description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nManaging a Managed Kubernetes Platform - Annegies van 't Zand & Wiender Sarup, Nationale Nederlanden \n\nOver the past year Nationale Nederlanden (NN) has built a managed Kubernetes platform for their DevOps teams.  Now, a year later, we are managing over twenty Kubernetes clusters that are running multiple production workloads. Although Kubernetes is the main component, it turned out that lifecycle management and reliable delivery of changes to in-use platforms proved to be the most challenging part. All-in-all there are fifteen components that provide all the platform features and services, so we had to get creative to make sure that we kept up to date with all of them.  In this talk we will share our solutions for setting up a platform delivery pipeline and the lifecycle management of our platform components. Fan-in/fan-out cluster deployments, platform integration tests, version dashboards and feature flagging are some of the subjects that we will address.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZepK"
