description: "Will it Run on *My* OpenStack? – Building an Executable Validation Testsuite for CPIs - Beyhan Veli, SAP SE & Cornelius Schumacher, SUSE Linux\n\nThere is not *one OpenStack*, there are plenty. Installations differ by version, by set of enabled projects, and by configuration. Validating that Bosh can be used on a specific installation is a tedious and error-prone manual task. The fact that the teams using Bosh are not the ones responsible for setting up and running OpenStack doesn’t help either. \nThe Bosh OpenStack CPI team is building an executable validation test suite that gives non Bosh-experts a tool to find out if an OpenStack installation is ready to run Bosh, or which changes need to be done. \n\nThe testsuite is based on the generic lifecycle contract between Bosh and the external CPI. It can also become useful for all authors of additional CPIs. They can plugin their CPI implementation and configuration to test against a different IaaS than OpenStack instead of writing their own lifecycle testsuite. \n\nIn this talk, we show how the testsuite can be used to validate an OpenStack installation and how authors of other CPIs could use the testsuite to avoid building their own generic lifecycle tests. Furthermore, we show how IaaS specific tests can be added to account for differences between the IaaS and CPI implementations.\n\nCornelius Schumacher\nSUSE Linux\nCornelius works as engineering manager in the cloud and systems management department at SUSE Linux, which is working on projects such as OpenStack, Docker, and a variety of systems management tools. Cornelius is driving SUSE's technical involvement with Cloud Foundry, in particular the work on the BOSH OpenStack Cloud Provider Interface. He is a long time contributor to many open source projects for more than a decade, such as KDE, openSUSE, the Open Build Service, or Machinery. Cornelius is a regular speaker at Linux and open source events, mostly in Europe, but also in the US or in Brazil.\n\nBeyhan Veli\nSoftware Engineer, SAP SE\nBeyhan works as software engineer at SAP SE. His current involvement is on the BOSH OpenStack Cloud Provider Interface project. He successfully used Eclipse technologies in many customer projects and has contributed to many Eclipse projects."
