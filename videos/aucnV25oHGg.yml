description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\nEmbracing DevOps entails more than just shipping changes to production faster and faster. Your team is suddenly also responsible for monitoring your software in production and detecting and troubleshooting issues. To work together with operation specialists in your team or maybe even embrace a #NoOps approach, you as the developer, need to learn about monitoring.\n\nWe will discuss logging frameworks and log analytics solutions. Next to that we will explore metrics: your software’s KPI’s. What metrics to choose and how to gather them. To let information come to us, we will use both logging and metrics to create dashboards and alerts that notify us when things go south. Or better yet: before things go south! Finally, we will combine all of this to see how we can quickly investigate and resolve production issues.\n\nJoin Henry Been for a demo heavy session, including like NLog, Application Insights, Seq and more to see how to implement all of the above from scratch. During this session, you will learn everything you need to know to start monitoring your solutions and never lose any sleep ever again!"
