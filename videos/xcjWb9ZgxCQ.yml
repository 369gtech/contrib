recordingDate: 1593171005
description: "An exploration of GoLang through the medium of a \"Game Assistant Tool\". We will explore:\n\n- Recursive algorithms\n- Passing functions as parameters\n- Interfaces\n- and much more\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/271008727/\n\n## About Dom\n\nHe needeth no introductions, but, does provide a wonderful array of bios and blurbs for an organiser to use https://github.com/domdavis/talks :heart: so we'd be amiss if we didn't use one:\n\nDom Davis is a veteran of The City and a casualty of The Financial Crisis. Not content with bringing the world to its knees he then went off to help break the internet before winding up in Norfolk where he messes about doing development and devops. Dom has been writing code since his childhood sometime in the last millennium â€“ he hopes some day to become good at it.\n\nDom is an enthusiastic and impassioned speaker [read: he gabbles] who uses a blend of irreverent sarcasm and flippant humour to bring complex subjects to a broad audience. Whether or not they understand him is up for debate, but he likes to believe they do.\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes. We aim to bring you local, national and international speakers and workshops.\n\nYou might want to try something new or wish to take your software development up to the next level. Norfolk Developers wants to jump depth-first into the detail and bring you practical value. We want to make it easy for you to access knowledge, progress and prosper in the highly specialised and valuable field of software engineering.\n\nFollow us https://twitter.com/NorfolkDev or join the community https://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/"
