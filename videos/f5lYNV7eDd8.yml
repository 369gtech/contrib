No agenda, no topic... just thoughts. This video is the first episode of this series, in which Chris DiBona, our intrepid open source programs manager talks to Stephanie Liu of the Developer Team about his \"sweet goatee\" in the Chrome Comic. He also explains why Google open sourced Chrome and Android  and why we didn't do it sooner.
