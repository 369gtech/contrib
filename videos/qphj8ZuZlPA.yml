description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nI will give a presentation on the Boost Units library. \n\nThis library implements a zero runtime facility for performing dimensional analysis checking and automatic units conversion on C++ expressions. I have found this indispensable for coding scientific programs involving a variety of complex physical units. The documentation of the Boost Units library is totally complete and accurate, but totally inpenetrable. I had to spend way too much time figuring out how to use this. By attending this meeting, you're going to avoid this pain and just get the benefit of simpler programs that contain fewer bugs.\n— \nRobert Ramey is a freelance Software Developer living in Santa Barbara, California. (See www.rrsd.com.)  His long and varied career spans various aspects of software development including business data processing, product, embedded systems, custom software, and C++ library development. Lately, he has been mostly interested in C++ library design and implementation related to Boost.  He is the author and maintainer of the Boost Serialization library and a frequent contributor to the Boost developers list.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
