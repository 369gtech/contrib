description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Containers are one of the major breakthrough in IT of the past few years, and promise to revolutionise the way software is developed and deployed. Thanks to the support in Visual Studio 2019, time has never been more favourable to adopt them in our technological stack.\n\nThis talk will showcase a possible approach to port an existing ASP.NET Core solution to Docker, demonstrating how seamlessly Visual Studio integrates them in the development experience, while still embracing the advantages of dependency management that containers make possible.\n\nAfter executing the solution locally on the development machine, we'll explore which options we have in order to deploy it on Azure Kubernetes Service. We'll show a possible example for a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps and demonstrate how we can integrate it with the PaaS offering in Azure, such as Cosmos DB and Redis Cache."
