description: "This is my personal story about building DevOps platforms with some of the largest companies in Europe. I'd like to share my 8 years of experience with building pipelines and platforms to improve software development lifecycle.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/35Xt2rp\n\nDevOps is a journey and I was fortunate to follow some of the largest European organizations on this journey. My session starts with looking at the beginning of the DevOps journey automation pipelines, then I explain our progress with the arrival of platforms and discuss where we're going next.\n\nI'll share my best practices for DevOps adoption in large organizations as well as many real-life examples. What are successful organizations doing and what should be avoided in terms of people/process/technology? Is there a standard pattern that can be followed?\n\nSpeaker: Jan Svoboda, Platform Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/my-personal-devops-journey-from-pipelines-to-platforms/Pivotal/my-personal-devops-journey-from-pipelines-to-platforms"
