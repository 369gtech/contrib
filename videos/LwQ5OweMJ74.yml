While these factors are important and can be quantified, there are other quantifiable measures that should be considered to seek the proper funding and approval for a cloud-native data management project. Learn the basic principles of writing a comprehensive business value analysis that will speak the language of both the finance organization and also allow your companies leadership to fully understand the big picture of improving application migration capabilities, test data related to your CI/CD pipeline, and getting a complete view of the costs of development across the application lifecycle. Learn to easily compare the costs of efforts associated with development time and infrastructure costs as well as the cost of maintaining cloud-native data management in a private or multi-cloud environment."
