title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays - Bootiful Spring Deployments with Mario Gray'
language: English

description: "Join Us in a cloud-native app building experience that Spring Boot provides out of the box! Why guess at the state of microservices in a Kubernetes-centric scenario when Spring can help us get that status out? We will code with Kotlin on the JVM and use Spring’s declarative access to the liveness/readiness state and its health monitoring subsystem. \n\nNext, we’ll see a recent Spring Boot feature that lets us declare container build and execution parameters using a build tool like Maven or Gradle. Finally, we step into configuration state transfer and service discovery so that application runtime behavior gets defined with Kubernetes idioms like ConfigMaps and Secret. This demo will look at how to tie these characteristics of Spring and Kubernetes together to produce a resilient cloud-native application.\n\n---\n\nMario is a principal technologist at VMware with more than 20 years of experience in software development and software architecture. He is co-author of Pro Spring Integration (Apress, 2011). He’s helped organizations large and small build service-based architectures in a number of different runtimes and platforms over the decades, but adopting Spring in 2004, and using it whenever possible since, was a no-brainer that culminated in joining the Spring team in 2017. As a Spring developer advocate, Mario loves to engage and inspire developers and businesses in the Pivotal ecosystem."
