The plot of a dataset is viewed as another statistic of the data, and as such, it can be \"re-calculated\" a few times on a permuted dataset, producing several plots. Recent advances in Deep Neural Networks have proved computers can extract all sorts of interesting information from images. Will a computer be able to \"see\" the correlation the same way a human can? Will it choose correctly the original plot in a lineup of permuted plots? In this talk we will show how well a computer can do Visual Inference in several tasks, after training a deep neural network on tens of thousands of sampled datasets. As often is the case it is interesting to focus on the cases where the computer got it wrong and wonder: was it really wrong? And if not - could your computer be a better Statistician than you?\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
