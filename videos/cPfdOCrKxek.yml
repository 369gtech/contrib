description: "This is a video of Ian Barber's talk at London Erlang Factory Lite http://www.erlang-factory.com/\n\nGoogle has been providing webservices and APIs for over a decade, and the latest generation of these services is engineered around discoverability, REST, and JSON. In this talk we'll look at the architectural decisions that have lead us to this point, and at how to consumer and work with these APIS from Erlang, working with OAuth2 and JSON.\n \nTalk objectives: The aim is to show consuming modern web APIs with Erlang, and to discuss the architectural principles and challenges that have lead us to the current design.\n\nTarget audience: People interested in interacting with Google's services, people developing large scale restful web services."
