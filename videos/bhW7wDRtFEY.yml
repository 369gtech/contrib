It’s now possible to build real time applications with much less effort in managing the idiosyncrasies of the async programming and a lot of batteries are included. Starting with a brief introduction to Channels (targeting version 2.0), we will see how to build a real time application, both on the Django and the frontend side and how easy it’s to start experimenting with it. The talk has a very hands-on approach, to allow the attendees to experiment with the proposed solution and approach, and starting immediately building their own real time applications with Django.\n\nIacopo Spalletti"
