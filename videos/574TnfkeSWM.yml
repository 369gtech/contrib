description: "Chances are sooner or later your shiny new single page application will need authentication. Add some security and resource access control to that list as well. But how can we integrate all of this into a single page application that is entirely public? How can we ensure that our users only have access to the resources they are authorized to by hacking way in via the console? In this talk, the attendees will learn about JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and see how they can be used to properly secure single page applications.\n\n# About the Presenter\n\nJoel Lord is passionate about web and technology in general. He likes to learn new things but most of all, he likes to share his discoveries. He does so by travelling at various conferences all across the globe.\n\nHe graduated from college in computer programming in the last millennium. Apart for a little break to get his BSc in computational astrophysics, he was always in the industry.\n\nAs a technical evangelist with Auth0, he meets with developers to help them make the web a safer place.\n\nDuring his free time, he is usually found stargazing in a camping site somewhere or brewing a fresh batch of beer in his garage."
