title: 'Getting started with Kubernetes Operators in Java by Charlotte Mach'
recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "If you've used Kubernetes to deploy your own custom application, you might have come across the annoying part of managing the state of that application. From versioning to backups, someone has to do it.\n\nNow, what if you could automate that management?\n\nWith Kubernetes Operators you can! They allow you to expand Kubernetes-native tools and concepts to your own application and permit you to build in your operational knowledge into your cluster.\n\nLet me introduce you to how Kubernetes Operators work, and how you can get started writing your own Operator in your favourite language (assuming your favourite language is Java).\n\nCharlotte Mach, Container Solutions\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
