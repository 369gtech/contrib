description: 'Like it or not, Machine Learning is here to stay and it is going to be one of the hottest topics in the apps development world going forward. Using Machine Learning, you could do things from detecting faces in your photos, to making predictions on what the user will do next. But how does Machine Learning actually work? And what are some of the concepts that you need to know as a developer? In this session, Wei-Meng Lee will talk you through the basics of Machine Learning - the concepts, the algorithms you need to be familar with, and the things you could do with it. This fast and furious session will also cover a number of tools to make Machine Learning easy - Azure Machine Learning Studio, Microsoft Cognitive Service, Jupyter Notebook, and more. You will also see how your mobile apps can be integrated with Machine Learning to make it more intelligent.'
