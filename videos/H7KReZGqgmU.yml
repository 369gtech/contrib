description: "Extending Cloud Foundry at Scale - Addressing the Non-12-factor App Gap with CFCR - Colby Johnston & Brett Mayer, Comcast\n\nFor many years Comcast has been successfully running and managing Cloud Foundry for stateless applications and micro-services at scale. Over time, we have had to address the requirements of our non-12-factor apps as well. We have chosen Container Runtime (CFCR) platform for these stateful applications by deploying multi-site / multi-cloud environments. As an extension of Cloud Foundry Application Runtime, it allows customers to do self service deployments and scaling of application stacks and make use of additional features such as service catalog/market place, eternal DNS and persistent storage. Join us to learn and provide feedback on how we have leveraged Bosh and Concourse to efficiently and predictably deploy and manage CFCR at scale.\n\nAbout Colby Johnston\nI've been working in IT since 1996 working in various systems engineering roles. The previous 3 years, I've been part of the Comcast Cloud Engineering team working on Cloud platforms including CF, AWS, SDS, Kubernetes, and now CFCR. My primary role has been cloud platform engineering, automation, deployment, and management. \n\nMy speaking experience has been with internal Comcast teams, organizations, and customers.\n\nAbout Brett Mayer\nSenior Cloud Engineer at Comcast responsible for engineering, deployment, management, of cloud platforms.Speaking experience has been with internal Comcast teams, organizations, and customers.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
