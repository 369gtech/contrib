description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nTowards Continuous Computer Vision Model Improvement with Kubeflow - Derek Hao Hu & Yanjia Li, Snap Inc. \n\nWith deep learning gaining popularity in industry, there is a lot of material focusing on model training and serving. However, in production machine learning typically isn't complete after a single round of training. Model owners need to find ways to improve trained models regularly, and good machine learning pipelines achieve this by leveraging continuous feedback.    In this talk, we will demonstrate how Kubeflow and Kubeflow Pipelines are being used to continuously improve computer vision models at Snapchat. We will walkthrough how we orchestrate multiple components with Kubeflow Pipelines to extract data, label images, and (re)train machine learning models. We will also discuss best practices for authoring Kubeflow Pipeline components based on our experiences from developing and deploying these components for production use. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uae4"
