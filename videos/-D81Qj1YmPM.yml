description: "Building a super-performant front-end is far harder and more intensive than making onLoad or onDomReady happen quicker — After you've removed \"blocking scripts\", what do you do?\n\nIn this talk I'll show you how to put best practice tools to work for you & your team.\n\nWe'll explore how to keep your pages scrolling buttery-smooth, the depths of undocumented Chrome devtool APIs, how to create your very own clean-room environment to test and measure while coordinating collection of performance metrics over many geographical borders — then how you can make it all happen within a continuous integration server.\n\nBEN SCHWARZ\n\nBen Schwarz is independent and works on the web.\n\nBen is interested in community (as creatives and builders for the web), building tools and the future of the web. He's been involved in running a series of events around Australia - training days, conferences and social events.\n\nhttp://germanforblack.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/benschwarz"
