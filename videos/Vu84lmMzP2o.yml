description: "the convex hull or convex envelope of a set X of points in the Euclidean plane or in a Euclidean space (or, more generally, in an affine space over the reals) is the smallest convex set that contains X. For instance, when X is a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around X.\n\nhttps://github.com/mission-peace/interview/blob/master/src/com/interview/geometry/JarvisMarchConvexHull.java\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/erect-the-fence/"
