description: "Whats new in Java today, and whats coming to Java tomorrow? Well start with a review some of the recent additions to the language and the platform. Well then look ahead and demonstrate some of the features currently in development in the Amber, Loom, Panama, and Valhalla projects. All of these features will continue to improve both developer productivity and program performance while retaining Javas core values of readability, generality, and compatibility.\n\nMark Reinhold\nOracle"
