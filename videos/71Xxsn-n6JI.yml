description: "Kylie Mathers\n\nA few years ago we found ourselves teaching students everything from Python to Arduino.  It was our plan to replace all the other languages with Python as we streamlined our course.   Learn why we introduced drones, what we learned not to do and what we were surprised about.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/flying-by-the-seat-of-our-pants--our-journey-of-teaching-python-using-drones\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nFri Aug  2 10:30:00 2019 at C3.4 & C3.5"
