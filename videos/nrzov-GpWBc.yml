title: 'YOW! Connected 2017 Svetlana Isakova - You Can Do Better With Kotlin'
recordingDate: 1510621202
description: "The Kotlin programming language is gaining popularity amongst the Java developer community. It’s a modern language that gives more power in everyday routines.\n\nKotlin code generally looks cleaner and nicer, and it’s much easier to work with when you have less verbosity or code duplication. But what’s even more important, is that Kotlin is 100% compatible with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling (it’s from JetBrains after all).\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss the concepts of the language that provide the desired expressiveness, as well as new important features introduced in the latest Kotlin release.\n\nSvetlana is a Developer Advocate at JetBrains. She’s been a core developer of the Kotlin language kotlinlang.org , the new standard for Android, since 2011. She is a co-author of Kotlin in Action. She is also a frequent Kotlin speaker and instructor. Svetlana enjoys new concepts and ideas, and when possible skiing in the Alps.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
