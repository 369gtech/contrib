description: "Everybody loves the Gruntfile, except for those who have seen the True Path and are now creating everything in Gulp, except for those of us that simply don’t understand the fuss because Make has “done all of that for years”.\n\nMake gets an awful rap for being obtuse and difficult to understand and this is often down to some common misunderstandings over what Make actually is. Most first attempts at using it (including my own) end up looking like badly written shell code.\n\nMake provides a wonderfully declarative DSL for building projects; complete with all of the pattern matching features one is still waiting in vane for in some supposedly modern languages. I am here to demystify some of this and you will hopefully leave this room thinking “Wow, I didn’t know Make could do that…”\n\nTranscript & slides: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/rob-ashton-got-make.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
