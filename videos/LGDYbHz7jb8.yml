title: 'JDK IO 2016 - Michael Nitschinger - State of the Art JVM Networking with Netty'
recordingDate: 1474443308
description: "Netty is a popular open source library which greatly simplifies the development and maintenance of networking applications. It abstracts the burden to deal with tedious and error-prone low level details in NIO and as a result allows you to concentrate on your business logic instead. It is used by high profile companies like Apple, Google, Netflix, Twitter or Facebook and designed from the ground up to handle high throughput at low latency, even with thousands of connections at the same time.\nThe first part of the talk introduces you to networking on the JVM and why a library like Netty is needed in the first place. You'll then learn how to adapt it to your requirements and get the biggest bang for the buck. If you have low latency, high throughput requirements or just want to get the last drop of performance out of your networking stack, this talk is for you."
