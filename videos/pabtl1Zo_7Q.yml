description: "Watch more from the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference: http://goo.gl/lXpXnG\n\nToday, APIs and APPs are everywhere. Every company is racing to become a software business and to ultimately disrupt or be disrupted. However, in a world of millions of apps and billions of users, it is important to think about the people behind these technologies and ask, where are the developers? With only around 15 million professional developers in the world, one of the most important considerations we need to keep in mind today is who will be writing the apps of the future. Salesforce has taken a different approach to platform with this in mind, and Adam can share some perspective from the declarative-first world.\n\nAdam’s talk will cover this and questions including:\n- What would it mean to have 100 million developers in the world?\n- What tools and languages will these developers of the future be using? What is the closest analog in the technology world today?\n- What frameworks and architectures of today will best aid the developers of tomorrow?\n- Where should we look with our architectures and tools to equip the hundred million?\n- Is code the right way to express an application?\n\nAbout Adam Seligman (Saleforce):\nAdam Seligman is the vice president for developer relations at Salesforce.

It's also a fast-moving discipline, where entire suites of best practices become obsolete overnight.\n\nThe O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference is a new event designed to provide the necessary professional training that software architects and aspiring software architects need to succeed. A unique event, it covers the full scope of a software architect's job, from IT to leadership and business skills. It also provides a forum for networking and hearing what other professionals have learned in real-world experiences.\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
