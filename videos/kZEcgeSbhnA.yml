description: "Don't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects - Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nCloud Native NFV Performance Benchmarks - Vipin Kumar Rathi & Parth Yadav, University of Delhi \n\nThis session will provide a brief overview of CNF orchestration, NSC (Network Service Chaining), multi-interface Pods, fast data paths, NUMA, deep dive in Benchmarking Cloud-Native NFV and ongoing Benchmarking standards and works. Unlike big, complex & heavy NFVI with fixed boundaries as specified by ETSI, the new Cloud-native NFVI is relatively simple with easy to orchestrate lightweight CNFs chained together and distributed over the cloud blurring boundaries between different components of NFVI and with the introduction of CNFs new Benchmarking considerations and methodologies have evolved like time to deploy, migrate, recover, activation delay, scaling up, the impact of chaining services, data-plane acceleration and possible deployment scenarios like Pod in VM or Bare metal . All this have resulted in a 4x3 benchmarking coverage. \n\nhttps://sched.co/YWJB"
