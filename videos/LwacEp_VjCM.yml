title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2020 - Martin Odersky - Implicits Revisited'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609290396
description: "Implicits Revisited\nI talk about the history of how Scala's implicits evolved, about some of the mistakes we could have avoided in hindsight, and about aspects that I believe we got right. I then present the new system of givens in Scala 3, which replaces implicits. This system fixes most of the existing issues, increases safety and predictability and offers some exciting new possibilities to structure and modularize code.\n\nMartin Odersky is a professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. He has been working on programming languages for most of his career. He first studied structured and object-oriented programming as a PhD student of Niklaus Wirth, then fell in love with functional programming while working as a post-doc at IBM and Yale. When Java came out, he started to add functional programming constructs to the new platform. This led to Pizza and GJ and eventually to Java 5 with generics. During that time he also developed javac, the current reference compiler for Java. Over the last 10 years, Martin worked on unifying object-oriented and functional programming in the Scala language. Scala quickly escaped from the research lab and became a popular open-source tool and industrial language. He now oversees the development of Scala as head of the programming group at EPFL and as chairman of the Typesafe company.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit, www.yowconference.com.au"
