description: "In our second episode of Breaking Open, Hans Dockter peels back the curtains on Gradle, the open source, general purpose, and platform agnostic build system he created to address the changing landscape and new demands of modern enterprise automation.\n\nFrustrated with other build systems, and fueled by the passion to make something better, Hans explores how he took Gradle from an idea to an open source project to building a business model and sustainable company around it, eventually founding Gradleware."
