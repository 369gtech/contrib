description: "Photorealism has been the holy grail of computer graphics for many years. With the introduction of WebGL and hardware accelerated API’s on the browser, Web designers and developers were given a powerful tool to enlarge their creative scope and communication options. In this talk Ivan will demo and explain the concepts behind his creations, the tools he uses; from basic 3D modeling and texturization tips, to how to assemble a complete application, wether a small game, a product configurator, a cinematic experience, an augmented reality ad, or a virtual reality tour, your imagination will be the limit.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
