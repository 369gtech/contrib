description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - Since the beginning of 2014 we have been working with Tesco groceries to build a brand new online platform using React. Earlier this year we launched a new mobile site for Tesco''s international grocery business, releasing for 7 countries and 7 different languages. Since then we have been hard at work on further products, constantly adapting and enhancing our approach along the way. Join me while I take a walk through our journey so far, discussing the technology and process decisions we made, and lessons learned along the way, and hopes for the future.'
