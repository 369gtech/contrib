title: 'Vibhu Jawa - Accelerating Text Processing with RAPIDS | PyData Global 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609866619
description: "Talk \nSee how you can speed up text processing on GPUs without ever leaving Python. In this session, we will explore the use of DataFrame APIs, up through higher level, special text manipulation functions, and on up into sklearn style Text Vectorizers and integration with SpaCy, HuggingFace, to get 100x+ faster NLP pipelines. We also cover scaling up these workflows to multiple nodes using Dask.\n\n\nSpeaker \nVibhu Jawa is a Software Engineer and Data Scientist on the RAPIDS team at NVIDIA, where his efforts are focused on building GPU-accelerated data science products. Previous to NVIDIA, Vibhu was doing his masterâ€™s in computer science at Johns Hopkins, where his research was focussed on NLP and building interpretable machine learning models for healthcare.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
