description: "\"Who's Afraid of Front-End Databases?\"\n\nIndexedDB is a full-blown database that is hosted inside your browser. In data driven scenarios it can help you to persist your data inside your front-end. IndexedDB can also help you to persist data in mobile web disconnected environments and later on the data will be available for synchronization to the server. In this session you will learn what is IndexedDB, how to use it and how to incorporate it in your AngularJS apps."
