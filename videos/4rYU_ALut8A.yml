description: "Switch on my features!\n\nWith new paradigms in software development and the embracing of Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment, the speed for the development of new features and the publishing of new software versions have considerably increased.\n\nThis talk will cover the approaches to test new features and software versions as often as we need, without impacting our users and allowing us to analyze the behavior to get the most out of our product. Which features are more likely to be successful? How do our users react to a new version? Which design is preferred?\n\nWe will also review different techniques for the deployment and distribution of functionalities and different ways of implementing them in a practical way."
