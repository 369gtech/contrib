title: 'The Curious Case of Freya, Suave and Giraffe: reducing risks in picking a new tech - Gien Vershatse'
recordingDate: 1533540916
description: "Picking a new technology is hard. Very often we avoid change at all cost, and go with the devil we know. Another extreme is to do some haphazard implementation and hope for the best.\nIn this talk, I will tell you the strategies I tried out to understand three web frameworks I didn't know beforehand, Freya, Suave and Giraffe, in order to find out if they were a good fit for my needs. Along the way, I will discuss some tricks that everybody could use to understand, beyond these specific libraries, what heuristics worked and which didn't in quickly evaluating libraries and understanding their risks."
