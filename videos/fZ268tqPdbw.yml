description: 'This is the story of my journey with JavaScript. It’s about the things that I wish I knew since the beginning, my “ah-ah that’s how it works!” moments that guided me to write code in a more expressive and declarative way. It''s a love letter for this powerful language, in the form of a talk that bounces between the technical and the personal perspectives. My hope is that everyone in the room, even experienced developers, will learn a bit more about writing more idiomatic and consistent JavaScript code, learning from the mistakes I made and that I still witness every time I see other developers.'
