title: 'Practical quickstart to non-blocking I/O with Ratpack'
recordingDate: 1586856996
description: 'In this session, I would like to introduce you to asynchronous and non-blocking HTTP requests processing with Ratpack. It won''t be an introductory tutorial or shallow walk through all possible features and nuances Ratpack framework provides. Instead, I''m going to build from scratch a REST application, compare blocking vs. non-blocking processing and show you where possible issues are hiding. No slides. Only live coding.'
