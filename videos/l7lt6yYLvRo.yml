description: "The Kubernetes hype train has reached full velocity and many organisations are now adopting the technology.\n\nThe Kubernetes ecosystem can be very operator focussed and it can be a challenge for developers to distil the information that is relevant for their job. There are a large number of available tools aimed at solving a broad set of problems but it can be daunting choosing which to invest in.\n\nThis deep dive sessions aims to provide developers with a thorough grounding on Kubernetes concepts, suggest best practices and get hands-on with some of the essential tooling.\n\nTopics will include\n\nLocal development workflow\nApproaches for building images from source\n\_Image Tagging Strategies\nUsing profiles\nDeployment\nRemote build services\nAutomated testing & Kubernetes\nDebugging apps on Kubernetes\nProvisioning a persistent data store with your application\nPackaging your service as a Cloud Native Application Bundle\nHealth monitoring and management of running services\nLog aggregation\nTLS Termination\n\_Integrating with Kubernetes security\nExternalised Configuration & Secrets\nService to Service communication & discovery\n\_Ingress Controllers\nObservability of applications\n\nAlberto Rios:\nSoftware Engineer interested in building products people love in agile environments with a focus on high-quality tests and clean code.\nAt the moment, I am part of the Spring Engineering team at Pivotal working from Seville, Spain on a fully remote team.\nWe are building Spring Cloud related products and frameworks to help people adopting a microservices architecture and improving the experience of Spring in Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. \nI like to focus on Reliability, Continuous Delivery, and Testing tasks and I mainly commit to Java Open Source projects. \n\nOliver Hughes:\nOllie is a software engineer at Pivotal working on the Spring team. He is passionate about testing, cloud automation and data engineering. In his spare time he loves windsurfing, cycling and having BBQs in the garden."
