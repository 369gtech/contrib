title: 'GopherCon 2020: L Körbes - The Quest for the Fastest Deployment Time'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608668776
description: "When a developer changes a line of code, how long does it take for that code to run in their development cluster? L Körbes, an expert in Kubernetes development tooling, has seen the answers to that question vary between 1 second and… infinity. So how do you get your team’s code to stay on the 1 second side? In this talk, L will explore every avenue to make our “from code change to process running” benchmark faster, and show you whether to…\n\n  •  …cache your deps with Docker layers or go mod,\n  •  remove debugging data to make Go binaries smaller,\n  •  pre-populate your container with the compiler cache, \n  •  keep a container running, sync code diffs to it, and recompile in place,\n  •  re-compile in place when you have a lot of memory and CPU,  \n  •  re-compile when a lack of memory and CPU make the Go compiler sad,\n  •  use trickery to make binaries even smaller,\n  •  or, one last trick… how each of these differ when using a local cluster versus a remote one.\n\nExpect an in-depth exploration with strategies and techniques you can put in practice to speed up your workflow for good!"
