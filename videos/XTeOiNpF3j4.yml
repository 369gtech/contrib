But little on HOW to determine how to invest the scarcest resources in the software economy: developer talent. How do choose between building new features or reducing technical debt? How much to focus on web versus mobile? Which code to improve to best grow revenue? If you’re going to compete as a software company, you gotta listen to your apps. We tell you how.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by New Relic.\n\nAbout Patrick Lightbody (New Relic):\nPatrick is an entrepreneur at heart; prior to joining New Relic, he started two companies in the SaaS monitoring/APM space.
