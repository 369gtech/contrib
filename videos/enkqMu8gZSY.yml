description: "Alex Bolboaca is a polyglot programmer, trainer and coach at Mozaic Works. He has worked for almost 15 years in software development, for various industries and in various european countries and UK, co-facilitated the first code retreat outside US in Bucharest in 2009. Since then, he has facilitated tens of events such as coding dojos, architectural katas, code retreats and others in many countries from Europe.\n\nThe talk: Motto -- “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works” Steve Jobs.\n\nThere is a user for your software design. That user is the developer.\nAdding usability techniques in the way we do software design can help us achieve similar benefits as for our users: faster implementation of typical tasks and easier inclusion of new developers in the team.\n\nWhenever we talk about design in other domains than software, we discuss it from a user-centric point of view. Apple’s products are renowned because they focus on the experience of a user with their device: how it feels, how it looks, how fast it responds, the sounds it makes etc.\n\nSoftware design is the only type of design that seems to be userless. After all, the end-user has no idea how the software works and doesn’t care. All they do care about is to work fine. It turns out that software design is not userless. The user is the developer that will have to change the code after you do. So how about user-centric software design?\n\nIn this session he shows how to apply techniques from UX to software design in order to achieve: faster implementation of typical tasks and easier inclusion of new developers in the team.\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
