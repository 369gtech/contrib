language: English
recordingDate: 1602879907
description: 'Enterprise customers need the ability to move, mask, filter and validate data i.e. Logs, Metrics, Stream messages, etc. in near real time from many Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services to destination sinks like Object Storage, Streaming, Monitoring for additional processing or compliance storage needs. In addition, Developers need the ability to build event driven applications which react to these events or messages, process the data to take actions in near real time via target services like Functions (for custom processing) and Notifications. In this webinar, we will demonstrate how the Service Connector Hub addresses the above needs, specifically in the context of Observability by moving logs from the Logging Service to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services such as Object Storage, Streaming, Monitoring, Functions and Notifications for the purposes of archival, integration with 3rd party tools for running analytics, alarming in near real-time, lightweight data transformations and notifications.'
