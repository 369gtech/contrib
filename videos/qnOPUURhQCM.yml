description: 'This presentation will quickly go over the 3 main smartwatch platforms on the market, namely Pebble, Android Wear and Apple Watch. We will explain the characteristics of each platform, the usage scenarios it supports, the architecture of an app, show the language and the tools that are available to develop apps, describe the development lifecycle and illustrate with code samples (no live-coding). We will demonstrate all that based on a common app developed for the three platforms.'
