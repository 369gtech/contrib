title: 'ElixirConf 2021 - Chris Ertel - The Hitchhiker''s Guide to Elixir Performance'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635109202
description: "Elixir is a great language but many developers lack an intuition for the performance characteristics of their code.\n\nUsing Elixir and BEAM source code and bytecode, this talk will explore the basic performance characteristics/timings of various Elixir operations/data structures, and talk about profiling code. Along the way weâ€™ll dig into various ways of writing faster code to solve problems."
