description: "Mike Tamir, Head of Data Science at Uber ATG, UC Berkeley Data Science faculty, and head of Phronesis ML Labs\nAbstract: In this talk we explore real world use case applications for automated “Fake News” evaluation using contemporary deep learning article vectorization and tagging. We begin with the use case and an evaluation of the appropriate context applications for various deep learning applications in fake news evaluation. Technical material will review several methodologies for article vectorization with classification pipelines, ranging from traditional to advanced deep architecture techniques. We close with a discussion on troubleshooting and performance optimization when consolidating and evaluating these various techniques on active data sets.\n\nSee Mike's presentation slides on our slideshare page here: https://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/how-to-use-deep-learning-to-solve-the-fake-news-problem?qid=50ac10f7-edea-4e5d-b88b-20752e297119&v=&b=&from_search=2"
