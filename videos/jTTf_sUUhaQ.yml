description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nAny C++ developer working in a large codebase is very likely to experience weird bugs. In this talk, I'll be sharing with you post-mortem of a set of weird bugs that occurred in deceptively simple code but were difficult to debug.\nMany of these bugs occurred at unfortunate moments - for instance, just before the day of the release or at the customer site. Almost all of them took nontrivial amount of time to debug them. But surprisingly it took only a few lines of code to fix them. The cause of these bugs range from static buffer overflow and stack corruption to undefined behaviours and many other exciting ways to break a C++ program. In this talk I’ll present the code snippets in which the bugs occurred, show you the fixes and share with you the pitfalls to avoid these bugs.\n— \nSatabdi Das\nMentor, A Siemens Business\nSenior Software Engineer\nBoston, MA\n\nSatabdi has been programming in C++ for more than 10 years. She works on a market leading emulator platform widely used by the chip design companies. She has previously worked on parsers and static analyzers. She is a big proponent of using modern C++ and likes to organize lunch and learn sessions at her workplace. She is also one of the co-founders of Boston Hack && Tell, a fun meetup for programmers to showcase their work. Long back she contributed to Gnome as an Outreachy intern. And not so long back she spent three months at Recurse Center learning assembly, debugger internals and distributed systems.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
