Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nCloud Native Architecture: Monoliths or Microservices? - Goutham Veeramachaneni & Edward Welch, Grafana Labs \n\nMicroservices are the rage right now and for very good reasons. But microservices are not without drawbacks, requiring a complicated configuration and deployment, increasing the barrier to entry for both developers and users alike. This poor user experience can slow the rate of adoption for a project and hinder developers.    There is a solution to this problem seeing a lot of success. A single binary app which can act as a monolith but can also be scaled as microservices. Thanos being a great example, where the kickstart is super simple yet can be scaled out as required. The Loki project was patterned after a similar model and weâ€™ve since re-architected Cortex as well. In the talk we will explore how an application can be architected to be both a monolith and microservices, improving both adoption and ease of use while still allowing to scale as a cloud native microservices application.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaX6"
