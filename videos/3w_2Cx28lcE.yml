description: "Speaker: Grzegorz Witek, Lead Software Engineer, Kaligo\n\nWhile premature optimization might be the root of all evil, at some point, whether you want it or not, you must look at your beautiful (and of course fully tested) code, and make it a bit less pretty, but much, much faster. API performance optimization does not need to be scary, though. To start you just need some benchmarking tools and a few optimization techniques. In my talk I'm going to present example problems and solutions that will make speeding up API much easier.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\nI boost economy by making bugs here and there, so that others always have something to fix and they can keep their jobs. Constantly afraid of stack overflows, I work as an empty-stack developer.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/ONq0/"
