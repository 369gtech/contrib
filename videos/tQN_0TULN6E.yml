title: 'Mastering the Three S’s for a Successful Pipeline-as-a-Service Strategy'
recordingDate: 1512078658
description: "Mastering the Three S’s for a Successful Pipeline-as-a-Service Strategy\n\nMarc Priolo, Global Software Configuration Manager, Urban Science\n\nUrban Science is essentially a global big data company specializing in performance optimization for the automotive, health and retail industries. We've been on a CD journey for the past 4 years – resulting in exponential improvements to our software delivery: +8,500% increase in release cadence and number of deployments, and more than 50,000 manual work hours avoided- with engineers, developers and account teams put to better use.\n\nWe went through a strategic initiative to implement DevOps and CD as a cross-organizational, centralized Platform - providing teams with a self-service Pipeline Catalog. This allowed them to easily choose the appropriate, vetted, automation for their needs and automatically trigger the pipeline and deploy their app with a click of a button.\nI’ll share my learnings from overcoming the most common challenges to a “platform” approach to DevOps implementation. We’ll review patterns for successfully implementing and rolling out this strategy, addressing the three S’s required for success: Standardization, Self-service, and scale. We’ll also discuss tips for how to strike a balance between the need to enable and empower developers (and being flexible to support “snowflakes” configurations), and the need for standardization and providing on-demand, reusable pipelines - in order to scale DevOps so that the entire organization reaps the benefits.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
