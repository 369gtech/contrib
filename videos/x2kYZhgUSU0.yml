title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Advanced Configuration Management in Drupal 8'
recordingDate: 1523468921
description: "In Drupal 8, Configuration Management is part of Core rather than relying on the Features module. However, in practice there are still many challenges remaining:\n\nHow to manage environment-specific or multi-site configuration (Config Split)\nHow to install sites using pre-defined configuration (Config Installer, Core patches)\nHow to create reusable configuration \"templates\" (Config Actions)\nHow to override configuration (Config Override vs Config Actions vs settings.php)\nHow to switch from a \"Features-based\" workflow to a more standard D8 config workflow.\nThis session will go through all of the above topics and discuss the various modules that are useful for managing configuration and give examples of real-life use-cases where these modules are needed.\n\nSome basic knowledge of the Configuration Management system in Drupal 8 will be useful, but a brief overview will be provided at the beginning of the session."
