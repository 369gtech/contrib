description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nOne way of modeling a procedure mathematically is to treat it as a statement about the ways in which events can be arranged by a computer. This conception brings programming into the domain of mathematical logic, the study of truth and proof in formal languages.\n\nIn this lecture, I will explain how to read a procedure and its interface as a sentence, how that sentence may be true or false, possible or impossible, necessary or provable.\n\nThis material is the mathematical background for my other lectures on assertions and function interfaces, including \"What is the Basic Interface?\" which was presented at CppCon 2016.\n— \nLisa Lippincott\nTanium\nSoftware Architect\nLisa Lippincott designed the software architectures of Tanium and BigFix, two systems for managing large fleets of computers. She's also a language nerd, and has contributed to arcane parts of the C++ standard. In her spare time, she studies mathematical logic, and wants to make computer-checked proofs of correctness a routine part of programming.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
