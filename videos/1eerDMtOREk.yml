title: 'Vue Instance & Communication with the Outside World with Houmann Saffarzedeh'
language: English
recordingDate: 1545409800
description: 'At BlastMotion, the company Houmaan works for, they wanted to migrate to Vue, so they started using it in small pieces of their front-end. Unfortunately, that meant there were places where Vue.js had to talk to the outside world (their JQuery code). In this talk, Houmaan shows how to communicate events between Vue.js code and outside JavaScript.'
