description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Raul Hernandez Lopez, Twitter.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=166909\n\nReactive Extensions are widely used on large scale successful Android applications, and for this, the most popular library is an adaptation of these Reactive Extensions, the very well known RxJava. What if we could use the existing Kotlin suspending functions asynchronously to return more than a single value?\r\nHow could we return multiple asynchronously backed results in Kotlin?\r\nKotlin Flows to the rescue!\r\nWould Kotlin Flows replace RxJava in the long term on the Android platform? How could we start migrating smoothly to Flow on hybrid (Java & Kotlin) languages apps?"
