We'll also discuss our endless striving for \"0 manual QA\", which always seems in reach, if we only overcome that one last technical hurdle.\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nSauce Labs → https://saucelabs.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nNeuralegion → https://www.neuralegion.com/\n\nSilver Sponsor\nTestim → https://www.testim.io/\n\nProduction Partner\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/"
