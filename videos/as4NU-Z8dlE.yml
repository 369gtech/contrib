description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nStrategies for Multi-Cluster Routing - Leigh Capili, Weaveworks \n\nEveryday, we're dealing with more and more clusters. With that comes fun networking problems! Are you bridging the gap between Kubernetes in the cloud and your own on-premise data-centers? Perhaps you need to access a service managed by another team in an entirely different cloud! Kubernetes has great in-cluster routing, service-discovery, and policy enforcement. This lets us deploy workloads very fast, but how do we keep up with these changes across clusters? If you're struggling to integrate kubernetes into your network and preserve the benefits, this talk is for you. We'll cover: - Public & Private Load-Balancers - ACME, mTLS, & Wildcard Ingress - Route Sharing via BGP / OSPF - Using other cluster's DNS servers - Multi-Cluster Canaries - Bootstrap & Repeatable Config You'll leave knowing more on these strategies' trade-offs and how to apply them to your own cluster networks. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekCT"
