description: "Deep Dive: Envoy - Lizan Zhou, Tetrate \n\nEnvoy is a high-performance proxy in the cloud-native landscape designed to be extensible at its core. There are several possible “extension points” in Envoy as outlined in https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/tree/master/source/extensions. However, the currently available approaches to extend it is rather limited. Since Envoy is written in C++, the primary way to introduce new extended functionality in Envoy is by writing an extension (e.g. filters, either network or HTTP filter, as one of the most relevant use-cases in Envoy), in C++. It is possible to write an extension for Envoy using Lua (https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http_filters/lua_filter.html), but the current scope of this extension is only for HTTP traffic. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPjQ"
