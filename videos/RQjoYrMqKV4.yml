description: "What if a crisp white envelope dropped into you letter box today? What if it contained a neat, gold-blocked invitation to spends some time considering what really matters to you?\n\nWould you be interested? Would you be interested enough to commit the time and effort implicit in accepting the invitation?\n\nIn this keynote, Bob Marshall extends an invitation to explore how you feel about work, the extent to which your personal needs -- and the needs of others -- are presently being met by work, and the part Agile can play in attending better to those needs.\n\nAbout Bob\n\nBob Marshall has dedicated his career to helping businesses dramatically improve the effectiveness of their software development and design engineering efforts. In the course of this career he has worked at the cutting edge of software and business systems development for the best part of thirty years. Throughout, he has consistently inspired people to improve their own capabilities -- along with those of their teams and organisations. He spent three years as CEO of the UK's first 100% agile software-intensive product-development and consultancy start-up, serving major clients in Telecoms, Finance, Media, eBusiness, etc., and has for the past nine years headed a Software Development Management Consultancy advising organisations how best to manage software-intensive product development in all its aspects.\n\nAbout Agile Adria conference\n(agileadria.com)\n\nThis video is recorded at Agile Adria conference.
