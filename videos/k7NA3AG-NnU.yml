title: 'Extreme Programming practices for your team'
language: English
recordingDate: 1431260201
description: 'Extreme Programming had some momentum as a practiced agile method in the beginning of last decade. But then SCRUM took over the lead and soft, PM-oriented practices started dominating the agile software development movement and thinking. Focusing purely on the PM side without strong  technical background and practices has made a good few teams fail their projects and get back to the old-school waterfallish methods. In the presentation I’ll be talking about implementing technical practices of XP in your teams and projects. How to start using them, what to watch out for and how to make them stick. I’ll be talking about implementing TDD, Pair-Programming, Collective Code Ownership and Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery – which should constitute a tooling of any contemporary agile team.'
