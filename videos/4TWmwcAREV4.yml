title: 'Coding Literacy'
recordingDate: 1508807294
description: "You may have heard the pitch that “everyone should learn to code”—possibly from former President Barack Obama or Michael Bloomberg or Ivanka Trump. Interestingly, this argument for computer programming to be available to “everyone” have been around since at least the 1950s. What are the justifications for these arguments, how have they changed over time, and what does it mean for people who are already skilled programmers? Annette will point to some of these arguments and justifications for “coding literacy,” tell a bit about the history of programming and programmers, and show how it all potentially connects to the history and future of literacy.\n\nAnnette Vee to present. Annette recently published her book \"Coding Literacy\" (http://amzn.to/2greX0f).\n\nAnnette is an Assistant Professor in the Department of English at the University of Pittsburgh. She teaches graduate and undergraduate courses in literacy, composition, and technology.\n\nYou can read more about Annette and her research at www.annettevee.com (http://www.annettevee.com/)."
