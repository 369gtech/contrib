Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nBuilding Blocks: How Raw Block PVs Changed the Way We Look at Storage - Jose A. Rivera & Rohan Gupta, Red Hat \n\nRaw block PersistentVolumes (PVs) allow applications to consume storage in a new way. In particular, Rook-Ceph now makes use of them to provide the backing store for its clustered storage in a more Kubernetes-like fashion and with improved security. Now we can rethink the notion of how we structure our storage clusters, moving the focus away from static nodes and basing them on more dynamic, resilient devices.    This talk will go over how we incorporated raw block PVs, how the operator manages them, and how we can now define storage cluster. It will also include a demo of the resiliency of these new types of devices. By the end of the talk, you'll not only know how to use raw block PVs but also why and when to use them. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaWo"
