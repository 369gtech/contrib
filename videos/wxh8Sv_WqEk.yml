Many customers choose to use cluster migration (that is, create a new high-version cluster, and then migrate the applications from the low-version cluster to the high-version cluster) instead of upgrading the cluster. However, how to migrate cluster with zero downtime has become a major challenge. This proposal propose a way to solve the problem."
