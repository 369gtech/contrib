description: "Designing for the casual gaming market\n\nWith the rise of mobile gaming we are seeing a shift from Triple-A companies back to small groups or single developers making games. Designing for the casual market is harder than you may think. In this webcast talk by Jesse Freeman, author of Building HTML5 Games with ImpactJS, he will go over how he has been redesigning his own game ideas for the new casual gamer market. Jesse will go through some of the most popular casual games on Windows 8 which are helping redefine the meaning of PC gaming including my own games. Plus, Jesse will go over tips for how to simplify your own games for kids without dumbing them down for the average user. Finally, we will leave plenty of time to cover questions and answers about designing for casual gaming as well as what it takes to make a successful game for Windows 8 or any platform. \n\nAbout: Jesse Freeman\n\nJesse is a Technical Architect/Technology Evangelist at Roundarch Isobar and is a seasoned speaker who has presented at over 15 conferences as well as being an active leader in New York's developer community.
