description: "\"Speakers: Mariatta, Andrew Svetlov\n\nAsyncio is a relatively new feature in Python, with the `async` and `await` syntaxes only recently became proper keywords in Python 3.7. Asyncio allows you to write asynchronous programs in Python. In this tutorial, we’ll introduce you to an asyncio web library called `aiohttp`. \n\n`aiohttp` is a library for building web client and server using Python and asyncio. We’ll introduce you to several key features of `aiohttp`; including routing, session handling, templating, using middlewares, connecting to database, and making HTTP GET/POST requests. We’ll provide best practises in building your `aiohttp` application, as well as how to write tests for your application.\n\nWe’ll use all new Python 3.7 features to build web services with asyncio and aiohttp. \n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
