description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotswift.io on January 28th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nSwift Attributes - you use them in your day-to-day coding.  The @decorations that @you put on your @code to more clearly express your intent for the code. Mark tours a number of attributes, and ends up by showing you how to search the compiler source code to find all of the attributes, providing a gateway to your own personal exploration of the compiler and the language."
