description: "The new forum is here! If you have purchased a course through IAmTimCorey.com, you will soon have access to a dedicated forum for each of your courses. The invites to the forum will be going out this week. Make sure to check your inbox.\n\nFAQs:\nWhen do I get my invite? Soon. They should all be out by Friday, February 5, 2021\n\nWhat if I purchase a course after that date? You should receive an invite within an hour of purchasing a course.\n\nDo All Access Pass members get a forum invite? Not at this time. It is difficult to give access to a forum when you may lose access to the content. We are starting with course purchases, which include lifetime access to the course. We are still investigating how to handle All Access Pass memberships.\n\nWhat if I don't get an invite? First, check your spam filter. Then, if it is after February 5, 2021, email help@iamtimcorey.com to get help.\n\nIf I post a question on the forum, will Tim answer? Not necessarily, no. With the thousands of active students, Tim does not have time to answer every question. That would make courses much more expensive. However, he may pop into the forum once in a while to leave a comment or two.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
