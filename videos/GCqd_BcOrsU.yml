description: "Not so Neo In the Matrix by Micah Adams\n\nMatrices are powerful data structures that are used for all sorts of interesting problems- from 3d graphics, to image processing, and cryptography. However, the mighty matrix can be used to solve more mundane problems as well. This talk attempts to demystify the matrix and offer real life examples for using this powerful but understandable data structure."
