description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nIn the past year, Mozilla changed everything behind the scenes of our Android-based Firefox browsers. We launched a new project to package everything it takes to build a great browser, called our Android Components. Then we immediately got to work building awesome browsers with it.\n\nCome learn how to build your own unique browser in Kotlin using our components written in Kotlin. We'll also discuss which syntactic sugar made our work oh so much sweeter.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenters:\nColin is an experienced software engineer specializing in Android development.
