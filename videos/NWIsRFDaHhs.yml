description: 'Reflection in C++ has always been and remains a hot topic for the whole time C++ has been around, but unfortunately there is no a standard solution to retrieve and manipulate compile-time information. There have been several approaches implemented to tackle the lack of reflection, be it macros, pragmas or independent preprocessors. At the talk we will cover 2 similar proposals on reflection in C++, will look at some examples and live code a bit.'
