Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nSpanning the Globe with Envoy at Stripe - Dylan Carney, Stripe \n\nStripe operates compute infrastructure around the globe in order to provide low latency and high availability to its users, using Envoy to connect this infrastructure together.\n\nTo ensure reliability and operability, Stripe built an Envoy control plane, along with new tooling to manage it. New XDS services provide features like ramp-up of traffic to specific compute clusters, tiered failover, and per-customer routing of API requests. Stripe also built their blue/green deployments on top of this. Finally, they made improvements to make Envoy significantly more reliable in the face of issues like packet loss and head-of-line blocking, based on traffic patterns and behavior observed in production.\n\nAttendees will learn details about these projects and get to hear war stories, cautionary tales, and valuable lessons learned during the process of building out a globe-spanning Envoy topology."
