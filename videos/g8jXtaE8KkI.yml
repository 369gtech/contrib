description: "DLSpec: A Deep Learning Task Exchange Specification\n\nAbdul Dakkak and Cheng Li, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Jinjun Xiong, IBM; Wen-mei Hwu, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nDeep Learning (DL) innovations are being introduced at a rapid pace. However, the current lack of standard specification of DL tasks makes sharing, running, reproducing, and comparing these innovations difficult. To address this problem, we propose DLSpec, a model-, dataset-, software-, and hardware-agnostic DL specification that captures the different aspects of DL tasks. DLSpec has been tested by specifying and running hundreds of DL tasks.\n\nView the full OpML '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/opml20/program"
