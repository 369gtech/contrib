She introduces the type system, how it is used to allow actors to send mutable state while also avoiding data races, and how the type system is used so as to allow the actors to perform garbage collection fully concurrently with one another and with normal execution.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon London 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq\n\n#FunctionalProgramming #Pony"
