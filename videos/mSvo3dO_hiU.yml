description: "Topic: Lessons learned as software engineer working at appear.in\nThis talk is based on a blog post on my Medium account (more) where I share a bit of what happened and what I’ve learned since I started working at the appear.in team. Basically, I’ll walk through topics such as automation, code review, experimentation, refactoring and much more, and the way we use such practices to build a service that our users love to use.\n\nAbout Walmyr: Hi, I’m Walmyr. I’m a software engineer at appear.in, a company based in Oslo, Norway. I am fan of technology, programming, and software development. I’m also interested in skateboarding and writing.\n\nMore: https://about.me/walmyr-filho"
