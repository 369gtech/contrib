description: "Software Configuration Management at National Cancer Institute\n\nSarah Elkins, SRA International\n\nConfiguration management at National Cancer Institute involves support for over 600 Web sites ranging from flat HTML to complex bioinformatics applications on a variety of container technologies. This 45-minute presentation will cover the SCM processes and technologies which enable software to move from source code repositories all the way to production servers at NCI. SCM activities have expanded within the last few years to include Git mirror as well as local Subversion repository hosting, Maven as well as Ant build support, build dependency artifacts management, and build and deploy automation setups for Windows as well as Linux. Details will address the promotion of sites/applications up the tiers to production, the services and tools we administer, and tool integration capabilities.\n\nView the full UCMS '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/ucms14/summit-program"
