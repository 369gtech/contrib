description: 'Come and join us on this session when we''ll show you how to leverage your new Spring Boot application (or even your Java EE one) with the Kubernetes Platform. We''ll convince you that you don''t need to manage many different services by yourself to have a true Cloud Native application. You can rely on Kubernetes services to solve most of the problems. For the rest of them you can use alternatives like sidecar containers to offer added-value functionality without having to add even a single @Annotation!'
