Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nPanel: Is Service Mesh Ready for Edge-Native Applications? - Wendy Cartee, Ramki Krishnan, VMware; Srini Addepalli, Intel; Parveen Patel, Google; & Ravi Chunduru, Verizon \n\nEdge deployments, in contrast to large public clouds, pose interesting demands since they are physically insecure & capacity constrained. Also, Edge Computing Apps such as AR-VR, have low-latency characteristics with RTT typically few msec and pose further demands to edge deployments.  Edge Computing Apps like to use Service Meshes (SM) such as Istio/Envoy, Linkerd etc. to offload infrastructure related activities such as security.  In this panel, we first examine the unique challenges in using SM technologies for Edge Computing Apps - especially the additional latency and resource usage to due to Kernel Networking. Next, we will explore software techniques such as Kernel Bypass, QUIC as an alternative to TCP/IP etc. to alleviate the performance bottlenecks introduced by SM technologies including early results. Last, we will touch upon hardware acceleration techniques for the above. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaZu"
