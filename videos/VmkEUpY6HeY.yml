description: "Software developers are the foundation of any application. In order to achieve secure software, developers must be supported and helped by the organization they author code for.\n\nAs software developers author code that makes up a web application, they need to embrace and practice a wide variety of secure coding techniques. The OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls (2018) is an OWASP documentation project that lists critical security techniques that should be included in every software development project. This document was written by developers for developers to assist those new to secure development.\n\n1) Define Security Requirements\n2) Leverage Security Frameworks and Libraries\n3) Secure Database Access\n4) Encode and Escape Data\n5) Validate All Inputs\n6) Implement Digital Identity\n7) Enforce Access Controls\n8) Protect Data Everywhere\n10) Handle All Errors and Exceptions\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
