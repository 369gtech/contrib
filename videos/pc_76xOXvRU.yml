title: 'Cloud Day Online - Cloud Native Served Two Ways'

description: "Cloud native development encompasses a constantly evolving set of practices and emerging technologies. Container workflows have become standard, leveraging Kubernetes to abstract infrastructure resources and deploy and scale complex systems with ease. The advent of serverless provides even-more-powerful abstractions and promises potentially greater efficiencies for native cloud development. This session demonstrates these two paths to cloud native, first with a web application leveraging microservices running on Kubernetes and then the same application implemented with serverless functions. The presentation discusses the pros and cons of each architecture and why you might choose one over the other.\n\nKarthik Gaekwad\nCloud Native Developer Advocate"
