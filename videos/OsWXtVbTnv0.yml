description: "This talk is aimed at people who are curious about using Kubernetes and want an overview of how it works. Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration system, developed by Google. It deploys, scales and manages containerized applications. We’ll talk about the fundamental building blocks of a Kubernetes cluster, the architecture of the system, and the problems that it can solve. Then we’ll deploy and scale a Spring Boot application using Kubernetes.\n\nMeaghan Kjelland, Software Engineer, Google\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
