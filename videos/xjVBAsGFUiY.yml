description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeaker:  Emanuel Rabina\nWith the disconnect between the languages of the web (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and the languages of the server (Java, Groovy, Scala, etc), many libraries and frameworks have been invented over the years to fill this void, often resulting in views filled with back-end code, views filled with specialized syntaxes, or even the invention of completely new view languages abstractions; all for the purpose of transforming our server-side ideas into HTML, and few of which actually look like the HTML that it ends up as.\n\nEnter Thymeleaf - a templating framework that uses HTML to create good old HTML.\n\nIn this presentation, you'll be introduced to Thymeleaf, some of its features, how you can use it in your Spring web projects, the growing ecosystem being developed around it, and how it uses natural templates to keep the web designer on your team, and inside each and every one of us, happy."
