description: "From Velocity Santa Clara 2015: \"Beyond the Hype Cycle; Bleeding Edge for the Enterprise\".\n\nAccording to many analysts, the Internet of Things promises to add more than $7 trillion to an already inflated global technology spend, and a large part of that belongs to a segment that isnâ€™t prepared for the changes that are coming; one that is so integrated with every part of our lives that its success is critical to us all.\n\nThe enterprise is the slowest moving, and most complex, customer base in the world, where every innovation that has seen the light of day in the last 30+ years is still in production. The processes and technologies are ancient and sometimes unrecognizable to the outside observer, but the enterprise is ready for a massive shift unlike anything since the big boom of Y2K.
