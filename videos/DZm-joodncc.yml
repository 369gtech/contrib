description: "What’s so fantastic about the open source, DIY, and the biohacking scene? \n\nIt’s the fact that financial considerations take a back seat to the driving forces of pure curiosity and knowledge sharing. \n\nThose are the motivating factors for Patric Lanhed and his team. And it’s also why they garnered a lot of media attention with their Bio Pay solution last autumn. Patric works\nwith technology in the communications arena at DigitasLBi in Sweden, and is a true evangelist when it comes to biohacking and how technology can play a major role in the human upgrade.\n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
