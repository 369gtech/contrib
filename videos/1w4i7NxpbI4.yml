title: 'Fault Tolerance Made Easy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433515010
description: "For high availability and for scale-out systems to operate reliably and robustly, we need fault-tolerant application design, because infrastructure-based fault tolerance is either not available or not sufficient. Thus, we must implement it on the application level. But fault tolerance is known as an extremely complicated and challenging domain. So, time to panic? No, not really. OK, fault tolerance is not a trivial domain, but there are a lot of high-value patterns that can be implemented surprisingly easily. This session uses real-life code examples to show some of these patterns, how they work, and how to implement them. Just a small step for a developer but a giant leap for operations!\n\n\nAuthor:\nUwe Friedrichsen\nUwe Friedrichsen travels the IT world for many years.
