In order to create technologies that serve the society as a whole, we need more diversity, and beyond including women in technology. In this session you will learn how to make conferences more inclusive and diverse - for women, minorities, LGBTQ and non binary individuals. Learn simple ways to support and include a more diverse community in the office, at conferences, and online.\n\nHeather VanCura \nFrom Oracle\nHeather leads the Java Community standardization efforts at Oracle, and is a leader of the global community driven adoption user group programs. She is Chairperson of the Java Community Process (JCP) program. In this role she drives the efforts to transform the JCP program and broaden participation and diversity in the community. She is passionate about Java, women in technology and developer communities, serving as an International speaker and community organizer of developer hack days around the world.
