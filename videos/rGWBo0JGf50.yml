description: "Evolutionary/genetic algorithms are somewhat of a mystery to many in the machine learning discipline. You don't see papers regularly published using them but they are a really fascinating subfield and in this video, we're going to use a genetic algorithm to improve invaders in a space invaders game!\n\nCode for this video: \nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Evolutionary_Space_Invaders\n\nPlease Subscribe!
