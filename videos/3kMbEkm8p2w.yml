description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/containers-will-not-fix-your-broken-culture-and-other-hard-truths\n\nBridget Kromhout, Principal Technologist at Pivotal,  says how things like containers are good tools, but they will not fix communication or team problems. A huge takeaway from this talk was the importance of decomposing the culture behind the monolith, not just the technical architecture itself.\n\nKeynote recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\n\nSpeaker: Bridget Kromhout, Principal Technologist, Pivotal\n\nBridget Kromhout is a Principal Technologist for Cloud Foundry at Pivotal. Her CS degree emphasis was in theory, but she now deals with the concrete (if ‘cloud’ can be considered tangible). After years as an operations engineer (most recently at DramaFever), she traded in oncall for more travel. A frequent speaker at tech conferences, she helps organize tech meetups at home in Minneapolis, serves on the program committee for Velocity, and acts as a global core organizer for devopsdays."
