description: "JSF 2.2, which marks the latest evolution of this popular framework, ships with Java EE 7. This release includes a few major new features, plus several other enhancements and bug fixes. Itâ€™s easier than ever, with HTML5-friendly markup. Faces flows enable you to package up navigation, pages, and code into easy-to-manage modules. Enhanced cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection makes your applications more secure, and there is also a standard file upload component. Resource library contracts enable you to swap sets of templates, images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files across your application, simplifying customization for different clients or deployments. This tutorial digs deep into details about how to use these and other new features.\n\n\nAuthor:\nKito Mann\nKito D.
