description: "Many organizations expect a high-performance, high-reliability cloud that avoids cloud lock-in and allows them to develop in a reliable, easy, consistent fashion. \n\nIn this webinar, we will showcase how your organization can adopt a portable workflow deploying to Oracle Cloud including Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) for cloud native deployments. Weâ€™ll walk through a live demo demonstrating how teams can increase productivity by enabling cross-functional team collaboration and CI/CD automation with a single DevOps application.\n\nKen McKnight\nSolutions Architect\nGitLab\n\nVladimir Ten\nTechnical Account Manager\nGitLab"
