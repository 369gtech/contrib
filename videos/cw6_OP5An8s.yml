description: "DeepMind, an AI lab & complete outsider to the field of molecular biology, beat top pharmaceutical companies with 100K+ employees like Pfizer, Novartis, etc. at predicting protein structures. This is huge! DeepMind didn't yet release the paper or code, so I browsed the CASP reports and different related papers to reverse engineer the architecture as best as I could. What I ended up doing is forking a related research papers code and repurposing it, since its very similar (2 residual networks were used). In this episode, i explain the different components of its architecture, why the protein folding problem is so important, and give some programmatic examples.
