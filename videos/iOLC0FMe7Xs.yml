title: '"Securing firmware: Secure and Trusted boot in OpenBMC" - Joel Stanley (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1580301566
description: "Joel Stanley\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/36/\n\nThe OpenBMC project has brought modern Linux technologies to the firmware in your new server. A missing piece of this is ensuring the firmware is the image you expect it to be running, weather that is something your vendor shipped, an update, or something you build yourself from the open source project.\r\n\r\nThe next generation of BMC hardware will allow a hardware root of trust to secure the entire boot chain. Come hear about how that works, and how the design goes to great lengths to ensure user freedoms to replace firmware while still being secure are preserved. This talk will coverTPMs, EEPROMs,  keys, and signing, from a firmware perspective.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nFri Jan 17 11:40:00 2020 at Room 7"
