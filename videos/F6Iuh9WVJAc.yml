Fisher and Katya Yefimova\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn 2016 the world faces the worst humanitarian crisis since WWII: over 60M people are forcibly displaced, half of whom are youth. Building on our work with teens from East Africa, Myanmar and Latin America about how they hack technology to support ICT wayfaring, we focus in this talk on how technology can help young Syrian refugees reimagine their lives and build their futures. From fieldwork at the UNHCR Za’atari Syrian Refugee Camp in Jordan, we report on youth’s creativity, desires to help others via ICT wayfaring, and how universal design archetypes occur across cultures but differ in affordances. We share sample design specs for glasses that detect disease, magic roads, wish making, and more. As we return to Za’atari on March 4 for our second, year-long engagement, we ask Googlers to brainstorm on how to bring these designs to life.
