description: "Filmed at https://2020.dotswift.io on February 3, 2020 in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nKaya explains two unique techniques to help make your tests easier to read, write and understand. The first technique is using Swift enums to abstract XCUIElementQuery calls and to isolate UI element into cases with each enum representing one screen. The second technique uses function builders to allow you to group multiple calls to XCTAssertTrue() and XCTAssertFalse()."
