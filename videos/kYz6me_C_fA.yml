description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nStreaming Recording Rules for Prometheus, Thanos, and Cortex Using the M3 Coordinator - Gibbs Cullen & Rob Skillington, Chronosphere\n\nAs the Prometheus ecosystem has matured, the compatibility between projects has accelerated and it is possible to use features from one project with another. In this talk, Gibbs and Rob will show how to use various parts of the M3 ecosystem to perform in-memory streaming metrics aggregation, without using M3DB itself, thanks to developments in core Prometheus and M3. Using two deployment options, they will perform a demo using a concrete example of creating a highly efficient cAdvisor overview dashboard that shows fast aggregate views of CPU, memory, network and disk activity for pod groups from tens of thousands of active containers. They will also demo how to use streaming recording rules to store per-metric 10m or 1h downsampled metrics with a global metric suffix in Prometheus, Cortex, and other Prometheus remote storage solutions, like M3 and Thanos, that don’t yet have the ability to downsample metrics."
