description: "Speaker(s):\nBarbara Wang; Marc Stogaitis; Waleed Kadous\n\nDescription:\nAre we as developers taking full advantage of the new sensing capabilities (like GPS, Bluetooth Low Energy, accelerometers, barometers) of mobile devices to make user experiences delightful? These new sensors introduce the capability to know where a person is and what they’re doing as well as many other clues. Join us as we explore the opportunities, show some old and new tools Google has created to help, share our lessons building experiences like the Now “Where did I park my car?” card, and predict what the future may hold for context-aware computing.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
