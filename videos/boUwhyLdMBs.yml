description: "Recorded live at SpringOne 2GX 2012. \nPresenter: Craig Walls\nThe modern web is rich with APIs that can be consumed by other applications, enabling an integrated experience for the users who hold accounts on the websites that front those APIs. Many of these APIs are secured with OAuth, an authorization specification for securing REST APIs. Spring Social is an extension to the Spring Framework that enables Spring applications to establish connections with those APIs on behalf of their users with little or no need to muck about in the intricacies of OAuth.\n\nIn this session, we'll explore how Spring Social brings API connectivity to Spring applications. We'll also uncover the newest features of Spring Social that make it easier than ever to link your application's users to the identities they maintain on various sites across the web."
