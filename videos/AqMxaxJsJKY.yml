The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nBalancing Power and Pain: Moving a Startup From a PaaS to Kubernetes - David Sudia, GoSpotCheck & Toni Rib, Gusto  \n\nBy hiding a lot of complexity and allowing a team to move fast and simply \"heroku push\" applications, PaaS solutions like Heroku are a perfect fit when you are early stage startup. However, what do you do when your business starts to get traction, and your scale or use case begins to stretch the limitations of a PaaS? This talk will share the story of a startup's successful migration away from a PaaS to a self-built platform powered by CNCF technology.     We'll share the highlights of our journey, such as how we translated PaaS concepts to our new infrastructure, and explain the series of choices we made, like assembling our platform from Kubernetes and other CNCF components. We will also share some of our difficulties, with the goal that other organisations can avoid making the same mistakes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaWH"
