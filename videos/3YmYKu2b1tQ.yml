title: 'Microservices in action at the Dutch National Police - Bert Jan Schrijver'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636020001
description: "Microservices? At the Police? Definitely!\nAt the Cloud, Big Data and Internet division of the Dutch National Police, 4 DevOps teams use the latest open source technology to build high tech, cloud native web applications in a private cloud. These applications are used to support various types of police work with data from open, online sources and are built using Spring Boot, Angular 5, Spark, Kafka and Jenkins 2.\nIn this session, I'll share our experiences and real-world use cases for microservices. I’ll explain our architecture, why we chose it, which challenges we face and what this all brings us. I’ll show how 4 teams work together on one product, loosely based on the models used by Spotify and Netflix, and I’ll talk about how we apply the principles of DevOps and Continuous Delivery. I’ll show how we handle security, build pipelines, test automation, performance tests, service discovery, automated deployments and monitoring.\nYou’ll leave this session with an understanding of how this approach enables us to have the agility of a startup within the large Police organization.\n#Microservices\n\nPresented by Bert Jan Schrijver\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
