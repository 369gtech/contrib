During the webinar, he explores some of the causes of bad collaboration and how to achieve the desired results using a combination of high impact interventions, skills development and organizational consulting in areas like cultural transformation, technology, software development, leadership and processes.\n\nThank you Jose for this interesting and meaningful talk.\n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/.\n\n\n\n\n\n00:00 - 03:30 Introduction\n03:30 - 43:28 Collaborating by design talk\n43:28 - 55:46 Q&A"
