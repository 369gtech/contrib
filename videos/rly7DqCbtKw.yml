Equally important however is bringing that research to production applications to solve real-world problems, but the issues and approaches for doing that are often poorly understood.\nAn ML application in production must address all of the issues of modern software development methodology, as well as issues unique to ML and data science. Often ML applications are developed and trained using tools like notebooks and suffer from inherent limitations in testability, scalability across clusters, training/serving skew, and the modularity and reusability of components. In addition, ML application measurement often emphasizes top level metrics, leading to issues in model fairness as well as predictive performance across user segments. The user experience of any ML application is unique to the model’s performance on that user’s input data, so if the model doesn’t perform well on that particular data segment then the user has a poor experience.\nWe discuss the use of ML pipeline architectures for implementing production ML applications, and in particular we review Google’s experience with TensorFlow Extended (TFX). Google uses TFX for large scale ML applications, and offers an open-source version to the community. TFX scales to very large training sets and very high request volumes, and enables strong software methodology including testability, hot versioning, and deep performance analysis. Robert Crowe is a data scientist and TFX Developer Advocate at Google and will discuss how developers can move their ML [...]\r\n\r\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\r\nhttps://gotocph.com/2019/sessions/955/taking-machine-learning-research-to-production-solving-real-problems\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcph\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\r\n#ML #TensorFlow #TFX #TensorFlowExtended #MachineLearning\r\n\r\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\r\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
