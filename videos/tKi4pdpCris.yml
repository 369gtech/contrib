description: "Filmed at http://ng-poland.pl 2018 on NOVEMBER 15 in Warsaw. \n\nPWAs, are we there yet?!\n\nProgressive web applications are the new hip and all the cool kids are on board. They are slowly becoming an industry standard for building web applications. With reliability, speed and immersive user experience in mind, PWAs help you reach a broader audience. But what are the gotchas? Let's explore some of the limitations we might encounter compared to native applications. Which traditionally native features are now available for PWAs to use and which are in development? All browsers are on the same page, supporting features like Service Workers is key but which are differences in API implementation and what bugs should we be aware of? After this session you'll walk away with a clear idea on which is the current state of PWAs, its limitations as well as its strengths.\n\nSimona Cotin - Senior Cloud Developer Advocate\n\nSimona Cotin is a web developer with a passion for teaching.
