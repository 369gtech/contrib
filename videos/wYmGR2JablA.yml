description: "DevX with Application Runtime (CF) and Container Runtime (K8s) - Neven Cvetkovic, Pivotal\n\nWhat's the difference between these platforms, what do they have in common, and what does working with each of them look like from a developer perspective? Landing your code on the right platform will determine the quality of your developer experience. It's important, therefore, to understand what kinds of workloads are most suitable for each, the level of effort required to work with them, and what each platform does for you.\n\nDo you let buildpacks create containers for you, or do you build your own? How much YAML do you need to author and maintain? What kind of security can your application expect from the platform?\n\nYou'll leave this session with a clear understanding of what two platforms do for developers.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyT/devx-with-application-runtime-cf-and-container-runtime-k8s-neven-cvetkovic-pivotal"
