description: 'Choosing the backend architecture for your mobile app can be daunting. Do you go with a traditional WebAPI? Serverless? Maybe a mobile backend as a service (MBaaS) that packages several convenient components for mobile developers together? In this session you will learn about the pros and cons of each, the context of when each makes sense to use, and you’ll see a real-world app built using each of these backends. When you leave this session, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge of how to pick and implement the right backend for your mobile application.'
