title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Recruiting and retaining dedicated volunteers'
recordingDate: 1462996412
description: "Volunteer work is exhausting, time consuming, and many times, thankless. \nSo why do we do it?\n\nSure, many companies encourage it, and some may even pay you for it, but odds are, if you're one of the many volunteers I've worked with over the last eight years, you do it because you like it. You have a passion for the work, or for the mission, or simply because you like giving back.\n\nHow can you, as a meetup coordinator, an initiative lead, or project manager, tap into that same motivation and use it to recruit and retain your own dedicated team? It's actually pretty simple, but you'll have to attend my session to find out."
