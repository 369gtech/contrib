recordingDate: 1632990494
description: "What is the best use of my time right now? Isn’t that the ultimate agile question to ask yourself? And we want to ask it often enough to not get stuck in less important tasks, but not too frequently to avoid breaking our focus.\n\nMonotasking is an agile method scaled down to one person. It helps you to focus, prioritize, and collaborate with others in a simple and natural way. It draws on scientific research and it affirms our great intuition.\n\nIn this session, Staffan will talk about how we may manage all too long to-do lists and how to get started quickly in the morning.\n\nRecorded Tuesday 1 June 2021 12:00"
