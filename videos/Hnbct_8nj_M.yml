description: "Sarcastic talk, sharing real-life experience on both technical and social aspects of doing an architecture migration to microservices without losing a job.\n\nAny change in software architecture is a significant time investment.

Therefore it is always an advantage to know what to expect in advance, not just from inspiring blog posts but also from the harsh reality.\n\nI would like to share typical pitfalls of choosing a framework stack, communication protocol, conventions, and deployment process â€” all covered by real projects.\n\nEVENT:\n\nEuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Shanghai\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAnton Caceres\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYgla2-mxMc"
