title: 'Building Smarter Applications with Machine Learning on Autonomous Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623179782
description: "Slide Deck: http://bit.ly/slidedeck-ADB0603\n\nApplications are smart when they can spot trends, react to unusual events, predict outcomes, recommend choices or detect and prevent fraud. Data Scientists are constantly producing AI and ML models that can be invoked in real-time to provide these smart functionalities. But most of these models donâ€™t make it to production due to challenges in integrating them in the application. \n\nJoin us as we show you how Autonomous Database makes it simple to understand and code the integration points between your Application and these models. You will learn all the different options available for adding AI and ML into your projects when using Oracle Machine Learning that is available inside the Oracle Autonomous Database.  You will also learn about interfaces with SQL, PL/SQL, Python and REST APIs, and see live demos of the different components, as well as see a live demo of a ChatBot App used for Image Classification.\n\nVideo Highlights:\n00:22 Agenda\n01:30 Oracle Machine Learning overview\n05:40 OML Model building with PL/SQL and inference (scoring) with SQL\n08:58 Live demo\n14:11 OML Model building with PL/SQL and inference (scoring) with Python\n15:58 Live demo model inference (scoring) with Python\n17:35 OML Model building with Python and inference (scoring) with SQL\n21:00 Using OML AutoML UI to build and deploy an OML model\n24:03 Live demo of OML AutoML UI\n30:30 Live demo of OML Models for model deployment\n34:34 Live demo Open API of a model\n36:39 Live demo Using Postman to access OML Services\n40:56 Live demo Using Postman to score OML models\n48:08 Live demo Using Postman to score ONNX ML models \n49:21 Live demo Using Postman to score ONNX Image Classification models\n50:50 Live demo OML AutoML UI create auto-generated Notebook with best model\n53:00 Where to go from here?\n54:14 Q&A"
