Sustainability of this ecosystem is pivotal to accelerate human progress; yet many organizations focus their community building efforts as a sales pipeline, or a program to deflect requests for support. \nIn this talk I’d share tools to engage your communities in a positive, nurturing way; with a servants approach to building community and centered on creating advocacy, loyalty, and ultimately business value.\n\nSpeaker:\nAndrea Griffiths – https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/member/andrea-griffiths\n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/new-oss-community-enabling-advocates-not-customers"
