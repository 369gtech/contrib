recordingDate: 1534760632
description: "Darryn Campbell\nSenior architect, Zebra Technologies\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN DEVICE OWNER: WHY? HOW? AND WHY NOT?\n\nIn Android Enterprise, much of the functionality depends on what your Enterprise Mobility Manager provides: it is their their server backend and their client that acts as the Device owner (DO). \n\nWe are seeing a number of organizations of all sizes break out of this restriction and create their own DO: In this talk I will explain why you might want to create your own device owner, what is involved beyond Google's excellent but somewhat utilitarian TestDPC, how to take full advantage of the Device Policy Manager APIs and finally perhaps save you a couple weeks of effort by covering why this approach is not best for everybody."
