description: "Google I/O 2009 - Browser Perspectives: An Open Discussion\r\n\r\nJonas Sicking, Charles McCathieNevile, Ian Fette, Mike Schroepfer\r\n\r\nWeb developers are asking more from today's browsers â€” more speed, more functionality, and more ability to make web applications that make users happy. To talk about how browser development happens with respect to new standards, such as what influences decisions around which new APIs to implement first and how to implement new features in the face of still-changing standards proposals, we have a series of representatives from Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Opera taking part in a panel discussion moderated by Mike Schroepfer, VP of Engineering at Facebook.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
