title: 'Software Engineering Is About Tradeoffs - Mateusz Pusz - NDC TechTown 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635790875
description: 'This talk presents a view of a Software Architect. Often there is no such thing as "the best" solution for the problem. In many cases, we have to deal with compromises and accept the downsides of a specific approach. During the talk, I will present some of the major tradeoffs and disagreements regarding the C++ design. I will also describe a few issues I encountered during the design of mp-units (the modern C++ physical units library) and ask the audience to make a choice between several alternative solutions to the problem.'
