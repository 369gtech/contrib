Understand why people are doing certain tasks, not only what they are doing. \nBasically, improve your apps, by asking the right questions.\n\nNo budget for user research? Learn what you can do under the radar to understand the user behaviour better. You will get examples on how it can be done, regardless if you are a bigger company, or an indie developer!\n\nAlex Karp Production"
