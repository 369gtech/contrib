description: "Docker is revolutionizing the way people think about applications and deployments. It provides a simple way to run and distribute Linux containers for a variety of use cases, from lightweight virtual machines to complex distributed micro-services architectures.\n\nContainers allow to run services in isolation with a minimum performance penalty, increased speed, easier configuration and less complexity, making it ideal for continuous integration and continuous delivery based workloads.\n\nBut migrating an existing application to a distributed microservices architecture is no easy task, requiring a shift in the software development, networking and storage to accommodate the new architecture.\n\nWe will provide insight on our experience creating a Jenkins platform based on distributed Docker containers running on Apache Mesos and Marathon, applicable for all types of applications, but specially Java and JVM based nones.\nDevOps Pro Vilnius 2016 - http://goo.gl/D9eDT7"
