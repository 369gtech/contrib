You will also get to know the boundaries of Kubernetes – what it does and what is it not supposed to do.\n\nYou will also understand the inherent architecture of Kubernetes – master components, node components and the addons provided by it. The course will start off with learning the basic components of Kubernetes like Node, Pod, Deployment, Services, APIs etc and then teach you to create a local cluster using Ubuntu VMs.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFor Online Training and Certification, Please write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free) for more information"
