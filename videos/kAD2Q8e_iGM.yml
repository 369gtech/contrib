description: "Speaker: Erdem Gunay\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/erdem-gunay-springshowcasewebinar\nTurkcell launched a personal cloud storage service few years ago. Adding new business features was costly in terms of time and budget on the legacy solution. The user experience needed to be improved. Finally, it was decided to build a new solution where Spring Boot and Spring Framework projects play crucial role as the backbone.\n\nThe project was completed just in 6 months starting from scratch. The solution was built on top of Spring Boot and many Spring IO Platform projects, allowing the development team focus on business logic instead of configuration & integration details. The project has been divided into deployable modules (API, backend, migration, test automation) accessing micro services that are responsible for one task only.\n\nJoin Erdem for a review of the migration effort and new architecture - all enabled by Spring Boot."
