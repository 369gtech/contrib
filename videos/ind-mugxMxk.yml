title: 'Python Web Scraping Tools: A Survey'
language: English
recordingDate: 1524766033
description: "There are myriad web scraping tools available in Python spanning a broad range of use cases. At the same time there are many surprising gaps in coverage. Further complicating matters, differences which look innocuous in a browser can have an outsized impact on the design of an automated browsing system. In this talk we survey a collection of common web scraping frameworks and work out a mapping from real-world use cases to packages. Along the way we address common questions like: How do I choose among content parsers? What if a page is dominated by JavaScript or HTML5? If I'm going to control a browser which one should I choose? Can I run this in the cloud with no access to a display? Can I download files? \n\nEVENT:\n\nSingapore Python User Group 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJon Reiter \n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee4VJ2ohLaw"
