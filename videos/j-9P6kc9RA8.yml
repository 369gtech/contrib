description: "Titel: Reactive DDD: Floor to Ceiling, or Ceiling to Floor?\n\nIn new fields, such as IoT, software complexity comes at you rapidly, and over time complexity can dominate systems and the teams that work on them. Previously unforeseen customers, functionality, and other demands, such as short timelines, and your desire to deliver everything to everyone, can break you and your code. When that happens business opportunity is lost, along with your confidence and reputation. Learn how you can rethink software design and implementation with the actor model, using these small, independent, asynchronous, computing components, in a business-driven fashion, to focus on delivering new functionality in a business-driven way. For example, wouldn't it make sense to design IoT solutions around event-driven digital twins in an microservices architecture?\n\nGreat, but how do we get there? Are Reactive systems developed top-down, or bottom-up? Does it matter? The question is, what *is* the top and what *is* the bottom? Reactive DDD is pervasive throughout the system, so maybe it's Reactive Through-and-Through. This session informs how to design Reactive systems using Domain-Driven Design.\n\nSpeaker: Vaughn Vernon - Domain Model Whisperer. Champion of simplicity and reactive. Author of DDD and Reactive Books - Founder @vlingo_io platform.\n\nVaughn Vernon is a software developer and architect with more than 30 years of experience in a broad range of business domains. Vaughn is a leading expert in Domain-Driven Design, champion of simplicity and reactive systems, and the founder of the open source, DDD-friendly, reactive, vlingo/platform. He consults and teaches around Domain-Driven Design and reactive software development, helping teams and organizations realize the potential of business driven and reactive systems as they transition from technology driven legacy web implementation approaches. As he does so, he puts strong emphasis on embracing simplicity whenever possible. Vaughn is the author of three books: Implementing Domain-Driven Design, Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model, and Domain-Driven Design Distilled, all published by Addison-Wesley."
