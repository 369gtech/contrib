description: 'Reactivity — is a buzzword. Nowaday’s market talks about reactivity. Vert.x, Akka, what else? Right — recently Spring Framework introduced new module called WebFlux, which allows building Reactive Application using traditional Spring features. But do we really need that module, will it help us in our every-day job, will it in solving our problems? What else is hidden behind that? All that stuff will be discussed during the talk and finally, we will get an understanding whether starting/migrating your current project with/to Reactive Spring worth it.'
