title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Biohacking Village - Michelle Holko - Digital Health Tech in NIH All of Us'
language: English
recordingDate: 1596874766
description: 'The National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) All of Us Research Program (AoURP) aims to enroll at least one million US participants from diverse backgrounds; collect electronic health record (EHR) data, survey data, physical measurements, biospecimens for genomics and other assays, and digital health data; and create a researcher database and tools to enable precision medicine research. Since inception, digital health technologies (DHT) have been envisioned as integral to achieving the goals of the program. A “bring your own device” (BYOD) pilot for collecting Fitbit data from participants’ devices was developed with more recent integration of Apple HealthKit data donation and additional DHTs planned in the future. This presentation will describe 1) the initial process to assess, curate, and include Fitbit BYOD data in the All of Us Researcher Workbench, 2) the diversity and assessment of under-represented in biomedical research (UBR) in Fitbit BYOD participants compared with overall AoU participant population, and 3) future DHT studies planned for AoURP.'
