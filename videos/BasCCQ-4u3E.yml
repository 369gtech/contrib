title: 'DevOpsDaysRiga 2017 | Kris Buytaert | The return of the Dull Stack Engineer'
recordingDate: 1507810830
description: "Kris Buytaert is CoFounder & CTO at Inuits and long time Linux and Open Source Consultant. He spends most of his time working on bridging the gap between developers and operations with a strong focus on High Availability, Scalability, Virtualisation and Large Infrastructure Management projects hence trying to build infrastructures that can survive the 10th-floor test, better known today as the cloud. \nKris is one of the instigators of the DevOps movement and is actively promoting the DevOps idea! He has written about the same subjects in different books, papers and articles and is frequently speaking at, or organizing different international conferences including DevOpsDays!\nDuring his talk: \"The return of Dull Stack Engineer\" during DevOpsDays Riga 2017 he is speaking about that it's time again for the Dull Stack Engineer, the Engineer who knows what's running on his platform, focusses on servicing the business and not just his need of new and fancy tooling, the engineer who collaborates with his peers rather than running Docker because it's the cool thing to do."
