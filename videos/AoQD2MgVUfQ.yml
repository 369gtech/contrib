description: "Historically, the health care space has done a whole lot of 'talking at' and 'lecturing to' and not a whole lot of listening -- to what really matters, to what really resonates -- and not just to those who offer up their opinions, but perhaps even more importantly...to the millions of nameless faceless individuals out there struggling with where real life meets their health. Now the healthcare space is sitting on a mess of data -- actual data reflecting how real people live and think and interact with the world around them. It's time to pore through the data...to listen really hard...to focus on separating signal from noise -- looking for what is really there as opposed to what we think should be there. Is engagement data more telling than claims data? Is vulnerability more important than risk? Can we open our minds and our warehouses to consider these questions? Is it bigger data we need? Or is it higher fidelity, more relevant data that's missing... And remember -- knowing something is different than doing something -- so the next question becomes: Once you've tamed your big data, what are you going to do with what you learned?\n\nAlexandra Drane\n\nEliza Corporation\n\nAlexandra sets the vision and strategy for Eliza, and is responsible for maintaining Eliza's leadership position in the healthcare industry. She has devoted her career to inspiring people to lead healthier, happier and more engaged lives through the use of innovative technology, and her entrepreneurial spirit and passion for technology and design have led to the launch of four successful healthcare ventures over the past 15 years. Alexandra has proven herself a visionary and an innovator, whose ideas on using technology to engage people in their health -- and her belief in adding a touch of joy to the often staid world of healthcare communications -- have been adopted by the nation's top healthcare organizations.\n\nAlexandra is currently Founder, Chief Visionary Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Eliza Corporation, the pioneer and leader in Health Engagement Management and one of Entrepreneur magazine's \"100 Brilliant Companies.\" The company's intelligent, tailored interactions—including automated calls powered by a patented speech recognition engine, rich web and multi-modal delivery platform and proprietary sophisticated data analytics—make health and healthcare information more accessible, more actionable and more engaging.\n\nEliza draws on its database of more than 700 million interactions with individuals about their health to better understand what makes people \"tick\" and create programs with measurable and sustained impact. Examples include increasing the number of patients who get their recommended diabetes screenings by 76%; more than doubling prescription refills over a six-month period; quadrupling participation in an online smoking cessation program; and boosting younger members' perceptions of their health plans' brands beyond what far more expensive traditional advertising campaigns deliver. But perhaps most important are the countless saved lives as the result of timely, personalized health outreach. Alexandra is also a co-founder of Engage with Grace, a not-for-profit movement launched in October 2008 aimed at helping people understand, communicate and have honored their end-of-life wishes. She received the Boston Business Journal's \"Champions of Healthcare\" award for her efforts in this area, and Engage With Grace has been added to the healthcare lexicon as a top ten phrase.\n\nBased on her experience engaging people in conversation about health topics, in 2010 she co-founded a non-profit, web-based movement called SeduceHealth that aims to reframe how the healthcare industry communicates with the people it serves by adding greater passion, joy, and inspiration.\n\nPrior to founding Eliza, Alexandra was a founder of three other healthcare ventures -- all focused on developing products that enable individual behavior change through the use of technology. The output of these ventures included the web-enabled injury-tracking software system adopted by the US Olympic Committee, software that automates dialysis clinics across the U.S., and a medical device proven in clinical trials to improve asthma treatment compliance by over 35%.\n\nAlexandra sits on the board of Eliza, the Board of Trustees for Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (a Harvard Teaching Hospital) in Boston, MA, the Board of Advisors of TEDMED, and the Harvard Executive Sleep Council. She also sits on the Board of Directors and the Operations Committee of the Coalition to Transform Advanced Care (C-TAC) and co-chairs C-TAC's Public Engagement Workgroup. Alexandra is a member of the Health Executive Leadership Network, Women Business Leaders of the U.S. Health Care Industry Foundation, and is a trustee of several charitable trusts."
