description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nDean Wampler - Head of evangelism at Anyscale.io, O'Reilly author on functional programming and expert in streaming systems\n\nABSTRACT\nRay (https://ray.io) is a framework for scaling Python applications from single machines to large clusters. It is used in several ML/AI systems and production deployments.\nDean will explain common problems in scalable, distributed computing, particularly for high-performance ML/AI applications that motivated that creation of Ray. You’ll see how Ray solves them for Python-based systems (and possibly other languages in the future).\nIn particular, Ray supports rapid distribution, scheduling, and execution of fine-grained “tasks”, a more natural decomposition of work for many problems compared to coarse-grained decomposition. Sequencing of dependent tasks cluster-wide is also transparent and intuitive.\nRay also manages distributed state using the popular Actor model, which is essential for the next generation of “serverless” computing, where these services are stateful.\nWhether or not you are a Python or ML/AI developer, the general lessons discussed [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1241/ray-a-system-for-distributed-applications\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#RayIO #Ray #Programming #SoftwareArchitecture #Python #Cloud #Backend\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
