description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2016 - Brussels, January 27-29 2016\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nAre design changes hard to justify because so many user stories in your Product Backlog would need to be rewritten? Do you neglect design work because it's not a \"business priority\"? If so, you are not alone. Many teams struggle with integrating DDD with their current \"process\" - don't be one of them! Don't get stuck in agile ditches when you could be doing effective design. You will be able to identify common mistakes agile development teams make, and learn how to counter them with simple, proven techniques to do design well. Be aware of the ways that current agile wisdom in the industry sabotages effective design, and learn techniques for reducing the friction and making design fun again."
