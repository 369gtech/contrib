description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/ben-marx\n\nThe story of Elixir and Phoenix adoption as told through a visual representation of application development. Three subdivisions emerge: initial commits, production release, and refactor. These subdivisions, common to application development, uniquely coincide with milestones in the lifecycle of Elixir and Phoenix.\n\nThe initial phase explains the motivations behind embracing Elixir and Phoenix but also the pitfalls of early adoption.\n\nThe production release phase explains how benefits were realized and expectations were exceeded. This period couples nicely with the 1.0 release of Phoenix and Ecto as well as the 1.1 release of Elixir.\n\nFinally, in the refactoring phase, benchmarks and code samples illustrate how a better understanding of Elixir and Phoenix has led to simpler, more expressive code in line with Elixir and Phoenix paradigms\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nThrough code samples, metrics and benchmarks, it’ll be shown how Elixir and Phoenix yielded immense benefits in terms of performance, terser code and developer happiness.   \n\nTarget audience: \n\nDevelopers interested in Elixir and also those currently using Elixir to show how an app has matured - in terms of coding paradigms and performance - over the course of its development."
