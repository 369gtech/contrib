title: 'Java in the Age of Containers and Serverless (Markus Eisele, 2019)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636121122
description: "Java in 2019 was predicted to be business as usual by many. We have seen new Java releases coming out as planned, AdoptOpenJDK became the main trustful source of binaries and Oracle fighting for the trademark again by preventing the use of javax as namespace.\n\nEverything looks like it would be a silent year for Java. But one thing seems also obvious. Java's popularity is not gaining any more traction. New language features keep it up to date but people are getting more selective when it comes to implementation choices. Especially in the age of containers and cloud infrastructures. How will Java continue to fit in? What are the advantages and what needs to be done?"
