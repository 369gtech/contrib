description: "Slides and more info: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2016/rob-martin\n\nA year ago, I chose to focus on three professional goals:\n\n1. How can we get new developers learning functional programming, rather than object oriented programming?\n\n2. How can we get startups using functional programming, rather than platforms like Ruby on Rails and Node.js Express?\n\n3. How do we build teams of functional programmers, and especially teams that productively use junior developers?\n\nThis talk is a progress report in three parts, covering our women's internship program, the work we've done with mob programming, and a functional programming workshop we started called Eleven Ounces of Elixir, specifically for new developers and entrepreneurs. Because we do a lot of retrospectives, we'll be able to share a lot of first-person experiences.A year ago, I chose to focus on three professional goals:\n\n1.
