description: "Cutting-edge Continuous Delivery: Automated Canary Analysis on Cloud Foundry using Spinnaker - Andreas Evers, Pivotal \n\nUsing Cloud Foundry, we’ve learned best practices about how to deploy software at velocity — things like automated releases, immutable infrastructure, gradual rollouts, and fast rollbacks.  One of the most sophisticated techniques of going to production quickly, with confidence, is called automated canary analysis. While canary deployments themselves are becoming a commodity, having an autonomous judge at your disposal, makes all the difference. The judge analyses metrics of both baseline and canary deployments and automatically rolls forwards or backward.  Meet Spinnaker, an open-source multi-cloud continuous delivery platform which embodies these core principles of safe, frequent and reliable releases with contributions from Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and Pivotal. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
