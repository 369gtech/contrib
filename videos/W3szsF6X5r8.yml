description: "\"Learning Erlang - the advantages of keeping things simple\" - a Webinar by Torben Hoffmann and Robert Virding\n\nMassive concurrency, fault-tolerance, process- isolation, distribution, soft-real time, hot code replacement have always been basic properties of Erlang which have fundamentally affected the design of both the language and Open Telecom Platform (OTP) library that Ericsson created on top of it.\n\nErlang is a dynamic language with simple and concise syntax. It allows you to avoid writing tons of boilerplate code, thus making the iterative and agile development faster. It found its usages in telecom exchanges, instant messaging servers (e.g. MongooseIM), web frameworks (e.g. Zotonic), database engines (e.g. Riak, CouchDB) and many other solutions in different business branches.\n\nIn this webinar you'll learn:\n\n-Erlang, its benefits and use cases\n-How Erlang fits into the technologies you're already using\n-What makes Erlang easy to pick up & learn\n-Different Erlang/OTP training courses and e-learning sessions available worldwide providing insight into the different aspects of the Erlang software cycle"
