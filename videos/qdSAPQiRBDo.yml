description: "#Programming​ #Cpp​ #CppOnSea​ \n2021 Program: https://cpponsea.uk/2021/schedule/\nC++ On Sea Website: https://cpponsea.uk/\nC++ On Sea Twitter: https://twitter.com/cpponsea\nStreamed & Edited By Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk​\n-------\nC++20 is the next big release of C++. It introduces a lot of changes that will have an impact or our programming style. But the real power becomes clear if you come up with examples that go a bit beyond the usual basic feature motivations.\n\nThis talk will present examples that demonstrate how cool programming with C++20 becomes. Ideally, these are examples combining multiple new features.\n\n-------\nNicolai Josuttis\nNicolai Josuttis (www.josuttis.com) is well known in the C++ Community for speaking and writing with authority about C++ (being the author of \"The C++ Standard Library\", \"C++ Templates\" (coauthor), and \"C++17 - The Complete Guide\") but is also an innovative presenter. He is an active member of C++ standardization committee for more than 20 years now.\n\n-------\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 and 2021 conferences were moved to virtual events due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
