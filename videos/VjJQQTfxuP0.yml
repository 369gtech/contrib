description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 18 http://bit.ly/2P7SPII\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nPROGRAMMATION EN LOGIQUE\nby Lars Hupel\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nLogic-based \nProgramming \nRocks\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nProlog is one of the most underrated programming languages around; possibly because of its strange syntax and the unusual paradigm. But it is a very nice special-purpose programming language. In this talk, I would like to introduce Prolog’s programming model, showcase some programming domains in which Prolog allows for very concise, elegant programs, and finally describe how it can also be used as a general-purpose tool.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/lars-hupel/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - LARS HUPEL\nCo-founder, Typelevel\n\nLars Hupel is a PhD student at TU München in the field of logic and verification. His research focus is on techniques for verified code generation from theorem provers. Additionally, he has worked on formal treatments of Linux firewalls. A frequent conference speaker and co-founder of the Typelevel initiative, he is active in the open source community, particularly in Scala. He also enjoys programming in Haskell, Prolog, and Rust.\n\nMore on Lars Hupel: http://codesync.global/speaker/lars-hupel/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
