description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeaker:  - Rajini Sivaram\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/reactive-kafka\n\nApache Kafka is a distributed, scalable, high-throughput messaging bus. Over the last few years, Kafka has emerged as a key building block for data-intensive distributed applications. As a high performance message bus, Kafka enables the development of distributed applications using the microservices architecture.\n\nReactive Streams simplifies the development of asynchronous systems using non-blocking back pressure. The reactive framework enables the development of asynchronous microservices by providing a side-effect free functional API with minimal overhead that supports low latency, non-blocking end-to-end data flows.\n\nAfter an introduction to Kafka and reactive streams, we will explore the development of a reactive streams interface for Kafka and the use of this interface for building robust applications using the microservices architecture."
