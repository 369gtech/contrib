description: "Keynote: Smooth Operator♪: Large Scale Automated Storage with Kubernetes - Celina Ward, Software Engineer & Matt Schallert, Site Reliability Engineer, Uber \n\nManaging stateful applications is tough. While Kubernetes excels in automated application management, more often than not, the state of these applications live outside of Kubernetes. What happens when users develop complex stateful software but still want to benefit from the automation and portability that Kubernetes provides?\n\nIn this talk, Celina and Matt share their experience creating an operator for a unique stateful workload: a sharded, replicated, multi-zone time-series database. They discuss the major shift in thought -- from the mental model of a 1:1 process/node relationship, to one far more adaptive to both machine and user behavior.\n\nThe audience will walk away with a framework for expressing their stateful workloads using Kubernetes primitives, and advice for navigating the difficult process of codifying innovative abstract ideas without over-engineering solutions. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Gsxn"
