title: 'Lambda Jam 2014 - Andrew Sorensen - Live-Coding the World'
language: English
recordingDate: 1410616527
description: "Live-coding explores the idea that changes made to a program’s text can have an immediate affect on the program’s ongoing execution. Since the turn of the Century, musicians have been expoliting this behaviour to construct musical performances, live, in front of an audience. The real-time, and cyber-physical behaviour of these ‘sound generating’ systems raises interesting questions about the relationship between a program’s text, and its ongoing execution in both time and space.\n\nLive-Coding the World will explore the idea of program, programmer, machine and environment, with a particular focus on Extempore, a high-performance live-coding language being developed by Andrew. Where-ever possible Andrew will try to find excuses to demonstrate the potential of live-coding in the world, via music and sound examples with a strong physical connection to the built environment."
