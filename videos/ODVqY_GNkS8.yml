description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPyPI Supply Chain Security - Dustin Ingram, Python Software Foundation\n\nThe Python Package Index (PyPI) is one of the oldest software repositories for a language ecosystem and the canonical place to publish Python code. It serves more than 2 billion requests a day, and is almost entirely supported by volunteers and the non-profit Python Software Foundation.\n\nIn this talk, we'll review some recent supply-chain attack and how they relate to PyPI specifically. In addition, we'll take a look at some in-progess projects to make PyPI more resilient, secure and sustainable."
