description: "Speaker: Eric C.Y. Lee\n\nEric will give an introduction to graph database and Neo4j. He will demonstrate how you can install and setup Neo4j. He will explain some simple \"Cypher Query Language\" syntaxes. After you have basic knowledge of Neo4j, Eric will guide you through an exercise.\n\nIf you would like to follow along, bring along a laptop, preferably with Linux or Mac OSX and the latest copy of Neo4j 2.3 at http://neo4j.com/download. The community version is fine, although the Enterprise version is better.\n\nEric is a senior software engineer at Silicon Cloud International where he is responsible for work related to system development and NoSQL database. He has published books in digital publishing and biocomputing. Outside of work, he enjoys travelling and reading.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.meetup.com/PyData-SG/events/226837758/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HrLr/"
