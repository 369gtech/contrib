This was made possible by a significant effort to revamp Beam’s portability framework, build the corresponding Flink Runner, and simplify Flink’s artifact distribution & deployment mechanisms.\n\nWhat is the “killer big-data app” enabled by this integration: production TensorFlow pipelines. Building production machine learning pipelines that process large distributed data sets can get complex. In this talk, we will describe a set of open source libraries developed at Google, that simplify and unify pre and post processing stages for a production TensorFlow pipeline. These libraries are authored on Beam’s python SDK, and can be run on Apache Flink at scale.\nLast, but not least, we will describe how Beam & Flink aim to bring the power of big-data to newer audiences, in particular, developers of the Go programming language.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
