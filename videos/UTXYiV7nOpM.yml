description: "Filmed in Barcelona at ElixirConf EU 2017\n\nAvailability should be one of our major concerns when writing web applications, yet more often than not we ship code that is simply not resilient enough. Elixir and OTP provide powerful tools to improve resilience and increase availability: in this talk we'll look at how we can leverage them to provide continuous service even when our database is down. The talk will be a walkthrough of a refactor of an Elixir application with a Phoenix frontend, powered by PostgreSQL.\n\nElixirConf EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities."
