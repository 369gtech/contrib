title: 'Math for Game Developers - Rolling Dice (Intro to Probabilities)'
recordingDate: 1414695603
description: "To calculate a probability we take the number of possibilities for the desired outcome and divide it by the total number of outcome possibilities.\n\nFor the record I tried to say \"die\" when there was only one and \"dice\" when there are two and I generally failed at that.\n\nNew video every Thursday. Question? Leave a comment below, or ask me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VinoBS\n\nEXERCISES:\n\n1. How would you calculate the probabilities for two 20-sided dice?\n\n2. How would you calculate the probabilities for three 4-sided dice?\n\n3. How is the \"possibility pyramid\" different when we have three dice than when we have two dice?\n\n4. Tricky: If you wanted to design a system where the player rolls two 4-sided dice and every outcome is equally likely, how might you do it? Hint: You don't have to have the outcome be the sum of the two dice rolls. Try other things."
