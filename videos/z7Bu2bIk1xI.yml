description: 'The Internet of Things (IoT) with all its sensors produces already lots of data. These Big Data have to be collected, analyzed and represented. But instead of presenting them as the already known line and bar charts, I''ll show them on a Raspberry Pi in Minecraft. In my presentation I''ll demonstrate how the simple Minecraft API can be used to visualize data in different ways and how to interact with them.'
