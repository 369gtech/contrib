description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/dotnetfest/\nНаш сайт: www.dotnetfest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции .NET Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nThe MVVM pattern is a widely used architectural patterns that makes easier for developers to separate the business logic of an application from the user interface, allowing to create applications that are easier to test and maintain over time. However, when it comes to create a new project, there are some challenges to face: we need to setup every time the required infrastructure, we need to understand how to handle scenarios that in an application written without using the pattern are apparently simpler to manage, etc. In this session we're going to see how Prism, an open source framework driven by the Community, can help to deliver better and faster a Xamarin Forms application built with the MVVM pattern, by allowing developers to focus on the core of the project rather than on the implementation of the pattern."
