description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nAN ANDROID DEV START TO KOTLIN MULTIPLATFORM\nRoberto Orgiu, Android Engineer, The New York Times\n\nKotlin Multiplatform becomes more and more usable by the day. We might not need it every day, but there might also be the moment when it makes sense for everyone to just share that little bit of logic. In this talk, we will be talking about how we can convert a module to be Kotlin Multiplatform-ready in an existing codebase and how we can interact with it on an Android app.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/droidcon-italy\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
