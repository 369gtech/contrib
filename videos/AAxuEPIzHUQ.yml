To prepare for the session, follow the setup instructions at:  https://bit.ly/2JWsbxC   CRDs have become the main vehicle to extend the Kubernetes API. They are ready to build serious products on-top of them. But with more and more features like admission and conversion they are no longer just a hundred lines of YAML, but involve real software development. In this talk/tutorial we will start with a YAML-only CRD project and step-by-step go through the development life-cycle towards a powerful multi-version CRD:  - add schema validation using OpenAPI schema generators - enable pruning - add defaulting - add an admission webhook for powerful turing-complete validation - evolve the CRD to a new version with a conversion webhook - including comprehensive testing.  On this journey we will learn a lot of about the expected webhook behaviour, how they fit into API machinery, and about API compatibility and good & bad API practices. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaen"
