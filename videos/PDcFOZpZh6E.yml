description: "I love working with legacy code! It's great fun to dive into a system that we didn't write and figure out how to improve it. Last year, I jumped at the opportunity to work with a startup on a Ruby on Rails code base where developers had left and business users needed support. As I dived down into the code, there were a few surprises lying below the surface but my experience was not a miserable one. I enjoyed the challenge of an incredible learning experience. I'll be sharing my key insights from this project in my presentation at SC London. \n\nCome along to this talk to hear some practical strategies for getting to grips with an ageing code base while setting realistic expectations about what's possible.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2018, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
