The presenter will explain the necessity for GitHub automation, how RepoKitteh approaches the problem and how it compares to the alternatives, such hand crafted custom integrations and GitHub actions. The integration with Envoy will be detailed, and a demonstration of implementing new automations will be given. At the end of this talk, Envoy contributors will be empowered and inspired to add their own RepoKitteh integrations."
