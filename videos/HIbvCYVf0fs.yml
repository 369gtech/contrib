description: "Work can be extension of life and not a subtraction. A place where you can step into your full potential and become a better human. Work and a job can be the community that we’re all searching for, a place where you can be surrounded by people you love and revel in the joy of being your full self in all its flawed complexity. Work can be a place where you attain full autonomy and creative expression.\r\n\r\nI believe that self-organization and full participation are pre-conditions for autonomy. So is community.\r\n\r\nAutonomy is very important to me, as it is to many other people under 30 or 35. Autonomy doesn’t mean individualism or isolation. It means freedom from external control or influence; independence.\r\n\r\n - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch"
