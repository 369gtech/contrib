title: '.NET 6 Hot Reload Controversy Explained'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635076807
description: "The .NET world was rocked by controversy recently and I want to talk about it. The basic summary is that a tool called Hot Reload was a major feature of .NET 6. Recently, the command-line version of hot reload was removed from .NET 6. This caused quite a bit of frustration because it meant that this touted new feature would only be available in Visual Studio 2022. Tools like VSCode, Rider, and others that rely on the command line tooling would not be afforded the same features as the full version of Visual Studio.\n\nFull Training Courses: https://IAmTimCorey.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nLinks from the video:\nInitial Hot Reload Post: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-hot-reload/\nHot Reload Removal PR: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22217\nHot Reload Removal Statement: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/update-on-net-hot-reload-progress-and-visual-studio-2022-highlights/\nRevert PR: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22262\nVerge Post: https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740701/microsoft-dotnet-hot-reload-removal-decision-open-source\nBlog Post: https://dusted.codes/can-we-trust-microsoft-with-open-source\nHot Reload Reinstatement: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-hot-reload-support-via-cli/"
