title: 'Angular 9: Getting Ready To Update to Angular 9'
recordingDate: 1575577278
description: "We've all been waiting for Angular 9 for several years now. Not for Angular 9 specifically, but for the code that is getting released here. I am talking about Ivy. It is a new rendering engine (whatever that means) and will affect us somehow, even though our code should run the same as it did before. \n\nIn this event we will get you more familiar with Angular 9 than you ever thought you would be. More familiar with this specific release than you have ever been on a prior release.\n\nDon't miss our Angular 9 Launch Event: Go Here For Update: https://ngcnf.org/ng9"
