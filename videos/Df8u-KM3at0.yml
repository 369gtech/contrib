description: "Graham Williamson\n\nBuilding python packages in a team can be a complicated process. Devpi can assist in reducing this complexity by hosting your own content and making it seamlessly available with the rest of the packages on pypi. It also provides resiliency, robustness and auditability to your teams build process.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/devpi-for-teams\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nSun Aug  4 11:10:00 2019 at Cockle Bay"
