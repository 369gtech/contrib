description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nPanel: Kubernetes and Cloud Native Security: A State of the Union - Rags Srinivas, InfoQ; Gareth Rushgrove, Snyk; Kirsten Newcomer, Red Hat; Scott Coulton, Microsoft; & Phil Estes, IBM \n\nWith the advent of Containers, Kubernetes and microservices, and platforms that build on it, like Helm, openshift, Istio, etc. the attack surfaces have increased and that necessitates a more holistic and disciplined approach towards security. While there is a lot of FUD around cloud native security in general there are approaches to harden security during development and deployment today.  This panel, intended for developers and devops audience will look at the cloud native, containers and Kubernetes security ecosystem. Attendees will walk away with a better understanding of the challenges of some of the tools for the trade and how to overcome some of the security gaps that exist today.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeqF"
