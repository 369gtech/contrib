Many of the arguments that you hear against using C++ deal with the level of abstraction provided by objects and the STL (or templates, in general). However, there are many standard practices in C codebases that can benefit from some C++ tactics without having to introduce any of those features of the language. In this talk, we will look at some history of C to understand the viewpoint of C programmers. Then we will see methods to both improve both the reliability and maintainability of the codebase, while not alienating the existing developers. Along with these techniques, we will use compiler output that can be used to prove that we aren’t introducing any new overhead. Armed with these tools, we can move this legacy code and your team forward in preparation for the day where the file is renamed from C to CPP.\n— \nBrian Ruth\nGarmin, Ltd\nSenior Software Engineer\nbsruth@gmail.com\n\nBrian has been programming in C++ for 20+ years; working for both small and large companies on a wide variety of projects and technologies. For over a decade he worked with neuroscience researchers and created high speed acquisition, analysis and visualization software. He is currently a senior software engineer at Garmin, developing embedded devices and migrating legacy modules to C++. When he isn’t knee deep in code, he is enjoying a home brewed beer or building some furniture. He has been a volunteer at CppCon since 2015.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
