description: 'In this session we will talk about Groovy compile-time metaprogramming: the AST transformations. Those are the wizards that improve, check and manipulate your code in compile time, allowing you to keep your source nice, tide and readable. In the first part of the presentation, Baruch will show you what Groovy has to offer out of the box in this regard (and itâ€™s A LOT!) and then Sergei will teach you how to unleash the power of AST to create your own magic by writing custom AST transformations, tailored to your business needs.'
