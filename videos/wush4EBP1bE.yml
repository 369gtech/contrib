title: 'Atita Arora – Exploring the alchemy of Streaming and Solr cloud'
recordingDate: 1628149688
description: "This is a normal E-commerce use case that had been relying on earlier standalone Solr and later Master-Slave for ages.\nEverything was running smoothly with no performance glitches until one day we had this requirement to support “Unlimited Products” in our shops.\nWe were confident that things would be smooth with full reindex 2 times a day but looking at the index pipeline duration of 4+ hrs, we realized it needed some cloud magic.\nThis is where we started and transformed a normal batch index pipeline to a stream index pipeline leveraging Kafka and Redis and achieved a NRT indexing.\nAlong with that, we did not shy to give our infra a bonus upgrade from Solr 6.6.2 to Solr 8.7 and an add-on migration from the existing Master-Slave to Cloud.\nWe want to talk about our journey and important lessons learned during this process.\n\nSpeaker\nAtita Arora – https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/member/atita-arora\n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/exploring-alchemy-streaming-and-solr-cloud"
