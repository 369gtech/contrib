description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nC++ can be easy, elegant, and powerful. We achieve obvious and robust code by leveraging static typing, lexical scoping, and destructors. By understanding simple patterns for object lifecycle, and employing only a few basic practices, we build performant and scalable systems that we control, understand, and can enhance.\n\nThis session is for those new to C++ (perhaps with experience in other languages), or for experienced C++ developers interested in clear articulation for “Why C++?” in discussion with colleagues using other languages. The conclusion quite clearly demonstrates through Computer Science Best Practice that easier reasoning and better scaling is achieved through core C++ language design choices. Topics include: Value and reference semantics, the type system, lexical and dynamic scoping, programming paradigms, and general purpose versus special-purpose languages.\n— \nCharles Bay\nCharley Bay\nFort Collins, CO, USA\n\nCharley Bay has over three decades of experience using C++ in multiple regulated and high-performance fields focused on large-scale and distributed systems in performance-sensitive environments including time-sensitive processing of large data sets, performance visualization, real-time processing, low-latency, embedded, and system status and control. He is an internationally recognized technical speaker, is active in the Boost Community (including Review Manager of Boost.Outcome), and active in SG14 (Low Latency) for ISO C++ WG21. He has taught C++ and Computer Science in post-secondary environments for over a decade, and brings broad experience from multiple industry domains.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
