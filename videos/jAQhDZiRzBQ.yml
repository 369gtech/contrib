Acceptance Testing with Ephemeral Environments - Erin Krengel, Pulumi & Sean Holung, Nordstrom \n\nHow confident are you that the changes you’re about to make won’t break production? In a world of Continuous Delivery, we need to be prepared for the fact that our code is going to production. K8s makes it easy to quickly deploy applications, so building pipelines with robust quality gates is vital. There’s a lot of emphasis on this, yet how to create a solid deployment strategy isn’t clearcut.     Erin and Sean will demonstrate a pattern for acceptance testing complex architectures, which verifies a K8s app properly interacts with its infrastructure. Leveraging ephemeral environments, these tests will validate as well as document the app’s business and functional requirements.    Utilizing infrastructure as code and K8s Jobs, they will demo how to create a comprehensive acceptance test suite that allows you to continuously deploy to production. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaWE"
