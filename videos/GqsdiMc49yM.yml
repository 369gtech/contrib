description: "More and more art incorporates LEDs these days, and for good reason. They're eye-catching and can be controlled cheaply by a Raspberry Pi.\n\nThe question of course is: how do we animate them from JavaScript? The answer is more complicated than just figuring out how to turn LEDs on and off. Animating LEDs smoothly requires math!\n\nThis talk will dive into the theory and practice of using different color spaces combined with some clever math to create beautiful LED animations for your JavaScript-powered art piece."
