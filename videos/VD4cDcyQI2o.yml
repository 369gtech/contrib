description: "Unacast has spent three years in the cloud, scaling from a few thousand rows of data every month, to billions every single day. During this period the tools and techniques have stayed the same, but the architecture and use cases of the tools have evolved. Unacast's first employee and VP Engineering, Andreas Heim, will share some of the learnings from the last three years by taking you through the history of Unacast from a Data and Engineering perspective.\nAvoid these mistakes:\n\n\n- Non-scalable architectures\n- Systems bursting at its seams\n- Pricing that scales exponentially\n\nLearn how Unacast:\n\n\n- Processes 2bn rows of data on a daily basis\n- Maintains full transparency in reporting and cost\n- Manages GDPR compliance across all teams\n- Optimizes deployment and developer experience"
