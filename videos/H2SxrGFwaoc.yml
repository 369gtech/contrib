title: 'Tips for Writing PL/SQL in APEX Apps'
language: English
recordingDate: 1575398586
description: "Ah, the joy of a low-code development tool like Application Express! You point, you click, and you get beautiful, powerful websites and mobile apps. But you will also almost certainly need to write some SQL and PL/SQL to complete the functionality of that application. Sadly, there is always a tendency when writing code within a point-and-click development environment to treat that code rather casually; after all, it is not the really important (user-facing) part of the application, right? Wrong! It’s all important, and it is way too easy to create an awful mess in your otherwise elegant APEX app if you treat your SQL and PL/SQL code as “second class citizens” in terms of the attention you give to it. Not to mention bad performance or maintenance nightmares!\_\n\nIn this session, three expert APEX developers (Karen Cannell, Scott Wesley and Scott Spendolini) offer recommendations for how best to write and manage your SQL and PL/SQL in your APEX applications, with attendees chiming in - we are certain! - with their own suggestions.\n\nStarting Times\n\n3:04 - Overall introduction from Steven Feuerstein\n\n5:58 - Karen Cannell on the fundamentals: don’t reinvent the wheel, don't litter, don't do it the hard way, don't forget where you live. And don’t wing it!\n\n18:42 - Scott Wesley (using his cool app): guidance on conditions, triggers, interpreted PL/SQL, and dodging exceptions.\n\n36:55 - Scott Spendolini on creating secure views with contexts, the power of virtual private database, good-to-knows on redaction and more.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
