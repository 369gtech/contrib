They can be used for admission control, validation, and injecting sidecars into Pods. The are also one of the most challenging to operate. You have to manage and rotate a certificate, key, and root CA certificate. With some new features in SPIRE you can now automate certificate management for Webhooks like any other workload. The SPIRE issued certificates for Webhooks are tied into the same trust chain as regular workload certificates."
