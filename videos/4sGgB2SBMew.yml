language: English
recordingDate: 1400520601
description: "You have seen the stuff that FourSquare has done with spatial and you want some of that hotness for your app. But, where to start? Have no fear - in this webcast session you'll understand the pieces necessary to write your own location based app. The OpenShift platform already has MongoDB plus the spatial bits installed, so there is no need to find a VPS or convince your IT peeps to install stuff.\n\nIn this webcast session led by Steven Pousty, will start with a quick MongoDB and Node.JS application on OpenShift. Then we will load some data into MongoDB, show you how to handle spatial and finally plug in some Node.JS JavaScript code to build simple REST services to query your data. Finally we will show how to use the REST service with OpenStreetMap and Leaflet for a fully interactive map. After this webcast session, amaze your friends and supervisors with some spatial magic goodness you can control.\n\nAbout Steven Pousty\n\nSteve is a PaaS Dust Spreader (aka developer evangelist) with OpenShift. He goes around and shows off all the great work the OpenShift engineers do.
