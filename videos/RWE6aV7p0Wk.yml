title: 'Creating Enterprise Web Applications with Node.js'
recordingDate: 1529594070
description: "Node.js is a lightweight but yet capable platform for creating powerful web applications. The core of Node.js is kept small and restricted to a limited functionality that is extended by a vast ecosystem. With the right combination of packages you are able to build full-featured web applications. There is nearly no limit in features starting with simple problems such as authentication or logging over web interfaces with REST or GraphQL to a whole application based on a microservices architecture. In this talk Sebastian Springer introduces the audience to some commonly used packages and shows how to use them by example.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developers playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
