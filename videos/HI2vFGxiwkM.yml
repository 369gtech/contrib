description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nModern web is evolving so fast that it's challenging to make the right decisions about a project not only for the web devs, but also solution architects. Putting jokes about JS frameworks aside, most of the major tools are built around certain patterns and architectural decisions that one might not grasp at the first sight. It's often very different than the classical Object-Oriented and Imperative Paradigms. Many of the tools that pop up each week do solve issues with performance, design and complexity, often by introducing IoC or making the code declarative. And sometimes, by introducing new complexity.\n\nIn this talk I will walk through the most important concepts that modern JavaScript ecosystem relies on. These include: different strategies for view re-renders, view-as-a-function, reactivity on the UI, push-based control-flow, handling client application state and splitting webapps into microfrontends. Let's NOT talk about the frameworks, but the concepts they are built upon.\n\nIf you're keen on webdev, this talk is for you. If you're interested in architecture and different ways to tackle problems, this talk is also for you."
