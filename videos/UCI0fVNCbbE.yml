recordingDate: 1502056633
description: "We look at different approaches to building applications and discuss the merits. Joining Anne on the panel will be:\n\nSebastian Goasguen - Author of the Docker Cookbook, and creater of Kubeless, a serverless framework for Kubernetes. Sebastian bridges the worlds of containers and serverless in a way few others do.\n\nAnna Doubkov√° - Senior Developer at Pizzahut, actively using both serverless and containers today. Nothing like working at the coal face to understand the challenges of a particular stack.\n\nGreg Cope - Head of Platform and Security at the Financial Times. Greg has to weigh up the merits of these approaches whilst meeting the needs of the Financial Times users.\n\nKassandra Perch - Developer Advocate for IOPipe. In their role at IOPipe, and previous role at Auth0, few people have the exposure to organisations deriving value from serverless platforms as Kassandra."
