description: "UAA Feature Updates and 2017 Roadmap [I] - Sree Tummidi, Pivotal   \n\nIn the past year, multiple features have been introduced in UAA which have accelerated its adoption in the CF ecosystem.\n\nOpenID Connect Enhancements: \nMultiple enhancements around OpenID Connect have been introduced for UAA as an Identity Provider and Relying Party including support for discovery profile, custom user claims in id_token and /userinfo , account chooser, authentication method reference and much more.\n\nKeys and Secrets Rotation: \nAt last year’s CF Summit Justin Smith introduced his vision for Cloud Native Security with three R’s(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUXpz0Dni50). Now UAA supports canary style rotation of signing keys and OAuth clients secrets and will soon add support for rotation of SAML Keys. \n\nOpaque Tokens: \nUAA since its inception has supported JSON Web Tokens which has the advantage of offline validation. However with the the addition of stateful opaque tokens UAA now supports on-demand token revocation.\n\nIn addition to this Sree Tummidi will also provide a sneak peek of the UAA roadmap for FY 2017 with features like Multi-Factor Authentication, additional token exchange flows and fine grained authorization support.\n\nSree Tummidi\nPivotal\nStaff Product Manager\nSan Francisco\nSree Tummidi is the Product Manager for UAA (User Account and Authentication Service) on Open Source Cloud Foundry since the past 2 .5 Years and drives the Identity and Access Management products for Pivotal.
