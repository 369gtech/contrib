description: "The modularization of the Java SE Platform in JDK 9 will bring many benefits but also many changes. Existing code that uses only official Java SE Platform APIs and supported JDK-specific APIs should continue to work without change. Code that uses certain deprecated features or any JDK-internal APIs is likely to break, however. This session shows you how to prepare existing code for JDK 9 and takes a look at new features designed to help migration, such as JDK versioning, multi-release JARs, and enhanced deprecation.\n\nBlog: https://blogs.oracle.com/java/gear-up-for-java-se-9"
