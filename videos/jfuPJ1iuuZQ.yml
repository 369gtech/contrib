description: 'ZEIT Now enables deploying any serverless application instantly. With just one command (''now'' or ''git push'') you get a URL back with your working deployment, which takes advantage of a global CDN network that automatically serves your static assets (such as a static frontend) and invokes lambdas on-demand. Deploying is faster. The resulting websites and applications load faster. Failures are minimized or flat-out disappear. No monitoring is required. It all sounds like heaven... except serverless is different. This talk will explore how we are helping developers get all these benefits and migrate from a serverful world without a hassle.'
