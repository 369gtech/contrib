title: 'Henri Helvetica The Shape of the Web at Mobile Era 2019'
recordingDate: 1574093775
description: "“The Shape Of The Web” is about both accomplishments and challenges that lay in the past and present of the web. In his opening keynote, Henri Helvetica looks back in time and forward into the future, at the technologies the web has employed, but also at the future of its employed technologists. He remembers the textual academic web of the early 1990s and the sea change that came when a browser allowed for both text and images to be displayed in the viewport. And he identifies some of today’s challenges in ensuring that the “gateway to the riches of the internet” remains open and inclusive for all.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nHenri is a freelance developer who has turned his interests to a passionate mix of site performance engineering and pinches of user experience, which have a considerable impact on the mobile landscape. When not reading the deluge of daily research docs and case studies. Henri can be found contributing back to the community: Toronto Web Performance Group meetup + SPOTLIGHT: PERFORMANCE conference co-organizer, curating content for conferences or volunteering his time for lunch and learns at various boot camps - all with a radiant smile. Otherwise, he’s focusing on running the fastest 5k possible (surprise surprise).\n\nAbout Mobile Era\nMobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo. We're passionate about developing mobile apps and want to see a kick-ass event in Oslo for people like ourselves. The organizing committee consists of developers who are also active in organizing open events, conferences and meetups in the Oslo developer community.\n\nOur topics: iOS / Android, Mobile web / PWA, Cross-platform / JS-to-Native, IoT / Hardware, Mobile UX / Accessibility\n\nFollow us on:\n\nWebsite: mobileera.rocks\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mobileeraconf\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mobileeraconf/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mobileeraconf"
