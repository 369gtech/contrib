recordingDate: 1505130034
description: "These days IT is all about speed. Many methods are being introduced in IT to facilitate this such as SAFe, DevOps etc. Typically, these radically change the process of working and in doing so introduce new toolchains that automate the delivery of results. \n\nWhat we set our self out to create with the IT4IT initiative was once and for all to create a complete toolchain across all of IT that allow you to gain insight across ALL of IT and create speed and agility across all service delivery, not just in-house software development. \n\nIn this talk we will explore how IT4IT is focused on the information model across IT. It focus on the big picture value creating steps in IT and address the need to work in a hybrid environment with many supplier, with legacy and new services and with a rich service hierarchy. \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
