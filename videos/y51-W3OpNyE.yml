description: "You may remember the first versions of WhatsApp and their terrible, insecure encryption. Back then— and before Snowden's revelation — privacy wasn't a major concern. In 2019, WhatsApp and a number of other messaging apps are using end-to-end encryption, or encryption that doesn't allow relay servers to see your messages. \n\nThe situation for IoT, machine-to-machine, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications is a bit like mobile messaging in 2012: at best connections are encrypted using TLS from clients to server, but end-to-end encryption is almost inexistent. Shouldn't business-critical and privacy-sensitive data have the same level of protection as WhatsApp messages? We believe so, and will describe how to design and deploy strong end-to-end encryption for IoT networks, based on our experience developing such a product.\n\nThe speech took on 9th May 2019 on Crypto&Security Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n\n#Cybersecurity #Crypto&Security #Tech"
