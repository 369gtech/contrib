description: "Konark Modi\n\n\n\nOrganizations with digital products that lack even the most basic data security practices are living in a utopian world where people leave their safe open and never expect a burglar to walk in.\n\nWith the advent of SaaS, companies are relying more on more on third-party services for CDNs, analytics, recommendations, loyalty, advertisements, email marketing etc. But not so much effort is being put in ensuring what data is being shared with these third-parties.\n\nAs an example:\n\nIt is a common practice to load fonts from third-party CDNs. But is it necessary for the website to share sensitive data like users' booking IDs in order to load the fonts from a CDN?\n\nThese data leaks are bad in itself, but in the GDPR-era, companies could face huge penalties for such accidental leaks.\n\nAt PyCon UK I would like to showcase our work, on how we are creating Babel: a Network analyses framework built on top of http://mitmproxy.org/. Think about this as Local-Sheriff but outside the browser.\n\nIt cuts down all the clutter of using network inspecting tools and provides a search interface to users which shows the ugly world of data collection, third-parties and how using your app, sensitive data is being shared with companies.\n\nEverything is done locally, and no data is sent out to our servers. (Actually they don't even exist)\n\nInsights that the Babel presents: * Hostnames that application connects to. * Classifies them as First-Party and Third-parties used by the application. * Using data from open-source project WhoTracksMe to map third-party domains to company names. * Local search interface to look for PII and how it is being shared with different companies. * URLs being shared with third-parties via network headers / query parameters. * URLs that contain sensitive data, are they behind a login page or not. * Values like EmailID etc being shared with third-parties. * Configuration to flag, pre-defined list of values, hostname that are not supposed to be transferred. * Identifiers which do not look like PII, but can be used for tracking the user on the internet. Example cookie synching, long-term user identifier. * Adoption of basic security headers via observatory.mozilla.org\n\nTakeaways for the audience: * Common pitfalls while using third-parties and how apps end up accidentally leaking sensitive data. * How can they audit partners before implementing them in production. * How they can audit their own apps and bring in privacy checks as part of their software life cycle."
