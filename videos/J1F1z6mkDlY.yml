title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Realtime PHP using websockets'
recordingDate: 1493426796
description: "Websockets give real-time access to your PHP application, facilitating data transfer between the browser and the server. With the popularity of Javascript libraries like Node.js and Meteor, websockets are Hot Stuff™. But just because they’re popular with the Javascript crowd doesn’t mean PHP applications are left out in the cold.\n\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss some use cases for websockets as well as strategies for implementing websockets into your PHP application. We will look at the most popular websocket protocols and specifically an overview of the WAMP protocol (the protocol, not the stack - http://wamp-proto.org) and the PHP Ratchet library. Additionally, we’ll talk about WAMPv2 and Thruway. At the end of this talk, you’ll have a better sense of what websockets are, how they work, and how to use them in your application.\n\nSlides:\_https://truedeveloper.co//wp-content/uploads/2016/08/The-websockets-awaken-1.pdf"
