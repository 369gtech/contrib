Seemingly straightforward operations such as counting, set membership and set cardinality become either extremely slow or prohibitively expensive to do using traditional methods.\n\nHelp is at hand, however: probabilistic techniques are both fascinating and extremely useful. By sacrificing a predictable amount of accuracy, we can perform operations at scales we never thought possible, and fast! We'll introduce approaches such as Bloom filters for set membership, count-min sketch for frequency in streams, and HyperLogLog for cardinality. No maths PhD is required.\n\nWe'll look at the before and after effects of using these techniques in real-world scenarios, and present the libraries that you can go away and play with right now."
