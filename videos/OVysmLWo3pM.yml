description: "Managing ML Models @ Scale - Intuit’s ML Platform\n\nSrivathsan Canchi and Tobias Wenzel, Intuit Inc.\n\nAt Intuit, machine learning models are derived from huge, sensitive data sets that are continuously evolving, which in turn requires continuous model training and tuning with a high level of security and compliance. Intuit’s Machine Learning Platform provides Model LifeCycle management capabilities that are scalable and secure using GitOps, SageMaker, Kubernetes and Argo Workflows.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll go over the model management problem statement at Intuit, data science/MLE needs vs Intuit’s enterprise needs, provide an introduction to our model management interface and self serve capabilities. This talk will cover aspects of our platform such as feature management and processing, bill backs, collaborations and separation of operational concerns between platform and model. These capabilities of the platform have enabled model publishing velocity increases of over 200%, and this talk will illustrate how we got there.\n\nView the full OpML '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/opml20/program"
