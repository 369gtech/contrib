description: "Since the beginning of the year, Apache Flink has made big headway in the unification of its stream- and batch processing capabilities. This effort is a major milestone in the bigger vision of building a stream processor that can form the backbone for both unified batch and stream data processing as well as for event-driven applications in a common way.\n\nWith the batch/streaming unification well underway, we want to look again at the other end of the spectrum: How can Stream Processing help to build modern event-driven applications:\n\n- What challenges do application developers face when using stream processors as their framework?\n\n- What building blocks and tools are still missing to build complex applications?\n\n- How does stream processing fit into the major trends in the application development space, like serverless architectures?\n\n- How does stream processing compare to other approaches (req/resp, actors, etc.) and what can those approaches learn from each other?\n\nFor more information about Stateful Functions, please visit: statefun.io"
