description: "This presentation will look into a Scrum Master role as proposed by the Scrum framework. At first - role's essentials in Scrum and shortly its similarities with identical roles in other methods, then overview of this role's different interpretations across the industry and my own experience in that.\n\nWhy this topic?\n\nScrum Master is a central role in an environment that wants to become Agile. While in the first place Scrum Master is serving a team, he or she is also serving an organization. Scrum Master is a soft role more than a hard one (like developer) and therefore includes coaching too. In my experience and research, above aspects are often under-estimated, which have significant impact on the overall work productivity of an organization that adopts or has adopted Agile. I would like to try clearing things out around this role together with you in ADR 2015!"
