description: "Design is the process of creating artifacts that solve problems. In the case of software, design is the creation of code entities that implement a feature. After trying up-front design for a while, we realized that we can take advantage of the fundamental property of code: we can change it very fast. We realized we can do incremental design, and the most popular way to do it is TDD. Ask anyone who does design (graphical, building, industrial etc) and they will tell you it involves exploring alternative solutions. For some reason, I've rarely heard about exploring alternatives when we program. Those who do explore do it informally or with design sketches. TDD is however an interesting technique to use for exploration. In this talk I will show a few patterns of design exploration using TDD. I've discovered them with the teams I helped and during community events, mostly during the 30+ code retreats I've facilitated or attended.\n\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
