title: 'Continuous Intelligence: Keeping your AI Application in Production - Emily Gorcenski & Arif Wider'

description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcporto.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\nIt is already challenging to transition a machine learning model or AI system from the research space to production, and maintaining that system alongside ever-changing data is an even greater challenge. In software engineering, Continuous Delivery practices have been developed to ensure that developers can adapt, maintain, and update software and systems cheaply and quickly, enabling release cycles on the scale of hours or days instead of weeks or months. Nevertheless, in the data science world Continuous Delivery is rarely been applied holistically.\n\nThis is partly due to different workflows: data scientists regularly work on whole sets of hypotheses, whereas software engineers work more linearly even when evaluating multiple implementation alternatives. Therefore, existing software engineering practices cannot be applied as-is to machine learning projects. Learn how we used our expertise in both fields to adapt practices and tools to allow for Continuous Intelligenceâ€“the practice of delivering AI applications continuously."
