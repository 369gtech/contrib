description: "\"Securely executing Python machine learning models with distroless images at ING\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Osaka / Samarkand [PyData track]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Thomas Kluiters\n\nExecuting machine learning models in a production environment can be tricky, especially at a major bank where compliance and risk are carefully taken into account. In this talk I explain how, we, at ING (a large bank operating on global scale), execute our Python models in a production environment by building minimal Docker images for python versions.\n\nI will first talk about the possible security risks of running any docker container in a production environment. Then I will talk about ways in which we can make Docker containers more secure by building minimal docker images for Python. Finally I will explain how these docker images are used in practice to serve machine learning models at ING.\n\nPrerequisites:\n- Some basic knowledge of Docker can be helpful\n- Some basic understanding of security can be helpful\n\nGoals:\n- Understand the security risks of running docker containers\n- Know how to make docker images more secure\n- How to build secure model serving docker images\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
