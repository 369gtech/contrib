description: "Mutability is something we’re quite used to in Java. Sharing is a good thing, but shared mutability is pure devil’s work. If we remove shared mutability, all the problems of concurrency will go away. In practice, however, it’s hard to completely get rid of shared mutability. This is where software transactional memory (STM) comes in with managed shared mutable variables. This presentation takes an example-driven approach to dive deep into STM, look at what it has to offer, explore various implementations, and discuss how we can design concurrent applications without any explicit locks.\n\n\nAuthor:\nVenkat Subramaniam\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., and an instructional professor at the University of Houston.\n\nHe has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with agile practices on their software projects.\n\nVenkat is a (co)author of multiple books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer. His latest book is Functional Programming in Java: Harnessing the Power of Java 8 Lambda Expressions.\nView more trainings by Venkat Subramaniam at https://www.parleys.com/author/venkat-subramaniam\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
