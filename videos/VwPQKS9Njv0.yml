description: 'TLS is easy, PKI is hard. Learn about Go primitives for generating certificate hierarchies, instrumenting mTLS, hardware backed keys, and public infrastructure like Let’s Encrypt and Certificate Transparency. Along the way we’ll discuss roots of trust for automated issuance, nuances of revocation, and encourage you to roll your own PKI.'
