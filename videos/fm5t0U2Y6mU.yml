description: "Python meetup by Point Nine 23.10.2018\n\nPythonâ€™s data processing capabilities along with the elastic infrastructure provided by Amazon AWS has leveled the financial tech field between the big players and the small. For the first time we had access to an infrastructure previously only available to the biggest players and allowed us to enter and compete in a market previously not open to smaller players.\n\nThis is a talk on how Point Nine has leveraged Python and AWS to enter into a complex fintech space, that of trade processing and regulatory reporting, processing millions of trades per day at a global scale."
