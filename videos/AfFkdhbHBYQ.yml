Itâ€™s increasingly an intimate companion, a go-between for our relationships, and a trusted friend helping us to develop new capabilities. Even so, it can be a struggle to live harmoniously with technology. So far, technologyâ€™s EQ hasnâ€™t caught up to its IQ. Technology is aligned with productivity, not attuned to our inner world. More than designing machines that sense emotional signals, itâ€™s about shaping technology that make us feel more human. Join Pamela to consider how we might design technology that is attuned to the emotional side of experience. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/amuse"
