description: "Long waiting time to get medical attention, population is constantly getting older and more and more of care is carried out in homes than hospitals. By today's systems or lack of systems, nursing is done too early (by the hour) or too late (when something already have happened) and not when needed. i.e. nursing needs are planned by the hour whether needed or not, giving the result that resources are used when an incident or accident already has occurred. This means that already tensed resources are stretched even further instead of using them preventive. \n\n\n\nWith connected health devices we can realize value of sensor data, through smart sensors communicated to nursing surveillance, activity monitoring and more. Perhaps the the future includes smart diapers, leaving-bed-sensors, door helpers, medicine monitors?\n\nAshok kumar Bandaru is CEO at Techsource IoT, with more than 10 years’ of experience mobile handsets and embedded devices. He currently focuses on the field of Industrial, E-Health and Energy, building IoT platforms, sensor implants, low power sensors.\n______________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
