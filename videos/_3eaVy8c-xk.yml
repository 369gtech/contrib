title: 'Machine learning algorithms, choosing the correct algorithm for your problem - Joakim Lehn'
recordingDate: 1535457741
description: 'When I started out exploring machine learning I often faced the problem of choosing the most appropriate algorithm for my specific problem. In this presentation I will try to explain basic concepts and give you an intuititive approach to using different kinds of machine learning algorithms for different tasks. By the end of this presentation youâ€™ll know what category of algorithms is most suited for your problem.'
