description: "In todayâ€™s session, Lau Llobet who is a Software Craftsman at Codurance, gives an interesting talk about how we can evaluate any code's quality and the value it potentially has for your business\n\nDuring the first part of this webinar, Lau shows us how to apply the term cohesion to our software design from a practical technical perspective. This is followed by a business approach to the code value and Q&A with the webinar's participants.\n\nThank you Lau for this amazing talk! We look forward to see how you keep working on the subject matter. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
