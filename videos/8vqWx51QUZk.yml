description: "Speaker: Kamesh Sampath\n\nWith Kubernetes gaining so much popularity over the years since it was introduced, it has now become the new Application Server. With most enterprises starting to embrace Serverless architectures, developers wished to have a platform like Kubernetes but with capability to handle serverless workloads. As a result, Knative(Snow White) was born in Kubernetes Fairyland…\n\nThe story starts with how Knative was born, with details explaining how it uses the Kubernetes primitives to provide a platform that can run serverless workloads. With many Serverless platforms based on Kubernetes, developers are left with question which one to choose and why. That’s exactly what the next part of the session is going talk about with demos. The Snow White tale is never complete without the dwarves, but in this story I have only three dwarves -- Build, Serving and Eventing; the building blocks of Knative -- The last part of the story is packed with demonstrations to show how our dwarves helps the Snow White to handle the serverless workloads in an efficient and optimal way.\n\nSince \"Knative\" was announced by Google in 2018 there has been a lot of buzz and excitement around Serverless and Knative. As a developer I always had the following questions around the subject:\n1. Where is the \"get started\" for me ?\n2. Who will explain the concepts and how they are related ?\n3. Is there good demo(s) available ?\nI did spend lot of time in getting answers for these questions, which I wish to share with with me fellow developer community\n\nAbout Speaker:\n\nKamesh is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, as part of his additional role as Director of Developer Experience at Red Hat -- he actively educates on Kubernetes/OpenShift, Servicemesh and Serverless technologies --.
