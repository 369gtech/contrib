recordingDate: 1579227231
description: "Sven Dowideit\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/165/\n\nIn my day job, I'm a DevOp. In my almost non-existent spare time, I build hardware and software for immersive theater.\r\n\r\nWe just did the final chapter of the current \"Game\" at Woodford, and to add to the magic of the festival wide user lead adventure, we have interactive installations that become a part of the story.\r\n\r\nInside, is a horrific mess of raspberry pi's, esp8266 and esp32's, all chattering away on wifi, blinken lights, movement and sound - and that's what I'll talk about.\r\n\r\nThe failures are always epic, the successes mindblowing, and the smoke, everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee https://woodfordfolkfestival.com/programme/the-game/\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 10:45:00 2020 at Room 5"
