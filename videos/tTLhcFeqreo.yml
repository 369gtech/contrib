description: "From Velocity Santa Clara 2015: \"Addressing operational challenges: Building a faster, highly available data tier for active workloads\"\n\nThe complexity of managing today’s databases can be daunting for even the most experienced operations teams. According to Forrester, 42 percent of database decision makers admit they struggle to manage the NoSQL solutions deployed in their data tier. There’s currently no “one size fits all” data store – many enterprises are faced with using a polyglot of databases to handle their active workloads. This poses enormous integration and operational challenges not only for active workloads, but for passive workloads and backend analysis as well. In this session, Dave McCrory, CTO of Basho Technologies, will discuss steps organizations can take to solve these challenges and how innovations in distributed systems can simplify today’s complex management systems.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Basho.\n\nAbout Dave McCrory (Basho Technologies):\nDave McCrory is the CTO of Basho Technologies. Most recently, McCrory served as SVP of engineering at Warner Music Group, where he led over 100 engineers building the company’s new Digital Services Platform, based on an open source enterprise platform as a service. His extensive experience in the cloud and virtualization industry included positions as a senior architect in Cloud Foundry while at VMware and as a cloud architect at Dell. Earlier in his career, he experienced successful exits for two companies he founded: Hyper9 (acquired by SolarWinds) and Surgient (acquired by Quest Software). McCrory currently holds nine patented technologies in virtualization, cloud and systems management as a co–inventor. He is well known for inventing the concept and coining the term “data gravity,” which states that as data accumulates, there is a greater likelihood that additional services and applications will be attracted to this data and add to it."
