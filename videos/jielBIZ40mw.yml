description: "RubyConf 2019 - Sorbet: A type checker for Ruby 3 you can use today! by Jake Zimmerman & Dmitry Petrashko\n\nIn June we open-sourced Sorbet, a fast, powerful type checker designed for Ruby. In the 6 months since, tons of things have improved! We’ve built quality editor tools like jump-to-def and seen many contributions from a growing community. Within Stripe, we've used Sorbet to drive code quality via measurable, concrete indicators.\n\nWe’ll share these improvements and give an update on our collaboration with Matz and the Ruby 3 Types working group. Suitable for anyone using Ruby—no familiarity with Sorbet needed! Come follow in the footsteps of the many companies already using Sorbet.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
