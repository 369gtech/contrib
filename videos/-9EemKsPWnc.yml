recordingDate: 1595315011
description: "by Erwin Hoffmann (feh)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.1309/dns_djbdnscurve.webm\n\nThe fehQlibs and djbdnscurve6 provide both a DNS library which support IPv6 LLU addresses. The inclusion and use of IPv6 LLU addresses is discussed. While the typical Unix /etc/resolv.conf is applied system-wide and the Microsoft Window's pendent works interface-dependent, here application specific DNS settings can be used.\nOverview:\n1. Background and heritage on fehQlibs and djbdnscurve6\n2. Application specific DNS resolver settings\n3. Integration of IPv6 LLU addresses - benefits\n4. Integration of IPv6 LLU addresses - recipe\n5. Outlook and future challenges\n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 10:45:00"
