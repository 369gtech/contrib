description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/wilto/responsible-responsive-images-1\n\nThe goal of a “responsive images” solution is to deliver image sources optimized for the end user’s context, rather than serving the largest potentially necessary image to everyone whether or not they’ll see any benefit. Unfortunately, this hasn’t proven to be quite so simple in practice as it seems to be on the surface.\n\nSmall screens should get smaller images, sure, and large screens should get larger ones. Naturally, only high-resolution displays should qualify for high-resolution images, but what if that user has limited bandwidth available? Would the low-resolution image be preferable—and at what point? Further, should we developers be making those kinds of decisions *for* the user in the first place?\n\nDuring this talk we’ll discuss the road to a standardized solution to the surprisingly thorny issue of responsive images, what that solution—or solutions—might look like, and some of the scripts and techniques we can use in our work today.\n\nAbout Mat: https://twitter.com/wilto\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl\n\nVideography generously sponsored by Mirabeau: https://www.mirabeau.nl"
