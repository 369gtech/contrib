description: "Video with transcript included: http://bit.ly/35T23MY\n\nChris Gillum explores two stateful programming models: workflows and actors. He discusses how they can simplify development and how they enable stateful and long-running application patterns within ephemeral, Serverless compute environments. He explains why he is making a big bet on these programming models in the Azure Functions service.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon San Francisco 2019: http://bit.ly/38sivWf\n\nThe next QCon is QCon London 2020 – March 2-4, 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq\n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQ’s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#Serverless #Workflows #Actors"
