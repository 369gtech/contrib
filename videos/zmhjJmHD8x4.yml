description: "Error Budgets and Risks\n\nMarc Alvidrez, Google\n\nStriving for Imperfection: Using an error budget to move fast without compromising high reliability\n\nYou may assume Site Reliability Engineers aim to build systems that never go down. What that fails to realize is that 100% reliability is almost never the goal. Instead, our task is to trade off reliability against the many other goals we have for our services. SREs want to provide great service to end users and customers, and also have the flexibility to change the systems often and quickly. We want to ensure that the queries and the revenue keep flowing, and do so as efficiently as possible, provisioning as little excess as necessary to deliver good service. Taking an engineering approach to meeting these goals means we need to make these tradeoffs measurable, and this is where error budgets come in. Your error budget is a measure of risk, it is the amount of headroom you have above your SLA. Being smart about how you manage and spend this error budget is one of the best tools that SRE has to meet the various contending goals that services at Internet scale present.\n\nView the full SREcon15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon15/program"
