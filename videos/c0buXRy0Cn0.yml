title: 'Not Your Grandfather''s C++ - Phil Nash'
recordingDate: 1563208323
description: "C++ has been around since the 80s, and is based on a legacy that stretches back to the 70s, 60s and earlier (depending on how you measure it). A remarkable heritage, but given the quantity and quality of \"modern\" programming languages available today is it really relevant anymore? Isn't it just an overly complex behemoth that should be consigned to a museum?\n\nThis talk gives a tour of Modern C++ - starting from C++11, through C++14 and today's C++17 - then on to what is coming in C++20 and likely in C++23 and beyond. C++ is far from stagnant and, despite some warts, is moving forward at an impressive pace while staying true to its founding principles of zero cost abstractions.\n\nWhether you've never touched a line of C++, or are using it today, you're sure to get something from following this journey.\n\nPhil Nash\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/philsquared/\n\nPhil is the author of the C++ test framework, Catch2, and the composable command-line parser, Clara. As Developer Advocate at JetBrains he's involved with CLion, AppCode and ReSharper C++. More generally he's an advocate for good testing practices, TDD and using the type system and functional techniques to reduce complexity and increase correctness. He's previously worked in Finance and Mobile as well as an independent consultant and coach specialising in TDD on iOS."
