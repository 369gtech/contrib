recordingDate: 1549545055
description: "There is a lot of talk about AI these days, but how does someone actually go about transforming the concept from an abstract narrative into something that produces actual business results?\nWhat are some good ways to get started with AI in an existing business?\nHow can we use AI to optimise already-running business processes?\nHow can we prove the efficacy of AI projects in terms of business value?\nIn this talk, Amer Mohammed will provide us with some very hands-on and actionable answers to those questions, drawing on his experience from Stena Line.\n\nAmer Mohammed made a name for himself as CIO of Stena Line, where he established cognitive technology as a cornerstone of the company's business strategy. During his time at Stena, he implemented several AI-based projects that translated directly into increased profits and reduced costs. Currently, he is the CDO of Cap Gemini, a major consulting firm in Sweden.\n_____________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
