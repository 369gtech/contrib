description: 'Micronaut is a brand new framework designed from the ground for the microservices environment. It provides compile-time dependency injection to minimize the memory overhead known from Spring. As it was created by the Grails team, Micronaut comes with easy to use command line interface. Java, Groovy and Kotlin languages are supported. Thanks to minimal startup time, you can deploy new instance in less than a second and you don''t need any special infrastructure for you integration tests - you just spin up an embedded server and you are ready to go. MIcronaut is a perfect fit for serverless functions such as AWS Lambda.'
