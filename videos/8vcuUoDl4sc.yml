description: "The journey of developing and launching new digital products into the wild is a rollercoaster ride of risk and reward. What if risk could be reduced each time you hit an unknown? Prototyping your ideas and testing them on real or potential customers is the best way to reduce that risk. Youâ€™ll save time, money and your teams sanity. And ultimately build a product your customers will thank you for (with money of course).\n\nDayton Pereira\nFounder, Product Designer, Signal UX\nhttps://twitter.com/daytonp"
