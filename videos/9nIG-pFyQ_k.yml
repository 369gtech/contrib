description: "How do you deploy code with speed and confidence?\n\nDone well, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) is a total game-changer. It allows us to get new solutions into the hands of users as efficiently as possible, with minimal risk.\n\nThis sounds great, but it’s important to remember that CI/CD isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. You need to consider the unique characteristics of your organization – infrastructure, team culture, and internal knowledge – when designing and implementing a strategy for faster shipping.\n\nIn this panel, engineering leaders discuss the most important factors to improve the performance of your organization. We will explore what a successful CI/CD strategy actually looks like the tools and processes you’ll need, and hear real-world examples of how to achieve CI/CD success.\n\nKey takeaways\n\n- Understand the fundamentals of a successful CI/CD strategy\n- Build a toolkit to confidently ship code with speed and security\n- Nurture a culture of sustainable delivery to support and motivate engineers\n- Identify skills gaps and training needs to keep the organization moving forward"
