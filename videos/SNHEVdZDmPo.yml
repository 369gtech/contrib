description: "Audio with web technologies; it doesn't always have to be annoying background music that starts playing when you open a new tab.\n\nThe Web Audio API is extremely powerful, we can create sounds, load them, analyse them, modify them in an insane amount of different ways. This is an in-depth talk into the different methods of the API and not just the details, but how best we could use them in our development work flow. What techniques really come in useful when loading and manipulating sounds? We'll outline just that so you can go away feeling more confident knowing you that yes you can use audio!\n\nAnd if all that wasn't enough, there's just a sprinkling of MIDI to go on top.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/Rumyra/Talk-Web-Audio\nAbout Ruth: https://ruthjohn.com\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
