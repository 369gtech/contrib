description: "Envoy on Windows: Use-cases, roadmap, and more - Sunjay Bhatia, David Schott\n\nReady to dive a little deeper into the world of Envoy on Windows? Learn about the ongoing efforts to enable the vast ecosystem of Windows applications to leverage the Envoy proxy, what it can do now, and what is coming next. Contributors have been hard at work bringing Windows platform support to Envoy. The project hopes to enable the vast ecosystem of Windows application architectures to leverage Envoyâ€™s rich feature set and benefit from the vibrant Envoy open source community. This talk will show how Envoy users can start to use and evaluate Envoy on Windows, demonstrate how Envoy can be used to enable cloud-native applications on Windows, and discuss the roadmap ahead."
