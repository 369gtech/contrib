description: 'Supercomputer-worthy memory and core counts have much more approachable to mere mortals. ''What can it do'' is the obvious follow up question, leaving ''mining'' and ''mirkoservices'' aside One use-case is simulation, especially based around agents. I will talk about agent based modelling, from the point of view of a developer building the framework, focusing on some interesting, non-trivial or plain old surprising experiences I''m getting building a JVM-based agent-based modelling SDK at Simudyne. We will talk performance, distributed systems, multithreading and SDK design. We will not cover statistics or modelling, but I''ll be happy to talk in person.'
