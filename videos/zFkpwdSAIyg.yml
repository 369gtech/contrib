Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nHow to improve customer engagement and service delivery in the connected age.\n\nDigital transformation is not a buzzword. It’s the promise that your organization can reach new heights by leveraging digital to provide a superior customer experience and optimize your team’s efforts in doing so. At the same time, there are a vast amount of organizations who believe a digital presence alone is enough to meet customer expectations and keep your organization at the forefront of the connected economy. The general approach is typically to just make sure deliverables exist: we have a responsive website; we listen to customers on our social channels and help lines. But this approach does not ask the right questions of how you can drive consumer engagement and retention, and make sure your team is focused on solving the right problems in the most effective manner.\n\nTo do so, every organization needs to align their digital ecosystem with their customer journey. This talk will introduce the process for and key benefits of aligning your digital ecosystem and team efforts to your customer’s journey, including highlighting how you’ll find new business and growth opportunities, while finding those key insights in how to better connect and provide value to your customers.\n\nLee Dale\nCEO, Say Yeah!\nhttp://twitter.com/smack416\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
