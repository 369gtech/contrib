description: "You have heard of React, right? Well, it’s not reactive at all. This talk will show you how to think in a Reactive way, how to properly use streams and improve your apps. We’ll talk about some great alternatives to React to writing frontend apps. There is something cool about functional programming, pure functions and pure data streams that you should know.\nWhat is reactive programming? A lot of people have this question. Thinking in a reactive way is not that hard but it takes some time to understand all things and to change the way you look at development. In this talk we should learn everything about reactive programming and how can it help us to create better JavaScript apps. We’ll also see some good examples and also talk about functional programming."
