description: "The blockchain technology has been with us for some time now. Next year we will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first commonly available blockchain implementation that is called Bitcoin. Yet few people know the magic behind it. The best way to learn something is to build it.\n\nIn this session we will walk through the implementation of a simplistic blockchain in Python and see how all the pieces fit together. Seeing something so simple, yet powerful in the works, unfolds the ingenuity of the whole solution and allows to fuller grasp the next steps in the evolution of the blockchain.\n\n\nThe speech was given on 2018-05-23 at infoShare 2018 (Tech Plus I Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
