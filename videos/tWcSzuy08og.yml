title: 'Heidi Helfand - A Practical Introduction to Coaching'
recordingDate: 1557953910
description: "Please note that Heidi's session included a couple of interactive exercises. Since participation was an important element of these exercises we cut them out from the final version of the video to make it more dynamic for those, who can only watch Heidi's talk on our Youtube channel.\n\nListening is power. By tuning in and applying self-management and directed curiosity, you can help others solve their own problems instead of telling them what to do, giving them the tools they need to be leaders in your organization rather than order takers. Heidi Helfand leads a crash course in coaching conversations, helping you become a better and more empowering leader, coworker, and friend. Heidi first makes the case for focused attention, listening, and awareness—skills that help people feel “heard.” You’ll then learn specific strategies like the three levels of listening, paraphrasing, and mirroring and discover how you can draw people out by asking powerful, open-ended questions. You’ll be able to apply these lessons to all areas of your life. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/keJX6dzr85d with the Ustream Mobile App"
