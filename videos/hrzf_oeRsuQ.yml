description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nIstio Cookbook: Kiali Recipe - Lucas Ponce, Red Hat\n\nIstio provides a rich feature set, including service discovery, traffic management, extended security, observability (including telemetry and distributed tracing), rolling releases and resiliency. All these features are very powerful but on the other hand they add more configuration to manage and more information to process on top of a standard kubernetes cluster. Kiali is a management console for Istio. It provides dashboards, observability and lets you operate your mesh with robust configuration and validation capabilities. In this session we will run several scenarios learning Istio capabilities in a in a visual manner on a multiple namespace demo application."
