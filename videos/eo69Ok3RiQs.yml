title: 'Tracing the black box of serverless - Matt Williams'
recordingDate: 1554299096
description: "Serverless is often seen as a bit of a black box. You write your functions, and then they are invoked on a platform on which you have no real visibility. Sure, there are metrics and logs, but figuring out where the bottlenecks are is a huge challenge. Understanding how the function relates to the other resources used is just as interesting. On the AWS platform, one underused tool to help solve these problems is X-Ray. In this talk, I will show you how you can use X-Ray to: * troubleshoot some of the more ornery issues with Lambda * get a better understanding of how your functions are invoked * and work with all three pillars of observability to provide complete visibility into your serverless infrastructure.\n\nWebsite: https://boston.serverlessdays.io"
