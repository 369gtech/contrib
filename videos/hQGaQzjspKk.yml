title: 'The impact of the GDPR by Michae?l Demey'

description: "Do you know what it means to be GDPR compliant? Do you know what the GDPR is? Developers answering \"no\" will have hard times ahead of them. The GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation, is one of the most important legislations introduced by the EU in the past decade. It describes what personal data is, what companies are allowed to do with that data and, more importantly, what citizens are allowed to do. A lot of software development and products involve the use of personal data and this falls under the GDPR. Developers and software companies not aware of what the GDPR stands for, may risk heavy fines if the software they write is non-compliant. This is not a scare session. In this session we will walk through what the GDPR is, what it affects and what not, and what steps people should take to be on the way to being compliant. I promise to keep the legal jargon to a minimum.\n\n# Michaël Demey\nInterested in Open Source software and licenses Michaël has been a developer at iText Software since 2011. Working closely together with its users he has a keen insight on how the real world uses PDF. He has been known to have short flings with other JVM languages, but at heart he's a Java Developer. When he's not looking at PDF syntax, he likes to play music and (tries to ) develop games."
