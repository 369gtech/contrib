description: 'Modern compilers provide us with advanced functionality to make us more productive and help us find bugs easily. In this talk, I will do a whirlwind tour of these tools including: formatting, static analysis, dynamic analysis, hardening (for security), coverage, fuzz testing, automated refactoring, and profile guided optimization. The talk will be full of demos. I will also talk about the big picture, how these tools fit into the development process and when they are the most useful and important.'
