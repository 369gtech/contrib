title: 'Building a Spring Boot 2 application: Ask the Audience! by Hanno Embregts'
recordingDate: 1522160113
description: "Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone Spring-based applications that you can ‘just run’. It uses a ‘convention over configuration’ approach to get you up and running in no-time. And with the release of Spring Boot 2 in February 2018 all Spring 5.0 features will be available for Spring Boot users, as well as Kotlin support. In this session I will demonstrate this by live-coding a Spring Boot 2 application that will ‘just work’.\nBut audience beware, this is not your standard ‘live-coding session’. Attendees will have a vital say in the session’s content by defining the application’s requirements. Do you want a simple task planner? Or track your favourite movies? It’s up to you! Should it use MongoDB or JPA? You decide! Built with Java or Kotlin? I don’t care! Do you want an Angular front-end with a RESTful back-end or do you prefer a classic web app with Thymeleaf templates? It’s your call! Seriously.\nDuring the session you get to make these decisions by participating in an online vote. And you will discover that Spring Boot is up to the task no matter what choices you make.\nSo what are you waiting for? Bring your own device, help shape the application that we’re building and learn lots about Spring Boot in the process.\nThis session is intended for Java software engineers with an interest in Spring Boot. Some Spring experience could come in handy, but is not strictly necessary. After this session, you will know enough to start your own Spring Boot project."
