description: "The talk from JS Fest conference 2019 Autumn\nin Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: will be added soon\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/JSFestua/\nWebsite: https://jsfest.com.ua \n\n\nJavaScript is a very powerful and ubiquitous language. At the same time, it is also a language that is often misunderstood and misused. Better quality code greatly reduces the effort and time to maintain software. So, there is a good incentive to improve quality of code. In this presentation we will cover two things. We will discuss dos and don'ts for programming with JavaScript. Then we will look at a set of tools that can help keep an eye on our code and prompt us to improve the quality."
