description: 'A successful software developer is not a geek or an algorithm expert any more. Even though computer science is very important, there are other things that make you valuable to the projects you''re working in and the team that rely on you. I will try to summarize my experience in hiring over 250 people in the last three years and emphasize what''s important now and how will the future perfect software developer look like, in 10 years ahead'
