description: "Self driving cars are the future of transportation and will make up a crucial part of society as more drive related jobs are automated. In this video, i'll explain how the entire self driving car pipeline works, including computer vision, path planning, control, sensor fusion, and localization. We'll use the Udacity simulator to train our own self driving car with the Keras deep learning library as a tool at the end. This technology is surprisingly simple to understand, it just requires research into a couple of subfields, all of which i'll cover. \n\nCode for this video: \nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/self_driving_cars_explained\n\nPlease Subscribe!
