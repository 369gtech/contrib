description: "So you've travelled all the way to London to attend workshops, listen to talks and meet old friends and new, but what do you do next?\n\nThis conference marks the 1 year anniversary of the creation of Cloud Native Wales. It was born in a pub (next door to the venue) and has become one of Wales' largest tech meetups with a community that continue to help and support each other.\n\nWe'll share how you can create or contribute to your local communities and hopefully inspire some stories to hear at NDC London 2020.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
