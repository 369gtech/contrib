Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nServerless Experiences -- On Your Own Servers? - Evan Anderson, GoogleSDCC - \n\nThe term \"Serverless\" was coined to suggest that \"in the future, developers won't think so much about servers\". Since then, many have equated serverless with Functions-as-a-Service as offered by AWS Lambda (and competing services). Unfortunately, defining a movement by the absence of a concept is as absurd as \"don't think of a white bear\".\n\nIn this talk, Evan Anderson will provide an overview of a number of hosted and OSS serverless efforts including services like CircleCI and BigQuery and projects like Knative and Tekton to develop a useful test and theory of serverless. After examining signature design features of existing serverless solutions, he will discuss the applicability of Serverless to organizations with large on-premises installations.\n\nThe talk will close with suggestions about how and when to apply serverless design principles to software projects, as well as signs that your problem might not be a good fit for serverless."
