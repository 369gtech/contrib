description: "Deep Dive: Long Term Support WG - Tim Pepper, VMware \n\nLate in 2018 community discussion of Kubernetes support coalesced into a proposal for a Long Term Support Working Group. \"WG LTS\" is the name, but LTS should not imply work is towards what you may already believe to be meant by the term. Rather we seek a new, evolved definition of the Kubernetes release/support cadence, an investigation in a time-limited fashion during 2019 of the questions of \"To LTS Or Not To LTS\" and \"What Are We Releasing And Why And How Is It Best Integrated, Validate, And Supported\". Discussion spans complex questions of what support is desirable and viable in the minds of users, vendors, and ecosystem code contributors. This presentation will provide an overview of first half of our 2019 survey findings, describe progress towards and future work remaining to achieve a higher level of critical API stability, and outline the shape of possible support enhancement proposals. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MkJq"
