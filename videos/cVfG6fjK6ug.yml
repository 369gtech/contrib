It can be used to build tracking systems, messaging systems, high performance streaming platforms, real-time analysis, audit log….you name it. In our case, it’s been used to build a scalable event-store and messaging platform that stores billions of messages.\n\nIn this talk, we’re taking a closer look at essential Kafka concepts such as partition rebalancing, offset management, replication, producer/broker request fetching, file segments, etc. to understand what makes Kafka so scalable, resilient, performant and fault tolerant. We will also touch upon Kafka transactions to know what they are and how to leverage them. Last but not the least we will highlight some potential pitfalls that one should watch out when going to production with Kafka.\n\n \nNakul Mishra From Casumo\nSenior Software engineer and consultant around JVM and related technologies. Prefer automation over manual configurations. Keen on continuous delivery, unit testing and code simplicity. Interested in developing applications that requires creativity, imagination, fast-learning and zest for putting theory into code."
