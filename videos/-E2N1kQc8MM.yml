description: "Generative Adversarial Networks. It's time. We're going to use a Deep Convolutional GAN to generate images of the alien language from the movie arrival that we can then stitch together to animate into video. I'll go over the architecture of a GAN and then we'll implement one ourselves!\n\nCode for this video (coding challenge included):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/how_to_generate_video\n\nNemanja's winning code:\nhttps://github.com/Nemzy/video_generator\n\nNiyas' Runner up code:\nhttps://github.com/niazangels/vae-pokedex\n\nand his blog post:\nhttps://hackernoon.com/how-to-autoencode-your-pok%C3%A9mon-6b0f5c7b7d97\n\nPlease Subscribe!
