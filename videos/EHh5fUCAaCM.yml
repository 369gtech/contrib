title: 'Samuel Rivas - Ask not what your Erlang can do for you'

recordingDate: 1406033139
description: "After some years of usage, I have found quite common to find strong reactions against Erlang in organisations that have adopted it for a project, or even use it from the beginning.\n\nI believe one of the reasons is that we have become overconfident about the, sometimes alleged, strengths of Erlang. Which leads us to promise things that are not fulfilled in the long run. The truth is that the actual strengths of Erlang are likely to be outweighed by both its weaknesses and our bad practices in very few years unless we design our projects taking them into account.\nTalk objectives:\n\nI want to explore both how Erlang main strengths can faint along the project live and how some fundamental weaknesses can negatively impact reliability and productivity.\nTarget audience:\n\nAny erlang developer, specially those with some real world experience"
