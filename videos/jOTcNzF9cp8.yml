description: "This is an invitation to discover a mode of creative exploration where ownership, authorship and even personal identity start to collapse. What happens when your artwork is built on tools you made with friends? Or when you start to focus on the discussion youâ€™ve created instead of focusing on the tools? Then, instead of just sharing tools, what if you start to share your identity? This is a world that is fluid, where light and motion are programmable, surveillance is inverted, identities are swapped and distributed, and inspiration is everywhere.\n\nKyle McDonald\nkylemcdonald.net\nhttps://twitter.com/kcimc\nhttp://vimeo.com/kylemcdonald\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/kylemcdonald/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
