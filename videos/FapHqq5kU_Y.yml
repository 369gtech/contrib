description: "RubyConf 2018 - Practical guide to benchmarking your optimizations by Anna Gluszak\n\nMany people believe that ruby applications are inherently slow, yet oftentimes it is the lack of optimization and not the language that is at fault. But how do you even get started with this daunting task of performance optimization? For those that do not have a computer science background, understanding all the different ways of algorithm optimization can sound scary and overwhelming. Some may have a good handle on the theory behind things like the big O notation, but struggle to put it in practice. This talk will focus on a tangible and data driven way to measure and optimize code performance."
