How do you feel about perfectly responsive typographic scale and vertical rhythm? Do you feel itchy when it comes to building responsive email layouts? Have you ever tried to work around complex tables, nasty carousels, endless country selectors and complex user interfaces? Well, let’s bring it on!\n\nIn this talk, Vitaly Friedman, editor-in-chief of Smashing Magazine, will present dirty practical techniques and clever ideas developed in actual real-life projects, and use many examples to illustrate how we can solve problems smarter and faster. Please take the techniques with a grain of salt.
