description: "Implementing Cloud Foundry Right in the Middle of an Existing DataCenter - Andreas Landenberger & Juergen Sussner, DATEV eG\n\nDATEV eG is offering software and services for tax advisors, auditors, lawyers, ... . It processes more than 12 Mio paychecks per month and more than 110.000 enterprises use its services to collaborate with their tax consultant. Due to the sensitivity of data processed, DATEV has set up its own private cloud based on Cloud Foundry.\n\nAt the beginning of our journey with Cloud Foundry we made the conscious decision to implement Cloud Foundry right in the middle of the existing DataCenter. It is not installed as an island but it is running alongside with e.g. IBM WebSphere, Microsoft IIS and IBM CICS (on the mainframe). In this presentation we will discuss what led us to this decision and how we implemented it to make it a first class citizen in our application development landscape. We will openly talk about the experiances we made with this approach and what we would \nhave done different in case we would have a chance to do it again.\n\nSome of the questions we will adress are: What were the technical drawbacks we faced with the current infrastructure as we tried to enable new business-models? What led us (from a technical standpoint) to the implementation of Cloud Foundry?\nWhat are the experiances managing Cloud Foundry in a truely air-gapped environment (\"offline\")? How are various workloads seperated and how can developers decide about the placement of their applications? How is the connectivity to and from the existing infrastructure / applications? Why does DATEV use custom buildpacks in some areas? How did DATEV make use of the Cloud Foundry ecosystem?\n\nFinally we will take a look at the future challanges and what we would need from Cloud Foundry to help us to build a future-proove platform.\n\nThis presentation will discuss *how* DATEV uses Cloud Foundry. It looks at some of the technical details of the \nCloud Foundry implementation at DATEV and the experiances we made so far and what we expect for the future.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRz7/implementing-cloud-foundry-right-in-the-middle-of-an-existing-datacenter-andreas-landenberger-juergen-sussner-datev-eg"
