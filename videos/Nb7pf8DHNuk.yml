Even hype-r (or crazy-er, I let you judge), have you tried mixing different JavaScript frameworks (let’s say AngularJS, Angular and React for example) in a Single Page Application?\n\nThat’s what Micro Frontend is and that’s what we’ve done this year at Saagie. In this talk I’d like to give you a feedback on the different architectures we’ve tried, their pros and cons and help you find which one would be the best for you, just in case you’d like to opt for the dark and crazy side of front-end.\n\nAudrey Neveu \nFrom Saagie\nAudrey is full-stack developer, specialised in APIs. Heavily involved in the French wide Java Community, she’s part of Devoxx4Kids, a not-for-profit global initiative to get children coding, Devoxx France and Les Cast Codeurs, a french podcast on Java, but not only."
