description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotgo.eu on October 10th in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nThere are overlooked corners of our codebases. Ignored, unloved. Unimportant. Or so we thought. What was once inconsequential has—somehow—grown into ghastly mess. It's nobody's fault, and yet it's our responsibility. Katrina tells the story of one such mess, and the taming of it."
