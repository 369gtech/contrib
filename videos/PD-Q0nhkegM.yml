language: English
recordingDate: 1635801471
description: "Binary exploitation is a common attack method in memory unsafe programs. Some might think binary exploitation is old news and rarely happens, but thatâ€™s wrong - it is highly relevant and common even in 2021! Marit and Christian introduce the concept of binary exploitation with code examples. They demonstrate how to exploit a recent vulnerability in Sudo by explaining the vulnerability and the exploit, and running it live! Then they will demonstrate ways to detect and prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities in your software.\nMarit and Christian introduce the concept of binary exploitation with code examples.
