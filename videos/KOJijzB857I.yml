title: 'Change Data Capture, What Can Go Wrong - Neil Stevenson (Jfokus Brown Bag series)'
recordingDate: 1622451238
description: "Change Data Capture, What Can Go Wrong\nNeil Stevenson, Hazelcast\n\nAbstract What is change data capture (CDC), why is it important, and what does it have to do with real-time? This talk is about the areas architects and developers need to understand about it. In a nutshell, it’s tailing the logs on a database, and using that to update another database with the same changes. If all committed changes to a database are captured and sent elsewhere for more processing, you’ve essentially created a stream. It’s easy in principle, but the core topic for this talk is the powerful uses of CDC, as well as the challenges to be aware of. Some affect the architecture, some affect the coding, but it’s better to be aware of both and how you can deal with them. The talk will include a demo based around the popular Debezium libraries, and discuss the solutions coded, and where these are imperfect but pragmatic implementations\n\nRecorded Tuesday 20 April 2021 kl. 12:00"
