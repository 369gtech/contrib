It also kick-started the release-train of frequent Java releases, with Java 11 being the first long-term supported Java version poised to take modules into the mainstream. So what has happened since the introduction of the module system?\n\nThis talk will provide an overview adoption of modules in open-source libraries, IDEs, build tools, and so on. It will also feature tools that have emerged to make working with modules easier. Expect an honest overview of the current state of modules in Java, with lots of demos to show what's possible. After this talk you can start developing your own modular Java application without hesitation!\n\nSander Mak From Luminis\nSander is a Fellow at Luminis in The Netherlands, where he crafts modular and scalable software, most often on the JVM, but with a touch of TypeScript when needed. He also is a Java Champion and author of the O'Reilly book 'Java 9 Modularity' (see javamodularity.com). As an avid conference speaker, Sander loves sharing knowledge, also through his blog at http://branchandbound.net and as Pluralsight instructor."
