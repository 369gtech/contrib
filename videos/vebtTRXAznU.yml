description: "Keynote: Technically, a Talk by Eileen Uchitelle\n\n\"Peer deep into Rails’ database handling and you may find the code overly complex, hard to follow, and full of technical debt. On the surface you’re right - it is complex, but that complexity represents the strong foundation that keeps your applications simple and focused on your product code. In this talk we’ll look at how to use multiple databases, the beauty (and horror) of Rails connection management, and why we built this feature for you.\n\"\n__________\n\nEileen Uchitelle is a Staff Software Engineer on the Ruby Architecture Team at GitHub and a member of the Rails Core team. She's an avid contributor to open source focusing on the Ruby on Rails framework and its dependencies. Eileen is passionate about scalability, performance, and making open source communities more sustainable and welcoming."
