description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V  2020 - codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nAn introduction to the new socket API | Raimo Niskanen - Software Engineer \n\nABSTRACT\nThere is an experimental new socket API since OTP 22 that is thinner, lighter, and faster than the old gen_{tcp,udp,sctp} over inet_drv. It is implemented with NIFs on the Unix networking functions, which potentially gives the programmer access to _all_ of the socket functionality in the OS networking stack. This talk gives an overview of the API, some details on the implementation, informs on what is done and missing, and how the new sockets is intended to fit in the rest of Erlang/OTP.\n\n• See & download slides:\nhttps://codesync.global/uploads/media/activity_slides/0001/03/1b6a342cbc6428202bbb96479ffc4\n27730b0862d.pdf                    \n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\n  LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/27159258\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
