description: "Speaker: Maciej Piotrowski\n\nMaciej will be sharing on Synchronous Unit Tests. Mobile applications are usually multi-threaded. We perform UI operations on the main thread and dispatch heavy tasks (e.g. network requests, JSON parsing, writing to a file on a disk) to background threads. If we wanted to test an object that uses a background thread to perform work, we would use an XCTestExpectation and wait for an async operation to finish. Is there another option to test it?\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-iOS-Dev-Scout-Meetup/events/247949934/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: Yeo Kheng Meng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/fF0c/"
