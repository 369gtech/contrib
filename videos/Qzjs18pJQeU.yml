description: "Spring Boot is a product from Spring, that provides many configuration defaults for a new Spring project, so that one can set up a project in minutes. However, this is only one of the many features of Spring Boot. One of its module also provides many important Non-Functional Requirements out-of-the-box: monitoring, metrics, exposing those over HTTP, etc. In this presentation, I'll demo some of those, that will make DevOps more than a little happy.\n"
