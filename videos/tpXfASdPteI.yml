title: 'Navigating ClojureScript''s Fire Swamps - Peter Schuck'
language: English
recordingDate: 1490916130
description: "ClojureScript goes a long way towards curing JavaScript fatigue, however at its edges dangerous monsters still lurk. Third Party JavaScript integration via Externs, Module Splitting, Dead Code Elimination, and performance profiling often catch the unwary. Production builds often become complex and fragile to avoid these dangers.\n\nIn this talk I’ll show how to navigate the treacherous parts of ClojureScript and the landmarks to use for orientation. The current roadmap for bleeding edge features like externs inference and building dependencies from NPM will also be discussed.\n\nPeter is a full stack developer with a soft spot for functional programming a la Clojure and for high performance JavaScript. He’s contributed to the ClojureScript compiler and is currently working on significant performance gains to Clojure’s HashMaps. No language snob, he’s comfortable with a wide variety of languages like PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, and Scala. Peter is a senior software developer at Bendyworks in Madison, WI."
