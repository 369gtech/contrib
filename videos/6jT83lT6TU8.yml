language: English
recordingDate: 1509732501
description: 'DevOps in the Real World is far from perfect, yet we all dream of that amazing auto-healing fully-automated CI/CD micro-service infrastructure that we''ll have "someday." But until then, how can you really start using containers today, and what decisions do you need to make to get there? This session is designed for practitioners who are looking for ways to get started now with Docker and Swarm in production. This is not a Docker 101, but rather it''s to help you be successful on your way to Dockerizing your production systems. Attendees will get tactics, example configs, real working infrastructure designs, and see the (sometimes messy) internals of Docker in production today.'
