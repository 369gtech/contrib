language: English
recordingDate: 1630569696
description: 'Following a Vulnerability Disclosure to an aircraft manufacturer in 2019 little did Gaffers know that he was about to start on a journey in to a world where vulnerabilities are considered features and unless you can argue a safety impact you are not taken seriously. Without divulging the details, this talk will discuss the steps taken, what worked, what failed and some advice for anyone else who finds themselves in a similar situation.'
