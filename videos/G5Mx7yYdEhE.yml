description: "Can we predict cryptocurrency prices using machine learning? We're going to build a Keras deep learning model that attemps to predict the future price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in this video. The type of model i'm using is a bidirectional LSTM recurrent network. Ethereum future prices as well as other cryptocurrency prices are hard to predict, but with the power of machine learning we can find a suitable prediction. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/ethereum_future\n\nWant more education?
