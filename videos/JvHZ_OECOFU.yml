description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nC++17 is adding parallel overloads of most of the Standard Library algorithms. There is a TS for Concurrency in C++ already published, and a TS for Coroutines in C++ and a second TS for Concurrency in C++ in the works. \n\nWhat does all this mean for programmers? How are they all related? How do coroutines help with parallelism? \n\nThis session will attempt to answer these questions and more. We will look at the implementation of parallel algorithms, and how continuations, coroutines and work-stealing fit together. We will also look at how this meshes with the Grand Unified Executors Proposal, and how you will be able to take advantage of all this as an application developer. \n— \nAnthony Williams: Just Software Solutions Ltd\n\nAnthony Williams is the author of C++ Concurrency in Action.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
