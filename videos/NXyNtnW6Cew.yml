description: "Battery is a sacred resource on mobile; limited in capacity, and hard to understand, this resource can be brutally mis-managed causing lamentations for your users. This talk will cover some troublesome design patterns on mobile devices, and talk about some new tools that can help you track down, and improve, battery usage problems.\n\nColt McAnlis is a Developer Advocate at Google focusing on Games and Performance; Before that, he was a graphics programmer in the games industry working at Blizzard, Microsoft (Ensemble), Petroglyph, and an Adjunct Professor at SMU Guildhall. Recently, heâ€™s a UDACITY course instructor on HTML5 games and a Book Author. When he's not working with developers, Colt spends his time preparing for an invasion of giant ants from outer space.
