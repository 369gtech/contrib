description: "Getting your JavaFX app into the hands of end users is often as important as writing the app in the first place. This session outlines the processes, tools (including the JavaFX Packager), and techniques needed to get your application on the Mac App Store. Fit and finish are a major concern for Mac app users, so the presentation also addresses common visual and integration issues with Mac OS X.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDanno Ferrin\nDanno Ferrin is a Software Engineer at Fluke Networks by day, where he is enhancing a long-standing application to work on JavaFX and mobile devices.
