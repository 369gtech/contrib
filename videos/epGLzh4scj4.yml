recordingDate: 1563984049
description: 'Over the past few decades, the airline industry has transformed in many ways, leading to growing complexity in processing data from a wide variety of data sources to solve complex business problems. Capturing data across customer touchpoints provides a foundation for knowledge discovery and developing predictive models using Artificial Intelligence. Emerging technologies that give machines access to data and let them learn promotes the concept of continuous improvement that minimizes expensive repetitive calibrations. Modeling using this approach is gaining in importance and it represents a fundamentally different approach to creating software since the machine learns from examples rather than being explicitly programmed for a specific outcome. This talk will discuss required software tools that can be accessed in the cloud, cases as it relates to travel and programming languages that are commonly used.'
