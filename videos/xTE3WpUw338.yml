description: "by Oliver Sauter\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/collab_mcwr.webm\n\n\nAre you also annoyed that it is 2019 and you still have to bookmark stuff? Or that your notes about your web research are scattered everywhere? How come we cannot really collaborate and communicate in our web-research?\nIn this talk we give a brief introduction into Memex. It's an open-source browser extension to organise your web-research. Full-text search everything you've seen on the web, archive and annotate websites and collaborate with your peers in your web-research.\nAll data stored on your computer &amp; self-hostable.\nWith a mix of open-source software, data interoperability and a non-speculative economic model we try to protect users data sovereignty, privacy and stimulate the democratisation of knowledge management software. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 17:55:00+01"
