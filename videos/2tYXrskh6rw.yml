recordingDate: 1493418762
description: "Perhaps your company or department\_is considering hiring an external vendor or agency\_to work on your next project. Maybe your group\_has\_already hired an external development team\_to supplement an internal team. Integrating your in-house Drupal team with developers from an agency or vendor\_can positively contribute to a project's success, but can also\_result in resourcing headaches, hidden costs,\_and unexpected project management overhead. In this session, project managers tasked with managing internal\_and external developers on one team will gain insights and ideas on how to create and maintain a single team, and learn what pitfalls to avoid.\n\nThis session will\_highlight\_what to keep in mind while\_managing combined teams, how improve collaboration when adding external developers to an internal team, and how fostering the experience\_of a single team\_results in the ideal\_outcome. It will also cover\_mistakes project managers make with combined internal and external\_teams, how to spot communication breakdowns before they are unmendable, and provide helpful suggestions on how to mitigate issues. Attendees that have some project management experience, and have\_worked or plan\_to project manage\_a\_combined internal and\_external team\_will\_gain the most from this session.\n\nAlso included:\n\nPreparing yourself and\_your in-house team to work with external developers\nIncreasing productivity\nEnsuring smooth hand-offs and multi-vendor transitions\nResourcing internal and external developers\nManaging\_roles and responsibilities\nNote: This session's intended audience is\_project managers and\_team leads.
