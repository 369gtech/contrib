description: "RubyConf 2018 - Inheritance, Composition, Ruby and You by Cody Stringham\n\nPrefer composition over inheritance is something you’ve probably heard. You may have even heard more strongly worded arguments against inheritance. This talk will give you the knowledge you need to know whether or not inheritance is a viable solution. While preferring composition is often the right answer, the Ruby language has deep ties into inheritance and we should know it well. If you’re new to Ruby, Object-Oriented programming, or just curious what all the hubbub is about - this talk is aimed at you."
