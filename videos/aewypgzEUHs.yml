description: "Norfolk Developers 5th February 2014 \n\nMore than just a UML ORM for .NET? \nby Scott Price\n\n\nCapable Objects ECO framework is more than just another ORM for the .NET Framework.  Having used this tool for many years, Scott will discuss some of the advantages that have kept it as a tool in his component-set for many years, since before the Entity Framework was at Version 1.  From speed of designing a business model, flexibility of back end database persistence support, communications opportunities, strong UML and OCL support and advanced features such as Object Versioning.  This may be a fast packed session to cover so many of the features, hopefully of interest to other .NET developers. \n\nScott Price had been experimenting with computers and software since early teens, and not surprisingly has ended up involved with software, databases and custom systems.\n\nHaving started much of his early work with languages such as Pascal/Delphi, Java, C/C++ and other older languages, most of the past decade has been spent utilizing the .NET Framework.\n\nWhist most of his time is spent consulting and working with and on corporate customers projects these days, he has enjoyed previous presentation opportunities with other developer groups (generally around London), and is very happy to be able to present some of these topics in Norfolk. \n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/158376552/"
