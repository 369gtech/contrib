description: "Challenges and Learnings: Building gRPC Python AsyncIO Stack - Lidi Zheng, Google \n\nOne of Python 3â€™s most significant improvements is AsyncIO -- the official asynchronous library. The split Python asynchronous world now shares a common destination. Although this feature has been asked to integrate with gRPC back in 2015, it never really happened until now. In this session, we will discuss the challenges of integrating an asynchronous paradigm with gRPC Core, the designs that are tailored to the AsyncIO world, and, most importantly, the collaborations from the open-source community."
