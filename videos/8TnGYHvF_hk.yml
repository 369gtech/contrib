title: 'Sarah Drasner - Animating Vue'
language: English
recordingDate: 1511961191
description: "As superfluous as something like animation may initially seem, you can tell a lot about framework by the way that it handles the concept of time. Idiosyncrasies and race conditions in rendering reveal themselves, pauses in DOM and virtual DOM diffing can be exposed.\n\nThis is one of the ways Vue shows itself to be uniquely capable and elegant as a framework. In this session, we'll cover how to use the Transition component and some of its offerings to create fluid effects in the browser. We'll move on to watchers and transitioning state. Finally, we'll talk about lifecycle methods, asynchronous updates, and pushing our animations to the next level."
