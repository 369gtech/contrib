description: "This is the first in a new series of guest tutorials!\n\nMy first guest is Tega Brain. Tega is an Australian artist, teacher and engineer who gives us a tutorial on environmental sensing and p5.js. In this video, she shows you how to set up a light sensor with a wireless physical computing platform called Particle. She teaches you how to read the data in p5js and make a basic data visualization.\n\nLink to code: https://github.com/tegacodes/p5js-sensing/tree/master/P5-Particle\n\nLink to particle website: https://www.particle.io/\n\nBelow is a link to the Particle tutorial that's referred to in this video. This getting started tutorial lists the electronic components you need, shows how to build the circuit, and provides the Particle code that Tega walks through. It's the section under the subheading \"Read your Photoresistor: Function and Variable \" at this link:\n\nhttps://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/examples/photon/\n\n\nLinks to videos mentioned in this tutorial:\nPlaylist on RESTful APIs: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Yyn-fBtGHfN0_xCtBwUkBp\nVideo on JSON: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NFkzw6oFtQ\n\nFor more Guest Tutorials and Interviews: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bYBG4PsCJpsvMka3boE9pR\n\nFor more Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/0PrN/"
