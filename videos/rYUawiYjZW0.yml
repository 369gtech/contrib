title: 'Is machine learning sustainable?'
recordingDate: 1603780296
description: "Training a single NLP model can emit as much carbon as five cars in their lifetime. Is there such a thing as green Machine Learning? With accuracy hungry algorithms ML software is consuming more and more computational resources, largely benefiting from the increasingly better hardware. Are the results worth the environmental cost? This talk will cover some of the latest research in the area, showing options to estimate the carbon footprint and discuss ideas on how to make Machine Learning greener.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend. To make an event at Foo Café, you have to become a partner company with us or you can run a user group with an in-depth technical focus.\nWe welcome companies with sponsor challenges.\nWe are currently present in Stockholm and Malmö and have made over 2048 tech events since the start in 2012. \nAt Foo Café there’s an event going on everyday, year round."
