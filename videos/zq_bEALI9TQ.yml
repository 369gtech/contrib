description: "► Check out https://gorails.com for Pro episodes and more!\n► SaaS business template for Ruby on Rails with built-in features like Payments, Teams, and much more: https://jumpstartrails.com\n► Ruby on Rails hosting with Hatchbox.io: https://hatchbox.io\n► Learn how to add Stripe Payments (with SCA support!) with Ruby on Rails: https://courses.gorails.com/payments-with-rails-master-class\n\nInfinite scroll examples are pretty outdated these days. You'll often see them using jQuery to calculate the scroll positions and make AJAX requests.\n\nWhat about doing this with modern Javascript? We'll be using Stimulus.js to make everything compatible with Turbolinks. Our updates will be done using Rails UJS in webpacker, so everything Javascript is simple and clean.\n\nPlus, we'll use the Pagy gem for the pagination backend to make everything work (and fast!)."
