description: "by Claes Wallin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.201/fractalideandcantor.webm\n\n\nFractalide is a Flow-Based Programming framework for making GUI applications in Racket and Rust, tied together by Nix. As one of the first applications to make use of this, we created Cantor, a cryptocurrency wallet. \n\nHow did using Racket help us or hinder us, and how does Flow-Based Programming interact and fit with Functional Programming? \n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:50:00+01"
