title: 'An introduction to Apache Kafka - this is Event Streaming, not just Messaging by Katherine Stanley'
recordingDate: 1550057988
description: 'The amount of data the world produces is growing exponentially every year and many companies are realising the potential of harnessing this data. A lot of this is generated in the form of a never ending stream of events, with publishers creating the events and subscribers consuming them in many different ways. This is where Apache Kafka comes in, Kafka isn''t just a messaging system - it''s an event streaming platform. This session will introduce Kafka and explain concepts such as topic partitioning, consumer groups and exactly-once semantics. Finally, learn about more advanced concepts such as stream processing using the Java Kafka Streams library, cross-datacenter replication and integration with other messaging systems.'
