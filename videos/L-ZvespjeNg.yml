description: 'The job of a developer is creating software, not changing the world. But to even the most focused developer it''s now obvious that to create software is to change the world. Information technology is changing everything in personal and public life: social relations, the nature of work, what an enterprise is, and perhaps even the basis of trade itself. As developers, should we care about this or is it someone else''s problem? In this talk, we''ll explore conflicting ideas about info-capitalism and its future, and attempt to draw out implications for ourselves.'
