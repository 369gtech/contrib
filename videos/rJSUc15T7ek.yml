description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeakers: David Winterfeldt, Brian Dussault\nThis session will focus on deploying and managing your Spring Application in the cloud using VMware vFabric Application Director. A series of Spring applications, increasing in complexity, will be deployed. The deployments will cover generating property files and activating Spring profiles. Some other highlights of the presentation will be deploying to VMWare vCloud & EC2, updating an existing deployment, and some general tips & tricks.\n\nThe session will begin by using a simple contact application to be deployed as a standalone webapp with an in memory DB on single node, then it will continue with a more advanced example using PostgreSQL DB on a separate node, and finally demonstrate the use and configuration of an external DB & an Apache proxy. The session will conclude with the deployment and discussion of Nanotrader, a sample trading application, with complex requirements."
