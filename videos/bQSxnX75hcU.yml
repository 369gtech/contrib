title: 'YOW! 2019 - Casey Rosenthal - Evolving Chaos Engineering'
recordingDate: 1581537606
description: "Almost five years ago I published at manifesto of sorts at https://principlesofchaos.org to define a new discipline in software engineering called Chaos Engineering. It wasnâ€™t about creating chaos, but rather identifying the chaos inherent in a complex system. The other practices that commonly address availability (incident management, alerting, monitoring, disaster recovery, etc) are all reactive: they focus on time to detect, and time to remediate. Chaos Engineering on the other hand is proactive: finding systemic vulnerabilities before they affect customers. Now that Chaos Engineering has high adoption at big tech companies and non-digital native orgs alike, we can look at how the practice is maturing. Our knowledge of systemic properties of complex systems is improving and leading us into a new era of Continuous Verification.\n\nCasey Rosenthal is CEO at Verica.io, the premiere Continuous Verification company. Previously, he was an executive manager and senior architect managing teams tackling big data, architecting solutions to difficult problems, and training others to do the same. He seeks opportunities to leverage his experience with distributed systems, artificial intelligence, translating novel algorithms and academia into working models, and selling a vision of the possible to clients and colleagues alike. For fun, Casey models human behavior using personality profiles in Ruby, Erlang, Elixir, Prolog, and Scala.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
