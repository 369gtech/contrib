Getting Started - installing log4net, initial configuration and getting it running in your code.\n2. .NET 4.5 Changes - What additional options you have if you are using .NET 4.5.\n3. Appenders - How to log to different data repositories like SQL Server, text files and more.\n4. Filters - How to log only the data you want to capture while ignoring the rest. This will cover both the simple options as well as the more advanced possibilities.\n5. Log Patterns - Learn how to capture a number of different pieces of data, what the pitfalls are of some data points and how to send data to your data source.\n6. Advanced Logging - Take logging to the next level by capturing custom data in your own fields. Even capture data at the time of the error without any extra configuration.\n7. Wrap Up - Review what has been learned and identify how to move forward with log4net.\n\nThis video course is easy for a beginner to get started with but even if you didn't know anything coming in, if you follow the steps outlined in the video, you will become an advanced log4net user by the end of the video.
