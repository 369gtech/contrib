description: "As your organization adopts containers and Kubernetes, the number of teams and clusters to manage will explode. You'll need a way to stay in control so you can keep your platform secure and contain costs.\n\nIn this session, we'll show you how Tanzu Mission Control enables you to do that by automating the enforcement of policies—access policies, pod security policies, image policies, backup policies, and more—across fleets of clusters. You'll learn how to align your organization and resources to maximize security, enable development team self-service, and safely share resources across your teams. We'll also dive in a bit into how it all works under the covers.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2oUfP1V\n\nSpeaker: Fabio Yeon, Sr. Staff Engineer, VMware\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/more-devs-no-problems-enabling-selfservice-access-to-kubernetes"
