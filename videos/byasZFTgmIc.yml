description: "Kathy Reid\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/274/\n\nThis session will present a history of open source voice projects and provide an overview of the current open source voice landscape. From Star Trek’s computer, to Knight Rider’s K.I.T.T, to Selma in Time Trax, we have long desired to work with computers using the power of our voice. But while attractive, this technology is currently used to gather data, using spoken utterances to personalize advertisements, and provide privacy-impugning ‘nudges. Enter open source, privacy-focussed voice assistants. As voice becomes ubiquitous, those organisations wanting to ensure privacy and prevent vendor lock-in are turning to open source solutions.What's out there? What are the differences? And what sort of things should you consider when you're choosing an open source voice platform? What does the open source voice assistant roadmap look like? What models are there for sustainability and revenue generation in open source voice? This presentation will provide an overview of the voice stack, and the different open source options available at each layer of the stack, as well as their pros and cons, enabling you to make an informed choice about open source voice.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
