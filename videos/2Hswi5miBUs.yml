title: 'Applying Principles of Chaos Engineering to Serverless (Yan Cui, 2019)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636120985
description: "At this month's Ops Matters, we're joined by Yan Cui who'll be telling us how we can apply principles of chaos engineering to a serverless architecture, and improve resilience through controlled experiments that expose the inherent chaos and failures modes in the system before they manifest like wildfire in production and impact our users. Don't miss it!\n\nThe motivation of this talk is to provoke the audience to think about the failure modes that exists in their serverless architecture and how they can discover them early by applying the principles of chaos engineering. Serverless architectures have more inherent chaos and complexity than their serverful counterparts, and, we have less control over their runtime behaviour!\n\nWatch thousands more tech talks in our SkillsCast library at https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts"
