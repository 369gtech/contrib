title: 'Memory Efficient Java by Kirk Pepperdine'
recordingDate: 1581886615
description: "When developers and Operations are asked what their biggest performance bottleneck is, it’s rare that memory inefficiency comes up as an answer. Unfortunately, this runs counter to observations that 60% of all applications are memory-inefficient. Quite often this memory inefficiency hides as lower application throughput and longer, more frequent tail latency events, meaning that other things often take the blame. This session looks at the telltale signs that your application is in that 60% and the steps you can take to attack this problem.\n\nWhen developers and Operations are asked what their biggest performance bottleneck is, it’s rare that memory inefficiency comes up as an answer.
