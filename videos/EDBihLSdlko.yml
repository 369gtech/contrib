description: "All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky. So are the ones that try to obscure how your concurrent code is executed by saying “Write Once, Run Anywhere”.\n\nThe session starts with a theoretical overview of the subject, and then moves on to a hands-on OpenJDK digging. We will cover implementations of synchronized and volatile. We will learn what a memory barrier is, and why everyone loves x86. Last but not least, we will do some very convoluted stuff to HotSpot."
