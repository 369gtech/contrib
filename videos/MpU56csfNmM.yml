description: "Katie McLaughlin\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/230/\n\nFor engineers who participate in on-call rotations, documentation is critical to resolving issues. Especially when, at 3am, the responding engineer will be -- initially -- on their own, and not performing at their peak. \r\n\r\nIn this short presentation, Katie will discuss some strategies she's implemented as a veteran on-call Site Reliability Engineer, and shows you how to be kind to 3am you.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource"
