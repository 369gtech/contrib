title: 'Journey from Monolith to Microservices and DevOps by WIX (Aviran Mordo, Israel)'
recordingDate: 1486916667
description: 'Wix.com started the journey toward DevOps and a microservices solution about 5 years ago when we switched from a monolithic application to a microservices-based systemâ€”a transition that took two full years to complete, with many lessons learned along the way. Today, Wix successfully operates over 200 microservices on a battle-tested production environment. In this talk, we will cover why Continuous Delivery and DevOps are important requirements for microservices, discuss guidelines for a good microservice architecture, explain why YAGNI and KISS are important and how operational concerns (DevOps) affect the design of a microservices architecture, as well as give some recommendations on the best way to transition from a monolithic to a microservices architecture.'
