description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nAaron Bedra - Application Security Lead, Braintree and Co-Author of Programming Clojure, 2nd Edition\n\nABSTRACT\nKnock, knock.\nWho's there?\nUser.\nUser who?\nuser@website.com:password.\nOk, have fun!\n\nThere are lots of ways of dealing with authentication, but the interaction before, during, and after is usually ignored. This is pretty much how web applications work today. We don't ask the right questions of users attempting to access our web applications. How sure are you that the user accessing your site is who they say they are? How sure are you that you want them accessing your site at all?\n \nJoin Aaron Bedra as he walks you through asking the questions you should be asking of your users, and how to help prevent abuse, fraud, and otherwise unwanted activity on your web applications. You will learn how to ask the right questions without interfering with a great user experience. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
