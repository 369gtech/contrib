description: "Advanced Ruby Scripting for Sketchup\r\nSang Ahn and Scott Lininger (Google)\r\n\r\nGoogle Sketchup contains a Ruby API for users who want to extend the capabilities of SketchUp. The interface allows users to create macros, such as automated component generators and additional tools, to be included in the menus within SketchUp. This session will cover two Ruby technologies that can be used to add functionality to SketchUp: WebDialogs and Ruby Extension Modules. For those comfortable with web programming, WebDialogs allow you to create rich user interfaces easily. For those with a native library they'd like to use, Ruby Extension Modules can help with high performance computations."
