title: 'Apache Spark on planet scale Using Apache Spark to process OpenStreetMap data'
language: English
recordingDate: 1600160596
description: "by Denis Chaplygin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.126/apache_spark_on_planet_scale.webm\n\nApache Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework with implicit data parallelism. OpenStreetMap is a huge database of features, found on Earth surface. Working with that database is hard, so Spark is a natural solution to solve OSM size-caused processing issues. I'm going to show how to load OSM data to Spark, run processing algorithms like extract/merge or render and how using Spark improves development process and cuts processing times greatly. Will show, how to use Spark OSM DataSource to load data to the Spark DataFrame and how to use Spark for OSM data merge/extract, simple analysis, rendering etc. Talk will also mention multithreaded OSM PBF parser, that can be used independently of Spark or other processing library.\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 14:00:00"
