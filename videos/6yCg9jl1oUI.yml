language: English
recordingDate: 1619693920
description: "\"Thereâ€™s something powerful in giving an emotional experience with a medium like programming, considered by the wide public as cold and emotionless. For many people, programming is something completely foreign and mysterious. Their computer just works without a thought of why it works and who hides behind the fact that it does.\n\nBut could an artistic practice using code be the perfect way to bridge the gap between humanities and computer science and to open up much-needed conversations? What if artists of code have a job that is not only there for our entertainment, but crucial for shaping the way technology is understood and used by the public?\"\n\nIn this talk, Mynah Marie explains the motivation behind her work as a live coder by looking at live coding as a way to bridge the gap between humanities and computer science."
