description: "You're a developer, not a magician. Yet sometimes, optical illusions and design tricks are needed to help a website seem like it's loading fast. Users don't care about technical challenges; if a website feels like it takes forever to load, they will bounce.\n\nCome in, listen to this talk and leave with a few tricks up your sleeve to improve performance when everything else you've tried has failed.\n\nMyriam speaks to desktop robots, mobile humans and everything in between. She specializes in digital marketing and so far, it's meant more code than anything else for the past 10 years."
