language: French
recordingDate: 1553175058
description: "There are many challenges with microservices architecture that are not solved by Java EE, but the MicroProfile seeks to close that gap. MicroProfile is an initiative brought by the Enterprise Java community to foster rapid innovation around Microservices and Enterprise Java. This session will show the details around the Microprofile initiative, how it improves the Java for modern applications, and finally how to implement a microprofile-based java application using WildFly Swarm. WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular WildFly Java Application Server in order to support just enough app server for microservices. Additionally, WildFly Swarm brings other state-of-the-art components to your application, integrating them seamlessly. This includes authentication/authorization from Keycloak, client-side load-balancing via NetflixOSS Ribbon/Hystrix, and log aggregation using Logstash.\n\npar Edson Yanaga"
