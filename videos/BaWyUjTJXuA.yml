title: 'YOW! West 2016 Herdy Handoko - A Whirlwind Tour of Apache Mesos'
recordingDate: 1470547442
description: "What if you can write applications and treat your entire datacenter as one giant pool of resources? Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.\n\nAfter this presentation, you will gain an understanding of the Mesos architecture; how it differs from existing virtualization and containerization technology and where it fits on the existing application and infrastructure landscape.\n\nIn addition, we will take a look at two primary Mesos frameworks available: Marathon and Chronos, discuss some of the Mesos usages in large-scale production systems today and close off by running a short demo of Mesos in action.\n\nHerdy Handoko is originally from Indonesia, he migrated to Australia for the pursuit of higher education; he spent ten years working within the engineering and natural resources sector in Perth before continuing his adventure in Singapore.\n\nHerdy consider himself as a well-rounded developer and a polyglot. He has worked and delivered graphic design projects, front-end solutions (incl. geospatial), web applications, service applications, and completed a number of database migration projects. Having worked in various C#, Python, Objective-C, JavaScript, and Java projects — he is currently enjoying his role working in Scala full-time, and has started an experimental side-project to learn Elixir and Elm. He is also keeping a close eye on the development of Nim and Pony language.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
