description: "Lana Brindley\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/39/\n\nThere's a writing style people use when they want to sound smarter. It goes something like this:\r\n\r\nWe're using iterative approaches to corporate strategy to foster collaborative thinking and further the overall value proposition.\r\n\r\nDepending on which reading test you use, you need to have a grade 20 equivalent reading age to be able to understand that sentence. Many doctoral candidates haven't even been to school for twenty years. So why do we write like this?\r\n\r\nThere is some evidence (yes, actual scientifically sound, peer-reviewed evidence), that indicates that people who show signs of power are treated in a way that allows them to actually achieve such power. In other words, 'fake it til you make it' is an actual, scientifically proven way to get what you want. \r\n\r\nBut, if you're writing technical documentation, or an email to your boss, it's more important that you're seen as being honest rather than powerful. It would be nice to think that people will read your writing and think \"wow, what a clever writer that Lana Brindley is! She knows lots of fancy words, and I think I'd like to be her friend\". Sadly, if your writing is full of jargon, they're more likely to think \"what a silly twit\" and go read something else.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Lana will go through some of the ways you can make your writing clearer, more engaging, and honest, without using too many big words.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
