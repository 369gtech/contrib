title: 'Alex Nuijten - Analytic Functions: Unleash the SQL Power'
language: English
recordingDate: 1462252753
description: 'Analytic Functions have been around for quite a long time, and still they are a relatively unknown. If you are unfamiliar with these very powerful functions, you are missing out on something spectacular. Analytic Functions add inter-row calculations, aggregates over multiple dimensions, or rank assignment based on values within a group of values - all without a GROUP BY clause. The syntax might seem daunting at first, but it is really not that scary. This session will focus on the syntax with tons of real world uses for Analytic Functions.'
