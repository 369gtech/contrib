Your hosts are Camila Kuhn, Christian Staudt, Gianluca Speranza and Kai Matzutt.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @PyDataHamburg \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n# (Talk 1) Phu Mon Htut : Transfer Learning in NLP: Tools and Tips\n\nIn recent years, pre-trained language models, such as Google's BERT, combined with transfer learning methods have enabled us to achieve the state-of-the-art in many natural language processing tasks. In this talk, I'll give an overview of the pre-trained language models and transfer learning methods in NLP. I'll then introduce open-source tools designed for transfer learning of NLP tasks and tips on using them.\n\nPhu is a Ph.D. candidate at New York University working on applying transfer learning methods to NLP problems and linguistic analysis of these methods for interpretability.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n# (Talk 2) Sebastian Nichtern & Adrian Baetu: NLP based Customer Service Automation at scale\n\nWe all hear about the great revolution of AI and NLP ahead. Still, we see most companies struggle leveraging the benefits of such technologies.
