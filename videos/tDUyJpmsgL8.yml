description: "Matt Russell - Partner, Autostructure\n\nHave you been prototyping Docker? Do you like what it can do? Are you having a difficult time selling it to your leadership? Or are you an executive and your team is glowing about DevOps? Do you understand the business value that it can offer? Gaining large-scale adoption of container technology requires an ability to translate tech-speak into exec-speak. We will provide some examples from what worked for us, as well as some mistakes that we would avoid next time. We have built a major DevOps effort from the ground-up in the definition of \"bureaucrazy\" - the US Federal Gov't. We'd like to share some of our lessons learned so that you can apply them in your organizations. The use of tools in the \"DevOps\" operating model require consistent support. This support must be provided in various ways - management support, rank and file support, and most importantly financial support."
