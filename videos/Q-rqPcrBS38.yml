What a great idea! Let's dig into the BEAM's execution tracing implementation, learn how it works, and look at what it takes to port this great idea to a much more traditional language runtime, like Perl.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/ben-tyler/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BEN TYLER\nPrincipal Developer at Booking.com\n\nAbeba Birhane is a PhD candidate in Cognitive Science at University College Dublin. Her interdisciplinary research, which intersects between embodied cognition, digital technology studies, and critical data science, explores the dynamic and reciprocal relationships between individuals, society and digital technologies. She is a contributor to Aeon Magazine [https://aeon.co/ideas/descartes-was-wrong-a-person-is-a-person-through-other-persons] and blogs regularly about cognition, AI, ethics and data science.
