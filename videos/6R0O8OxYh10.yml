title: 'Webinar:  Developer-friendly platforms with Kubernetes and infrastructure as code'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604692497
description: "Adopting Kubernetes can dramatically accelerate your product delivery and unify the developer experience across your organization, but building a platform that is both friendly to the platform builders and the developers who need to consume it can often be tricky. It’s common for organizations running multiple services to have a myriad of languages, frameworks, and tools they need to learn which can quickly lead to a steep learning curve. In this Webinar, we’ll take a look at how you can build a Kubernetes-based platform using languages that are familiar not only to the ops side of DevOps but also the developer side. We’ll discuss what it takes to build a developer-friendly platform that meets developers where they are -- using their preferred programming languages, tools, and workflows to quickly learn complex Kubernetes concepts. The talk will introduce techniques to help developers automate Kubernetes configuration, management, and deployment tasks and level up their operational knowledge.\n\nPresenter:\nLee Briggs, Staff Software Engineer @Pulumi"
