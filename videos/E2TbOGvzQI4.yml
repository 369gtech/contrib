title: 'Building Wireless Sensor Networks, MQTT, RaspberryPi and Arduino - Zvi Avraham'
recordingDate: 1401788135
description: "In this talk, Zvi will share his experiences in developing an MQ Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT-S) over Zigbee Gateway software in Erlang/OTP. MQTT-S is used as a publish/subscribe messaging protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSN), with the aim of extending the MQTT protocol beyond the reach of TCP/IP infrastructure for Sensor and Actuator solutions. This makes it a very efficient protocol for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things connectivity.\n\nTalk objectives:\n•    Introduce MQTT protocol, it's ecosystem and standardization efforts.\n•     Give overview of MQTT-S - a version of MQTT specifically designed for sensors.\n•    Show how to build wireless sensor nodes with Arduino and Zigbee.\n•    Discuss design and implementation of MQTT-S over Zigbee gateway in Erlang/OTP.\n•    Highlight how easy is to port Erlang code to small Linux machines like RaspberryPi and BeagleBoard.\n\nTarget audience: Erlang programmers developing and/or testing web services."
