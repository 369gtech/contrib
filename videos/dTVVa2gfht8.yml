I have been asked for this tutorial many times in the last few weeks.\n\nTo understand the Model View Controller you just need to know that it separates the Calculations and Data from the interface. The Model is the class that contains the data and the methods needed to use the data. The View is the interface. The Controller coordinates interactions between the Model and View.\n\nThe video and code will make it very easy to understand."
