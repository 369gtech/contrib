description: "When Bruce Lee started his own martial art, he took all the best traits from the different flavours of Kung Fu and adapted it, to make his own unique version that suited him best. In this talk, I will draw parallels between software craftmanship and how Bruce Lee approached honing his skill. In the end, I will prove to you that Bruce Lee was, in fact, a software architect.\n\nEVENT:\n\nThis talk was given at the Dutch PHP Conference in 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJeroen v.d.
