description: "With high performance Virtual Machines (VM) and networking, blazing fast VM provisioning, per-minute billing and rich set of services, Google Cloud is a great platform to deploy and run your ASP.NET apps.\n\nIn this hands-on session, we will start with the classic Contoso University ASP.NET MVC5 app and move it to the cloud. Once in the cloud, we will take our app to the next level with Machine Learning APIs, Cloud Storage, Stackdriver error reporting and other services provided by Google. In the end, you will see how easy it is to create a production ready ASP.NET app on Google Cloud."
