description: "You want to migrate your existing application to serverless and you donâ€™t know where to start. This is a common problem that a lot of the architects, CTOs and developers have, as it is very rare that we start a project from a Greenfield.\n\nIn this talk I will walk you through different strategies to migrate an existing application to serverless. We will look at known architectures existing challenges in applications and how we can overcome them with serverless. And also I will share what I learnt when I worked on the migration of one existing micro services application into serverless.\n\n\nCheck out our links below, and don't miss our next conference!\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndccopenhagen.com/"
