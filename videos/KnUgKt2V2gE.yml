title: '#HITBCyberWeek #CommSec D2 - Trustworthy Shield – A Cheap TPM Module For Older Systems'
language: English
recordingDate: 1607986999
description: "Trusted computing, as an active defense technology, can be automatically immune to new security threats such as ransomware without relying on virus database upgrades. However, trusted computing generally requires a trusted computing module (the TPM chip) attached to the motherboard using the unpluggable LPC or SPI interfaces.\n\nOn the other hand, older computer systems are facing severe security threats: they often run industry software that has been running stably in the past years, and the basic operating system (such as Windows XP, etc.) that runs these industry software is no longer maintained by the manufacturer, and more and more system vulnerabilities are constantly discovered by attackers or researchers. Most of the existing old computers do not have hardware-level trusted computing supporting.\n\nHence, we developed Trustworthy Shield – an easy way to introduce trusted computing hardware (as well as the corresponding trusted-computing-enabled security software) without changing the original hardware of old computers.\n\n=== \n\nI am a security researcher in China and I focus on the trust computing. I work in a start-up company, which is promoting the application of cheap TPM modules in the embedded field."
