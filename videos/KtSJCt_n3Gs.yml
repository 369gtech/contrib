title: 'Webinar: Securing and Accelerating the Kubernetes CNI Data Plane with Project Antrea +  Mellanox'
language: English
recordingDate: 1594762934
description: "Project Antrea is an open source Kubernetes CNI network plugin simplifying secure pod connectivity and network policy enforcement powered by Open vSwitch (OVS). Project Antrea provides a powerful toolset to reason about and troubleshoot distributed security postures enforced at the application edge. Additionally, CNI solutions, including the ones built with OVS, traditionally handle switching, routing, and packet filtering in a hypervisor or OS kernel resulting in CPU overhead and preventing full utilization of available bandwidth. In this webinar, we will introduce Project Antrea and its diagnostic capabilities, and show that performance doesnâ€™t have to be sacrificed for security by offloading the network dataplane to NIC hardware enabled with NVIDIA Mellanox Accelerated Switching And Packet Processing technology. This software-defined, hardware-accelerated approach best positions Antrea as the secure SDN of choice to meet and beat the most demanding cloud native workloads across cloud, on-premises and edge domains.\n\nPresenters:\n\nAntonin Bas, Maintainer of Project Antrea and Staff Engineer @VMware\nMoshe Levi, Sr. Staff Engineer @NVIDIA\nItay Ozery, Director, Product Management for Networking @NVIDIA"
