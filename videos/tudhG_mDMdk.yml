description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nSpeaker: Matt Stine\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/lattice-a-cloud-native-platform-for-your-spring-applications\nLattice is a cloud-native application platform that enables you to run your applications in containers like Docker, on your local machine via Vagrant. Lattice includes features like:\n\nCluster scheduling\nHTTP load balancing\nLog aggregation\nHealth management\n\nLattice does this by packaging a subset of the components found in the Cloud Foundry elastic runtime. The result is an open, single-tenant environment suitable for rapid application development, similar to Kubernetes and Mesos Applications developed using Lattice should migrate unchanged to full Cloud Foundry deployments.\n\nLattice can be used by Spring developers to spin up powerful micro-cloud environments on their desktops, and can be useful for developing and testing cloud-native application architectures. Lattice already has deep integration with Spring Cloud and Spring XD, and you’ll have the opportunity to see deep dives into both at this year’s SpringOne 2GX. This session will introduce the basics:\n\nInstalling Lattice\nLattice’s Architecture\nHow Lattice Differs from Cloud Foundry\nHow to Package and Run Your Spring Apps on Lattice"
