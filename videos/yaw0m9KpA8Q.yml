description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nWhen it comes to deploying applications at scale without needing to integrate different pieces of infrastructure yourself, the answer nowadays is increasingly #Kubernetes. While Kubernetes does provide all the building blocks and deployment tools, much thought is required to truly deployment pipelines to use in production. Configuring your builds with things like YAML may be tedious and error-prone. What if you can use the power of Kotlinâ€™s type system and compile-time checks while building your deployments! In this interactive and code-driven session Fedor and Viktor teach you how to use Kotlin DSL for Kubernetes to configure your deployments (including custom resource definitions like Kafka CRD).\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nFedor spent many years at the industry leading companies building tools for engineers before founding Cirrus Labs which is focused on innovative tools for the Cloud Computing Era."
