title: 'I am testing my micro-services and let others test theirs (Viktor Polishchuk, Ukraine) [RU]'
recordingDate: 1577305474
description: "Today it is very common to hear that micro-service architecture is a way to solve all problems. Scalability, fast release cycle, controllable code evolution, testability etc. Micro-services are well known to be a heaven for developers, QAs, PMs, and business owners. However, those who have already worked with such architecture usually are not that doubtless of the statement. Moreover, when it comes to the real thing â€“ each company has to overcome enormous amount of technical challenges to make it work.\n\nI would like to shed light on testability aspect. How we (at Wix) are testing integration of our micro-services, why it works, and what do you need to know before dive into it."
