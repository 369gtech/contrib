description: "Enable IoT and Media Support in CF with Custom TCP/UDP Routers - Roman Swoszowski, Grape Up\n\nRecent updates to cf-routing introduced new powerful improvements related to route services and TCP routing. Yet there is still a missing piece of the puzzle – UDP routing. We would like to share experiences we gained at Grape Up while working on adding UDP routing in Cloud Foundry and how the original idea evolved into something much more flexible. During this talk we will present a pluggable router architecture that can make Cloud Foundry even more powerful and extensible. We will show how one can attach and register a custom router to appropriately handle specific TCP or UDP based protocols and what new possibilities open for the Cloud Foundry platform.\n\nAbout Roman Swoszowski\nRoman Swoszowski is CTO and VP Cloud Foundry Services at Grape Up. Responsible for developing the overall technology vision of the company with focus on Cloud Foundry and related cloud technologies. With almost 15 years of hands-on experience in the IT industry, he drives the company’s technology strategy and works with engineering teams to ensure continuous delivery of innovative software solutions."
