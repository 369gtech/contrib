description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nThere are many approaches to design and develop the automated unit and integration tests. Each system might require different approach. As a result - there is a whole bunch of materials on it, but still is it enough? Probably not, as still we all see the tests that we think are not good enough, don't we?\n\nYou will find something for you here. You will get a recipe on how to implement it tomorrow in your project as this is not yet another presentation showing the concept, but the code. I will be coding it live, step by step. Going from the very basic setup, showing real life cases. You will see my approach on building and testing modularized app.\n\nYou will get familiar with the whole idea, I will tell when to use it and when not to use it. Also I will show you some nice practices I use every day that makes my tests good. As a bonus you will know the answer to this popular interview question: How do you test your code?"
