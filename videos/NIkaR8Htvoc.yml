description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nErjang is a JVM-based Erlang VM. It runs the latest Erlang release with quite comprehensive compatibility with BEAM: networking, hot code replacement, tail calls, super-light processes, NIF compatibility and more. In this talk I'll explain how all this works, walk though some of the interesting challenges of making Erjang real, and some of the those that lie ahead."
