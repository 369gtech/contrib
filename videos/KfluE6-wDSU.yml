recordingDate: 1579300810
description: "Typescript is in full hype mode right now. Twitter gives us a new hot take daily, but most of us haven’t seen the long term benefits. Dropbox switched to Typescript in 2015 and we’ve seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. In this talk we’ll take a step back from the hype and cover what we’ve learned over the past four years. We’ll discuss how static typing has helped us scale a codebase, and when it’s worth it just to write an any and move on with your life.\n\n\nEVENT:\nReactiveConf 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nMatthew Gerstman\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nConference Organizers provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish ReactiveConf talks."
