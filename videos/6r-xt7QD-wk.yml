description: "The next advances in artificial intelligence will come from robotics. \n\nThe current state of the art in machine learning, also called AI, includes some mind-stretching achievements, but in narrow areas. The path toward building broader human-level intelligence requires us to relax the assumptions built into existing methods. Research in robotics and physical interaction will start us in this direction. \n\nAUTHOR:\n\nBrandon Rohrer\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nCheck out Brandon's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/BrandonRohrer"
