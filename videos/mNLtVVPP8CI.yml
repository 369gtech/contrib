title: 'GeeCON Prague 2019: Tomasz Borowiec - From Developer to Manager... and Back'
recordingDate: 1579081218
description: 'Would you like to become a team leader or a manager some day? Or maybe you already are one? I was a manager. Yes, I was, because I am not anymore. And I would like to tell you my story: How did it happen that I became a manager? What difficulties did I encounter? How did I tackle them? What have I learnt? Why did I go back to being a developer? I will also present a little bit of theory around management and I will share some of my own observations with you. All of this with a jot of humour, which will (hopefully) be a strawberry on top. See you there!'
