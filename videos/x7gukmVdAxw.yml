description: "PyData 2018 \n\nHow fragile is your data science pipeline? Can you recover from a laptop crash? Can you reproduce last year's analysis? (Can your co-workers?) This tutorial will take you through the process of making your data science work reproducible: from using the right tools, to creating reproducible workflows, to patterns for testing, automating, and sharing your results.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
