title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2021 - Lars Hupel - A History of Enterprise Monads'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628208821
description: "The early 2010’s were exciting times for Scala. The language & ecosystem started to professionalize, both from a technical (binary compatibility) and a community point of view (many conferences were started). Not too long after Lightbend – then Typesafe – was founded, I registered the typelevel.org domain on a whim and put together a rudimentary website advertising a few FP-minded Scala libraries. Fast forward to today: Typelevel is known for a wealth of functional libraries, beginner-friendly educational resources, a series of conferences and a distinct ecosystem – including a custom compiler – within the Scala community. In this talk, I’d like to examine what got us there and into the mainstream.\n\nLars is a consultant with INNOQ in Munich, Germany. They are known as one of the founders of the Typelevel initiative which is dedicated to providing principled, type-driven Scala libraries in a friendly, welcoming environment. A frequent conference speaker, they are active in the open source community, particularly in Scala. They also enjoy programming in and talking about Haskell, TypeScript, Prolog, and Rust. Previously, they were a PhD student at TU München in the field of logic and verification. Their research focus was on techniques for verified code generation from theorem provers.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit, www.yowconference.com.au"
