description: "\"Speaker: Jake VanderPlas\n\nThe Python world has a staggering array of data visualization tools, and choosing which to use can seem like a daunting task. But which tool you use is far less important than how you use it. In this talk Iâ€™ll walk through some of the important considerations involved in visualizing your data, so that you can create more effective visualizations no matter which plotting package you use.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
