description: "Google Tech Talk\nMay 31, 2015\n(\"show more\" for more information)\nPresented by Johan Tibell\n\nNote: We are sorry for missing first few minutes of the presentation.\n\nhttps://wiki.haskell.org/ZuriHac2015#Johan_Tibell\n\nABSTRACT\n\nProduction quality code not only needs to compute the correct result, but needs to do so within some given resource constraints (i.e. time and memory). We'll look at the most common optimizations you can use to make your Haskell code perform better and some rules of thumb you can use in your daily Haskell programming to avoid some performance problems \"by design\".\n\nSlides and other resources for this talk are available here:\nhttps://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/tree/master/meetups/20150531-ZuriHac2015_Johan_Tibell-Performance"
