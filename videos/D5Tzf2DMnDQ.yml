description: "This presentation is a detailed case study about the migration of a JSF-based web application from Spring 3 to Java EE 7 and CDI for a major German car manufacturer. It starts with a brief overview of the system architecture and explains the rationale for the migration. It then outlines the similarities and, most importantly, the differences between the two technologies and proceeds to present the patterns and strategies used to map and translate the different concepts from Spring 3 to Java EE 7 with CDI. It further discusses the implications of the migration for the system’s architecture and describes some of the problems and challenges encountered during the migration.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMario-Leander Reimer\nM.-Leander Reimer has studied computer science at Rosenheim and Staffordshire University and received his Master of Science degree in distributed computing.
