title: 'Lea Verou: CSS in the 4th Dimension - JSConf.Asia 2013'
recordingDate: 1387345899
description: "\"CSS2.1 was two dimensional: There was no concept of depth or time. CSS3 brings us some control over both, with transitions and animations for the latter. In this talk we will start from the basics of these specifications, but will quickly move to more advanced tips and tricks to fully leverage these exciting technologies. Expect hands-on coding and Lea's unique presentation style.\"\n \nLea previously worked as a Developer Advocate at W3C and currently spends her days writing & designing her first book (\"CSS Secrets\"), published with O'Reilly in 2014. She has a long-standing passion for open web standards and is blogging, speaking, writing, and coding popular open source projects to help fellow developers. She is an Invited Expert in the CSS Working Group, which architects the language itself. Although she holds a BSc in Computer Science, Lea is one of the few misfits who love code and design equally.\n\nJSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Hotel H2O and Manila Ocean Park, Philippines - 28 + 29 November 2013.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.asia/blog/2013/10/31/jsconfasia-2013-lea-verou-css-in-the-4th-dimension-not-your-daddys-css-animations\nSlides: http://lea.verou.me/css-4d/#intro\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
