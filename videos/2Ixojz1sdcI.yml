description: "Panel: Connected Everything - Why IoT is just getting started\n\nPanel moderator: Robbie Bouschery (Pirates Summit)\nPanelists: Anthony Charbonnier (Sigfox), Jakub Probola (hub:raum), Felix Plitzko (AISLER), Karen Nemeth (Geeny)\n\nHealthcare is currently undergoing a digital revolution, and its rapidly developing relationship with technology is beginning to shape potentially one of the largest sectors in the world. By 2020, it is projected that $102 billion will be spent on health and wellness technology across nine different markets, and the growing value of the global Health Tech market will rise to over $100 trillion. We will discuss the potential and future of this industry.\nThe term Internet of Things has been around for a number of years and every major corporation seems to have it's own IoT program now already. One could think we're already in the middle of change in this field - in this panel we'll explore why many say the topic is really just getting started.\n\nThe panel took place on 2017-05-18 at infoShare 2017 (Startup Stage) in Gda≈Ñsk.\nhttp://infoshare.pl\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
