description: "RubyConfBY 2019 - https://rubyconference.by\n\nVideo Partner â€“ iTechArt https://www.itechart.by \n\nAbout the talk: \nWe are experienced developers. Yet, when we deal with big codebases, we often feel that we don't fully control the situation. The question is what's missing? What is this mysterious thing? \n\nWe continuously learn new things, try new frameworks and approaches, but it doesn't really help. Let's talk why is it happening and how to reclaim the sense of control back."
