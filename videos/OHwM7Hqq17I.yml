description: "“To be tested a system has to be designed to be tested”\nEberhardt Rechtin, “The Art Of System Architecting”\n\nTesting is one of the main activities through which we gather data to assess the quality of our software; this makes testability an important attribute of software – not only for development, but also for maintenance and bug fixing. Design for testability is a term that has its origin in hardware design, where the concept was introduced in order to make it easier testing circuits while reducing the costs of doing so.\n\nIn this talk I’ll show how to translate this concept to the software domain along with the consequences on various aspects of the development activities, both from the technical point of view (e.g., design, code quality, choice of frameworks, etc.), and the product management point of view (e.g., management of team dependencies, delivery time, costs, etc.).\n\nI’ll provide examples based on real world experience, both for the technical and the management aspects. Last but not least, there will be code!"
