description: "A Google TechTalk, June 29, 2016, presented by Itay Hen (USC)\nABSTRACT: Tunneling is widely believed to be the main advantage quantum annealers have over their classical counterparts. \nWith neither provable speedups nor no-go theorems demonstrated, the true power of quantum annealers remains debated.\n\nIn this talk, I will present preliminary results of numerical simulations of simple classical algorithms that contest, at least to some extent, the belief that quantum tunneling is an important resource.\n\nTameem Albash, USC, Peter Young, UCSC\n\nPresented at the Adiabatic Quantum Computing Conference, June 26-29, 2016, at Google's Los Angeles office."
