description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2019 Conference: https://jsnation.com\n\n# Building Fast Angular Applications from End\n\nAngular grew significantly in the past few years from both a tooling and developer experience standpoint. This talk will explore many of the features and newer improvements in the pipeline that allow anyone to build and deploy performant apps with very little overhead.\n\nThrough real demos and examples, we’ll cover Ivy, bundle budgeting, differential loading, automatic code-splitting, and progressive rehydration of SSR elements. In the second part of the talk, we’ll focus on how to efficiently prefetch and preload different modules and components."
