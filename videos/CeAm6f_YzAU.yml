description: "Building a highly available application in the cloud can be difficult given the nature of distributed systems.\n\nIn this session we will look at patterns we can apply to our system as well as features we can use in Microsoft Azure to build system that are resilient to faults and disasters, such as Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Service Bus.\n\n\nNote: Due to technical issues there is no picture until 4:03, and some flicker until 4:37."
