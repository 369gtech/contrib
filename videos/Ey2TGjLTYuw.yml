description: "RejectJS 2013 - http://rejectjs.org - Berlin, September 12, 2013\nSlides: http://gmarty.github.io/jsSMS/Reject.JS-2013-Slides/#/intro\n\n\nTalk description: \"Born as an interpreter, jsSMS is now a hybrid emulator for Sega Master System and Game Gear. It makes uses of static and dynamic recompilation, and fall back to a classical interpreter if required.\n\nFrom parsing to JavaScript generation using an optimised AST, I'll present the different steps to make an emulator fast.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to provide full speed for retro gaming on mobile browser and web app!\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
