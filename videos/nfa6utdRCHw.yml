As such, many are not aware of key differences between desktop browsers and mobile browsers once they are trying to build an app vs a traditional web site, even if adapted for mobile. In this introductory session aimed at desktop developers interested in making the jump to mobile, we will present the technical tricks that are needed to circumvent a mobile browser's own interface (touch and gesture management, viewport and other aspects) to deliver a web app that looks and feels like a native app. We will discuss among other things how to virtualize the browser's own event loop, block swipe and pinch/zoom gestures, pin down the viewport, and a simple trick to build a mobile touch-based app that also works on a desktop browser with mouse events.\n\nAbout Laurent: https://twitter.com/ldhasson\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
