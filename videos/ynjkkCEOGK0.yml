description: 'Please join Nate Schutta and Craig Walls, a software engineer with VMware and the author of Spring in Action, Spring Boot in Action, and Build Talking Apps. He’s a zealous promoter of the Spring Framework, speaking frequently at local user groups and conferences and writing about Spring. When he’s not slinging code, Craig is planning his next trip to Disney World or Disneyland and spending as much time as he can with his wife, two daughters, 1 bird and 3 dogs.'
