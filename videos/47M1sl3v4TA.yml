description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nCollection is not Detection - Sec Ops in a Cloud Native Environment - Sarah Young, Microsoft \n\nSecurity operations have always been hard. How many logs should we collect? Which logs should we collect? How to we respond and remediate things quickly? Then just when you thought you'd got it right for your on-premises, you've decided to move the cloud and have to start all over again... or do you?  In this talk, Sarah will discuss how security operations change from on-prem to the cloud native environment and how to optimise your security operations in a cloud native environment to make use of modern tooling. \n\nhttps://sched.co/aO27"
