description: "Slides http://tjanczuk.github.io/about/jsconf2014.html#/\nHumankind has been scripting JavaScript from other programming environments for generations. Time has come to reverse the roles. Let's script C# from Node.js, in-process. On Windows, Mac, and Linux. Combine the power of single threaded V8 with multi-threaded CLR. Run +70k NPM packages and .NET Framework with +20k NuGet modules and Node.js in one application. Live on the edge of two great technologies using Edge.js."
