description: "Deep Dive: Kubernetes Architecture SIG - Timothy St. Clair, VMware \n\nThis will go into deep coverage of SIG Architecture's subprojects including the KEP process, the API review process, conformance testing review, and code organization. Other topics may include the evolving definition of what is in and out of scope for the project, as well as the latest visualizations of the ecosystem. Attendees should have a much better understanding of project architectural layering, governance, and goals. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPjl"
