description: "Exploring Our User-Base Challenges: Getting Insight From StackOverflow‍ - Javier Salmeron, Bitnami \n\nKubernetes has become the de-facto container orchestration system that developers and system administrator use to go Cloud-Native. As more users adopt Kubernetes, supporting those users has become a critical need. Stackoverflow has been since the inception the place where to get support, even though other channels like Slack are also heavily used. It should not be surprising that the amount of questions in StackOverflow has increased by more than 800% in only two years. Getting to know our users, understand their pain points and and use cases is the best way to improve the ecosystem. In this talk we will show some deep analysis of Stackoverflow questions. We will show the major trends and describe the major pain points felt by our users. We will also discuss the most common use cases discovered and the most familiar tools that people use in combination with k8s. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrTW"
