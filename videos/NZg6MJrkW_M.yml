description: "Serverless computing is one of the preeminent technologies driving cloud adoption and modern applications. Serverless is predicated on the simple mantra: focus on business logic, not servers. While AWS Lambda enabled this new style of computing, today, serverless has grown to be more than just AWS Lambda.\nContainer technologies are evolving to bring developers the same serverless benefits – never manage clusters. Just write code. There is innovation happening at all layers of the stack. Firecracker provides an open source virtualization technology specifically designed for serverless computing.\nIn this talk, we’ll take a look at how the serverless computing has evolved and the myriad of serverless offerings that have been created since then. As the serverless landscape evolves rapidly, we’ll dig into what’s coming next. Is orchestration still relevant in this new paradigm?\nHow will serverless fundamentally change the way we think about application architecture and where do we see the next wave of innovation?"
