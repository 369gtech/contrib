description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAWS OIDC Authentication with SPIFFE at Square - Roy Xu, Square Inc.\n\nAs part of Square’s migration to the cloud, we found that we needed an easy way for our datacenter applications to communicate with services in AWS. We were able to use the existing SPIFFE infrastructure that we’re already using for our service-to-service authentication and extend that to AWS with federated identity through OpenID Connect (OIDC). Our AWS OIDC infrastructure provides automated AWS credentials for applications in our datacenter to assume roles in AWS. We leveraged the SPIRE OIDC Discovery Provider provided by SPIRE paired with spiffe-aws-assume-role, a custom open source tool we wrote to exchange SPIFFE JWTs for AWS credentials. Our new process means that app owners only need to make a simple config change to allow their applications to connect to AWS."
