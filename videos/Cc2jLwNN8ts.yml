description: 'GraalVM is a recent development from Oracle. It''s supposed to replace HotSpot just-in-time compiler technology, but actually, it''s much more. From a JIT compiler to a language implementation framework for JVM to a native image generator, it''s going to change how software for JVM is written and run. During the presentation, we will explore the new possibilities and benefits provided by GraalVM. The presentation deck is available at https://bit.ly/3052X63'
