language: English
recordingDate: 1632325449
description: "As all aspects of our lives become more distributed and the galaxy gets ever smallerâ€”someday we'll go anywhere in the alpha quadrant at warp speed, wait and see! \n \n Distributed systems are the future, and anyone who says otherwise is probably selling monoliths. With the number of applications and cloud regions expanding at a dizzying rate, communication is key. \n \n In this session, we'll take you through a live-coding adventure exploring various powerful options for data transport among your critical services. \n \n Topics covered may include some or all of the following:\n \n - Reactive Streams\n - Server Sent Events\n - WebSocket\n - RSocket\n - Message-based interactions using messaging platforms, e.g. RabbitMQ, Kafka\n \n All examples will be coded live and in real-time using live flight and weather data. Come to this session to learn how to use all of the tools in engineering to enable your enterprise to transport data at warp speed!\n\nMark Heckler, Cloud Advocate, Java/JVM Languages at Microsoft\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/transporting-data-at-warp-speed-how-to-connect-spring-boot-apps-quickly-powerfully-and-painlessly"
