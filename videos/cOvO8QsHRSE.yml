description: "Google Tech Talks\nOctober 26, 2006\n\nMike Linksvayer\n\nABSTRACT\nCreative Commons provides tools that enable the legal sharing and re-use of creative and educational materials online. Come learn about Creative Commons, what they're doing, and how Google might help. Creative Commons' general counsel will be on hand to answer questions about CC copyright licenses and other legal issues, but the presentation will focus on technical projects at Creative Commons: license-aware web search, microformats, reliable metadata-embedding in various media types, and licensing integration with user generated content platforms.
