recordingDate: 1523543412
description: "In every work project, both colleagues and clients look to project managers (PM) for leadership and direction. But when it comes to down to it, PMs rarely have direct power over anyone involved in a project. Instead we rely on our soft skills and winning personalities to coax, entice, and charm people into doing our bidding. And some days, that just doesn't cut it.\n\nWhile reading about content marketing and methods for influencing consumers, I began to wonder if I could apply those techniques to my own work. What can PMs learn from marketers? How might we use the dark arts of digital marketing to drive and motivate our colleagues, guide our projects, and achieve our ultimate goals?\n\nAttendees will learn tips and tricks in getting results from both clients and coworkers. Using the insights of human psychology, as they apply to projects, will help project managers, project leads, product leads, or anyone who has to use their influence to achieve successful project outcomes."
