description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nPeople often complain about C++: to some, it's not memory-safe enough, not type-safe enough. Some will tell you that some (or all!) of its defaults are wrong. Many complain that it's too expert-friendly.\n\nThere's often a grain of truth in criticism, and C++ surely has a bit of each of these alleged warts; it's a language that has history, obviously, and that has evolved organically over the years, and it has the imperfections we can expect for a tool used by millions to perform high-performance or safety- critical tasks in various application domains.\n\nHowever, there are a significant number of things C++ does right, and there are a number of reasons why we love this language... and love it so much that we gather together to trade ideas, learn about it, understand it better... and enjoy it all!\n\nThis talk is about some of the things C++ does right. It does not aim to provide an exhaustive list (far from it!), or to throw arrows at other languages (although there will be comparisons), nor does it aim to offer an apologetic perspective on C++. This talk is about some of those things one misses when using other languages, and aims to remind us of some of those things that make C++ beautiful, fun and efficient.\n\n---\nPatrice Roy has been playing with C++, either professionally, for pleasure or (most of the time) both for over 25 years. After a few years doing R&D and working on military flight simulators, he moved on to academics and has been teaching computer science since 1998. Since 2005, he’s been involved more specifically in helping graduate students and professionals from the fields of real-time systems and game programming develop the skills they need to face today’s challenges. The rapid evolution of C++ in recent years has made his job even more enjoyable. He’s been a participating member in the ISO C++ Standards Committee since late 2014 and has been involved with the ISO Programming Language Vulnerabilities Committee since late 2015. He has five kids, and his wife ensures their house is home to a continuously changing number of cats, dogs and other animals.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
