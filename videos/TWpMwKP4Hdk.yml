description: "Since React is just a “view framework”, it leaves you with lots of options for how to architect the deeper parts of your stack. The best way to handle those deeper layers is by using Redux – a state container that allows you to write much of your application in the form of pure functions. Using Redux helps you write applications that are much easier to test and understand and to achieve more thorough separation between your views and your business logic. Redux also unlocks the possibility of using amazing tools.\n\nEvent sponsored by Rangle http://rangle.io/ and Microsoft Canada \n\nYuri Takhteyev\nhttps://twitter.com/qaramazov\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
