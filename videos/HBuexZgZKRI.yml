description: "Growing an engineering organization with effective DevOps\n\nMost of us hope that our engineering organizations will grow and scale with the success of our businesses, but that growth is often easier said than done. The strategies that worked when all your engineers could all sit and work in the same room won’t necessarily be successful when your engineering org has grown to hundreds of people. How can you scale up your engineering organization and still maintain an effective collaborative culture?\n\nThis talk will look at organizational scaling through the lens of Effective Devops, introducing the four pillars of Collaboration, Affinity, Scaling, and Tools, and then focusing on scaling specifically within engineering. We will examine the idea of the devops compact and how it can serve to guide growth throughout the organizational lifecycle. This talk will use the ideas of effective devops to help the audience consider questions such as:\n\nWhat are the benefits of single-function teams versus cross-functional teams?\nHow can you prevent unhealthy silos from forming?\nWhen do you need a dedicated team for X?\nHow do you balance scaling technical skills with growing “soft” skills?\nOrganizational growth is a complex topic with no one-size-fits-all answer, but listeners will learn how to apply the principles of effective devops to find solutions that fit their own organizations.\n\nABOUT KATHERINE DANIELS\n\nKatherine Daniels is a senior operations engineer at Etsy who got their start in programming with TI-80 calculators back when GeoCities was still cool. These days, they have opinions on things like monitoring, on-call usability, and devops. Before escaping to the world of operations, Katherine spent a few years doing R&D and systems engineering in the corporate world. Katherine lives in Brooklyn with a perfectly reasonable number of cats and in their spare time can often be found rock climbing or handcrafting knitted server koozies for the data center.\n\n--\n\nWhen you’re busy leading a team, coding and maintaining standards, how do you find the time to stay ahead of new technologies and develop yourself as a technical lead?\n\nThe Lead Developer conference features practical advice from experts on leading and motivating your team and high-level sessions on new and disruptive technologies.\n\nGet tickets at theleaddeveloper.com"
