description: 'For ten years now, app developers have wanted to integrate Gmail features into their apps, and until now the only way to do so was to implement full IMAP.  Starting this week, the new Gmail API gives RESTful access to the user''s Gmail threads, labels and messages, and does so with high performance, APIary level control and SLAs and with SDK level access for client side developers.  We''ll show the API in action, highlight some 3party early adopters, and show how you can use it to power your apps.'
