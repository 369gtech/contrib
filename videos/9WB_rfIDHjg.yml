title: 'Webinar: How to Promote the use of Best Practices & Automate Security Policies'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592503981
description: "Securing containers against attacks in multiple deployments and different geolocations requires integrating security into multiple points in the pipeline. Using manual processes to impose the policies is error-prone. Automation is a key to ensure the best practices and the policies are applied consistently without losing business velocity. In the webinar, NeuVector CTO Gary Duan will provide an overview of security integration points in the CI/CD pipeline. He will focus on integrating vulnerability scanning, admission controls, and run-time security by using tools such as Open Policy Agent (OPA), Kubernetes Admission Controls, and Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD). He will demo how to use these tools for security integration as well as how to extend security using third-party tools.\n\nPresenter:\n\nGary Duan, CTO and Co-Founder\_@NeuVector"
