title: 'Only SQL: Empower data analysts end-to-end with Flink SQL'
recordingDate: 1635787803
description: "Customers and companies are becoming more digital and the amount of available data is growing every day. Traditionally, engineers were needed to implement business logic via data pipelines before business users can start using it. In this talk, we would explain how data analysts and non-engineers can use only Flink SQL to explore and transform data into insights and actions, without writing any Java or Python code. This includes: \n\n- Exploring clickstream data and creating a trigger to display a notification to a customer when visiting a specific page.\n- Combine speech-to-text data with clickstream data to redirect a calling customer to your website, displaying a notification to help the customer achieve its goal on your website and achieve call reduction.\n- Applying frequency capping by changing the notification to the customer after it has been displayed more than 3 times in the last minute."
