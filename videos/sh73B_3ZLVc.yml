title: 'IoT Solution Recipes - Beyond your first slice of Raspberry Pi - Adam Stephensen & Valeriia Savenko'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620632097
description: "By 2025, it is estimated that there will be more than 75 billion IoT devices. IoT is driving efficiency and innovation in government, business and our homes. The challenge many projects face is they donâ€™t get past a prototype. Productionising IoT gets complex fast. In this demo heavy session we will build and demonstrate Azure IoT solutions that can go all the way to production based on our work helping government and commercial customers across Australia. If you are looking to go beyond a prototype and want your IoT solution in production - this is the session for you.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
