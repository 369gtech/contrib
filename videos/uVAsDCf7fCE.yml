description: "\"Cloud adoption & DevOps methodology are dramatically changing how forward-looking organizations innovate today. In the midst of this transformation, Security owners are finding that the traditional methods of integrating security into this new world is not keeping pace with the highly agile continuous software delivery model. The traditional perimeter, on-premises or hardware-based security controls are often perceived as inhibitors to the speed & agility our modern-day developers require.\n\nCodify your security policy at the beginning of the software journey. Include security and policy as part of your DevOps culture by using the tools & platform your developer already uses, enabling security to become a shared responsibility for the entire organization. \n\nThe best part? This Policy as Code will be enforced across the infrastructure (Kube, VMs, ADC, Firewalls, and Clouds)!\""
