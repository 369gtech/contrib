description: "Presentation from the 'Agile Riga Day 2012' conferenece.\r\n\r\nBecoming agile is not an easy task, especially if you are working in public sector project. Though it is possible and we have managed to do it. Here is our advice on how to do it:\r\nSeek for opportunities. Public sector project carry pretty heavy burden of administrative work, which does not go well together with strive of agile practices to eliminate waste. Though sometimes things which seem to us as obstacles at the first glance, are in fact opportunities. We will teach you how to use some of them.\r\nStart small. Starting all is often scary, and build resistance to agile practices on both customer and supplier side. By implementing practice by practice you will have enough time to gain trust and build confidence of the team.\r\nWork harder! When you start using agile practices in software development, all team members both on customer and supplier side have to commit to following them. Lack of commitment justified by lack of understanding or complexity of chosen approach might actually hide bigger problem - insufficient ability to deliver. Sometimes it is enough just to start working.\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.agilerigaday.lv/Sessions/becoming-agile-in-public-sector-project"
