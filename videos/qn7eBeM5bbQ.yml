description: "We live in a world full of user interfaces. In 2019, we are spending so much time on our screens it’s more reasonable to count how much time we’re not spending looking at a screen than it is to count how many hours we are. Screens as we think of them are problematic. They’re mostly just 2D rectangular display devices. Rapid changes in what is possible with today’s hardware has opened up the world of 3D user interfaces to the designer/developer.\n\nThe new computing frontier of extended reality is here, and building good 3-D user interfaces is what makes or breaks an XR experience. In this talk Hasan will be providing some background on how the relatively niche field of research in 3D UI has become critically important to understand.\n\nHasan Ahmad\nPrincipal Consultant, Aquent DEV6\nhttps://fitc.ca/speaker/hasan-ahmad/?event=29567\n\nAt Aquent DEV6, Hasan delivers next-generation applications for very large enterprise companies.
