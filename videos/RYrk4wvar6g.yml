description: "by Maurizio Cimadamore\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.1302/bytebuffers.webm\n\nAbstract: Direct buffers are, to date, the only way to access foreign,\noff-heap memory. Despite their success, direct buffers suffer from some\nlimitations --- stateful-ness, lack of addressing space,\nnon-deterministic deallocation to name a few --- which makes them a\nless-than-ideal choice under certain workloads. In this talk we paint\nthe path to the future: a safe, supported and efficient foreign memory\naccess API for Java. By providing a more targeted solution to the\nproblem of accessing foreign memory, not only developers will be freed\nby the above limitations - but they will also enjoy improved\nperformances, as the new API is designed from the ground-up with JIT\noptimizations in mind - and all without sacrificing memory access safety.\n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 11:20:00"
