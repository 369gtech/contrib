They're also frequently turning to apps to purchase physical goods and services right from their device. Merchants are responding, making tap and pay more widely available, and making transactions as seamless as possible in their apps. Google is launching Android Pay, the way to pay in-store and in-app with your Android device. In this session, we'll showcase how Android Pay was built on the pillars of simplicity, security and choice. We'll also discuss opportunities for developers to innovate with us on mobile payments at Android scale.\n\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
