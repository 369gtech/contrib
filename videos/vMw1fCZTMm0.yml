title: 'GeeCON 2018: Marcin Zaj?czkowski - Is Spock still needed in the time of Junit 5?'
recordingDate: 1532330827
description: 'Spock was a game changer for all the people struggling with unit testing in JUnit 4. Compact syntax, parameterized tests or flexibility to mention just a few advantages. Over 10 years after JUnit 4.0, the brand new, written from scratch, Java 8 optimized Junit 5 has been released. Is it still worth to write tests in Spock? During my presentation I will compare selected areas of Spock and JUnit 5 to give you an overview how the situation looks like in 2018. I will try to answer the question if its time for Spock to fade into oblivion.'
