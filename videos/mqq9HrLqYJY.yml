description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay 22, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe old idea of impulse radio dates back to Marconi's first wireless transmissions using sparks. Unlike\nmost wireless today, impulse radio transmissions are extremely wideband signals. The recently FCC-\nreleased frequency band from 3.1GHz to 10.6GHz is the widest unlicensed frequency band ever released (7.5GHz). This ultra wide bandwidth (UWB) is commercially explored for even faster data transfer using traditional, multi-band (OFDM) RF techniques. However, the available bandwidth is wide enough for impulse radio transmission giving new functionality and new implementation challenges. \n \nIn this talk I will show how power efficient impulse radio solutions are feasible in standard digital CMOS\ntechnology. Quite non-standard and untraditional design strategies must be used including time-domain\nsignal processing. Circuit topologies for higher order Gaussian pulse generation and power efficient,\ncorrelating RAKE receivers will be explained. Impulse radio transmissions have additional interesting properties compared to narrowband modulation. \n\nWith time-domain processing (TDOA) highly accurate positioning is feasible in the millimeter range. Improved sensitivity for robust communication.  Large number of channels (greater than 100).\n\nNovel applications are also feasible using impulse transmission. Combining novel design techniques like\n\"Swept-Threshold sampling\" and digital lossless integration, micropower impulse radar is feasible in\nCMOS. A 60GHz sampler is used to accumulate and recover reflected electromagnetic energy. These\nnew sensing devices (medical radar) may be explored for reading vital body signs (pulse, breathing, blood pressure?) embedded in your car seat or hospital emergency bed (detached sensor). Just imagine what you can do looking though heavy matter! Single chip CMOS impulse radar will be demonstrated at the end of the talk.\n\nSpeaker: Tor Sverre Lande \nTor Sverre (Bassen) Lande is a professor in Microelectronics at the Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo.
