description: "Introducing Log Cache - A New Restful Interface for Observing Distributed Systems - Adam Hevenor, Pivotal\n\nThe Firehose provides a highly available stream of logs, but requires consumers to bring their own infinitely scalable data store. \n\nIn this Product update for Loggregator Adam will walk through some of the pain points operators were experiencing with the current streaming system and introduce a new component of the Loggregator system known as Log-cache. Adam will provide an overview of how the log-cache system works and is architected in cf-deployment along with a demo of the functionality using the log-cache CLI. Adam will also demo how easy it is to create integrations with log-cache and what the future Roadmap for Loggregator + Log Cache looks like.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyS/introducing-log-cache-a-new-restful-interface-for-observing-distributed-systems-adam-hevenor-pivotal"
