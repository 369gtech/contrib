language: English
recordingDate: 1513433277
description: "We are taught to program computers by using branching, loops and accumulators. When we write our loops we  also mix in all sorts  of other concerns. This makes for a very difficult situation re parallelization.  I will present some ideas from the famous Array Programming languages APL and J and make the case that learning Array Thinking should be in your future.\n\nDavid Leibs is a Senior Researcher at Oracle Labs. His research interests include Graphical Programming Languages, Compiler Front-ends, Meta-Programming, Active Libraries, and high performance Array Programming libraries. \n\nDavid is currently in the Virtual Machine Research Group working on a \"reactive\" and \"lively\" graphical programming interface used for technical computing.\n\nIn his past David was responsible for productizing Smalltalk-80 at Xerox Parc and ParcPlace and was responsible for Visualworks.  He has used Mathematica for 15 years.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
