description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nSheng Liang - CTO Cloud Platforms at Citrix Systems\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this session you will learn how enterprises can now implement an on-premise infrastructure that lets you run legacy and native cloud applications on a cloud-style IaaS platform, while retaining traditional controls over the physical layer. This allows you to prepare your cloud adoption in phases, while moving workloads back and forth as required to support the needs of your application lifecycles and organizational readiness as you make the transition to the cloud.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
