title: 'KotlinConf 2017 - Building Kotlin Applications at Scale with Gradle by Hans Dockter'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510747847
description: "Once your Kotlin library or application crosses over 10,000 lines, it becomes especially important for your build tool to avoid building the whole project and process only what is necessary — unless you want to spend your days chair-swordfighting.\n\nThis is why incrementality and work avoidance are key features of Kotlin and Gradle tooling, just as discoverability and debuggability are when you need them.\n\nIn this session, we demonstrate performance and traceability features of Gradle and the Kotlin Gradle Plugin that are essential for scaling your Kotlin applications.\n\nHans Dockter is the founder and project lead of the Gradle build system and the CEO of Gradle Inc. Hans is a thought leader in the field of build automation and has successfully been in charge of numerous large-scale enterprise builds. He is also an advocate of Domain Driven Design, having taught classes and delivered presentations on this topic together with Eric Evans. In the earlier days, Hans was also a committer for the JBoss project and founded the JBoss-IDE."
