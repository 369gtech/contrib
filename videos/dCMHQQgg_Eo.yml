description: 'Ever wanted to contribute a module to CPAN but found it difficult to navigate the in''s and out''s of the labyrinth? I''m a first time contributor that also found it hard to know what to do and what not to do. I still don''t know everything but if you come to this talk you should leave knowing at least a little bit more about how to get your code added to CPAN.'
