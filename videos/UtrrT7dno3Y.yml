description: "Blockchain Essentials & Blockchain-as-a-Service on CloudFoundry - Gurvinder Ahluwalia & Gari Singh, IBM\n\nBlockchain is a new pattern of distributed transaction systems with private or public immutable ledger properties arrived through decentralized consensus algorithms across peer nodes. Recent milestones have created the Hyperledger Project as an Open Source Blockchain and delivered Blockchain-as-a-Service for the first time on a CloudFoundry-based commercial cloud provider. The three broad applications of Blockchain are as a platform for exchange of tangible and intangible assets, as a trusted source of truth, and to run smart contracts. This session will explain Blockchain, its uses, and its relationship to the cloud world. The session will elaborate on four consensus technology approaches, other architecture considerations and practices important to your Blockchain-based visioning or projects. Blockchain business use cases in Financial Services, Internet of Things, Business Contracts, Supply Chain Management and Provenance will be outlined. The session will demo an application built using Blockchain-as-a-Service running on a CloudFoundry-based provider cloud.\n\nGurvinder Ahluwalia \nIBM\nCTO Cloud Technical Solutioning\nDallas\nGurvinder Ahluwalia is the CTO for the Cloud Technical Solutioning unit at IBM covering NA and an early member of IBM's technical community working on Blockchain.
