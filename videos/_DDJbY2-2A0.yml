title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Car Hacking Village - Brent Stone - CAN be super secure Bit Smashing FTW'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597621961
description: 'Bit smashing CAN transceivers are already on the market and cost pennies. Using them would make vehicles, robots, and medical devices effectively immune from almost every layer 2 attack including denial of service. Brent explains why this security measure works so well. This is also a call to action for industries using exclusively multicast ICS protocols like CAN to invest the less than $5/platform to greatly improve their product''s security.'
