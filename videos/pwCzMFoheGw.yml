description: "Presented by Demetrios Papadopoulos at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday January 29th 2015 - Lovefield is providing a feature rich, cross-browser database query engine built using IndexedDB as a backend. It provides an intuitive SQL-like declarative syntax and it is closing a gap in the web development ecosystem that was created by the deprecation of WebSQL back in 2010.\n\n* github.com/google/lovefield"
