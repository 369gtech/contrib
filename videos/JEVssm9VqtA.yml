description: "Kim Schlesinger, ReactiveOps & diversity\n\nBeing able to transform a junior engineer into an excellent mid, then senior engineer is a competitive advantage for any company. Unfortunately, there aren't many entry-level SRE job postings, and if your company hasn't hired juniors before, you'll need to make changes in order to create an environment where they can thrive.\n\nThis talk is the story of a junior Web Developer turned SRE. I've been able to successfully transition into my role because my company has embraced junior engineers by creating a 'Culture of Error,' encouraging all engineers to be mentors, and ensuring that all employees take time during the day to learn new skills.\n\nBy end of this talk, I'll share the specific details, and you will have a roadmap for how to support junior SREs during their first day, month, 90 days and year.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
