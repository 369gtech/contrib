title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: One Site to Rule Them All'
recordingDate: 1493192913
description: "This\_project for Obermeyer, the Aspen-based ski company, began with a broad set of challenges, including three seperate websites,\_three distinct audiences, and independent ERP and B2B ordering systems. The goal was to optimize Obermeyer’s digital processes and consolidate their connections with customers through a single, well-integrated platform.\n\nTo meet the needs of each audience — or user group — we prioritized user experience. Throughout the process, we had to consider the following:\n\nB2C users complete final purchases on one of Obermeyer’s 3rd party dealer websites\nB2B users buy product through Obermeyer’s website with purchase orders (no cash transactions)\nVIP users are provided discounts on items that can be purchased directly from Obermeyer in exchange for completing a brief online training\nMerging three separate websites from Drupal 6 into\_a single site on Drupal 8 was a complex process that included careful design and testing. After launching,\_we monitored the site carefully, using A/B tests and anonymous using recording\_to determine whether customers experiencing the site as intended.\_\n\nThe\_audience will learn how an iterative design process and consistent testing helped succesfully launch\_the first\_Drupal 8 enterprise ecommerce website."
