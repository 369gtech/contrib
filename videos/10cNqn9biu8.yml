description: "To Infinity! Let’s Build a Buildpack - Dr. Nic Williams, Stark & Wayne \n\nCloud Foundry is now almost infinitely configurable thanks to user-provided buildpacks, multi-buildpacks, and new support for sidecars. It is important for developers, operators, and management to know of the full power of Cloud Foundry as a lifetime container management platform.\n  \n  In this session we bite off one small piece - a look at how to build your own buildpacks, how to bundle assets, how to change environment variables, create files, and to run sidecars.\n  \n  This session will introduce you to the Buildpack Core teams toolchain to allow you to rapidly create, test, and deploy your own buildpacks. I will review my own buildpacks, which use their tools, during this session.\"\n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
