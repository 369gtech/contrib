description: "The invokedynamic instruction (part of JSR 292) has been around since JDK7. Since its introduction, four years ago, we have seen its adoption by many of the JVM’s most popular languages, including Java itself. Despite its importance to most languages that run on the JVM, many developers still do not understand how it is used or implemented. Most resources available about JSR 292 are aimed at language implementers who are experts in compiler theory and language design. This session is different and offers an overview of JSR 292 for people who are curious about how things work but do not necessarily spend all day working on Java bytecode.\n\nSpeaker:\nDavid Buck, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\nA member of the Java JVM sustaining team, I have been doing some combination of supporting, troubleshooting, or fixing JVM issues for over 8 years. Originally a JRockit engineer, I currently work on both of Oracle's JVMs. I have spoken about Java at events both here in Japan and abroad. I have also coauthored Japan's #1 book on WebLogic Server and maintain an OTN blog where I write about various technical issues related to the JVM."
