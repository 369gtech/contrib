description: "Internet of Things (IoT) devices have always been vulnerable to a variety of security issues. In 2013, Independent Security Evaluators (ISE) performed research on IoT devices that showed how rich feature sets could be leveraged to compromise devices. Today, we show that security controls put in place by device manufacturers are insufficient against attacks carried out by remote adversaries. This talk summarizes some of the best stories from our research project aimed to uncover and leverage new techniques to circumvent these new security controls in embedded devices.\n\nBio:\nRick Ramgattie @RRamgattie is a Senior Security Analyst and Team Lead at Independent Security Evaluators (ISE), where he conducts high-end, custom security assessments of computer hardware, software products, and manages a team of security researchers. As someone who appreciates the art of reverse engineering, he has taken part in hands-on security assessments of complex systems, IoT devices, and many different native and mobile applications. Rick enjoys RE, exploit dev, and reading.\n\nIan Sindermann, a Security Analyst at Independent Security Evaluators (ISE), as well as a researcher for ISEâ€™s newly formed research division, ISE Labs. His day-to-day duties include conducting rigorous security assessments on a wide variety of web applications, researching the security posture of various IoT devices, and sharing knowledge whenever possible. His background is somewhat varied, with a primarily self-taught education, prior experience as a wannabe Linux admin, and a childhood spent as a traveling performer. Interests include hardware hacking, legacy systems, mainframes, and whatever tech obscurities he can get his hands on."
