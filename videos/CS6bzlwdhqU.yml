title: 'HTTP Load Balancing With Docker and nginx'
recordingDate: 1480993636
description: "nginx can be used as both: as a HTTP server and as a load balancer. In this screencast I used nginx to balance the load between two TomEE instances.\n\nThe Docker images in this screencast were borrowed from: https://github.com/AdamBien/docklands\n\nAlso checkout load balancing with HAProxy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lw9YO5oU0U\n\nSee you at http://airhacks.com, http://airhacks.io or at least at http://airhacks.tv :-)"
