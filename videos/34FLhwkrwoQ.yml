description: "Tandberg Telecom, also known as just TANDBERG - the videoconferencing company - was a very successful organization started from scratch around 1990 and then, during the next two decades, effectively competing and systematically outperforming all other market players in the videoconferencing industry.\n\nBy 2010, TANDBERG was a billion dollar business with a 50% marketshare and 1700 employees worldwide. In April 2010, TANDBERG was aquired by the american tech behemoth Cisco Systems for 19 billion norwegian kroners (3.3 billion USD).\n\nTANDBERG (1990-2010) was a legendary success that deserves to be praised and studied. TANDBERG was characterized by a unique organization culture, a fantastic sales force, very competent and charismatic leadership, but perhaps first of all, it had an engineering team that was able to churn out spectacular and successful products.\n\n\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
