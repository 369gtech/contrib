description: "The talk from DevOps Fest 2020 Online conference. \nPresentation: https://bit.ly/2YYWvyv\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/DevOpsFest/\nWebsite: https://www.devopsfest.com.ua/\n\nGitHub released its new CI/CD platform called \"\"Actions\"\" on the 13th of November this year. Since then it was rumored to be the \"\"be-all, end-all\"\" of build automation tools for open source developers.\nIn this talk we'll look at what GitHub Actions offers us as a maintainer of an OSS project, what benefits (and drawbacks?) it has compared to established platforms such as AppVeyor, TravisCI, CircleCI, and how easy (or hard?) is it to get started today.\nWe'll also take a look at how you can author your own custom automation scenarios (i.e. actions) to create complex pipelines and see how that helps with maintainability."
