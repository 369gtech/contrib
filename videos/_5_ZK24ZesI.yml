title: 'SREcon18 Asia/Australia - Automatic Traffic Scheduling for Internet Connectivity Failures'

description: "Liuqing Zhang, Baidu Inc.\n\nWhen it comes to high availability (HA) or user experience (UE), people often think about the stability of backend services or product design. Network connectivity, especially the Internet connectivity, is neglected. This might partly come from the impression that network is usually stable. Our observation shows that network failures are far from scarce, at least in China. Every week, we detect 3-5 PoP failures, 5-10 backbone failures breaking the connectivity at the province level. Most of the failures can be remedied by modifying DNS setting to bypass the broken path. The remediation depends on two systems, the detection system and the traffic scheduling system.\n\nThe detection system must detect failures precisely and punctually. Besides dedicated monitoring agents, we recruit volunteering agents to improve coverage and punctually. Dealing with their heterogeneity and unpredictable presence is crucial to the detection performance.\n\nThe traffic scheduling system is responsible for detouring the traffic to the correct path. It must consider not only the connectivity of external network links, but also the usersâ€™ experience and the load of target IDCs.\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce how to implement and use the above two systems to handle Internet connectivity failures.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
