description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia November 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nBernd Rücker - Co-founder and Chief Technologist of Camunda and co-author of “Real-Life BPMN\"\n\nABSTRACT\nThese days, many teams favor loose coupling, isolation and autonomy of services and therefore typically opt for event-driven and reactive architectures, using a communication pattern known as choreography.​\nBernd Rücker believes that choreography is beneficial in some situations, but that it is far from the holy grail of integration.​\nIn some scenarios, it increases coupling, often accidentally and to a dangerous degree. Orchestration is a better choice for some situations but is often bashed for introducing tight coupling. Bernd will debunk some of these myths and show how orchestration can even reduce coupling in some situations and work in an asynchronous, message-driven fashion [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:23 Orchestration vs choreography\n03:47 Example\n04:25 Synchronous call chains\n05:46 Asynchronous call chains\n06:22 Choreography or orchestration?\n07:49 Event-driven\n09:31 P2P event chains\n16:10 Decide about responsibility\n19:56 Stateful orchestration\n22:15 Glue code e.g. Java\n23:07 Using a workflow engine\n24:20 Challenge: Command vs event\n31:04 Your IT architecture\n31:44 Summary\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/november-2020/sessions/1654/balancing-choreography-and-orchestration\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#EventDrivenArchitecture #SoftwareArchitecture #EventDriven #PinballMachineArchitecture #EventChains #StatefulOrchestration #Java #WorkflowEngine #Monolith #Microservices #ChaosEngineering\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
