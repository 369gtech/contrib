description: "Winning card games with 1000+ CPUs\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-27 - Fintry [PyData]]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy vincent warmerdam, Bas Harenslak\n\nVincent was playing a card game against his girlfriend and he kept loosing. So he wanted to train a bot to play on his behalf. This is our story.\n\nWe’re using AWS Lambda to get better at a card game named SushiGO. We make a small genetic algorithm in Python that uses AWS Lambda as a backend. The talk consists of these parts:\n\n\nQuick Explanation of the rules of the SushiGo Card Game\nTranslation of real life to an algorithm\nExplain why this problem needs a lot of CPU\nExplain why AWS Lambda fits the simulation use-case \nHow to quickly hack Concurrency in Python\nHow to deploy lambda very quickly with chalice \nExperimentation Results \n\n\nThis talk will discuss an algorithm that we’ve tried to improve in three ways:\n\n\nApplying simple maths to make the search algorithm better\nThrowing lots (lots!) of CPU’s against the problem by leveraging AWS Lambda and python concurrency\n\n\nWe will conclude by discussing whether or not AWS Lambda is suitable for a gridsearch/grid simulation (hint, it’s not meant for this task, but it actually kind of works very well).\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
