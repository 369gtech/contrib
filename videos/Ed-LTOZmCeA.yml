description: "EDR solutions have landed in Linux. With the ever increasing footprint of Linux machines deployed in data centers, offensive operators have to answer the call.\n\nIn the first part of the talk we will share practical tips and techniques hackers can use to slide under the EDR radar, and expand post-exploitation capabilities.\n\nWe will see how approved executables could be used as decoys to execute foreign functionality. We will walk through the process of using well known capabilities of the dynamic loader. We will take lessons from user-land root-kits in evasion choices.\n\nPart two will focus on weaponizing the capabilities. We will show how to create custom preloaders, and use mimicry to hide modular malware in memory. We will create a \"Preloader-as-a-Service\" capability of sorts by abstracting storage of modular malware from its executing cradles. This PaaS is free to you though!\n\nWe fully believe the ability to retool in the field matters, so we have packaged the techniques into reusable code patterns in a toolkit you will be able to use (or base your own code on) after it is released.\n\nThis talk is for hackers, offensive operators, malware analysts and system defenders. We sincerely hope defensive hackers can attend and also have fun.\n\nDimitry Snezhkov\nDimitry Snezhkov is a Sr. Security Consultant for X-Force Red.
