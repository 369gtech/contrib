description: "Speaker : Etienne Caron\n\nIn this session, we'll bridge the real and the virtual. We'll first explore how to build a simple Android Things powered robot. This simple robot car uses both off-the-shelf and 3d printed parts.\n\nThen we'll close by building a simple Augmented-Reality remote control app. We'll be using Google's ARCore and Sceneform libraries.\n\nSome familiarity with Kotlin and OpenGL is helpful, but not required."
