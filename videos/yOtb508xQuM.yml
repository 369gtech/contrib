However, the C++14 standard does not allow for actual asynchronous programming, as the only ways to interact with an std::future are blocking calls. The proposed then helps, but the interface is awkward and can be extremely slow when handling exceptions. Here, I will talk about completion a high-performance, async-only and monadic alternative to std::future and how it is used at SolidFire.\n— \nTravis work at SolidFire on a high-performance, fault-tolerant distributed system, where he is responsible for developing tools to make building systems easier and safer. He is a bit of a programming language nerd and is a big fan of where Rust is going (eventually). If you find Travis during the day without coffee or during the night without whiskey, there is a problem.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
