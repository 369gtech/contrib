title: 'Pablo Barros -- The Agile Architecture Roadmap'
recordingDate: 1394181027
description: "Bio:\n\nPablo Barros is a software design enthusiast and determined to \"keep it simple\" while building and delivering against full solution specs. As Applications Architect at Oracle, Pablo defines and manages the pipeline of future architecture-related changes needed in the application to support upcoming Product changes. Previously, Pablo has worked in different startups focusing mostly in delivering scalable SaaS systems, mainly in E-commerce. Pablo hates meetings and loves well-oiled agile teams that deliver products in a lean fashion.\n\n\n\nPresentation:\nThe Agile Architecture Roadmap\nLanguage: EN\n\nProduct backlogs describe only the roadmap of the system from a feature set perspective, leaving architectural decisions to be made as needed in order to support new features. However, as products grow, architectural decisions become more complex and costly. In this session, we discuss how introducing an \"Architecture Roadmap\" in parallel with your \"Product Roadmap\" can help you creating and managing the vision for the Architecture of your system and allowing you to better plan for core changes needed to support your Product future growth."
