description: "From Ignite Velocity 2015 in New York: There’s a perception that it takes a “good ear” to hear when something’s in tune. Nothing could be further from the truth. You just need to know the math behind the music, and what to listen for, and you can tune a guitar better in 30 seconds than 99.2% of professional musicians.\n\nIn this talk Baron will explain a bit of music theory and how to listen to the sound of two notes clapping — and then give a demo. You won’t listen to music the same again.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreilly\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
