description: "Finding and Resolving Problems at Scale\n\nBen Maurer, Facebook\n\nLarge scale systems fail in surprising ways.

This talk is about breakage, debugging and building long term scalable solutions from those experiences.\n\nView the full SREcon14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon14/program"
