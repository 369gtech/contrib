Although there are many domains where visual programming languages are popular, like in procedural architecture, graphics design, electronics design or ETL, visual programming languages never took off on a broader scale.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/wojciech-danilo\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - PIOTR MOCZURAD\nMember of the Luna team, Haskell developer\n\nHaskell developer in the Luna language team, changing the way people think about software development. Always a functional programming enthusiast, especially Scala and Haskell. As to my academic career: just got my MSc in Computer Science from AGH University of Science and Technology, now I am a doctoral candidate there, working on seamlessly integrating serverless architecture with visual and functional programming.\n\nMore on Piotr Moczurad: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/piotr-moczurad\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
