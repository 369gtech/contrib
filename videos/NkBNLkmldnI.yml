description: "The Java Ecosystem Collision: What is the Future of Cloud Native? - Erin Schnabel, IBM\n\n Changes in cloud orchestration technologies have started to push the boundaries between Cloud Native applications and their environment.\n\nThe notion of smart endpoints gave rise to shared libraries, like Ribbon from Netflix, to encapsulate outbound service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance. Now new technologies, like Istio, call that paradigm into question, suggesting those concerns should move out of the app and back into the infrastructure. What does that mean for Java applications using Netflix integrations in Spring Cloud?\n\nThe emergence of reactive programming is also pressing against the dominance of REST. Should everything be reactive now?\n\nFrom shared libraries to sidecars, buildpacks to containers, Erin will demonstrate how different Java application frameworks are adapting to the changing Cloud Native landscape. \n\nAbout Erin Schnabel\nErin Schnabel is a Senior Technical Staff Member at IBM working with microservice architectures, cloud native applications, composable runtimes and Java. Erin has more years of experience than she cares to admit, and was the former Development Lead for WebSphere Liberty. Erin is passionate about the Java developer's experience, particularly with respect to the role of community-driven, open source or standards-compliant software in the cloud environment, and strongly prefers being up to her elbows in code."
