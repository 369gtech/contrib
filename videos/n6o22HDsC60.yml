recordingDate: 1530718905
description: "In late 2007 from his childhood bedroom, Nicolas Haunold — now 22 years old and Software Engineer at Airbnb in San Francisco — joined one of the major iPhone hacking groups that helped millions of people around the world regain control of their iOS devices.\n\nDuring his talk, he will share his firsthand experience in the cat-and-mouse game between Apple and the hackers: the community and ecosystem that emerged around it, their slow demise as Apple began to mirror the jailbreakers’ best ideas into its own operating system, and the learnings that can be applied to upcoming technologies.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
