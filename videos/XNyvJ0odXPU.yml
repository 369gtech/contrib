recordingDate: 1418065886
description: "The main challenge of software design is to control complexity. Less complexity means that our programs are easier to understand, reason about and evolve. This presentation shows how we can use beauty as a mental tool to reduce complexity. \nWe'll start with psychological theories of beauty and expand them to also cover code. You'll see how these concept relate to the way your brain works - beautiful code is cognitive economy. Finally we'll take it a step further and apply these ideas in novel analyses of software architectures. The techniques will help you detect structural decay and serve as a refactoring guide towards better designs. As a bonus you'll learn about ideas from different fields of psychology, all of them related to how you think and code."
