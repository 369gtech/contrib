description: "by Hubert SABLONNIERE \n\nIn the wonderful world of frontend Web, the frameworks and their ecosystems come and go... For a lot of devs, this endless race is getting tiring. Nevertheless, we continue to make architecture decisions that will push us tomorrow to throw away and rewrite lots of code.\n\nStep by step, it gets very easy to be locked into a given framework/ecosystem and too easy to limit one's skills to what this ecosystem provides. We tend to forget the basics and most of the time it pushes us to write code where all layers and concerns are mixed up (UI, DOM access, data access, router, stage manager, bundling, build...).\n\nIn this session, we'll deconstruct the different parts of modern Web frameworks :\n\nWhy are we using those tools?\nWhich problems do they solve?\nHow can we avoid our code to be locked in and mixed up with those ecosystem?\nHow can we produce future-proof code that resists against the hype and evolutions of the Web platform?"
