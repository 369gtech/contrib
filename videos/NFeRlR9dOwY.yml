description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotcss.io on November 30th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nWhat if we could hack CSS into a search engine? Actually we can, and Tim shows you how to do it. Using only CSS and minimal HTML, it's possible to build a fast, relevant and easy to use search engine... with \"only\" 8MB of CSS."
