description: "Speaker: Dave Thomas\r\n\r\nEvery successful business is powered by legacy technology and applications which need to evolve. Vendors, Consultants and New Tech Enthusiasts bemoan technical debt and have the answer – Switch to Our Technology, Outsource, Use a New Language/Platform. Each of these options comes with major business and technical risks and expenses, along with long uncertain delivery dates.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we describe an alternative lean approach to legacy evolution that focuses on high value near-term tactical business and technical innovations. We focus on data rather than code. Code has been the primary focus for traditional legacy approaches. We illustrate common patterns for identifying high return opportunities and techniques for high payback. We discuss risk mitigation and management buy-in for innovative approaches.\r\n\r\nTechnical Debt | Innovation | Targeted Technology Adoption | Accelerated Development | Data Driven\r\n\r\nABOUT THE PRESENTER: DAVE THOMAS\r\n\r\nDave Thomas, Chief Scientist/CSO, Kx Systems, Co-Founder and past Chairman of Bedarra Research Labs (BRL), creators of the Ivy visual analytics workbench and ACM Distinguished Engineer.
