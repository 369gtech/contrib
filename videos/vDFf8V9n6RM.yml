title: 'Turbocharging Client-Side Processing: Leveraging asm.js'
recordingDate: 1388671202
description: 'Mozilla''s asm.js technology has shown that JavaScript can approach the speed of native code for computationally-intensive tasks. However, many assume that the entire web application needs to be written in C/C++ and compiled to asm.js to achieve these speedups. The same speed boosts can be applied to the processing portions of regular JavaScript applications. This talk will explore how to take advantage of existing open-source libraries for performing tasks like image processing, physics simulation, and speech recognition efficiently as part of a regular JavaScript application â€” blending standard JS frameworks like jQuery with open source C++ libraries like Box2D physics to turbocharge the performance of web apps.'
