description: "Cesar Hernandez Mendoza, Senior Software Enginner, Tomitribe\nIvan Junckes Filho, Software Engineer, Tomitribe\n\nThe selection of the right toolset to develop, test, and maintain the interoperability between RESTful web services is a crucial part of any migration or new project. With the imperative constraints for shorter-time-to-market implementations with quality and standardization, the Eclipse Project’s MicroProfile Rest Client makes it possible to write type-safe RESTful client applications with more model-centric code and less boilerplate code in a standardized manner. During this session, the audience will be able to see the features, advantages, use cases, and code demos with the open source project Apache CXF, one of the MicroProfile Rest Client implementations used by Apache TomEE and OpenLiberty application servers."
