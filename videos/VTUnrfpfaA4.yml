description: "We cannot  firewall  or  patch  our way to secure Websites. Security professionals used to think that firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent, well-protected Websites are occurring every day. Citigroup, PBS, Sega, Nintendo, Gawker, AT&T, the CIA, the US Senate, NASA, the NYSE, Zynga, and thousands of others have something in common: all of them have had Websites compromised in the last year. No company or industry is immune. Programmers need to learn how to build Websites differently. This session reviews the top coding techniques Java developers need to master in order to build low-risk, high-security Web applications.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJim Manico\nim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security, a web security firm.
