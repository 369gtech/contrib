recordingDate: 1407747662
description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nKurt Schrader - CTO at intentmedia\n\nABSTRACT\nAt Intent Media we’ve tried many different machine learning technologies over the years, from straight Java map-reduce code, to Pig and Hive, to a large Vertica cluster. Over the last couple of years we’ve converged on Cascalog as our tool of choice for doing most of our data processing. In this talk we’ll walk through the history of our choices, discuss why we ultimately chose Cascalog, and then dive into some examples of Cascalog and how we're using it. \n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
