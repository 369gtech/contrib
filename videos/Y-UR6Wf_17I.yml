description: "A community starts by finding another person who shares the same interest and when found this greatly increases your learning potential as a developer. Communities can be formed inside your company or across the wider developer community, in person or online.\n\nBut how do you do that and how do you encourage more people to get involved? And how do you maintain a welcoming community which people want to remain part of? Just how big is a community anyway, is it 3 people or 3 million?\n\nI'll share my community building experiences from a diverse set of developer events; from brown bags, meetups, mentoring, dojo's, workshops, hackdays and conferences.
