title: 'Jeff Ching - Designing Rich API Clients at Scale - Code BEAM SF 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1521249944
description: "Many APIs are defined as RESTful resources, represented in JSON, and accessed via HTTP. While it's possible to make raw HTTP calls from your program, an API client library can provide significant benefits in safety, security, and readability. This session discusses how Google designs client libraries, covering common design challenges and best practices. You’ll also learn how Google uses code generation to produce clients for hundreds of APIs, across numerous programming languages—including, most recently, Elixir.\n\nThis talk will also cover OpenAPI, which is how we've chosen to scale to languages not normally associated with Google.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nDevelopers interested in producing or consuming APIs.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/jeff-ching/"
