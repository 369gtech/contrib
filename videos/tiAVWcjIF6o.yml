description: "PART 2: https://youtu.be/dLZcocFOb5Q\n\nhttps://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nTemplate metaprogramming is a vast subject, but there are a small number of basic fundamental idioms that are used over and over. Mastery of these idioms will help in reading, writing, and using modern C++ code. The type traits that come as part of the standard library are incredibly useful, but at times can be thought of as some form of dark magic.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will explore some of the fundamental idioms of template metaprogramming by implementing a good portion of the type traits from the standard library. In so doing, attendees will come away with a solid understanding of how to apply the fundamental template metaprogramming idioms to solve problems including, but not limited to, standard type traits.\n\n---\nJody Hagins first compiled \"C++\" code in 1984, and wrote a specialized LisP editor using Zortech C++ for senior project in 1988. However, he didn't truly start programming in C++ until 1992, when he read The Greatest C++ Book Ever Written, \"Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms\" by Jim Coplien. That book, combined with cfront, which generated C code from C++ source, gave him the joyful task of writing SVr4 Streams drivers in C++. Ever since, he has been hooked on writing C++ code for kernel modules, large telephony applications, and, since the late 1990s, applications in what is now known as the high frequency trading industry.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
