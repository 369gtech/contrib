description: "In this month's episode Rick Viscomi and Una Kravets (Director of Product Design, BDG Media) discuss the state of CSS.\n\nThe memes have not been kind to CSS over the years. Remember the gif of Peter Griffin fighting with the blinds, captioned \"CSS\"? It has a reputation of being unwieldy and hard to use. But how much of that is still true today? Things like preprocessors have helped to hide some of the unpleasantries of CSS and APIs like flexbox, grid, and Houdini have come a long way to help make development easier.\n\nFor more info about everything we discussed in this video, check out these resources:\n\nFlexbox usage → https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/1692\nGrid usage → https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/1693\nIs Houdini ready yet? → https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/\nCSS Tricks → https://css-tricks.com/ \nSmashing Magazine → https://www.smashingmagazine.com/ \n@Una on Twitter → https://twitter.com/una \nToolsday podcast → https://spec.fm/podcasts/toolsday"
