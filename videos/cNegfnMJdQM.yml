description: 'The talk presents a new technique of realtime single entity information extraction and investigation. The technique eliminates regular refresh and persistence of data within the search engine (ETL), providing real-time access to source data and improving response times using in-memory data techniques. The solution presented is a concrete solution with live customers, based upon real business needs. I will explain the architectural overview, the technology stack used based on Apache Lucene library, the accomplished results and how to scale out the solution.'
