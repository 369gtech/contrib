To facilitate users' ability to quickly retrieve news tailored to their specific interests, stories are run through a classification system containing hundreds of thousands of rules where they are tagged in real-time with a mean latency of under 50ms. In this talk I'll discuss the migration of the news classification engine from a legacy system to a solution based on Luwak/Lucene while retaining the query language of the existing corpus of rules.  \n\nSpeaker:\nMarvin Justice"
