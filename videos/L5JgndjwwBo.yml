description: "Speaker: Greg Turnquist \nDeck at https://speakerdeck.com/gregturn/debug-and-maintain-your-spring-boot-apps\nCode at https://github.com/gregturn/debug-your-spring-boot-app\n\nSo you have decided to build an application using Spring Boot? Sooner or later, something will go wrong. It does not matter how experienced we are. How will Spring Boot help us figure out what went wrong and fix things? This talk introduces lots of tools to help us debug and manage \"bootiful\" apps. You will learn how to use Boot's autoconfiguration report, override Boot's settings & beans, create custom metrics/health checks/app info, and create custom JMX info & custom CRaSH commands."
