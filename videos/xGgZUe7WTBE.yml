title: 'Code generation with Javac Plugin (Oleksandr Radchykov, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1468311422
description: 'Javac plugin API was introduced in java 8. We can use this API for getting cool things done (like code generation/code analyzing). However it is not widely used right now. Most of `java magic` projects like Lombok, Java-OO are using annotation processing. I want to show brand new approach for making the magic in java which has some benefits. Right now I have prototype which gives us the power of auto type casting in java and, if you want to use it, you shouldnâ€™t add any dependencies to your project for using it, you should only add flag for compiler. In future I think it can be done through build tool plugin.'
