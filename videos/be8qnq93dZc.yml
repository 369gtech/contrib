title: 'DEF CON 29 ICS Village - Javier Perez, Juan Escobar - ICS Intrusion KillChain Explained'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632164398
description: 'Cyber attacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) differ in scope and impact based on a number of factors, including the adversary''s intent, sophistication and capabilities, and familiarity with ICS and automated indutrial processes. In order to understand, identify and address the specific points that can prevent or stop an attack, a systematic model known as "Cyber Kill Chain" is detailed, a term that comes from the military environment and registered by the Lockheed Martin company. While most are familiar with terms and theoretical diagrams of how security should be implemented, in this talk we want to present live how an attack chain occurs from scratch to compromise industrial devices, the full kill chain, based in our experiences. The goal is to land these threats into the real world without the need to carry out these attacks with a nation-state budget.'
