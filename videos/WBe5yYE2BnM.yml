description: "Turbocharging the Cloud Foundry API with External Metadata - John Feminella, Pivotal\n\nThe Cloud Foundry API is useful for providing information about the resources it manages, but sometimes it would be helpful to have other kinds of information there. For example, operators frequently want to associate billing, chargeback, or contact metadata to an application. Unfortunately the CF API doesn't provide any mechanism to do this.\n\nBut there's still a straightforward way to make this possible. In this talk, we introduce an experimental approach by which platform owners can seamlessly add external metadata into `cf curl` API responses for use by other systems. In doing so, we'll see how we can make it possible for operators to augment API responses with whatever metadata they like. We'll also share results from some trials we're performing at several firms using this approach.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRye/turbocharging-the-cloud-foundry-api-with-external-metadata-john-feminella-pivotal"
