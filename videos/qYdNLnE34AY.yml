description: "Eyes on Target - Continuously Fielding Mission Driven Value - Keith Strini, Pivotal\n\nAt Pivotal, when we entered the national security space we made a conscious effort to translate the shared values of our company into those that were culturally aligned with this community. We did this with the stubborn intent to not sacrifice the speed at which we enable our customers to deliver innovation.\n\nIt required us to extensively collaborate with national security customers to define a new goal to align value and distill the non-value added work. This new primary goal was the development and implementation of a continuous fielding model. With a unified fielding platform strategy we are collectively working to overcome the delivery challenges of fielding to the last mile, out to the edge.\n\nIn the national security space its not how fast can you get an idea into production but how fast can you deliver a compliant solution to a mission need. This requires all of the pieces to be accounted for including compliancy. It drives a single KPI, the mean time between fielding. This KPI measures our ability to deliver the velocity needed to maintain the Effective Operational Agility. \n\nAbout Keith Strini\nKeith Strini is the Federal Practice Lead and a Cloud Foundry Advisory Solutions Architect at Pivotal, implementing Cloud Foundry solutions across a wide variety of customer environments both in the Federal and Commercial space.
