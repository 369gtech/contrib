description: "DevOps Transformation 2.0: From Ancestry.com to AdvancedMD\n\nJohn Esser, Sr. Director IT and Data Center Operations, AdvancedMD \n\nThere are times when we get a second chance at doing something big again. This is a report of lessons learned leading a devops transformation for a second time.\n\nHaving managed IT and DevOps at Ancestry.com, I now have the opportunity to build on these roots (pun intended!) leading a large-scale DevOps transformation at AdvancedMD â€“transforming the way healthcare works, with software.\n\nI will share critical aspects of leading a DevOps transformation in the enterprise, tailored to the specific nature and workings of the organization. Will the transformation be big or small? linear or non-linear? require a big leap or will be adopted organically? I will discuss key frameworks for analyzing your situation, and proven patterns for scaling DevOps in the organization and overcoming some common challenges we all face along the journey.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
