recordingDate: 1582182005
description: "Performing brilliantly at senior level requires far more than just technical expertise; you must have outstanding communication skills, incredible confidence and a luminous presence. Sadly, most of us were not taught the critical skills needed to inspire and persuade others. We struggle with the imposter syndrome, fear risk, repress our voice and diminish our credibility in the process.\n\nThe result? Our ideas fail to take flight.\n\nEnter The power of assertiveness - an exciting talk that shares powerful and practical insights on HOW to own any meeting, pitch, talk or challenging conversation where your results matter. Learn to command the stage, power up your voice, tell a story, handle nerves and deal with difficult objections so your words finally land.\n\nStretch is a non-profit leadership and management conference that brings 500 attendees and 16 speakers from all around the world who want to build effective organizations since 2013. An international platform and community for leaders and managers to share stories, hands-on solutions and explore new trends and ideas to lead, fail, learn and stretch.
