Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nIntro: SIG Cloud Provider - Jago Macleod, Google & Andrew Sy Kim, DigitalOcean\n\nThe long term goal of SIG Cloud Provider is to promote a vendor neutral ecosystem for our community. New vendors providing support for Kubernetes should feel equally empowered to do so as any of todayâ€™s existing cloud providers. More importantly, SIG Cloud Provider is focused on ensuring a consistent and high-quality user experience across providers. The SIG acts as a central group for developing the Kubernetes project in a way that ensures all providers share common privileges and responsibilities. This Intro session will go over historical context, status, and direction of efforts currently underway. We will discuss documentation and code organization, and offer an opportunity for participants to offer feedback and ask questions. We will also cover the support for all cloud providers to submit test results to testgrid, the shared infrastructure for recording and visualizing test results. Finally, we will cover the next steps and roadmap for transition of in-tree cloud providers to external repositories.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuLJ"
