recordingDate: 1556981564
description: "\"Speaker: Kevin Markham\n\nThe pandas library is a powerful tool for multiple phases of the data science workflow, including data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. However, the size and complexity of the pandas library makes it challenging to discover the best way to accomplish any given task.\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll use pandas to answer questions about multiple real-world datasets. Through each exercise, you'll learn important data science skills as well as \"\"best practices\"\" for using pandas. By the end of the tutorial, you'll be more fluent at using pandas to correctly and efficiently answer your own data science questions.\n\nParticipants should have an intermediate knowledge of pandas and an interest in data science, but are not required to have any experience with the data science workflow. Datasets will be provided by the instructor.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
