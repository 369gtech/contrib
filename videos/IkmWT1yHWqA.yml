Because this will be the only preferences file for your Activity, you don't supply a name.\n\n\nWatch all videos of this series by clicking here : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOEAe1-V7WwojKmPbpBRDDQu\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \nhttp://www.edureka.co\nVisit -http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course"
