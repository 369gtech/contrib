title: '2017 Using BPF in Kubernetes'
recordingDate: 1508669571
description: "https://media.ccc.de/c/asg2017/ASG2017-134-using_bpf_in_kubernetes\n\nLinux superpowers in the cloud\n\nIn this talk, I will present different use cases for using BPF in a Kubernetes cluster. BPF is a Linux in-kernel virtual machine and there are different kinds of BPF programs for different subsystems that will be considered: kprobes, traffic control, cgroups, LSM. I’ll follow with concrete examples, such as Weave Scope’s HTTP Statistics plugin. Finally, I’ll share tips and tricks on how to develop your own BPF programs in Kubernetes with the libraries bcc and gobpf, and show ways of easily test those with SemaphoreCI and rkt.\n\n\n\n\nAlban Crequy"
