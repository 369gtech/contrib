description: "DjangoCon US 2018 - Serverless Django with Zappa by Dane Hillard\n\nA common set of considerations when planning to release a new application are around hosting and resources:\n\nWhich platforms will support my app?\nWhat OS should I use?\nWhat WSGI server should I use?\nHow much memory and CPU do I need?\nZappa, a framework for running serverless WSGI applications on top of AWS Lambda, can help address these and other questions around application deployment. With some configuration (as code), Zappa can get you up and running quickly, letting you focus on developing the application instead of the infrastructure.\n\nIn this talk we’ll go through some of these kinds of questions to see how they might be answered in traditional solutions and then see how Zappa handles them. We’ll also talk about a few specific configuration options for handling SSL certificates and running Django commands on the Zappa-deployed application."
