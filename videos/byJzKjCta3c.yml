description: "Google Tech Talk\nMarch 7, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by James Biagioni\n\nABSTRACT\n\nDriven by the near-ubiquitous availability of GPS sensors in a variety of everyday devices, the past decade has witnessed considerable interest in the automatic inference and construction of road maps from GPS traces. Existing methods for performing this task can be largely divided into three categories: k-means clustering, trace merging, and kernel density estimation.\n\nIn this talk I discuss the three classes of existing algorithms guided by examples from canonical work in the literature, and illustrate their strengths and weaknesses. In light of these findings I then introduce and explain the operation of our new hybrid map inference algorithm, developed to overcome these existing methods' limitations with GPS-trace coverage disparity and measurement error. Lastly, I discuss some directions for future work in this problem domain.\n\nFor further details on the material presented in this talk, please refer to the following research papers:\n\nJames Biagioni and Jakob Eriksson. \"Map Inference in the Face of Noise and Disparity.\" In SIGSPATIAL GIS, pages 79-88.

James' research interests are centered around the problem of inferring interesting and useful phenomena from sensor data, and its applications."
