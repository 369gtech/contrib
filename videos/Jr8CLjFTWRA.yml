description: "by Christophe Geuzaine\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2213/gmsh.webm\n\nGmsh (http://gmsh.info) is an open source finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities. Under continuous development for the last two decades, it has become the de facto standard for open source finite element mesh generation, with a large user community in both academia and industry. In this talk I will present an overview of Gmsh, and highlight recent developments including the support for constructive solid geometry, new robust and parallel meshing algorithms, flexible solver integration and a new multi-language Application Programming Interface in C++, C, Python and Julia.\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 15:15:00"
