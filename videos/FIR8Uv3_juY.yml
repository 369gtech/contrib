description: "Serverless computing is one of the hottest trends in computing right now due to its simplicity and cost efficiency. Oracle recently open sourced a new project that enables developers to run their own Serverless infrastructure anywhere. The platform is container-native, enabling users to write functions in any programming language with excellent support for local development and testing. Fn even allows devs to “bring their own Dockerfile”, such that ANY containerized code can be used as a function.\n\nShaun Smith\nDirector Product Management\nOracle\nShaun Smith is a Director of Product Management at Oracle responsible for the Docker-based Oracle Application Container Cloud. He's a past committer on a number of Eclipse Foundation projects, notably EclipseLink the Java Persistence API reference implementation, and is an experienced speaker who has presented frequently at JavaOne, Devoxx, EclipseCon, JAX, and many other developer conferences and user groups around the world."
