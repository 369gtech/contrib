description: "Trisha Gee, Programmer / Developer, JetBrains\nRaghavan \"Rags\" Srinivas, Architect, Microsoft\n\nThe panelists in this session continue the quest for the winner of the emerging languages bowl. Some JVM-based languages from previous years—Frege, Golo, Kotlin, Mirah, and Red Line—and new languages such as eta and Lux go through the following two rounds of heavy combat:\n• A common task round\n• A community round\n\nThe audience will pick the winner and will leave the fun-filled and unique panel session with an idea of which language might be the most relevant to their needs. PS: We welcome for the first time a female panelist!"
