description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nRecreating, Understanding, and Visualizing FiveThirtyEight's Elections Forecast\n\nThink about forecasting results based on polls, how to visualize your results, and explain them. Now apply that to a flashy, real world example: the 2018 midterms. The core tutorial covers sampling, simulations, statistics, interactive visualization, and communicating results. Not to fear: this tutorial is ultra \"hands-on\" with every concept being immediately applied with NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas.\n\nSlides - https://github.com/josephofiowa/pydata-dc-2018/blob/master/pydata-dc-2018-final.pdf\n\nCode - https://github.com/josephofiowa/pydata-dc-2018\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
