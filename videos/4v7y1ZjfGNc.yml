title: 'Frictionless Frameworks and the Future of Innovation - Kipp Bradford keynote'
recordingDate: 1435671683
description: "From Solid Conference 2015: The breakthrough products of the near-term future will not be created by pushing the boundaries of science and technology. Instead, innovation is being driven by a rising tide of entrepreneurs, who are now able to develop ideas into products that once required the resources of large organizations.\n\nNew products—and markets for those products—are appearing at an increasingly frenzied pace, threatening to disrupt established companies. Much of this is the result of “Frictionless-Frameworks”: tools and technologies that are intuitive and accessible, yet powerful and extendible. Those characteristics are frequently in conflict. However, consumer-centric design principals are being more commonly applied—not just to the development of new products and services, but also to the tools that can be used to build those products and services.\n\nThis talk will discuss what most conversations about the “Maker” movement have ignored: How large companies will wield influence and multiply their creative potential by intentionally designing frictionless frameworks that lower the barrier to entry for lead-user communities, and harnessing the power of transactional innovation.\n\nAbout Kipp Bradford (The Kippworks):\nKipp Bradford is an educator, technology consultant, and entrepreneur with a passion for making things.
