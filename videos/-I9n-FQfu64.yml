description: "I Volunteer as Tribute - the Future of Oncall\nPresented by Bridget Kromhout\n\nLiving #opslife makes us keenly aware of the cavernous gap between lofty ideals and 3am reality. In a perfect world, everyone would be devopsing sans effort. In the real world, sharing oncall is not as easy as giving devs prod AWS creds, adding them to the rotation, and saying “good luck! have fun!”\nFrom tightly-guarded fiefdoms to “of course all the devs are on call” to carefully negotiated compromises, I’ve lived this movie enough times to see what works (and what definitely doesn’t). I spent 1999 to 2015 on call for production infrastructure and made mistakes so you don’t have to! Spoiler alert: instead of volunteering as tribute to the vagaries of the pager, volunteer to invest in your architecture and your co-workers; you’ll sleep better at night.\n\nPresented at Code & Supply's Uptime conference.
