title: 'Advanced Chatbot Development - the Art of What''s Possible'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601417892
description: "Chatbot frameworks are relatively common, and many developers have already created bots that can address simple use cases such as a simple FAQ bot, or perhaps a voice skill for Amazon’s Alexa. But have you hit the proverbial wall for what’s possible? Are bot engagements reliant on simple sentences and not naturally conversational? Do the bots get lost and unable to follow a non-sequitur in conversations? And are they easily confused by the unique terms and jargon used in your industry?\n\nIf you’re ready to go beyond the wall, and work in the art of what’s possible, come hear what Oracle Digital Assistant has to offer. You will be pleasantly surprised by how Oracle is leading the charge in enterprise chatbot development."
