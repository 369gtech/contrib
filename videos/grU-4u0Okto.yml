description: 'Traits are one of the most powerful, but also most difficult parts of Rust to master. Come to this talk for a visual exploration of how traits work - from the most basic to the advanced. It is only through deep understanding of a concept like traits that you can fully harness their power in your every day code. You will walk away with a deep understanding of how traits work, why they work the way they do, and the how and why of using them.'
