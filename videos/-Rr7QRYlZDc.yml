title: 'Joreg & Elias Holzer — vvvv — visual programming for .NET'

description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Joreg and Elias present new visual language for the .NET ecosystem, called \"VL\" and a development environment for it, called \"vvvv gamma\".\n\nVL combines dataflow paradigms with features known from object-oriented programming and defaults to program-while-running with a hot state reload approach. It can directly consume any .NET library and its compiler is using Roslyn to generate C# code in memory from the visual language. This allows to potentially build to any platform that is supported by the .NET ecosystem.\n\nThis does not only allow for very rapid prototyping but is also indispensable for productions where you need the flexibility of modifying a program while it is running.\n\nVisual programming is widely criticized for not being suitable for anything other than domain specific problem solving. With vvvv gamma we argue we enter a new era of general purpose visual programming."
