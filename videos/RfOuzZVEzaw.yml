description: "From the 2015 Solid Conference: The problems we face are so complex that we have to use everything at our disposal to solve them: data, hardware, software, intuition, robots, empathy. The superheroes of the future are the MacGyvers who use CAD software and robots as readily as bubble gum and paperclips.\n\nAbout Danielle Applestone (Other Machine Co.):\nDanielle is a cofounder of Other Machine Co., a San Francisco-based company focused on joyful creation experiences. Danielle’s expertise integrates a strong background in science and technology, education, and entrepreneurship.\n\nArmed with an advanced degree in chemical engineering and a software programming hobby, Danielle cofounded her first company in 2003 – a profitable boutique internet software as a service (SaaS) company that she still operates. Following her PhD at the University of Texas at Austin, Danielle went on to work on a DARPA-funded education project to develop digital design and CNC (computer numerically controlled) manufacturing tools for the classroom. When the DARPA funding for the project ended, Danielle then bootstrapped financing with her team to continue their work, eventually launching Other Machine Co. and focusing on removing the barriers to desktop CNC manufacturing.\n\nDanielle grew up in the small town of Mena, AR and is the first college graduate of her family. As such, Danielle is particularly passionate about education -especially science and math for women and girls -, fostering work-based apprenticeship programs, and encouraging the development of businesses that provide relevant and meaningful mentorship for the future workforce in both urban and rural areas.\n\nDanielle has a BS in chemical engineering from MIT and holds a PhD in materials science and engineering from the University of Texas, Austin. Several of Danielle’s battery materials have been patented and subsequently licensed. She is also the proud mother of an eight-year old son who absolutely can’t wait to have an apprenticeship at Other Machine Co."
