Unfortunately, leveraging async I/O can be disruptive to careful code architecture. \n\nThis talk focuses not on the mechanics of async I/O, but rather on a library that manages async I/O with code that looks and behaves like traditional sequential code. Boost.Fiber introduces \"userland threads,\" permitting the application coder the benefits of both async I/O and clean layers of abstraction. \n\nThis talk presents an overview of the library, discusses integration with event-driven frameworks and illustrates several useful patterns.\n— \n\nNat Goodspeed\nLinden Lab\nNat Goodspeed first read about C++ shortly after implementing a medium-sized language interpreter in classic C. Almost every C++ feature led to forehead smacking accompanied by muttered remarks about how the language could have solved THIS problem... He has been fascinated (sometimes infuriated) by C++ ever since.\n\nWhen he first encountered Boost libraries, a light shone from the heavens and choirs of angels sang \"AAAAAAH...\" The idea of writing and maintaining C++ code without Boost has become unthinkable -- even now that some of those libraries have been adopted into the C++ standard.\n\nNat has presented papers on coroutines and fibers to WG21, the ISO C++ committee. He has spoken on these topics at C++ Now conferences.\n\nNat has worked on databases, games and virtual worlds, usually on architecture and infrastructure. He has functioned as Boost evangelist within various organizations.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
