description: "Despite order of magnitude advances in hardware, significant improvements in software development and execution remain elusive. Modern practices of Continuous Delivery; Functional Programming; Microservices; Data Driven; NoSQL; Event Sourcing; Accelerated Development; Mobility; IoT; SAAS are only possible due to significant improvements in hardware.\n\nWhat if FAST Hardware - FAST Software? Is this talk we look at ways in which simple design allows us to exploit the power of modern hardware. We begin with a quick look at hardware today and tomorrow and why software slows it down! We the argue through examples that aligning the software and hardware architecture often leads to much simpler, and faster solutions.\n\nFor more on YOW!
