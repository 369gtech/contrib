description: "The JCP plays a critical role in the evolution of Java. The third JSR in the JCP.Next reform effort—JSR 358: A major revision of the Java Community Process—is currently under way in the JCP program. It is the last of three JSRs to modify the JCP to make it more open, transparent, and participatory. Significant progress has been made since the initiation of this JSR, in 2012. This session discusses the upcoming changes to the JCP’s processes that are intended to lower barriers to participation and enable broad participation by the members of the Java community. JCP Executive Committee members will engage with the audience and the JCP chair in a panel discussion following the presentation.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJames Curran\nPatrick Curran is Chair of the Java Community Process organization.
