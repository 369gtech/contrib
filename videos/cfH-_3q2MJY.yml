title: '#WednesdayStreams: An Eve-ning of Code - Part 2'
recordingDate: 1634191956
description: "_Every wednesday at 17:30 throughout October_\n\n### In October's #WednesdayStreams we're exploring the world of Eve Online, and building tooling in aid of Dom's #Stonks.\n\nDom will be building out something that will be hitting the Eve Online API and then displaying that data in something that might be described as targeting `Web 2.0.0-alpha build 0001`. The idea is to build something that points towards the best profit/gain in game and prove once and for all that Eve is not just \"Spreadsheets in Space\", it's also \"Programming in Space\"\n\n## About your Host\n\nDom Davis is a veteran of The City and a casualty of The Financial Crisis. Not content with bringing the world to its knees he then went off to help break the internet before winding up in Norfolk where he messes about doing development and devops. Dom has been writing code since his childhood sometime in the last millennium – he hopes some day to become good at it.\n\nDom is an enthusiastic and impassioned speaker [read: he gabbles] who uses a blend of irreverent sarcasm and flippant humour to bring complex subjects to a broad audience. Whether or not they understand him is up for debate, but he likes to believe they do.\n\n## About our WednesdayStreams\n\nWe've grown a little accustomed to YouTube throughout the last couple of years and we've been trying different formats. The most recent of which, live coding on stream. We wanted to show the “real side” of Development. A warts and all approach to building software!\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nYou might want to try something new or wish to take your software development up to the next level. We want to jump into the detail and bring you practical value. We want to make it easy for you to access knowledge, progress and prosper in the highly specialised and valuable field of software engineering.\n\nOur community goes beyond our regular events, we're a thriving support network. Our membership include those that are just starting out, juniors, seniors, and the curious."
