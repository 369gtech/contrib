title: 'GStreamer WebRTC - The flexible solution to web-based media'
recordingDate: 1548373743
description: "Matthew Waters\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/143/\n\nCurrently, the most popular and most featureful WebRTC implementation is webrtc.org used in Chrome and Firefox. It works well for browsers, but the Native API has several shortcomings that make it a less-than-ideal choice for use-cases outside of browsers for native apps, server applications, and IoT use cases.\r\n\r\nI will discuss those shortcomings and present a new open-source WebRTC implementation that we at Centricular wrote and contributed to the GStreamer project, and will talk about how this enables sophisticated, flexible, and efficient multimedia use-cases across a wide range of devices.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
