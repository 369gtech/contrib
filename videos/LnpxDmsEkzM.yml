title: 'Securing Bare Metal Micro Services: Service Mesh'
recordingDate: 1569070712
description: "https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2019-136-securing-bare-metal-micro-services-service-mesh\n\n\n\nLearn how a Service Mesh can secure your bare-metal (non-virtualized) workloads quickly without any code modifications to improve your security posture.\n\nZero Trust is an information security mantra to not implicitly trust any the underlying infrastructure (hardware, network, software, etc). For many organizations, this extends into the cloud where this philosophy is applied to workloads running in public, virtualized clouds. We'll be taking this philosophy to protect an insecure application, the Fortune Cookie Micro Service, running atop a bare metal cloud with a Service Mesh to provide authentication and encryption of data in motion without the complexities of virtualization or containerization. This walkthrough uses all open source software (Terraform for the deployment atop the Packet bare metal cloud and Consul for the service mesh) atop Ubuntu physical nodes.\n\nJohn Studarus\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/ASG2019/talk/H3YZZM/"
