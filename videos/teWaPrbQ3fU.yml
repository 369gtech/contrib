title: 'YOW! Conference 2018 - Joe Albahari - Neural Nets From the Ground Up'
recordingDate: 1550700003
description: "Neural Nets From the Ground Up\n\nThe best way to understand neural networks is to get your hands dirty and write one.\nIn this session, we'll start from scratch and invent a neural net that can recognize handwritten digits with over 98% accuracy. Without leaning on any libraries! From the bottom up, we'll discover gradient descent, activation functions and backpropagation, as well as the mathematics behind this fascinating machine learning technology.\nWe'll code entirely in C# in a lightweight IDE (LINQPad). And you'll get to keep the code!\n\nJoe Albahari is an O’Reilly author and the inventor of LINQPad. He’s written seven books on C# and LINQ, including “C# 7.0 in a Nutshell”. He speaks regularly at conferences and user groups, and has been a C# MVP for ten years running.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
