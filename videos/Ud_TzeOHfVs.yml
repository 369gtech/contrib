This is not a songwriting retreat but a talk about songs analysis and some of the lyrical, structural, harmonic and melodic features it includes. We will discuss extraction of lyrical features using NLP tools, musical segmentation using frequency analysis, and how to combine different song structures.\n\nYama is a data scientist at MyPart, a startup in the music industry, researching lyrical and musical songsâ€™ features. Yama has a B.Sc in mathematics and physics from Tel Aviv University where she also plays in the TAU Wind Band.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
