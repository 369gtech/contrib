A combination of auto-scaling, rabbitMQ, scrupulous monitoring, and a tireless dev team. \nIn this talk I’ll discuss the functionality of the message bus at the core of Vonage’s communications platform, the powerful Node scripts that power the entire operation, and how you can use similar solutions for a number of different challenges. \n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nAWS Amplify → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nRetool → https://retool.com/\nEpsagon → https://epsagon.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nG2i → https://www.g2i.co/ \n\nSilver Sponsors\nAppSignal → https://appsignal.com/\nSailscasts → https://sailscasts.com/\n\nDiversity Sponsor\nPrisma → https://www.prisma.io/"
