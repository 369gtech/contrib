description: "Intro: Kubernetes (Instrumentation) SIG - Frederic Branczyk, Red Hat \n\nThe intro to SIG Instrumentation is going to be a lightweight introduction to what sig-instrumentation is responsible for within Kubernetes and give guidance on how to contribute to SIG Instrumentation. Beyond that it will cover a high level overview of the work SIG instrumentation has done over the years and elaborate on current efforts including the sub projects being worked on. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPiA"
