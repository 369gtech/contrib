description: "Burkhard Kloss (@georgebernhard (https://twitter.com/georgebernhard))\n\nAs Uncle Bob pointed out, software is everywhere, and without software, nothing works.\n\nThat gives us great power, and – as we all know – with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nWe have to make choices every day that affect others, sometimes in subtle and non-intuitive ways. To mention just a few:\n\nWhat logs should we capture?\n\n• How does that change if we have to hand them over to the government?\n\n• Are our hiring practices fair? Are we sure about that?\n\n• Is there bias in our algorithms that unfairly disadvantages some groups of people?\n\n• Is the core function of our software ethical? How about if it’s deliberately misused?\n\nI hope to raise a few of these questions, not to provide answers – I don’t have any – but to stimulate debate.\n\nBurhard Kloss\n\nI only came to England to walk the Pennine Way… 25 years later I still haven’t done it. I did, though, get round to starting an AI company (spectacularly unsuccessful), joining another startup long before it was cool, learning C++, and spending a lot of time on trading floors building systems for complex derivatives. Sometimes hands on, sometimes managing people. Somewhere along the way I realised you can do cool stuff quickly in Python, and I’ve never lost my fascination with making machines smarter."
