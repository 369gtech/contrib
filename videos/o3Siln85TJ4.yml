description: "Scalaz-Stream (soon to be called \"FS2\" or \"Functional Streams for Scala\") is a library that lets us write compositional, modular, safe, and efficient asynchronous I/O using an expressive purely functional API.\n\nIn this hands-on talk we'll see how to get started with the library, cook up a few streams, and look at ways of combining them into larger systems.\n\nTalk by Rúnar Ó.
