description: "Swapnil Gupta\nTechnical Lead\nMusicMuni Labs Pvt Ltd\n\nGopala Krishna Koduri\n\nSinging is a household passion. But there are no accessible solutions for learning singing other than the conventional ways.Think about what Duolingo did for learning languages. Riyaz is on a journey to do the same for learning music. In a gamified environment, it gives instant visual feedback showing the nature of mistakes made and guides you to improving faster. More than 90% of a learner’s time is spent practicing. This needs a constant feedback to improve, and is usually costly as it requires a human. That’s where Riyaz comes in! We bring in intelligence of a human teacher to your pocket. Riyaz exploits technology that leverages artificial intelligence and user-generated knowledge-base for scaling music education to masses."
