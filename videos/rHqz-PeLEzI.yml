description: "Panel: Educating SRE\n\nCraig Sebenik, Matterport;David Mah, Dropbox; Andrew Widdowson, Google; Philip Boyle, Facebook\n\nJoin us for a panel discussing various challenges facing the education of SREs. The panel will focus on new SREs (coming out of higher education), ongoing education and how we as a group educate developers.\n\nTraining the next generation of SREs coming in to our field means figuring out what information is important from other fields as well as trying to pass on lessons learned from years of experience. Also, we need to listen to new people that bring an unfettered perspective.\n\nEducating SREs within a company present slightly different issues. Namely, keeping up to date on tools that may be very specific to the processes used at any one company. Companies may choose to follow industry norms or may do something totally different. Companies need to keep their employees up to date with there specific goals.\n\nLastly, developers have their own priorities, but we need their help to emit metrics, add caching as well as a host of other code-level changes. We can learn from their experiences and also educate them to our best practices.\n\nView the full SREcon15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon15/program"
