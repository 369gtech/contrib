description: "Java 8 has been described as the largest change to the Java platform since the beginning of Java, but there has not been a corresponding effort to remove obsolete features from the system. Some features have been deprecated, but very few have actually been removed. The platform has grown ever larger and more complex, resulting in an accumulation of complexity and technical debt. These impose a continual tax on development. This session explores the trailing edge of the feature lifecycle: the meaning of deprecation, how it needs to evolve, what it takes to remove features from the system, and its impact on compatibility. Only by removing obsolete features can we make room to innovate in the future.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDr. Deprecator\n@DrDeprecator\nView more trainings by Dr. Deprecator at https://www.parleys.com/author/dr-deprecator\n\nStuart Marks\nStuart Marks is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Java\nPlatform Group at Oracle.
