description: "Developers don’t always take a step back to think about how they be better at learning and teaching: at engaging and audience and building a bigger product community. That’s where technical diagramming can really make an impact. Using visuals can help you unblock your work, uncover bugs, and even have a better understanding of a technical concept you thought you had already mastered. This talk will go over some of those benefits and how to use doodling and technical diagramming in your own work to be a more effective developer and community member.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/una"
