description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nInteroperability of Open Source Tools: The Emergence of Interfaces - Katie Gamanji, American Express \n\nIn the past years, Kubernetes has been the nucleus of container orchestration frameworks. Numerous tools have been developed to extend Kubernetes capabilities and enhance its features. Over time, tools with similar functionalities would have fundamentally different implementations and practices to converge with the Kubernetes components. The emergence of shared standards and a set of best practices became imperative.     This talk will focus on the evolution of interfaces within the Kubernetes landscape, including networking, storage, service mesh, and cluster provisioning. Attendees will acquire an understanding of why the interoperability of open-source tools is pivotal in the modern infrastructure. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp8T"
