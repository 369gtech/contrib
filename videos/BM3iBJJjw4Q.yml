title: 'CON2133   Nodyn and Vert.x: Running Distributed Node js Apps in JVM Environments'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449839114
description: "The Nodyn project provides the Node.js API on the JVM, but it uses only libraries that are running natively on the JVM: DynJS or Nashorn as the JavaScript engine and Netty for async and nonblocking I/O. By replacing the parts written originally in C with Java and JavaScript, it also contains more JavaScript than original Node.js does. With the approach of using Vert.x and its event bus (powered by Hazelcast), itâ€™s as easy as 1-2-3 to get your Node apps running in distributed environments, communicating with other JVM language verticals by sending objects across the event bus, which spans all available instances, even to the browser. Live coding and examples dominate this session.\n\nSpeaker:\nNiko Ko?bler, Fellow, Freelancer\nNiko works as an independant and self-employed software architect, developer and trainer for Java and JavaScript enterprise solutions, integrations and web development. Currently he is focussing on integrating polyglott script languages in JVM enterprise environments. He advises and supports clients across industries, conducts workshops, trainings and architecture reviews. Niko is a co-lead of a local Java User Group, writes articles and speaks regularly at international tech conferences."
