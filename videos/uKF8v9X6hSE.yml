description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe Control Loop As An Application Development Framework - Nick Santos, Tilt\n\nKubernetes emerged as A Good Idea® in part because it gives you real-time, circular feedback: it's a control loop. Something watches, something reacts, equilibrium is maintained. In this talk we’ll discuss how this model is useful not only for orchestrating containers, but for many applications that handle real-time feedback loops. And thanks to Kubernetes, most of the scaffolding for it is already out there, ready to be used. As a use-case the speaker will talk about a development tool that reacts to source code and server status changes in real-time—a perfect match for a Kubernetes-style control loop. Adopting control loops led to a simpler, more modular app. It made the codebase easier to grasp for new developers, and the application as a whole more uniform and easy to extend. Plus, Kubernetes already has a rich ecosystem of tools for it. Lastly, the speaker will discuss other examples in which this model applies and whether this model makes sense for your own applications."
