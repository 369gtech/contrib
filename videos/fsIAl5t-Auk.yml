description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nChubaoFS简介及深入剖析 | Introduction and Deep Dive to ChubaoFS - Shuoran Liu & Yong Sheng, Beike\n\nChubaoFS是具备生产级别的分布式存储系统。它同时提供POSIX和S3兼容的接口，并且具有高可用，可扩展及高性能等特性。ChubaoFS非常契合云原生的理念及生态系统，不仅能够很好的支持传统应用，也可以支持容器内应用。本次分享会回顾ChubaoFS的发展历程，为初次接触的伙伴简单介绍ChubaoFS是什么，能在生产中解决什么问题。另外，我们会介绍一些使用ChubaoFS的小技巧，能够更好的服务终端用户。之后，本次分享会详细介绍ChubaoFS的架构，控制流、数据流，以及当初从零开始设计时的一些思考和设计取舍。正是由于这些创新性的架构设计，使得ChubaoFS不同于其它任何一款开源分布式存储项目，并且极大的拓展了ChubaoFS可以支持的业务范围。然后，本次分享会选取一些有代表性的生产案例及最佳实践分享，其中有些场景之前没有使用过分布式存储，但是ChubaoFS能够很好的进行支撑。最后，我们会介绍下目前正在做的一些开发进展。\n\nChubaoFS is a production-ready distributed storage system which provides both POSIX-compatible and S3-compatible interfaces with high availability, scalability and performance. It is aligned with the cloud-native ecosystem and suitable for both traditional and containerized applications.    This presentation will go over the history of ChubaoFS and what it can do, to give you a general perception to the newcomers. There will also be some interesting using hints to fulfill diverse needs of the end users.    Then this presentation will also go through the architecture, control/data flows as well as design decisions made when developed from scratch. It is the innovative architecture and workflow design that makes it a unique distributed storage system and capable of supporting diverse using scenarios.    After that we will show some production case studies collected from different companies. Some of the using scenarios seldom involved a distributed storage before, but ChubaoFS can be used in such situations due to the architecture and data flows introduced in the previous section. And we will explain why in this part.    Finally, there will be an introduction and roadmap to the work we are doing."
