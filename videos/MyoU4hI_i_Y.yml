description: "If you want to create a UX experience that anyone will be able to use, start by thinking, \"could my mom use this?\" No offense to the moms! But as Andi Galpern points out, excellent UX design means an experience that anyone, even someone who might be a little less tech-savvy, can understand and navigate easily.\n\nAndi gives a brief and informative introduction to the basics of good UX. She focuses on Gestalt principles of design (proximity, continuity, similarity, figure/ground) to show you how following a few simple guidelines can lead to a site that is both functional and beautiful.\n\nFor more cool HTML5 content: http://marakana.com/s/tags/html5"
