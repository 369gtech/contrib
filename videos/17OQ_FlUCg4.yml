recordingDate: 1526413399
description: "With the AI revolution emerging as one of the most profound technological shifts of our time, there’s plenty of speculation on the implications for content creators. Adobe Sensei (the company’s AI and machine learning framework) is embracing this technological evolution, using machine learning to deliver innovations that will amplify human creativity and intelligence – not replace it.\n\nIn this session Shambhavi Kadam, group product manager for Adobe Stock, will demonstrate how by blending the art of creativity with the science of data, we can help users find what they need based on deep content understanding and deliver tools that can streamline workflows and liberate users from once cumbersome tasks. Shambhavi will demonstrate why AI-powered features such as visual search capabilities in Adobe Stock can manage mundane tasks by allowing users to search with aesthetic filters, semantic characteristics and automate key-wording.\n\nAttendees will walk away with ideas about how some tedious and repetitive workflows can be automated through AI and machine learning, extending creative possibilities like never before.\n\nShambhavi Kadam\nGroup Product Manager, Adobe Stock\nhttps://twitter.com/kadamster\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
