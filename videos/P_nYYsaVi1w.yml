description: "Browser fingerprints can be used to invade users' privacy by tracking them across websites. But they can also be used to protect users against account takeovers. At Salesforce, we have successfully deployed browser fingerprints to detect session roaming. We have build a machine learning model to detect anomalies in changes in the browser and device configuration. This model has successfully detected actual session takeover.
