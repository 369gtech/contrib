description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHow NOT to Start with Kubernetes - Christian Heckelmann, Dynatrace\n\nTo k8s or not? THAT should be the first question you answer before considering moving your workloads to k8s. Granted – in many cases - Kubernetes is going to be the right choice but don’t just default to k8s because its hip or cool. When starting with Kubernetes you will run into many challenging situations or must make important decisions that will impact the way you will benefit or not benefit from k8s, that will decide whether you have sleepless nights or whether you can enjoy your evenings and weekends with friends and family! I, Christian Heckelmann, would have loved to know a lot more about Kubernetes networking, resource limits, the importance of training people upfront, providing templates, security, the CNCF landscape and more. 2 years ago, I started my journey as DevOps engineer setting up k8s 1.9 on bare metal. In this talk I recap my lessons learned in the hope that everyone that starts with k8s doesn’t start off in the wrong direction."
