Why it Can't be Ignored?\nFor modern agile teams, release velocity is very critical. Unfortunately, one of the biggest bottlenecks for faster release velocity is testing times. Even after teams implement end-to-end test automation, long testing times significantly delay the pipelines. This delay means developers get feedback of their efforts very late, which can snowball, affecting the shipping velocity. Hence test execution time becomes one of the most critical KPIs for any business that wants to ship features faster than the approaching deadlines. LambdaTest helps modern dev teams release faster by executing tests faster on a scalable, reliable test cloud.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\nSnyk → https://snyk.io/\nToptal → https://www.toptal.com/freelance-jobs\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nSonarSource → https://www.sonarsource.com/\nmabl → https://www.mabl.com/\nLambdaTest → https://www.lambdatest.com/\nThundra → https://www.thundra.io/\nNeuraLegion → https://www.neuralegion.com/\nMicrosoft → https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStream → https://getstream.io/\nBirds Eat Bug → https://birdeatsbug.com/"
