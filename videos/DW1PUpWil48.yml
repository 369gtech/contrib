title: 'Choice is Overrated - Designing Products That Know What You Want Before You Do - Heather Wilde'
recordingDate: 1506326749
description: "According to CEO Aaron Shapiro, the next big breakthrough in design and technology will be the creation of products, services, and experiences that eliminate the needless choices from our lives and make ones on our behalf, freeing us up for the ones we really care about: “Anticipatory design”. Rather than traditional UI/UX, where the tendency is to provide options in a participatory manner to determine a result, here you remove all choices from the user, and use predictive modeling to give an outcome to liberate them from so-called “decision fatigue,”\n\n“Flow not friction,” “convenience not choice,” and “efficiency not freedom” are the mantras of anticipatory design.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore some implementations of anticipatory design, discuss areas where it is done well, and issues with the overall movement."
