description: 'Cloud computing providers offer an increasing number of great services which are being used more and more by our today''s applications. Docker has done an incredible job unifying development and production environments, but we think it is more a solution to package applications than a tool for developer workflows. Running your development environment in the cloud is the only way to have a truly unified experience from development to production. Other advantages are 100% repeatable environments, improved performance, payment as you go and company policies applied at the development level.'
