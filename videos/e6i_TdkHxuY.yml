description: "by Daniel Izquierdo\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.120/python_diversity_gap.webm\n\n\nWomen represents half of the population. The technological industry claims that around 30% of their work force are women. And that percentage decreases down to 20% when focusing on the tech. teams. \n\nIf we analyze open source communities, those hardly reach 10% of the population as this is the case of the OpenStack Foundation or the Linux Kernel. \n\nThis talk will show previous analysis and data publicly available with this respect, and an analysis of the Python community [1] to compare to. \n\nIn addition to that, this talk will provide the steps done up to having the data: retrieving, curating, cleaning and visualizing the information with Python. For this process GrimoireLab, and specifically Perceval [2] was used used for retrieving information. Perceval retrieves information from the usual data sources found in the open source world. Then Ceres [3] is a small library that handle Perceval's data. These are the basics of the technical infrastructure. \n\n[1] https://github.com/python [2] https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval, [3] https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-cereslib \n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:00:00+01"
