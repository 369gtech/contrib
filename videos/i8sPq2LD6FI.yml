description: "Don’t Fly Blind! - Christoph Eichhorn and Christian Duefel, SAP\n\nWhen running a cloud application that serves many different customers, keeping track of what is going on can quickly turn into a challenging and “cloudy” endeavor. Especially when unexpected and difficult-to-reproduce issues show up, you need to rely on a toolset, that provides timely insights and allows you to quickly find relevant information to solve that issue. In this presentation, Christoph Eichhorn and Christian Duefel will show how to leverage the SAP-Logging-Pipeline in order to obtain out of the box insights on performance, usage and other events, as well as metrics and the correlation of all these. Parts of the pipeline have already been put under Open Source. The SAP-Logging-Pipeline for Cloud Foundry enables you to gain visual flight conditions in the cloud.\n\nAbout Christian Düfel\nSAP SE\n\nAbout Christoph Eichhorn\nDeveloper, SAP\nWorking at SAP since 2012 on different topics related to the SAP Cloud Platform"
