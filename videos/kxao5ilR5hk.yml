description: "Programmers are on the shop floor, and know what is realistic.\nProgrammers can make, and measure detailed technical decisions, evolutionarily, iteratively, and incrementally, that Architects and Managers cannot.\nSo, it is not even a matter of programmers grabbing the power, but that it is in management interest to delegate it to them."
