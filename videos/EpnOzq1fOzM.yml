description: "Google TechTalks\nBay Area Discrete Math Day XII\nApril 15, 2006\n\nSinai Robins (Temple University)\n\nABSTRACT\nOne of the most fundamental problems in integer linear programming is that of finding an integer point inside a given rational polytope. Here we develop a new tool to solve this problem. We first give a survey of the history of Dedekind sums, and show the current state of a recently developed theory of higher dimensional differentiable Dedekind sums.\n\nWe next use these differentiable Dedekind sums to locate points in rational polytopes. Some examples in low dimensions will be given. Moreover, no background in Dedekind sums is assumed at all, to maximize accessibility for the casual..."
