language: English
recordingDate: 1487259476
description: "While Domain-Driven Design is supposed to take care of complexity in the very core of software, REST is usually treated a plain remoting technology. In the talk we're going to explore some commonalities of the two when it comes to the design of both the domain and resources. We're going to discover how a good domain design is essential to build a great REST API in the first place and which means REST provides to make your APIs more domain driven.\n\nFrom all of the building blocks of DDD, the talk identifies the ones most important when it comes to building a good REST API: we're going to look at aggregates as natural boundaries for representations, repositories as the backing foundation for collection resources and how hypermedia allows to make domain specific state transitions explicit."
