title: '"Why Linux Systems Administrators Should Care About the Mainframe" - Elizabeth K. Joseph (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579160305
description: "Elizabeth K. Joseph\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/139/\n\nMainframes still exist? In fact, more mainframes were sold in 2018 than in 1990! And Linux has run on them since 1998. In this talk, Iâ€™ll quickly cover what a modern mainframe is, and why Linux Systems Administrators may want to pay attention to them, from fascinating hardware to job opportunities.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 14:25:00 2020 at Arena"
