description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM Lite Munich 18: https://codesync.global/conferences/cbl-munich-2018/\n\nGet involved in Code BEAM Lite conference: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-lite-italy/\n---\nTALK TITLE\nBarrel, keep your data in sync in your Erlang application \nby Benoit  Chesneau\n\nBarrel is a database Benoit wrote from scratch in Erlang over the past two years that can be used embedded in an Erlang or Elixir application like Mnesia or standalone over HTTP from any applications or service. With Barrel, you can easily bring and keep a view (complete or partial) of your data inside your application and replicate it between your different machines.\n\nAfter briefly describing the architecture of barrel and its key features, the talk will show  how we  mix local and remote storages  and different peer-to-peer replications strategies to create a custom data platform. This data platform with thousands of nodes in Erlang or Elixir will be be used in a new application for general public.\n---\nTALK OBJECTIVES\nPresent barrel as an alternative of mnesia to build a modern data platform in Erlang or Elixir mixing different storage backends and locations using the replication and different peer-to-peer strategies. Some \n---\nTHEMES\ndatabase, p2p, replication\n---\nCode BEAM Lite LDN was brought to you by Code Sync. \n\nCODE SYNC Website: www.codesync.global \nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeMeshIO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/ Mail: info at codesync.global"
