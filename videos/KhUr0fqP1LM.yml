description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch 27, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nClassical texture mapping involves associating a single texture map with each polygon of a 3D scene. The pixels in this map are rendered onto the projection of the polygon in the rendered image, for every image generated of the scene. Consequently, for some viewpoints, the distortion of the texture map when projected to the image may produce results which are visually inferior. Moreover, the preparation of such texture maps, obtained by cutting pieces out of photographs, is time-consuming and error-prone. One solution to the problem is to render using multiple texture maps, such that the texture map used for each rendered image pixel is chosen on the fly,..."
