description: "Achieving the Ultimate Performance with KVM\n\nBoyan Krosnov, StorPool Storage\n\nMany companies build new-age KVM clouds, only to find out that their applications & workloads do not perform well. In this talk, I'll show the audience how to get the most out of their KVM cloud and how to optimize it for performance: People will understand why performance matters and how to measure it properly. I'll show how to optimize CPU and memory for ultimate performance and how to tune the storage layer for performance. I'll outline what are the main components of an efficient new-age cloud and which network components work best. In addition, I'll show how to select the right hardware to achieve unmatched performance for new-age cloud and applications.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
