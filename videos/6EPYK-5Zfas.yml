description: "??ATTENTION ??\nRegistration to ?DevTernity 2018 is running:\n? https://devternity.com\n\nAfter all the attention databases have been getting over the last years, it is high time to give some thought to queues. We will kick off with some considerations why you need queues in distributed systems and what their limitations are — in particular the at-least-once and at-most-once decision. And we consider when a queue is adding more complexity than it is worth. \nNext we discuss specific use cases. \n* Taking a look at ActiveMQ for starters, but also considering Kafka, Amazon SQS, and RabbitMQ. \n* Then we dive into Hazelcast — which seems to do everything, but might still not be perfect for everyone. \n* Finally we discuss Disque (kind of the brother of Redis), which is currently only a release candidate, but there are already production experiences."
