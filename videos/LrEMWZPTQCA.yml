language: English
recordingDate: 1596697478
description: "by Eric Herman, Kendrick Shaw and Stephanie Medlock\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2213/openelectronicslab.webm\n\nThe three main contributors to the OpenElectronicsLab projects started out as relative novices. The wealth of online resources and some trial-and-error opens the doors to the world of hardware design.\n\n\nThis will reflect on what lowered the barriers, insights gained, what needed to be done to handle things which turned out to be harder than expected, and to encourage hesitant novices to get started designing their own hardware.\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 16:55:00"
