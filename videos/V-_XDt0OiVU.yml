title: 'Cesar Valiente - Unidirectional dataflow on Android using Kotlin (DevFest Baltics)'
recordingDate: 1530806491
description: "Have you ever heard about unidirectional data flow? Flux and/or Redux? In this talk, we will talk about how to follow the principles that architectures like Flux and Redux do on the web, but on Android. What is a state? store? dispatcher? side effect? controller view? How do we glue all these parts together? How to keep our domain isolated from the outer world so is easily testable? how do we chain actions? how do keep everything unidirectional? We will cover all these topics and much more!!, and you know what? everything with a bit of Kotlin sauce, so we will see how we can take advantage of the cool stuff this language provide us to make our architecture even better.\n\nMore information about awesome conference: https://devfest.gdg.lv"
