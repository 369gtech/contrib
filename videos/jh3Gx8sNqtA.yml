description: "Ближайшая конференция — Mobius 2020 Piter\n22-25 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/mobius2020piter\n\n. We live in an age when code and data are the cornerstones of billion-dollar companies. You’d be surprised, though, at how easy it is to hack your way into most apps and take whatever it is that their VC-worthy idea is built on.\n\nIn this talk we’d like to share with you how some attack vectors are exploited, advise you on how you can secure your app against them, and talk about the pitfalls you’ll encounter when trying to make your app as impenetrable as possible."
