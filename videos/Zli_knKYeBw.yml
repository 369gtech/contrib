description: "Amazon is built on top of fine grained services that have a strong ownership model – you build it, you run it. These services are created by small teams to make it very easy to innovate. You can imagine this to look like a large group of startups within the walls of a bigger company. Each service needs to meet the needs of the customer, be it an internal or external one. To ensure this we use a process called “Working Backwards” in which you start with your customer and work your way backwards to the actual service or product. The goal of this process is to drive simplicity through a continuous, explicit customer focus. Thomas Lobinger will share how this process worked out for him at Amazon and what you can learn from this for your own projects.\n\nABOUT THOMAS LOBINGER\n\nThomas works for Amazon Web Services in Berlin. He joined Amazon after selling the startup he co-founded to Amazon in 2012. This startup became one of the Amazon Web Services and is now called AWS OpsWorks. Thomas joined as the Technical Program Manager for AWS OpsWorks.\n\nThomas’ current job is to drive innovation and automation in the world of frontend development. He has a small, super smart team in Seattle and Berlin to help him. Besides that, he is an advocate at Amazon to raise the bar on their customer experience."
