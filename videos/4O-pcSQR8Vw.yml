description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCERN's 1500 Drupal Websites on Kubernetes: Sailing With Operators - Konstantinos Samaras-Tsakiris & Rajula Vineet Reddy, CERN\n\nFollow the learning journey of junior developers towards a Kubernetes-native SaaS and hopefully get some ideas for your next (or first!) design. This talk is the development chronicle of a service provisioning Drupal websites that are CERN's public face, to replace the ageing physical infrastructure and reduce dependency on homebrew components. The presenters give their junior engineer's perspective, thrust into a world of Microservices, Observability and Operators. They will walk you through the design implementing the specific requirements of a service that targets varied user groups and is supported by a small team of engineers. Contrary to the old website management system that was a standalone application, now Operators play this role, leveraging Kubernetes as a common API to control different kinds of resources."
