description: "In the era of information overload, simple slides just don't cut it.\n\nBrace yourselves, for you're going to experience a never-seen-before JavaScript talk. Or rather, a meta-talk: a continuous, seamless display of rich media content where I'll describe how you can build this kind of engaging, hypnotic talks that involve the speaker, audio, visuals and a good dose of beats. All it takes is a little bit of rhythm.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/sole/4x4JS/blob/master/views/index.jade (raw source code)\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/soledad-penads-four-to-the-floor-javascript.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
