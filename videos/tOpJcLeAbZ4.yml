description: "Understanding your team’s engineering velocity can help you to find process inefficiencies, identify areas for potential improvement, and help to empower your teams and stop them from burning out.\n\nIn this session, we’ll take a look at how to understand the velocity of your engineering teams. We’ll think about how to measure, contextualise, and interpret the information we receive, and how this can be used to positively affect change in our teams."
