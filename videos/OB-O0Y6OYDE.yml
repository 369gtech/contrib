A journey that started with a small team trying to improve the searchability of Hadoop data. Over the years, this system has grown to be the central data hub where the entirety (more than a million) of data assets at LinkedIn (online, streaming and batch) have a home. This system is deployed at global scale, powers data productivity for all engineers and data enthusiasts, while serving as critical infrastructure for data privacy by default in our data systems. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/crunch"
