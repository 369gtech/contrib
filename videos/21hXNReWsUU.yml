description: "In the last decade, user demand for always-on applications have grown exponentially. Many developers choose application patterns to meet this need, but what about the infrastructure needed to support these ever growing demands? In this talk, we introduce you to the next level of automation using hands-on examples of industry standard tooling like Docker, a container format, and Kubernetes, a distributed automation platform. We cover the basics of modern day applications and how design patterns like microservices drive the need for more robust infrastructure. Then we cover packaging and distributing apps using Docker. Finally, we up our game to running applications on Kubernetes. By the end of this talk you'll have the knowledge needed to excel at scale.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
