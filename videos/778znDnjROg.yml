description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nThis talk will introduce the audience to writing gRPC applications in Scala using ScalaPB. gRPC is a modern, high-performance, open-source RPC framework focused on the requirements of connecting polyglot services in microservice-oriented systems. Its support of HTTP/2, protocol buffers, bi-directional streaming and type-safety make it an attractive alternative to traditional REST/JSON based service communication. gRPC support for Scala is available through ScalaPB - a community provided protocol buffer compiler that can be smoothly integrated into the sbt development workflow. Once integrated, ScalaPB will automatically generate the source code required for the implementation of the defined services and messages, as well as stubs for both synchronous and asynchronous clients. This talk will start with a short introduction to gRPC and its principles, followed by live coding examples of setting up gRPC with ScalaPB and implementing services and clients using various forms of gRPC communication styles, such as single request/response and bi-directional streaming. As a bonus - and if time allows - there will also be a demonstration about how to integrate gRPC with Akka Streams."
