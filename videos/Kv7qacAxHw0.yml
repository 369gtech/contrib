recordingDate: 1501247035
description: "Aleksander Piotrowski, freelance working mainly with Applause\n\nRoom is a new persistence library from Google announced during Google IO 2017. In my talk I'll walk through its features. Compare it with requery.io library and don't forget about testing and data migrations! Ideally after spending 45 minutes with me you will know if Room is for you and you should use it in your next project."
