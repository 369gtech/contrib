language: English
recordingDate: 1541880525
description: "We are social animals. We have evolved to depend on our tribes, literally, for our safety and survival. We identify ourselves as members of all sorts of tribes; our families, political parties, race, gender, social organizations. We even identify tribally just based on where we live.\nFrom my speech, you will learn the traits of strong tribes and the journey any group has to make to become a real tribe. We will be looking at the tribes you belong to and how can you help them become stronger and healthier.\n\nAbout the speaker: Vasilij Savin has been an Agile practitioner since 2008. After a successful career as an IT and Agile consultant in Sweden, he returned to Vilnius to assume an Agile Coach mantle in 4Finance. His main interests include modern management and leadership practices, tribal dynamics in teams, and how to work effectively. Eventhough Vasilij holds PSM and PSPO certificates, he considers himself beyond-Agile, using the practices and techniques that are most appropriate to given organisation and team maturity during the engagement."
