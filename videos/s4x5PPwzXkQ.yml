title: '"What Makes Decentralisation Hard? And How Do We Overcome This?" - Martin Krafft (LCA 2020)'

description: "Martin Krafft\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/90/\n\nPeer-to-peer technology has been around for decades, and has significantly shaped the file-sharing industry, much to the dismay of the media conglomerates. It wasn't until recent years, however, that the underlying concepts have entered other domains, such as communication tools, and storage. And of course: blockchain. And yet, despite the availability of technically sound and fully functional projects, widespread adoption is nowhere near.\r\n\r\nDrawing on his experience from working with digital identity startups, Matrix, Scuttlebutt, microblogging protocols (GNU social, Mastodon), and various blockchain projects, Martin takes a shot at identifying the reasons why the uptake is so slow. Using findings from his PhD research on the adoption behaviour of Debian developers with respect to version control systems and packaging techniques, he furthermore concludes with a number of suggestions that might help in taking projects beyond the early adopter phase.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
