description: "The Kubernetes ecosystem can be very operator focussed and it can be a challenge for developers to distill the information that is relevant for their job. There are a large number of available tools aimed at solving a broad set of problems but it can be daunting choosing which to invest in. This session aims to suggest best practices and get hands-on with some of the essential tooling.\n\nAbout the presenter: Alberto Rios is a software engineer interested in building products people love in agile environments with a focus on high-quality tests and clean code. He is part of the Spring Engineering team at VMware working from Seville, Spain on a fully remote team. \"We are building Spring Cloud related products and frameworks to help people adopting a microservices architecture and improving the experience of Spring in Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes.\""
