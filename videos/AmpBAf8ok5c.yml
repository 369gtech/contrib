description: 'The presentation introduces the journey that we have faced and challenged in adopting widely distributed software systems and Microservices-based architectures in our project. Firstly, we focus on how a full-blown service mesh solution fixes perfectly into our hard use cases in the real world Microservices project. Secondly, we show you how can we resolve interesting challenges such as connect, secure, control and observe services with Istio on the powerful Azure cloud platform with a fully managed AKS. Lastly, we give you a practical understandable demo which puts it all together, to sum up, what we did.'
