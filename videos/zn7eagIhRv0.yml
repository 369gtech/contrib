description: "The Pi on Wheels is an affordable open source DIY robot that is ideal for teaching Java-related technologies in the context of the Internet of Things. It can be controlled via a JavaFX-based visual IDE that utilizes beautiful JavaFX controls from Enzo and VWorkflows. In this session, you will learn how to assemble and program the robot with Java. It can be easily customized end extended. The session looks at how to connect the robot to Internet of Things devices such as an XBee-based sensor network. Most parts of the robot can be printed with PLA/ABS 3-D printers. Therefore, the presentation explains how to create 3-D geometries with JavaFXScad,  a JavaFX-based IDE for creating 3-D geometries. The attendees will get access to detailed assembly instructions and code.\n\n\nAuthors:\nGerrit Grunwald\nGerrit Grunwald is working as a software engineer at Canoo Engineering AG (Basel, Switzerland).
