description: "Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge. It deals with question such as how we know what we know? How do we justify it? What is the rationality of belief?\n\nA software developer debugging a production bug is asking very similar questions. The tools the philosopher has to answer those questions can inspire developers.\n\nTom will discuss similarities between influential philosophical concepts & software engineering, and writing code as a philosophical activity. The intention is to provoke the listener to go off the beaten path to find inspiration for the development of new approaches in & to software engineering."
