description: "Wesley Chun,  Guido van Rossum\r\n\r\nPython is one of the key languages at Google today. It runs on many our internal systems and shows up in many of our APIs. Some of the key contributors to the language are Googlers and continue to actively promote, use, and support the language. In this talk, we'll discuss Python's background & history, discuss its philosophy, show you some syntax, and give some examples of what we use it for at Google."
