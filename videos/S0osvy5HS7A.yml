title: 'Graphs from Malmö to Panama and Beyond by Emil Eifrem'
recordingDate: 1581886654
description: "The Panama Papers – the largest leak in journalistic history – exposed 2.6 terabytes in 11.5 million files spanning 40 years of records on more than 210k companies. Data on thousands of banks and major world politicians was disclosed, and the leak has led to 150+ investigations in 79 countries, many of them ongoing.\n\nThe impact of the Panama Papers received a major boost from the use of sophisticated data technology, including a locally grown (low carbon footprint!) graph database called Neo4j. Journalists and data journalists from all over the world used Neo4j to take complex webs of interactions and search them for interesting connections at phenomenal speed. This resulted in several prime ministers getting ousted from office or embarrassed, prominent sports figures being held to account for evading tax their fans pay and shady transactions of major international banks were laid bare.\n\nIn this talk, Emil will explore the Panama Papers story and how Swedish born open source data technology was used in one of the biggest global financial crime news stories in history.\n\nEmil Eifrem\nNeo4j\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
