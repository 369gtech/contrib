It's a hands-on workshop where each participant has a dedicated VM. In the VM, you deploy 3 Kubernetes clusters using Kind. One cluster is a management plane where Gloo Mesh is deployed, while Istio is deployed in the 2 other clusters. Then, you federate the identity of the Istio clusters, configure cross cluster communications, failover, learn about Web Assembly, ... And before each lab, we go through some slides. For example, before the identity federation, we explain you what is SPIFFE, how it's used in Istio, ... The labs are publicly available: https://github.com/solo-io/workshops/tree/master/gloo-mesh"
