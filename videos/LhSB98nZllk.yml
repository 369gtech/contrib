title: '"Frontiers in Cryptography" by Tony Arcieri'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474222860
description: 'Cryptography is an ancient idea, but modern approaches which draw from deep mathematics and have only started to pop up in the past decade. This talk will provide a broad survey of approaches for acting on encrypted data without holding a private key to the data, including property-preserving encryption, searchable symmetric encryption, functional encryption, and homomorphic encryption. It will also provide a historical context for the development of cryptography, addressing such questions as whether cryptography is "discovered" or "invented", what algorithms extraterrestrial cryptographers might use, and whether we can create encrypted Turing-complete programs which act only on ciphertexts.'
