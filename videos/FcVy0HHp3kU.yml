description: "Managing bigger projects based on HTML5 and JavaScript is difficult, because of the dynamic nature of the JavaScript language. With DukeScript there is a way to program JavaScript in Java. You can use the functionality of a JavaScript library without the pitfalls of JavaScript. This tutorial focuses on a couple of APIs for Knockout.js and HTML5 Canvas that use these techniques. It takes a look at these implementations and shows you how to create a Java API like that yourself to enable type-safe access and improve the maintainability of your application. The application developed can be deployed to desktop, iOS, Android, and any other platforms that support a modern browser.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAnton Epple\nToni is a Java Consultant and Trainer specialized in JavaFX and the NetBeans Platform...\nView more trainings by Anton Epple at https://www.parleys.com/author/anton-epple-5\n\nJaroslav Tulach\nJaroslav Tulach is the founder and initial architect of NetBeans, which is not just a well known IDE, but also the first modular desktop application framework written in Java. \n\nJaroslav will share his API experiences while talking about API Design Checklist - a must have set of rules to follow by every programmer writing code that is consumed by another being.\n\nRegardless how revolutionary NetBeans architecture was at the end of last century, most of it is not slim enough to fit into small devices that rule the world today. NetBeans IDE (as it is) cannot fit into your phone or tablet. Still we want Java that is small enough to run on small devices, phones, plugin-less browsers and more. \n\nThe HTML+Java technology, as designed by Jaroslav fulfills that gap. It is a way to write business ready, yet slim applications once and deploy them everywhere!\nView more trainings by Jaroslav Tulach at https://www.parleys.com/author/jaroslav-tulach-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
