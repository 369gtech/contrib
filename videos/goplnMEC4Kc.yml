title: 'Big Data-Driven Applications with Cassandra and Spark (Artem Chebotko, USA)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1468312612
description: 'Apache Cassandra and Apache Spark have proven to be a winning combination for building modern OLTP and OLAP applications that serve many millions of concurrent transactions and analyze petabyte-scale datasets. In this talk, we discuss requirements and challenges of big data-driven applications, how these requirements are supported by Cassandra and Spark, and what it takes to become proficient in these technologies. We then present the integrated architecture of Cassandra and Spark in more detail, introduce the Cassandra data model and query language, and focus on a selected subset of Spark Scala API. Finally, we demonstrate how to build your first functional recommendation system with Cassandra and Spark using less than 50 lines of code.'
