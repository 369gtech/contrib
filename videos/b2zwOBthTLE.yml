description: "Speaker: Kang Sheng\r\n\nContent Security Policy (CSP) is like a browser side firewall that helps protect against attacks such as XSS. By specifying the policy, the browser will follow your specifications to whitelist the assets that are allowed to be loaded on your website. It is really easy to configure CSP in Rails, but you might accidentally break your site when not done properly. In this talk, we will go through what is CSP and how can we roll it out safely to secure your website.\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Ruby-Group/events/272551921/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael"
