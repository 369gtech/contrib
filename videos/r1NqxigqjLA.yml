description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Marc Poppleton, Orange Labs.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=LQF-6083\n\nWe Android developers love desert. We love pie. We can't eat up a whole pie, but we can eat as many slices as we want.\nAndroid has a new API called Slices which is part of the AndroidX libraries. I'll show you how you can use it to serve slices of your app to any other apps like Google Search or Assistant but also any other app and in any Android desert you love.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
