description: "Did you know that one of the most headache-inducing problems a programmer will face in their career has only existed for barely 130 years? Time as we know it legitimately is a social construct, invented so we can do everything from predicting where a train is to scheduling a hangout with your international office coworkers.\n\nTogether we'll take a wacky adventure through history to learn why timezones are so confusing, why daylight savings time can feel like a form of torture, and why \"just use UTC for everything\" isn't necessarily the best idea. And while we're not going to walk away with a silver bullet answer to fix all our time problems, we will leave understanding the historical context behind the answer to why your automated emails went out a day early."
