description: "How can you gain more insight from your data? In this session we look at a specific application of the Google Cloud Platform to a Data problem while at the same time demonstrating that the same methodology can be applied to wide range of similar Data problems. We'll look at how you can spin up a Hadoop Cluster on demand in order to process large amounts of Data and then demonstrate how BigQuery can be used to gain real and actionable insight into datasets both large and small.\n\nMandy Waite, Developer Advocate"
