description: "Jenifer Foulkes, Richard Vevers \n\nGoogle and Catlin Seaview Survey's Richard Vevers have partnered together to bring the first ever underwater street view imagery to Google Maps. Learn how Catlin Seaview Survey has built a special camera to collect this spectacular surround imagery. Their goal in partnership with University of Sydney professor Dr. Ove Hoegh-Gulberg is to empower a global reef record to create a snapshot in time of the world's coral reef areas, starting with the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Explore also Apo Island, Philippines, Molokini Atoll, Maui, Hanauma Bay, Hawaii and now for the first time the pristine Raja Ampat, Indonesia. They have built an impressive 2.3 million following on Google Plus enabling public engagement through underwater diver hangouts.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
