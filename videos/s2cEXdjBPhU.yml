description: "“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” — Arthur C Clarke \n\nWell, machine learning can look like magic, but we don't need to be data scientists or ML researchers to develop with ML. Let's check this out... So, what about making our solutions smarter without any knowledge in AI? In this session, we’ll see how to transform or extract information from text, image, audio & video with the latest ML APIs, how to train an AutoML custom model, and we’ll be active players of a live demo. Don't put your smartphone on airplane mode!\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
