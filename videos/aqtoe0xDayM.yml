description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Berlin 2016\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAnstract:\nA 'taking to production' experience based talk about Scala.js, specifically tailored for Scala folks with chronic Javascript pain. People with and without Scala.js knowledge are equally invited. What to expect? Quick yet concise overview of moving Scala.js parts following by presentation of non coast-to-coast approach to Scala.js. Still not convinced to come to the talk? How about:\n* Spoiler #0: There will be no preaching to the choir. Huh? No slides about Javascript vs Scala. We all know the answer, aren't we?\n* Spoiler #1: Overview will be based on perks of Scala.js cross project. Crossbuilding knowledge is a power, you will see.\n* Spoiler #2: There is a strong presumption that a number of your frontend teammates willing to move to Scala.js is 0. You tell me if I'm wrong, I show you how \"\"my way or the highway\"\" is not your only Scala.js option.\n* Spoiler #3: It all will start making sense. See you on scala-js gitter."
