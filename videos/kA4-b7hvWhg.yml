description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nPhil Calçado - Director of Engineering at SoundCloud\n\nABSTRACT\nAt SoundCloud we ask candidates to send us some code before inviting them in for interviews. Candidates can use whatever language they want, and over the past years we saw a massive rise on the number of submissions using server-side JavaScript. Unfortunately, too many submissions are asynchronous blobs of procedural code.\n\nJavaScript is a fairly functional language, and over the past decades Functional Programming developed interesting solutions for many of the problems we face when writing Node.js and regular JavaScript. Let's talk about how to leverage good old Functional Programming techniques to make code less coupled and more readable!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
