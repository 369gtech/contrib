description: "Paul Sandoz, Senior Software Engineer, Netflix\n\nIn each release, the Java platform may contain a few large enhancements and numerous smaller enhancements, such as additions to existing APIs or performance improvements. Such smaller enhancements may not be as visible as the larger ones but can be important either individually or as a whole to the success of the Java platform. This session introduces several those smaller enhancements in recent Java releases that may be of interest to developers. Where appropriate, the presentation provides examples."
