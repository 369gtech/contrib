recordingDate: 1581624003
description: "Anti-Patterns are like patterns, only more informative. With anti-patterns you will first see what patterns reoccur in \"bad\" retrospectives and then you will see how to avoid, or remedy, the situation. Based on her experience with facilitating retrospectives, join Aino for an entertaining and informative presentation on the anti-patterns she has seen and how to overcome the problems. She gave the first version of this talk at YOW! 2014, and since then she has identified more and this talk will be interesting for everyone facilitating any kind of meeting, with retrospectives in focus.\n\n\nAino Corry is a teacher, a technical conference editor and retrospectives facilitator. She holds a masters degree and a ph.d. in computer science. She has 12 years of experience with Patterns in Software Development, and teaches retrospectives, OO design, software architecture and development in academia and industry. She also teaches how to teach Computer Science to teachers, and thus lives up to the name of her company; Metadeveloper. In her spare time, she runs and sings (but not at the same time).\n\n\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
