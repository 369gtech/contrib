description: "What do you get when you combine Calico’s rich networking and network policy capabilities with the latest eBPF capabilities of the Linux kernel? Join us to find out!\n\nSometimes referred to as the Linux kernel’s “super power”, eBPF allows you to write mini programs that can be attached to various low-level hooks and executed inside the Linux kernel, for a wide variety of uses including networking, security, and tracing. You’ll see a lot of non-networking projects leveraging eBPF, but for Calico our focus is on networking, and in particular, pushing the networking capabilities of the latest Linux kernel’s to the limit while maintaining Calico’s reputation for simplicity, reliability and scalability.\n\nIn this webinar you will learn the basics of how eBPF works, how it can be leveraged for networking, and what the benefits (and drawbacks) are for users interested in switching from Linux’s standard networking pipeline to Calico’s new eBPF optimized dataplane."
