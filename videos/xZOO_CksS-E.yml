description: "Microservices need DDD absolutely. Bounded Contexts, a key DDD ingredient, is the tool of choice to define services boundaries that won’t end up in a complete disaster at runtime and at deployment time. And for a given service, the Hexagonal Architecture is a great implementation style as well.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll get a deeper understanding of what these abstract buzzwords are all about, illustrated with short Java code. You’ll discover how to really split your monolith correctly, and when to go Hexagonal, or not, because one should never abuse of the good things. It will be fun, with perhaps a few surprises as well!\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
