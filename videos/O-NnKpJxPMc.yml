description: "We shall look at the use of the Semantic Web technology stack at Capish Nordic\nAB - a Malm√∂-based company offering a service of transforming tabular data to a proprietary graph database Capish, which helps users to make sense of, pool and analyze their (legacy) data.\n\nThe data transformation machinery must fulfill a few key requirements:\n\n* Have access to a controlled vocabulary, aka data schema, aka Capish Ontology\n\n* Be able to formulate data conversions and mappings in terms of the vocabulary entities\n\n* The conversions must not break or become invalid because of simple vocabulary updates such as term renaming\n\nAs we shall see, the requirements have been successfully met by using RDF, OWL, SPARQL, and a triple store - the core Semantic Web technologies - as a data layer for both the data transformation machinery and the vocabulary editing software.\n\nFor dessert, we shall admire the expressivity of OWL by formulating the Zebra Puzzle (a rather famous logic puzzle also known as Einstein's problem) with it, and then solving the puzzle instantly with an OWL reasoner.\n\n\nAbout Oleg Mirzov:\nOriginally a physicist (got a PhD in Lund in 2008), Oleg always liked data processing, and then developed an interest in formal knowledge representation, namely, ontologies. This predetermined a serious change in career, and for the last 5 years now he has been working with data conversions and development of ETL tools and data analysis software."
