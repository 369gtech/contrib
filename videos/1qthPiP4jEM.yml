recordingDate: 1494276040
description: 'People in tech are prone to working too much and all the time. Most of us really love what we do. We want to do our best. We want to succeed. We want to change the world with the code we write. Besides our normal day jobs we are involved in a ton of open source and community related volunteer projects. We work long nights. We work weekends. We give all we have. And a lot of times we forget ourselves. We neglect family, friends, and hobbies. This work ethic may seem great at first glance but the consequences are drastic. In order to prevent those drastic consequences from happening we need to take a step back and evaluate. We all need to learn to take better care of ourselves! We all need to learn to practice SELF care more and more efficiently. Learning to take care of your SELF can be hard sometimes. It’s something you need to practice continuously. The goal of this talk is to 1) take a look at self-care: What is it? Why is it important? Why is it so hard? What can happen if we don’t take care of ourselves? and 2) teach you how to continuously practice self-care. When you take care of your SELF you have so much more to give! * Introduction - Who am I?
