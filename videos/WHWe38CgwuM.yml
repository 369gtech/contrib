description: "Character encoding, just like many other tasks in our industry, seems straightforward and predictable. But when you look close enough, correct encoding of Polish or Chinese characters is not that obvious. During this seemingly trivial talk I'll show you, how complex Unicode can get. What kinds of problems, also related to security, we can expect. How many traps are buried in the specification and its Java implementation. For example did you know that a single UTF-32 character can take as many as... 28 bytes? And did I mention the Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 2015, that is... ':joy:' (yes, emoji, we'll talk about them as well).\n\nIf you believe that `char` is the best type to encode characters in Java, come to my talk!\nIf you ever used `String.length()` to calculate the length of a `String` and you think it returns the number of characters - I'll tell you the truth\nIf you don't want people getting killed because of a Unicode-related bug in your application, I'll teach you how. Yes, unfamiliarity of Unicode can kill. Literally."
