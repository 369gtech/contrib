description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2019\nhttps://dddeurope.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\n\nBounding complexity with domain specific languages \n\nTwo languages are described: \n\n1. Contract Definition Language - for expressing and evaluating insurance terms and conditions.\n2. Structure language - for expressing and evaluating the flow of quantities through a network of contracts and operators.\n\nI show a simple application enabling the manipulation, visualization and evaluation of complex reinsurance programs.\n\nBiography\nWith over 30 years of experience as a professional software developer, I have worked with a number of complex domains, which include: technical document management, computer aided design, and ad-hoc workflow systems.\n\nIn 2007, I attended a half day seminar on DDD conducted by Eric Evans. The seminar, and the blue book that came with it, scratched an itch I had barely been aware of.\n\nFor the last ten years, my focus has been building tools to model massive re/insurance structures."
