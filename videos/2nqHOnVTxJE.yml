description: "Google Workshop on Quantum Biology\nClassical and Quantum Information in DNA\nPresented by Elisabeth Rieper\nOctober 22, 2010\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\nDNA stores and replicates information. Special sequences of different nucleic acids (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine) encode life's blueprints. These nucleic acids can be divided into a classical part (massive core) and a quantum part (electron shell and single protons). The laws of quantum mechanics map the classical information (A,C,G,T) onto the configuration of electrons and position of single protons. Although DNA replication requires perfect copies of the classical information, the core that constitutes this information does not directly interact with the copying machine. Instead, only the quantum degrees of freedom are measured.  Thus successful copying requires a correct translation of classical to quantum to classical information. It has been shown [1] that the electronic system is well shielded from thermal noise. This leads to entanglement inside the DNA helix. It is an open question if this entanglement influences the  genetic information processing. In this talk I will discuss possible consequences of entanglement for the information flow and the similarities and differences between classical computing, quantum computing and DNA information processing. \n\n[1] E.

Since 2008: PhD studies in 'Quantum Coherence in Biological Systems' at CQT Singapore under supervision of Vlatko Vedral. This includes both finite dimensional entanglement (spin-spin entanglement in the avian compass, arxiv: 0906.3725) as well as infinite dimensional entanglement (phonons in the electronic degrees of freedom in DNA, arxiv: 1006.4053), exploiting correlations for work extraction (The work value of information, arXiv:0908.0424) and complexity theory.\nCurrently investigating the possible influence of entanglement on the information flow in biological systems."
