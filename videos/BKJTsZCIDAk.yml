description: "As more and more people are starting to deploy their application to the cloud, new architectural patterns have emerged, and some old ones have resurfaced or become more prominent.\n\nIn this session, Mahesh Krishnan, will run through a large catalogue of cloud patterns that will cover categories such as availability, resiliency, data management, performance, scalability, design and implementation. You will learn about what problem each and every pattern addresses, how to implement them and what considerations you need to take into account while implementing them.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
