description: "Jose Amadeo Martin Diaz Diaz, PERU JUG Leader, Peru JUG\nVíctor Orozco, CTO, Nabenik\nJorge Cajas, CTO, inin.global\n\nOne of the early innovations in the Java EE space was the possibility of measuring performance by using JMX and vendor-dependent APIs. Despite this, there are contexts where a monitoring tool such as VisualVM could not be used like secured app servers, special PaaS, and microservices with JVMs in elastic configurations. This session discusses the pros and cons of using MicroProfile Metrics in traditional (monolithic) and distributed (microservice) applications, describing when and how the various metrics (counted, gauge, metered, metric, timed) could give you an advantage. It presents an example of using it over Payara and some considerations of integrating these metrics with specialized tools such as Prometheus and Bash scripts."
