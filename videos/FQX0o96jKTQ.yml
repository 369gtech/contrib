recordingDate: 1477931286
description: 'The more I look at our economy and many of the companies that drive it, the more I see a machine with a bad design, one that shouts, “Humans don’t really matter.” That’s why I subtitled this year’s conference “Technology and business as if people matter.” We have to stop thinking about people working for companies and start making companies work for people. Sara Holoubek and I are clearly thinking along similar lines. Her Human Company Manifesto is one of the seminal documents of the Next Economy. She’ll outline its key tenets.'
