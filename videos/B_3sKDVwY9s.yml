description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWater is a Driving Force of Innovation: Open Source in the Dutch Government! - Onno Brouwer, Rijkswaterstaat & Tomasz Klimek, Grape Up\n\nImagine applications dedicated to \"Keeping a proper level of water in all Dutch waterways\" or \"Providing all cargo ships traveling throughout the country with a guaranteed travel slot.\" Now consider running and maintaining them 24x7 in ‘the cloud’ as a government agency. Failure is not an option. Sounds stressful, right? Running mission-critical systems, meeting all customer requirements, and providing a fully self-service experience is our goal. To do that, we are creating a multi-cloud, hybrid cloud-native application platform based on Open Source technologies, such as Kubernetes, Grafana, Prometheus, Harbor, Minio, or Shield. Providing such services as a government agency is demanding. Awareness of potential damage done by denial of services is also a strong motivating factor. This presentation will cover lessons learned & challenges that happened to our team while planning and building \"One platform to run them all”."
