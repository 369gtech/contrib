description: "Kubernetes Security and How to Fix K8s Cluster at Scale - Simon Pearce, SysEleven & Sebastian Scheele, Loodse \n\nAs a hosting provider, we have the challenge to run and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters for various customers on our infrastructure, similar to e.g. Google or Azure in a secure way. The majority of these clusters are fully managed by us. Our customers want to build and run containers. Not maintain and upgrade Kubernetes clusters. In this talk, we will give you a breakdown on how we help our customers to secure their clusters and how we can force Kubernetes upgrades to all clusters in a scalable way. We will use the Kubernetes API bug occurred in December as an example to show how we could fix all Kubernetes clusters in a very short time frame. This talk focus on the secure operation of multiple Kubernetes clusters and the requirements a Cloud Provider have to it. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYO"
