description: "This session demonstrates how to make use of the Concurrency Utilities for Java EE, using a hands-on approach including working code demonstrations. The examples are presented in a problem/solution/how-it-works recipe-style format that correlates usage of the API with real-life scenarios. Attendees will learn how to make use of ManagedExecutorService, ManagedScheduledExecutorService, ContextService, and ManagedThreadFactory resources, via practical examples. The presentation explains server-side resources and configuration via GlassFish, submitting tasks for asynchronous processing, and handling results. In the end, attendees will be able to go back to the office and start making use of the Concurrency Utilities for Java EE.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJosh Juneau\nJosh Juneau works as an application developer, system analyst, and database administrator.
