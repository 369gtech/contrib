description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nLeveraging Service Meshes for Accelerating Serverless Workflows - Paarijaat Aditya & Manuel Stein, Nokia \n\nServerless platforms increasingly provide support for function composition (e.g., Knative Eventing, Fission, KNIX). To reduce function interaction overhead within a workflow, platforms may choose to co-locate multiple functions inside a single container along with a custom local messaging mechanism. In this design, the functions of a complex workflow may have to be partitioned across multiple containers, requiring invocations to a downstream function to be load-balanced between its replicas across containers. Service meshes could provide such load balancing; however, they lack locality awareness for the workflow. This talk explores how service meshes can be extended to be co-location aware and to provide a single data plane for both intra- and inter-container messaging. Lessons learned implementing such a co-location aware data plane, its advantages and pitfalls are also presented. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekEe"
