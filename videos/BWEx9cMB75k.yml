description: "Full talk title: Using software engineering practices to improve engineering management\n\nAs a new manager, your changed responsibility is not to build features, but to build systems to support the people building the features. It can be a challenge to figure out how to prioritise problems alongside the day to day pastoral care of your team.\n\nIn this talk, \"Using software engineering practices to improve engineering management\", you’ll learn how to apply agile software engineering principles to your new career in engineering management. DRY, single responsibility, separation of concerns - how can you use these familiar tools and techniques from your time as a software engineer to help ease yourself into management?\n\nThis is a practical show & tell of how we organise engineering management work at FutureLearn, and a discussion of the good and bad things about it. After this talk you’ll be able to take advantage of all the familiar ways of working you learned about engineering as a developer.\n\nAbout Nicky Thompson\nNicky is a Technical Manager at FutureLearn, providing management and support to the Technology Team.\n\nShe has spent more than two decades as a freelance and in-house developer (including an earlier four-year stint at FutureLearn) - delivering successful projects for clients ranging from global banks and major publishing houses to indie storytelling agencies. She’s worked with designers all over the world, making beautiful websites that work for everyone.\n\nOffline, Nicky enjoys watching bad TV and learning new stuff: this year it's a serious sewing/dressmaking habit."
