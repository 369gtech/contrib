description: "I am a backend developer, like many of you. So what should I do when I need to show some data? Write a console app (sigh)? Or maybe learn CSS and JavaScript (deeper sigh)?\n\nI am using F# and functional programming for my daily tasks, so when I heard about MVU pattern and functional approach to UI development offered by Elm language and brought to F# by Fable and its Elmish extension, I became eager to try it in our projects. Did it deliver? Was I really able to write a decent Web site all in F#? Come to my talk and you can judge for yourself!\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
