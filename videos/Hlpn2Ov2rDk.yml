description: "Microsoft Azure is huge! In this session, I'll show you how to use some of the Platform-as-a-Service service in Azure to design and create a modern, ASP.NET Core application that will be used globally.\n\nAmongst other things, I'll show you how to route global traffic with Azure Traffic Manager and how to use Azure Redis Cache to speed up the application. I'll also show you how to script the environment so that we can deploy it consistently to all of your environments using Visual Studio Team Services. And I'll show you how to secure the application with Azure App Service Authentication! We'll go through a lot stuff that will show you that Azure helps to take care of the plumbing and \"boring stuff\", so that you can build things that matter!\n\n\nNote: Due to technical issues there is no picture until 3:37"
