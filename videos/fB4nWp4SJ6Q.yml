description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2018 Conference https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nTales from the QA crypt - Jennifer Voss\n\nAn anthology of QA horror stories from the past, and how to avoid such situations with TDD. When tests are built in from the beginning and not tacked on after features are built, fewer defects are created and development moves faster. JavaScript has all the tools required to cover your automated testing needs, and writing tests in the same language as your app is a no brainer. We'll cover the tools available today and the logistics of merging your QA and dev teams."
