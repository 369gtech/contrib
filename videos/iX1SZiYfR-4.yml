description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS Conference 2017, June 8 https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nHernan Magrini, Software Engineer at Udacity\n\nAssuming everyone uses the web with a 10 Mbps connection and a Macbook Pro it's rather utopian. At Udacity we have a daily traffic of millions of page views from people all around the globe and we always aim to serve the best experience possible even if you're browsing the sites with an old Android with a 3G connection. We'll see what critical steps we follow to make sure we are making our sites as fast as possible."
