description: "Phil Karlton famously pointed out that one of the only two hard things in Computer Science is naming things. While many of us dismiss naming as Programming 101 material, the names we choose can have a major impact on the cost (and sanity) of future development.\n\nDrawing on over a decade of API development, this lightning talk attempts to put a dent in one of the industry's most difficult and long-lived challenges -- in just ten minutes!\n\nIn addition to real-world (and sometimes embarrassing) examples of what NOT to do, this talk includes tips and suggestions for finding names that stand the test of time."
