description: "The ability to chat with your fellows is an important feature of games and social applications. In the talk I discuss chat features of mobile and web applications. I start by describing messaging protocols and focus on XMPP. Then I present techniques of connecting client applications with servers (TCP, HTTP and WebSockets) and discuss benefits of each technique.\n\nThen I will focus on how server scalability can be achieved and will share experiences from implementing MongooseIM - an XMPP server in Erlang. \n\n\n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
