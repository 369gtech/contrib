description: "As more and more developers move to distributed architectures such as micro services, distributed actor systems, and so forth it becomes increasingly complex to understand, debug, and diagnose.\n\nIn this talk we're going to introduce the emerging OpenTracing standard and talk about how you can instrument your applications to help visualize every operation, even across process and service boundaries. We'll also introduce Zipkin, one of the most popular implementations of the OpenTracing standard.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
