description: "Google Tech Talks\nDecember,  5 2007\n\nDomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an emerging IETF standard (RFC\n4871) to authenticate sending domains in SMTP mail. It is designed\nto be scalable, extensible, back-compatible, and adoptable without\nany flag days.\n\nThis talk will cover the background of sender domain authentication\nin general and DKIM in particular, details of how DKIM works, and\nother issues that DKIM brings up, notably sender accreditation and\nreputation and receiver policy. Sendmail's Open Source\nimplementation of DKIM will also be discussed.\n\nSpeaker: Eric Allman\nAs Sendmail's Chief Science Officer and co-founder, Eric Allman leads the company's technology strategy and direction. Allman authored sendmail, the world's first Internet Mail program, in 1981 while at the University of California at Berkeley. He continues to spearhead sendmail.org, the global team of volunteers that maintain and support the sendmail Open Source platform.\n\nAt the forefront of industry-leading trends and technology, Allman is currently a leader of the movement to adopt an international standard for Sender Domain Authentication. Allman, backed by a cross-industry group of companies (Cisco, Yahoo, PGP, et. al.), co-authored the draft specification for DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and submitted it to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).\n\nBefore joining Sendmail, Allman served as CTO for Sift, Inc., which is now part of 24/7 Media, Inc. He was lead developer and provided a large-scale research software infrastructure on the Mammoth project at U.C. Berkeley. Allman has contributed as a senior developer at the International Computer Science Institute to neural network systems design. Allman was also Chief Programmer on the INGRES Relational Database Management System and an early contributor to Berkeley UNIX, authoring syslog, tset, the troff -me macros, and trek in addition to sendmail. For several years, he has co-authored the \"C Advisor\" column for UNIX Review magazine. He was formerly a member of the Board of Directors of USENIX Association and is currently a member of the ACM Queue Editorial Review Board.\n\nAllman holds an Masters of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley."
