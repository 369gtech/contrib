description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotjs.io on December 1st in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nThe web platform in 2017 is powerful. What if we used that power for evil? What kind of terrible UX could we create if our goal was to build *the worst web page in the world*?\n\nWatch Feross livecode his way deep into the web platform, while demonstrating how new and old APIs can be used and abused for fun!"
