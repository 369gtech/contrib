title: 'Apache Flink Worst Practices - Konstantin Knauf'
recordingDate: 1588078516
description: 'Distributed stream processing is evolving from a technology in the sidelines of Big Data to a key enabler for businesses to provide more scalable, real-time services to their customers. We at Ververica, the company founded by the original creators of Apache Flink, and other prominent players in the Flink community have witnessed this development from the driver’s seat. Working with our customer and the wider community we have seen great success stories and we have seen things going wrong. In this talk, I would like to share anecdotes and hard-learned lessons of adopting distributed stream processing – Apache Flink specific as well as across frameworks. Afterwards, you will know, how not to model your use cases as a stream processing application, which data structures not to use, how not to deal with failure, how not to approach the topic of monitoring and much more.'
