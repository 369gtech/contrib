description: "Theo Schlossnagle, Circonus\n\nMost SRE techniques revolve around resiliency and reliability of service delivery. Most \"product\" is the type of product that is deployed, not shipped. At Circonus, we deal with a lot of on-premise software shipment due to hybrid customer requirements. It turns out that many SRE techniques can apply directly to the construction, packaging, and shipment of installed software as well. In this talk, we'll learn all about it.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
