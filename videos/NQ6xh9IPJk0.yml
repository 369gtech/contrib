description: "The FIRST Robotics Competition, a community that includes more than 300,000 students and 100,000 volunteers, will support Java SE Embedded starting with its 2015 controller platform. Learn how Java SE Embedded 8 is used to control the robot, the effects of JIT and advanced GC in a somewhat real-time system, and the real-life benefits of the Compact Profile. This joint WPI/FIRST session includes robot demos and videos.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDerek White\nDerek White is an engineer in the Java SE Embedded group at Oracle in Burlington, Massachusetts.\n\nPreviously I worked in Oracle/Sun Labs on the Squawk JVM - an open source virtual machine written almost entirely in Java. Squawk was a Java ME system designed for small embedded devices. Squawk was used in the SunSPOT project, a (shipping) Container Monitoring Device, as well as in the FIRST Robotics Competition.\nView more trainings by Derek White at https://www.parleys.com/author/derek-white-3\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
