recordingDate: 1548073113
description: "Web performance has become a very hot topic, and a top concern for the success of websites and web-apps. Both users and search engines expect sites to load quickly, and to respond quickly to user interactions. At the same time, sites and apps are becoming more complex and engaging, which often leads to them becoming heavier, and adversary impacts performance. This places significant burden on testing and QA to ensure that performance doesn't degrade as more features and capabilities are added.\nIn this session Dan explains what performance means in general, and on the web in particular, including terms such as First Contentful Paint (FCP), First Meaningful Paint (FMP), and Time To Interactive (TTI). Dan describes methods and tools using which performance can be checked an monitored during development, testing, and in production. And he shows approaches and techniques that can be used to ensure good performance, such as setting and maintaining Performance Budgets.\n\nBio: Dan Shappir is a performance Tech Lead at Wix.com in the infrastructure team of the Client Editor. Dan is a twenty year software development veteran, holds an M.Sc. in Computer Science, and has spoken at numerous technical conferences."
