description: "This session describes new features in JSR 341, Expression Language (EL) 3.0. It describes the APIs for the use of EL in standalone environments and EL syntax for new operators and lambda expressions. EL 3.0 also includes support for collection objects: their construction, and operations (such as filter and map) on them. The APIs are illustrated with Java codes, plus EL syntax with EL expressions. The presentation briefly describes use of EL in an application server, such as in JSF and Avatar.\n\n\nAuthors:\nEdward Burns\nEd Burns is a Senior Staff Engineer for Oracle Corporation where he chairs the JSR 344 (JSF 2.2) Expert Group and contributes to the open source Mojarra project.
