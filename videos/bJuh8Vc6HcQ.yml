title: 'Math for Game Developers - Procedural Generation (Uniform Sampling of a Circle)'
recordingDate: 1417723207
description: "We want to generate points uniformly in a circle, so we try to understand probability density functions to make sure that we generate the points uniformly.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/probability-uniformcircle\n\nNew video every Thursday. Question? Leave a comment below, or ask me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VinoBS\n\nEXERCISES:\n\n1. One technique of generating points in a circle is to generate points in a square and then remove points that fall outside of the circle. Why is this method better?\n\n2. How might you generate random points inside a sphere?\n\n3. Tricky: How might you generate blue noise (from the previous video) inside a circle?"
