description: "Machine Learning Model Serving and Pipeline Using KNative - Animesh Singh & Tommy Li, IBM \n\nLifecycle support— including continuous development, training, testing, and deployment of machine learning models—and continuous integration (CI) for AI applications is still in its infancy. We need a solution that enables end-to-end automation of data preparation and model deployment pipelines.In this talk we are going to show how to leverage KNative components to create an event driven AI pipeline. We will leverage OpenWhisk and Kubernetes to provide an event driven platform, and Istio for traffic management and observability to construct a pipeline which will provide interfaces to various open source tools: model training, validation. serving platforms on KubernetesWe will show how we can leverage this AI pipeline to train using advanced batch scheduling in Kubernetes, automate A/B tests and canary testing of models, monitoring concept drifts and accuracy losses etc. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrVt"
