description: 'In this lesson we want to create a fork from the original project to our personal profile where we created the fork. We want to clone the project into our local computer. Into our local computer we want to run “npm install” to get all the dependencies and then run “npm start” to see our localhost server working properly. After this we want to create a new branch and for this new branch we make a change, commit it and we create a pull request which goes back to the original project. We set the status of this one with WIP, which means working progress. Let''s have some fun!'
