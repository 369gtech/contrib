description: "Ask and vote for questions at https://developers.google.com/events/794092483/\nJoin us for a technical deep dive with Chrome engineer Cary Clark about Skia Path Ops—High Performance Set Operations for Geometry. Skia is the 2D graphics engine used by Chrome and the Android Framework. Skia's SkPath object describes contours containing lines and curves. Path Ops computes unary path operations like Simplify, and binary path operations like Intersect, Union, and Difference. Path Ops enable higher performance with OpenGL and a better mapping from Skia to Postscript.  Cary Clark discuss the challenges in creating a commercially viable algorithm and some of the arcane math involved."
