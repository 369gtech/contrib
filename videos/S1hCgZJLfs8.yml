description: "Earth Science presents interesting issues of large, multi-dimensional datasets stored in a variety of idiosyncratic file formats. In this talk, we'll work through some specific workflows and explore how various tools - such as Intake, Dask, Xarray, and Datashader - can be used to effectively analyze and visualize these data. Working from within the notebook, we'll iteratively build a product that is interactive, scalable, and deployable.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData Ann Arbor Meetup - April 10, 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJulia Signell \n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nPyData YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjD18EJYcsBog4IozkF_7w"
