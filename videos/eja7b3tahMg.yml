description: "Kubernetes The Database - Jonathan Owens & Maryum Styles, New Relic \n\nIn the operations world, one of the hardest problems is keeping track of your inventory: Which machines belong to which teams? Which machines are in service? How long have they been there? At New Relic, the ability to keep track of a massive inventory that runs across multiple providers quickly became an unbearable task so much so that it required designing a completely new central {tracking?} system that could scale with a large infrastructure. In this talk, youâ€™ll learn how Jonathan Owens and Maryum Styles used the Kubernetes API server to jump-start this design and create a unified infrastructure description service. They will share how they defined resources, created controller services, and dramatically decreased the process of manual updates. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrYP"
