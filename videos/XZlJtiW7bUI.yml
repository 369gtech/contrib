title: 'Using Flink SQL on Ververica Platform'
recordingDate: 1635787803
description: "From connectors to catalogs, Flink SQL offers a wide range of features to make writing streaming SQL applications a breeze both for developers and SQL-savvy non-developers. How can we use these features to create a collaborative, out-of-the-box environment for working with Flink SQL across people and entire teams? In this talk, we’ll explore how Ververica Platform does just that. We’ll take a look at the platform and discuss how it works under the hood to make Flink SQL easily accessible:\n- Using persistent catalogs to share resources across teams for collaboration.\n- Leveraging custom catalogs and connectors to access data from external systems.\n- Exploring your data interactively to develop SQL scripts and deploy them."
