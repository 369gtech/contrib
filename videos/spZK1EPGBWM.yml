description: "Turning Multi-cloud Deployments into Useful Events - Andy Lowe, Allstate\n\nModern CI/CD pipelines should be automatically deploying to your CF environment on commit. If you have multiple foundries, coordinating deploys across them can be a problem, especially if something fails. Deployadactyl is an open source tool for doing multi-cloud blue-green deploys with rollback to ensure zero-downtime deployments. Learn how Allstate uses this tool for thousands of deployments each month. Deployadactylâ€™s internal event model allowed us to add security and reporting checks into each deploy. This improved our compliance controls and lowered our security risks while simplifying the deployment process for our development teams. All this combines to allow our development teams to spend time focused on their product and less time focused on infrastructure. \n\nAbout Andy Lowe\nI am a product manager at Allstate's CompoZed Labs. As part of the automation engineering group, I work on products focused on allowing our developers go faster with higher quality and greater security. Current products include: - Automated API management processes, saving development teams weeks of time on each new API endpoint. - Cloud Foundry deployment tools, which transparently added security controls to thousands of cloud deployments each month with zero effort from development teams. - Increased accuracy of our governance processes by improving the data model of our configuration management system and helped build tools for automatically updating it. At previous companies, I have managed products focused on security, compliance, and e-Discovery. I have also worked as a developer in the content management and medical devices fields. Previous speaking experience includes local Cloud Foundry meetup and DevOps Days events."
