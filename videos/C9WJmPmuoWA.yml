description: "Attention spans are at an all-time low. People are making more choices per day than ever before, adding to a rise in Decision Fatigue. By creating UX that removes choice, we are at a crossroads, visually and ethically, to create products that can help or hurt this trend.\n\nAs applications get smarter, design becomes more spartan.\n\nAugmented Intelligence allows us to be more anticipatory with our software, and user experience turns into a world of distraction-free notifications rather than endless buttons and keypresses.\n\nIn this talk, weâ€™ll examine the trend toward proactive design and the cultural shift it is creating."
