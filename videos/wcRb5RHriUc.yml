description: "Join the chat and ask questions live at https://aka.ms/LearnLiveTV\n\nStarting Monday, March 15, 2021 (PST), join Anna Hoffman and Bob Ward live on Learn TV and explore the six-part Microsoft Learn \"Azure SQL Fundamentals\" learning path. Each week, Anna and Bob will be walking through each module live and answering your questions. \n\nMany organizations have an aging or under-engineered data platform strategy. There's been a significant trend of moving existing systems to the cloud, building new applications quickly by using the cloud, and offloading some on-premises costs. You need a plan for how to move some workloads to the cloud. And you need to understand how to set up your organization for success. You also need to understand how the role of a database administrator (DBA) or data professional stays the same, and what changes you'll have to make. In this module, you'll start with a brief history of why and how Microsoft built Azure SQL. You'll then learn about the various deployment options and service tiers, including what to use for your organization, and when. These options include Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and SQL Server in an Azure virtual machine. Understanding what platform as a service (PaaS) encompasses and how it compares to a traditional SQL Server environment will help you understand what you do and don't get when you move to the cloud.\n\nAzure SQL Fundamentals: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-sql-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=learnlive-video-learn\n\n#AzureSQL #AzureSQLFundamentals #LearnLive"
