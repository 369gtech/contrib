description: "The Rocket Science of Deploying Cloud Foundry in Multi-Cloud Environments - Andrea Aymon & Fabio Berchtold, Swisscom\n\nIn this session Andrea and Fabio will give you a big picture on how a multi-cloud architecture at Swisscom looks like and how to deploy Cloud Foundry on top of it. They'll share their experience and knowledge about multi-cloud BOSH deployments, how to enable continuous deployments within them, where you should pay attention to and - last but not least - how it was engineered. One of the biggest challenges was the connectivity engineering part - at Swisscom we have Cloud Foundry and BOSH deployments stretched over different OpenStack and VMware installations spread across several data centers. This architecture provides a maximum of failure tolerance and high availability as demanded by our customers. We're going to look over the general architecture, operations and continuous deployment of the Swisscom Application Cloud which is based on the open-source Cloud Foundry distribution.You'll also get an overview about how the integration and migration between the different infrastructures can work and take advantage of BOSH's powerful multi-CPI feature and Concourse pipelines to do so. After attending this talk you should know about how to get rid of the most painful challenges in setting up a multi-cloud environment.\n\nAbout Andrea Aymon\nAndrea Aymon is working for more than one year at Swisscom (Switzerland) Ltd as a Cloud Engineer on the Swisscom Application Cloud project. She was responsible for the infrastructure engineering part based on OpenStack and contributed greatly to the software defined networking setup used by Swisscom for all of the Application Clouds networking connectivity and is an expert on it's inner workings and operational aspects. She had the main lead in engineering and building up the new multi-cloud stacks from an infrastructure side - which consists of setting up the OpenStack installations and their networking connectivity which enabled the spanning of BOSH deployments like Cloud Foundry over multiple data centers in the first place. Her current work effort is mainly focused on the migration of Swisscom Application Cloud onto VMware infrastructure - this includes setting up continuous deployments and connectivity engineering between the old OpenStack based multi-cloud environments and the new VMware based setup. Last but not least, this also means a lot of effort in development of all the tooling involved - mainly written in Golang.\n\nAbout Fabio Berchtold\nFabio Berchtold is working since 13 years at Swisscom (Switzerland) Ltd as an Application Engineer, and for more than 2 years on the Swisscom Application Cloud project. He is Swisscom's foremost expert on all things regarding the Cloud Foundry runtime, BOSH and Concourse. He was the main responsible for engineering and introducing the Swisscom Application Cloud's continuous integration and deployment pipelines through Concourse, the main engineering effort in integrating the Diego runtime, and responsible for many of Swisscom's different Application Cloud environments and BOSH installations. He is also a passionate Golang developer and contributor to various Cloud Foundry projects including Diego and BOSH and has a habit of developing entirely new BOSH releases as a hobby. His previous speaking experience includes webinars and community talks about Docker, Cloud Foundry, BOSH and Concourse at various Docker and Cloud Foundry meetups in Switzerland, and on company internal trainings and onboardings for his fellow developers onto the Swisscom Application Cloud. His current work effort is mainly focused on the migration of Swisscom Application Cloud onto VMware infrastructure."
