This can be shown by the growth of the number of software developers learning Elixir, in anticipation of job opportunities, the companies adopting Elixir will offer. We will discuss some problems facing Africa, especially those which these companies are solving and why Elixir is suitable for these given problems. We will also discuss the growth of the Elixir community, its impact on both Elixir and non-Elixir developers, together with the success, lessons and challenges facing both adoption (companies and developers) and the Elixir community\n\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Getty Orawo\nRun-on rails but obsessed with Elixir.
