description: "Speaker: S J\n\nI coded Mastermind) on BASIC when I was 12.\n\nI embedded Star Wars opening theme on the 8080 board during the wire wrapping and assembly language lab in university.\n\nSometimes I wonder if my geekiness is a blessing or a curse. On hindsight, it may have been a curse that it inflated my ego not to take the computer science / engineering course, thinking that I could learn all these by myself.\n\nFast forward to present day. I'm responsible for a team who builds some of the largest Drupal sites in Singapore, and beyond, in a world where web development is getting more complex and getting closer to software development workflow. With Drupal, we can build some sites without writing any single line of custom code. But with more complex UX design requirement, it is getting harder not to customise Drupal core functions. When Drupal 8 architecture allows customisation without hacking the core modules, there is little excuse for me not to learn good programming skills.\n\nIn this session, I will share:\n\nHow I learn good programming skills by learning Drupal, especially Drupal 7 and 8.\nThe single most important skill to have for becoming better programmer, and how to train that skill.\nNew concepts in Drupal 8 which may put off people coming from hobbyist background like me: OOP, services, containers, dependency injection.\nIf there is enough time, I will share configuration management, Twig template engine and how Drupal Console keeps us happy as Drupal developer.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nSJ eats, sleeps, and breathes Drupal. Since knowing Drupal in 2005, he has helped clients launch complex scalable platforms on Drupal. His knowledge and skills on system and large architecture design have made big complex sites like Singtel, I²R, XinMSN / Toggle manageable by a small team of people. He always strives for building platforms which help other people lead happier, more productive and more fulfilling lives. When he’s not busy with his family, he’s active in the Singapore Drupal community by organising meetups and workshops.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VGXe/"
