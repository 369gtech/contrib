language: English
recordingDate: 1626266806
description: "The much-discussed micro frontends come with their very own challenges and trade-offs. People keep wondering if their benefits pay off for their projects and how to implement them. This session with Manfred Steyer brings some light into the darkness.\n\nWe start with looking at several real-world use cases I helped to plan and implement in the last years. They are from different branches: Finance and Accounting, Banking, Insurances. However, we also talk about projects where we deliberately decided against micro frontends. Using these scenarios, we work out reasons for using and not using this new architectural style.\n\nIn the second part, we talk about implementation strategies. We look at Module Federation which is a game-changer for Micro Frontends not only in the area of SPA. After seeing how to integrate it with Angular and the CLI we discuss consequences, necessary trade-offs and alternatives.\n\nIn the end, you'll know if micro frontends are a good choice for your project and how to implement them.\n________\nRewatch more recordings from our past conferences at our video portal ➡️ https://frontenddeveloperlove.com/video \n________\nOur upcoming conferences:\n➡️ https://vuejs.amsterdam/\n➡️ https://reactlive.nl/\n________\n#jsworldconference #jsworldconferenceusa #frontendlove #vuejsamsterdam #javascript #reactacademy #react #microinteractions #designsystems #artificialintelligence #speaker #conference #frontendlove #frontenddeveloperlove #javascriptconference #frontendconference #vue #angular #react #cfp #meetup #conferences #events #mobx #newyork Sign up for our newsletter: https://www.frontenddeveloperlove.com/newsletter\nStay up to date via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontendlove/\n\nPowered by https://passionatepeople.io\n\n#unittests #webaudio #unittesting #hiphop #frontendlove or #vuejsamsterdam #javascript #reactacademy #react #microinteractions #designsystems #javascript #artificialintelligence #amsterdam #speaker #conference #frontendlove #frontenddeveloperlove #javascriptconference #frontendconference #vue #angular #react #cfp #theateramsterdam #meetup #conferences #events"
