description: "Today we have the ability to write fully Functional-Reactive code in JavaScript, using RxJS. However, in our day-to-day life we often use RxJS alongside other libraries and patterns that make our life easier, but also distance us from pure Functional-Reactive Programming (FRP). What would an app that has been written completely in RxJS, and in-line with the principles of FRP, look like? In this talk we will examine such an app, and use it to understand what truly functional-reactive code in JavaScript looks like, and what are the principles that underlie it. \n\nEVENT:\n\nYou Gotta Love Frontend 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nNetta Bondy\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish YGLF videos.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nYGLF YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-fOxx_kT5OARG0KiksiCA"
