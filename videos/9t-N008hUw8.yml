description: "Mindaugas Mozūras is a software developer, book reader, speaker, movie lover and an all around geek. Most of the time these days he spends doing his darned best to help make second hand the first choice worldwide as Head of Engineering at Vinted, world’s biggest preloved fashion marketplace with a community of 12 million people in 11 countries, backed by $60M from Accel, Insight Venture Partners and Hubert Burda Media.\n\nWhen he's not doing that, Mindaugas contributes back to software development community. He has made significant contributions to open source with his own projects and improvements to existing ones. Mindaugas is also a frequent speaker at software development community events, sharing his personal experience and that of Vinted Engineering team, who are big fans of continuous deployment, releasing code hundreds of times per day into production."
