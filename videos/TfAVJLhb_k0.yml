Validating behavior across diverse interoperating devices is a significant testing challenge. To test Chromecast, several approaches were taken. We outline test frameworks, lab infrastructure and test tooling that we developed to generate reliable quality signals from the product. We detail the challenges of testing a product that operates in noisy networked environments. We propose that test tooling for devices such as Chromecast is in its infancy and presents opportunities for innovation in software test engineering."
