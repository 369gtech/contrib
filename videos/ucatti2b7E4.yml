title: 'Nordic.js 2018 • Tomas Della Vedova - Why we built another framework'
language: English
recordingDate: 1544608488
description: "Last year we started working on a new web framework for Node.js, Fastify.\nFastify is a highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture. Why you built another web framework? This is one of the questions we get more often. Most of the currently available web frameworks are well established, work with a defined pattern and have a very big usage among Node.js users. Try to innovate how they work is too risky, you will destroy the compatibility with the past. This is how the open source world works, “or you die as innovator, or you live long enough to become the technical debt”.\nWith Fastify we wanted to push forwards the limit of the platform and engage a sane spirit of competition with other framework creators. We focused on build from zero an architecture pattern, a plugin system and other components of the framework. We focused also on build a future proof system, that will help the users build what they need in the easiest way possible.\n\n\nTomas Della Vedova\nTomas is an enthusiastic software engineer, who spends most of his time programming in Javascript and Node.js. He constantly forwards the enrichment of his knowledge and the exploration of new technologies. Moreover, he truly believes in the open source philosophy and he will always be passionate about technology, design, and cinema.\n\n\nNordic.js is a single track conference with talks by internationally renowned speakers and rising stars in the JavaScript community.
