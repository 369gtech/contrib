description: "Speaker: Jakub Pilimon, Software Developer / Trainer / Architect\n\nEvent sourcing architectures naturally lead to messaging and CQRS-based services. We can benefit from getting rid of typical relational database models and replacing them with event reconstruction. \n\nJoin this webinar to understand how events naturally imply projections and different read models for data. In this talk we will explore these patterns, implemented with real Spring Cloud Stream applications. We will review how ES and CQRS concepts were perceived and used in the databases construct for many years and what's new about them in microservices context. \n\nAnd weâ€™ll learn how to leverage eventual consistency and event-driven architecture with the use of pure Spring tools! For the fans of Functional Programming, you will learn how you can model your domain with just functions, pattern matching, left fold and immutability. Never lose information in your ORM-based system again!"
