description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia November 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nAnita Sengupta - Rocket Scientist, Professor of Astronautics and Space Technology University of Southern CA, CEO & Founder of Hydroplane\n\nABSTRACT\nIn the global marketplace that transfers knowledge at the speed of light, we have a massive time delay that is modern transportation methods. We each spend up to 30% of our lives commuting on congested freeways, airports, and train stations. We put green-house gases into the atmosphere and change our climate with global consequences to health, habitat loss, and our economic future. On the cargo front this results in lost revenue, productivity, with no clear path to address the growing demands of the global market place.\nWhat if we could disrupt transportation, an aging and non-agile industry which has not seen a new mode in over 100 years. By introducing game changing technologies we can increase capacity, enhance energy efficiency, and shrink our carbon foot print. Dr. Sengupta will discuss how space-age tech coupled to the VC funded innovation environment are enabling the revolution in green transportation.\nShe will share her real-world engineering projects from her work developing the world’s first Hyperloop in Las Vegas Nevada, to autonomous VTOL air taxis her new company is designing in Detroit Michigan [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:17 Understanding your place in the universe\n05:00 We can build the future we imagine\n06:12 Technology has changed the world\n11:44 What is the near future?\n11:54 The Hyperloop\n16:43 AI enabling tech for mass transit\n19:23 Air travel\n21:12 Urban transport re-envisioned\n24:55 Smart grid\n25:35 Space flight\n28:49 Actual flight on Mars\n29:38 VTOL aircraft coming soon\n31:16 Would you want to live on Mars?\n31:25 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/november-2020/sessions/1638/the-future-of-sustainable-transportation\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Transportation #Sustainability #SustainableTransportation #Green #GreenEnergy #GreenTransportation #Mars #VTOL #Hyperloop #MarsRover #Hydroplane #NASA #Futurology #AI\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
