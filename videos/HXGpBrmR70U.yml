title: 'Ashton Kemerling - Generative Integration Tests'
recordingDate: 1416679931
description: "Functional programmers are already aware of generative testing libraries like test.check as a supplement or replacement for traditional unit testing. Since unit tests alone cannot cover an application, integration tests are typically used to assist in verification and regression detection. Given the difficulty of creating integration test cases, it makes sense to combine the power of generative testing with the necessary complexity of integration tests to find errant application behavior. In this talk we'll go over the tools and techniques used to wire up generative tests to a large JS application, Pivotal Tracker, and also talk about the complexities of introducing Clojure to a traditional Ruby and JS shop.\n\nAshton is a developer at Pivotal Labs where he writes Javascript for Pivotal Tracker. Residing in Denver, Colorado with his fianc√© and two cats Ashton is an avid hiker, an inexperienced but enthusiastic angler, and fences regularly in the Italian longsword style."
