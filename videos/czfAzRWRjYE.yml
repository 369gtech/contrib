description: "Artificial intelligence is defining a new generation of computer technology with applications that blur the boundaries between intuition, art, and science. These technologies are powered by a new paradigm: instead of handcrafting algorithms as long instruction codes, AI algorithms result automatically from applying data to models. This has direct implications on how computer hardware is designed for the new technology frontier.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
