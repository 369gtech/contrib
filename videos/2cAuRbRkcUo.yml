title: 'Big Data 2.0 as your New Operational Data Source'
language: English
recordingDate: 1611281579
description: "A large part of value provided from IoT deployments comes from data. However, getting this data into the existing data landscape is often overlooked. In this session, we will start by introducing what are the existing Big Data Solutions that can be part of your data landscape.\n\nWe will then look at how you can easily ingest IoT Data within traditional BI systems like Data warehouses or in Big Data stores like data lakes. When our data is ingested, we see how your data analysts can gain new insights on your existing data by augmenting your Power BI reports with IoT Data. Looking back at historical data with a new angle is a common scenario. Finally, we'll see how to run real-time analytics on IoT Data to power real time dashboards or take actions with Azure Stream Analytics and Logic Apps. By the end of the presentation, you'll have an understanding of all the related data components of the IoT reference architecture.\n\nData warehouses: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/data-warehousing/?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa\nBig Data: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/data-guide/big-data/?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa\nPower BI: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa\nAzure Stream Analytics: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/stream-processing-stream-analytics?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa\nIoT reference architecture: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/iot?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa\nCheck out more on Microsoft Learn: https://aka.ms/IoTelp40"
