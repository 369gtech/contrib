description: "Google Test Automation Conference 2010\r\nOctober 28-29, 2010\r\n\r\nCrowd Source Testing, Mozilla Community Style\r\nPresented by Matt Evans, Mozilla\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nSoftware testing and crowd sourcing are made for each other. The reach of today's web based applications extend well beyond country borders. Take for example today's modern web browser. A software application that rivals the complexity and features of any computer operating system. To become a successful world player in the web browser market, your browser must correctly render web pages and media across the global landscape of bleeding edge web standards to web pages written years ago.\r\n\r\nMozilla and its global community has been developing the Firefox browser for over a decade and continues to hold second position in the global browser market. A dominant success factor can be attributed to the participation of Mozilla's community in the testing of Firefox. In this talk I will show how Mozilla has been using crowd sourced testing and feedback monitoring of the nearly million member beta testing community to assess Firefox release readiness and demonstrate why Mozilla's testing and user communities are at the true heart of it's current and future success.\r\n\r\nSpeakers Bio:\r\n\r\nMatt Evans' career spans from establishing QA efforts in startups to running test engineering in large public companies. Matt has recently taken on the position of Mozilla QA Director and is diving into the world of open source development and testing. Prior to Mozilla, he was the QA Director at Palm where he managed the testing efforts for the Palm Pre smartphone WebOS applications. In addition, he was part of the founding team and Sr. Director of Engineering Services at Agitar Software which pioneered automated test generation from Java source code. Matt holds a B.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Oregon and lives in San Jose, Ca. When not getting out the latest release, Matt tries to spend his time enjoying the family cabin near Donner Lake, CA.\r\n\r\nTalk Slides: https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B4fT-BFGDnQkNzQ3MjQ5NDMtYjZiZi00MTUyLWIwZWUtNTI4Njc3NGE0ZDYw"
