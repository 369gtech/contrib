description: "Ask and vote for questions here: http://goo.gl/2b7Ds\n\nNow that you've got a handle on what Chrome Apps are and what they can do, we're going to build an app live, and dive into the new Windowing API to show you how you can completely configure the look and feel of your Chrome App window. We'll also explain more about Content Security Policy, and how it might affect your development. \n\nRemember, we want to hear from you! What are the APIs that you're most interested and excited about? Tell us at http://goo.gl/7ZQUN so we can cover the things you're most interested in first!\n\nBe sure to add this event to your calendar and tune in next Tuesday!"
