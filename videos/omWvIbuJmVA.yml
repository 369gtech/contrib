description: "Thoth: Comprehensive Policy Compliance in Data Retrieval Systems\n\nEslam Elnikety, Aastha Mehta, Anjo Vahldiek-Oberwagner, Deepak Garg, and Peter Druschel, Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)\n\nData retrieval systems process data from many sources, each subject to its own data use policy. Ensuring compliance with these policies despite bugs, misconfiguration, or operator error in a large, complex, and fast evolving system is a major challenge. Thoth provides an efficient, kernel-level compliance layer for data use policies. Declarative policies are attached to the systems’ input and output files, key-value tuples, and network connections, and specify the data’s integrity and confidentiality requirements. Thoth tracks the flow of data through the system, and enforces policy regardless of bugs, misconfigurations, compromises in application code, or actions by unprivileged operators. Thoth requires minimal changes to an existing system and has modest overhead, as we show using a prototype Thoth-enabled data retrieval system based on the popular Apache Lucene.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '16 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions"
