description: "Carter Morgan (Google): What does a production ready Kubernetes application look like?\nThis talk is a bit... different. Instead of telling you what \"production-ready\" means, we'll cover the questions you need to ask to determine it for yourself and your application. We'll cover common types of cloud applications; the different areas of concern for each of them; and what questions you should be asking yourself before shipping code into production. Along the way, we'll use a container automation framework, Kubernetes, to show examples of these various concerns and application types. This is a great talk for anyone wanting a clear overview of what a \"production-ready\" cloud application looks like. After this talk, you will: Understand the common classes of cloud applications Know the different areas of concerns for each application type Know the questions you need to ask to ensure you're production ready.\n\nThe speech was given on 2017-05-18 at infoShare 2017 (Tech Stage) in Gda≈Ñsk.\nhttp://infoshare.pl\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
