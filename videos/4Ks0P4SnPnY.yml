description: "Easy Freshness with Pequod Cache Joins\n\nBryan Kate, Eddie Kohler, and Michael S. Kester, Harvard University; Neha Narula, Yandong Mao, and Robert Morris, MIT/CSAIL\n\nPequod is a distributed application-level key-value cache that supports declaratively defined, incrementally maintained, dynamic, partially-materialized views. These views, which we call cache joins, can simplify application development by shifting the burden of view maintenance onto the cache. Cache joins define relationships among key ranges; using cache joins, Pequod calculates views on demand, incrementally updates them as required, and in many cases improves performance by reducing client communication. To build Pequod, we had to design a view abstraction for volatile, relationless key-value caches and make it work across servers in a distributed system. Pequod performs as well as other inmemory key-value caches and, like those caches, outperforms databases with view support.\n\nView the full NSDI '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi14/technical-sessions"
