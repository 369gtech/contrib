description: "Kotlin as a Language for Frontend Development\n\nKotlin is a young programming language. Originally it was designed to target the JVM, but now it targets the JavaScript too (and even Native). During this talk, we discuss aspects of Kotlin JS, like:\n* interop with JavaScript; \n* things which work differently compared to JVM; \n* sharing code between targets; \n* and more."
