description: "In this session, Martin Wezowski talks about the 4 dimensions of an innovation vision of work. All four will affect every aspect of work-life and the software that will support it. Why will you be relevant in 10 years from now? Why will your offering to the world be needed, and maybe loved, if you can't articulate a great answer, you might not be... relevant.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
