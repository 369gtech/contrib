description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nBack in time, I started out as a strong individual contributor. I loved to have a team around me and collaborate with them, but when it came to doing “my part”, I did it only by myself. I was uncomfortable when another one “peeked over my shoulder” to see what I was doing, or when they even wanted to do it together with me.\n\nBut then I heard about this strange new approach of mob programming, having the whole team work on the same task, same place, same time, same computer - which was such an unusual idea that it instantly fascinated me. I told my team about it; they surprisingly agreed to give it a try; and it changed our world.\n\nJoin us on our journey and see what we discovered along the way. Learn how our mobbing experience helped us to start pairing, on various tasks across “disciplines”. This is our story of how the whole team is growing even closer together, constantly learning from each other, while delivering our best.\n\nHaving graduated in sinology, Lisi fell into agile and testing in 2009 and has been infected with the agile bug ever since. She’s especially passionate about the whole-team approach to testing and quality as well as the continuous learning mindset behind it. Building great products which deliver value together with great people is what motivates her and keeps her going. She received a lot from the community; now she’s giving back by sharing her stories and experience. She tweets as @lisihocke and blogs at www.lisihocke.com. In her free time you can either find her in the gym running after a volleyball, having a good time with her friends or delving into games and stories of any kind."
