description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nAlmost all in software industry agrees that design patterns are important and beneficial for success of any project. Some regard them as an essential part of ‘good practices”. In a perspective there is something sexy and awesome in reading some code and recognize applied design patterns.\nIn real situations, one of the things that fall in oblivion and somehow get lost from developers perspective, right after documentation and most probably side by side with tests, are design patterns. Both in design and architecture phase and implementation phase.\nNowadays, the software solutions are more and more complex. The need to mimic the real life is greater and greater. Ergo the need to use and apply the proven solution from real life and software industry described as 'design patterns' should be more in our focus and part of our solutions."
