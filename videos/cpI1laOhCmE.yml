title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays - Cloud Foundry for Kubernetes With Tiffany Jernigan'
language: English
recordingDate: 1590588829
description: "Starting at the top, there is Cloud Foundry (CF), which is an open-source cloud app platform, providing a choice of clouds, developer frameworks, and app services. Users wanted to have a Kubernetes-native CF distribution, and thus Cloud Foundry for Kubernetes (CF-for-K8s) was born. This talk covers tooling used with CF-for-K8s, (e.g. kapp, ytt, cf) and components that work together that make it up (e.g. Cloud Native Buildpacks and Istio). It also explores using CF-for-K8s via a demo.\n\n===\n\nTiffany is a senior developer advocate at VMware and is focused on the realm of Kubernetes. She mostly recently was working as a software developer and developer advocate (nerd whisperer) for containers at Amazon. She also formerly worked at Docker and Intel. Prior to that, she graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in electrical engineering. In her free time she likes to spend time with her fianc√©, family, and friends as well as dabble in photography."
