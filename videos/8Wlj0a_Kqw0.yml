title: 'DEF CON 29 Adversary Village - Stephan Wampouille - Autonomous Lateral Movement'
language: English
recordingDate: 1629143744
description: 'See autonomous lateral movement in a live environment. In this Linux-based attack, multiple benign behaviors - each designed not to be detected - are chained together to complete a lateral movement action. Using a creative approach to parsing indicators of compromise out of RAT responses and injecting them automatically into commands later down the kill chain, this lateral movement demonstration will be fully hands-off. The techniques and TTPs in this demonstration will be made open-source following the talk.'
