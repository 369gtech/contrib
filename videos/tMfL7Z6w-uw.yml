title: 'Fireside Chat #13: What does being a senior developer mean?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632394242
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso, Mashooq Badar, and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss what makes someone a senior software developer. What are the expected behaviours and skills? What is the impact a senior software developer should have? \n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
