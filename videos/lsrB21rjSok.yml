description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nA Walk Through the Kubernetes UI Landscape - Joaquim Rocha, Kinvolk & Henning Jacobs, Zalando SE \n\nWorking with Kubernetes clusters and workloads can be overwhelming, both for operators, as well as application developers. While kubectl is the de-facto standard interface to interact with Kubernetes' API, a graphical user interface can provide a better experience for newcomers and advanced users alike. This talk will look at the current landscape of Open Source Kubernetes web and desktop UIs, including Kubernetes Dashboard, Lens, Octant, Kubernetes Web View, and Headlamp. Particularly, how different dashboards are built, for what purpose they can be used, and how they compare in terms of functionality, so attendees can get the most out of the vast landscape of Kubernetes UIs. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekAd"
