title: 'Vuetify, The Path to 2.0 with John Leider'
language: English
recordingDate: 1547823600
description: 'John Leider is the creator of Vutify, the component framework that utilizes Google’s Material Design Spec. In this talk John covers the new features and functionality that’s up and coming in Vuetify 2.0. Specifically, he’s looking to improve customization by making it easier to configure, using Material Design 2 custom themes, and allowing for the modification of your Vuetify settings from the Vue CLI UI. Vuetify 2 will improve performance through automatic tree shaking (or what they call “a-la-carte”), smaller bundle sizes, and optimizations across all device sizes. It will also be more accessible, with full RTL support, section 508 compliance, and following web content accessibility guidelines. The last is support, which they’ll do by releasing weekly patches, daily canary builds, long term support, and engaging community.'
