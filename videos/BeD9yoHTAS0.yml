description: "Todd Palino, LinkedIn\n\nIncreasingly, technical organizations are developing career paths to build and recognize leaders outside of the traditional management roles. But what should an SRE who wants to be a leader be focusing on? Through the eyes of an engineer who reinvented his career in one of the largest SRE organizations, we will examine what technical leadership looks like, and how an individual can help guide the strategic path of a team, department, or company without taking on the role of a people manager. You'll pick up tactical work that you can start immediately to set yourself up for success, and some pointers to be able to identify the opportunities when they show up.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
