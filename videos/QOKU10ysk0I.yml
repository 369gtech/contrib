title: '"Software for Court Appointed Special Advocates" by Linda Goldstein'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634131422
description: "Sustainably developing open source software is famously impossible and I'm not sure that this is it but we're faking it very well. Born in 2019 through the collaboration of Ruby for Good and CASA Prince George County, rubyforgood/casa has now expanded to serve hundreds of Court Appointed Special Advocate volunteers for multiple CASA organizations (there are 938 in the USA, as every county court is slightly different). rubyforgood/casa supports CASA volunteers and supervisors with data recording and reminders as they help youth in the foster system access services. Alternatives include salesforce(complicated) and Optima(expensive). We get rave reviews (along with minor bug reports) from the heads of CASA organizations during our weekly stakeholder checkins. Linda has been one of the leads for the project since the beginning and there are currently four active leads including one PM.\n\nLinda Goldstein\n@goldlindastein\n\nLinda (she/her) is a software developer working currently in healthtech, previously in airlines, QSR, and other industries. She writes code for Ruby for Good for free and good, and Parachute Health for money and good. When she isn't coding, she enjoys riding bicycles for distances between zero and 50 miles, and reading and writing science fiction and fantasy. She can frequently be found somewhere near an airport and is currently based in San Francisco.\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop 2021\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"
