description: 'Azure Data Studio is a cross platform multi database tool designed with the data developer in mind . Now with an integrated Notebook experience you can learn machine learning jobs using Python and Spark within Azure Data Studio. Azure Data Studio provides some of the best in class packages like “PROSE” for data preparation which no other Notebook in the world provides. In this session we will provide an overview on Azure Data Studio, demo how we can use PROSE for data preparation and then build a Machine Learning Notebook using some of the common ML packages. We will also show a quick sneak peek into the SQL Notebooks and how we can also author Notebooks in SQL and leverage some of the ML functionalities of the core SQL engine'
