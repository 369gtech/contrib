description: "In his eloquent talk, \"Fail, Learn, Fix: Improving Security the Old Fashioned Way,\" Payne recognizes how past events hold potential in the evolution of changes of future policy. Payne cites an example of the combined effort of how the government and the military produced the building of a top-secret, multi-level, information storage resource. Bottom line: Take lessons from history on how to fail, learn, and fix problems together.\n\nEVENT:\n\nAppSecCali 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBryan Payne\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpA1l7nEIuA"
