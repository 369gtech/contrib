recordingDate: 1538557154
description: "Huddly makes the world's most intelligent collaboration camera. It is the only camera in the video collaboration space that features a hardware-powered convolutional neural network. Hear about our technology and how we make use of design thinking to develop product features.\nThese days, many startups feature some kind of artificial intelligence, but fewer have a clear plan for how their AI should be applied to user-facing products. At Huddly, design driven development is an important part of our work. You will see how we user test and optimize our machine learning models for user experiences. You will also learn about edge computing and how and why Huddly is investing in it.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
