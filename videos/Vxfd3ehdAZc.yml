description: 'The goals of Project Jigsaw are reliable dependencies and strong encapsulation, but what does that mean precisely? This session explains the process of module resolution in JDK 9 and shows how it avoids errors relative to the classpath in JDK 8. It also explores the double-edged sword of modular accessibility, where the ability to hide a moduleâ€™s internals must be balanced against the needs of frameworks that perform reflection. Prepare for a deep dive into module graphs; class loaders; unnamed modules; and the once and future king, setAccessible.'
