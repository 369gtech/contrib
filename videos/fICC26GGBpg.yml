title: 'Optimizing ClojureScript Apps For Speed - Allen Rohner'
recordingDate: 1447804683
description: "Single Page Clojurescript Apps are the new craze, because they bring the goodness of Clojure to javascript and allow for rich UI interactions. But they have a few downsides, including speed. In this talk, we'll discuss ways to optimize your app, with an emphasis on page load times. Topics include dynamicly loading clojurescript modules, server-side Om rendering, and UI libraries that run in both clojure and clojurescript.\n\nAbout the speaker: Formerly founder and CTO of CircleCI, now founder of Rasterize. Allen has been using Clojure professionally since 2009. Allen has shipped 3 startups in Clojure, and written numerous OSS libraries."
