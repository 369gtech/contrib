language: English
recordingDate: 1542101917
description: "In one hand Kubernetes became the standard for the deployment of microservices and we started to see people stating that you can also take advantage of Kubernetes to deploy your legacy applications in the cloud. In the other hand GitLab and its integrated GitLab CI get always more attention and it can now perfectly integrate with Kubernetes clusters.\n\nBased on our experience we'll show you how Kubernetes (with a touch of GitLab CI magic) may be your best friend to take your existing development workflow to the next level. This presentation will not be about continuous delivery and Kubernetes in production. It will be about Kubernetes for the ordinary developer in the room.\n\nWe developed a few utilities and created a powerful workflow that is now enabled on projects in our company. We'll be speaking about enabling dynamic environments for feature branches, easy update of existing Kubernetes deployments, some heresy like embedding an application server into a Pod, having fun as a developer and much more.\n\nStéphane Tournié \nFrom Sopra Banking Software\nFormer Java developer for SERLI/Codenvy I'm now trying to find the right way to the cloud at Sopra Banking Software.\n\nI'm part of a team dedicated to automation. I love Git as much as shell scripts and automating as much as trappist beers.\n\nEtienne Vrignaud \nFrom Sopra Banking Software\nFull stack architect and Git evangelist using GitOps in my day to day work."
