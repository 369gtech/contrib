language: English
recordingDate: 1604574667
description: "Rather than focusing on making everyone feel the same as everyone else; belonging focuses on allowing individuals from disparate backgrounds to feel valued and embraced for what makes them unique.\n\nIn this session, we’ll take a look at what a culture of belonging actually looks like to engineering leaders from different backgrounds and with different perspectives. We’ll also consider how engineering leaders can create cultures of belonging at their own companies, ensure that everyone’s viewpoints are seen and accounted for."
