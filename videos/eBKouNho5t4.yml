description: "Co-Evolution of Kubernetes and GCP Networking - Purvi Desai & Tim Hockin, Google \n\nThis talk will explore the trials and tribulations behind the evolution of GCP Networking for Kubernetes and evolution of Kubernetes to meet provider requirements.    Our key guiding principle is to provide managed solution while maintaining portability and consistency. Question of consistency with OSS vs provider’s solution is not just on providers’ minds but also on our users’ minds as they decide whether to use OSS or managed offering. We have gone through the journey from supporting subset of features to making Kubernetes a first-class platform for networking. But there are still open questions. With ecosystem extending to hybrid, multi-cluster and service mesh, these questions become even more relevant.    Talk will cover learnings on how we see GCP networking evolving in offering Kubernetes solution and in evolving Kubernetes to provide better extensibility for providers. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPb9"
