title: 'When you’re going through hell, keep going: Using machine learning to deliver Tesla Model 3s'
recordingDate: 1543956891
description: "Michael Lindon, Senior Data Scientist, Tesla\nPresented at MLconf 2018\nAbstract: In August 2018, the Tesla Model 3 outsold all BMW passenger cars combined in the United States. How did Tesla scale vehicle delivery to customers as it more than tripled the number of cars produced – and delivered to customers — throughout 2018?  In this applied talk, Michael will describe some of his recent work at Tesla developing predictive models for ETAs. Forecasting accurate ETAs along with quantifying uncertainty in a complex logistics network is imperative to the smooth running of operations and the making of optimal decisions. This is a challenging problem due to the sheer complexity of outbound logistics. Transit lead times and dwells are influenced by a plethora of factors and further complicated by rich dependency structures across the network. This talk walks through a complete Bayesian analysis, from modeling to inference to decision theory.\n\nSee Michael's presentation slides on our slideshare page here: https://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/when-youre-going-through-hell-keep-going-using-machine-learning-to-deliver-tesla-model-3s"
