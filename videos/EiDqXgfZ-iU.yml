description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nScalaQuest is a fun, enticing game that will take you from Zero to Hero in your path to learning Scala (1).\nYou will battle Goblins and Wizards and face all kinds of challenges to prove your worth.\nStart on the warm, safe haven of plain harmless classes, hike over Variance Hills and make your way to the treacherous implicit forests.\n\nOur goal with ScalaQuest is to make it one of the least painful ways to learn Scala. This might be the first time you ask your team members to play a game during work hours.\n\nIn this talk, we will showcase our work in progress with ScalaQuest, and share our experience building it - our design decisions and the challenges we've faced. We will then focus on the technical challenges related to compiling user-submitted code on the server side while trying to keep a snappy UI.\n--\n(1) or will be, at some point in the future, hopefully."
