We'll take apart the Pivotal-provided resources and talk about how they can be used as a template in your own designs to implement Pivotal Platform in a public cloud. The primary technologies used are Terraform, textplate, and om. Learn what our PaaS offering looks like in a hybrid cloud offering spanning multiple on-prem data centers, as well as Azure locations.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2pLmQ4R\n\nSpeakers: Olaf Gradin, Principal Platform Architect, Fiserv and Brian Smith, Sr. System Engineer, Fiserv\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: Coming Soon"
