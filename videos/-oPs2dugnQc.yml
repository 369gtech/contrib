It has a number of innovative technologies and a long future roadmap, but in this talk Duncan will focus less on the 'what' and more on the question of 'how' and on transferable lessons:\n\n   * How the system has been and is being developed;\n   * How we balance rapid development with higher assurance development;\n   * Playing to Haskell's strengths;\n   * Opportunities for higher assurance with formal specifications;\n   * Bridging the gap between research and products;\n   * Building a larger Haskell development team and training;\n   * What has gone well, and what has gone badly, and lessons we can learn.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/duncan-coutts/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - DUNCAN COUTTS\nFounding Partner at Well-Typed LLP\n\nDuncan is a Haskell consultant, computer scientist and Haskell community member.
