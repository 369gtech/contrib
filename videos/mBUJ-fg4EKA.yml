description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nJez Humble - Author of \"Continuous Delivery\", Principal Consultant, ThoughtWorks\n\nABSTRACT\nDelighting customers by through the fast flow of features into production depends, like other capabilities, on repetition and habit.  In this talk, I present some observations on plant floor engineering and operations (the birthplace of Lean), and then derive the behaviors, rituals and processes that are essential to fast flow in software development. Some practices you’ll have heard of (e.g., continuous integration and delivery, TDD, etc.), and but some will be surprising and novel (e.g., the Improvement Kata). We’ll show how these practices are all interrelated, and how to institute them to create a culture of continuous learning leading to happy users, fast flow and fulfilled practitioners. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
