description: "An Introduction to Webassembly - Shashank Mohan Jain, SAP\n\nWebassembly (wasm) is taking the cloud world by storm. Started as a browser based technology, but off late we have started to see a lot of traction around using web assembly for cloud based applications. In this talk we intend to cover the basics of web assembly and why it is such an important technology for Cloud. We cover the ecosystem of wasm and how its being used not just for apps but also in various systems like API gateways like Envoy and Databases like Postgres SQL. We will cover the details of the bytecode of wasm as well as how it provides features like performance and security with fast startup. We also cover how wasm can be put to use for serverless workloads as well.\n\nTo learn more about Cloud Foundry, The Proven Developer Experience For Kubernetes click here: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
