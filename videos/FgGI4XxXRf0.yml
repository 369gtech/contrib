description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: New Relic - Kubernetes expert wanted! 12+ years of experience required \n\nI need HELP - my team is responsible for the Kubernetes environment, but I don’t know ANYTHING about it. I know, I’ll hire someone with experience!  Over the last few years (NOT 12!), Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto standard for orchestrating and managing containers. Virtually all the cloud vendors have thrown their support behind Kubernetes as an industry standard.  With the rise of Kubernetes, engineers and operators need better visibility to understand and explore the performance of their cloud-native applications and infrastructure.  Is Kubernetes part of your current or future software delivery practice? Are you responsible for your company's Kubernetes environment?  This session will show how to get observability into your Kubernetes environment with the help of New Relic. We’ll cover how to set up and use the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer as well as best practices. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff1D"
