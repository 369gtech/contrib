description: "Research by us has revealed direct CAN injection remote via APIs, which we intend to present the detail of live.\n\nViper Alarms uses a back-end from CalAmp, the manufacturer of LoJack. We'll show how the LoJack vehicle tracking & recovery device could be compromised and recovery of a stolen vehicle prevented.\n\nThis research lead us on to compromise of OEM-approved vehicle trackers and immobilisers. The rabbit hole went very deep indeed.\n\nThis is a story of systemic compromise through weak platform providers and outsourced security."
