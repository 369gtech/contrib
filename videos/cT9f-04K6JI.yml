description: "A: \"Dammit, we can't do this on the web :(\" \nB: \"You know, it's called the open web - you can change it!\" \nA: \"I can't just fork the web from GitHub and make it do the things I want.\" \nB: \"Haha, no, it's not that simple. But you can talk to some people and if they think your API makes sense, get a browser project from GitHub and they will help you to implement your new API.\" \nA: \"But then it's just in one browser, not the web?\" \nB: \"You got to start somewhere.\" \nA: \"Right... Can you help me get going?\" \nB: \"Sure!\"\n\nImplementing competitive printing support for PDF.JS is not possible with the current state of the web. Therefore, I started to work on some new `mozPrintCallback` API.\n\nIn this talk, I will share my experience with proposing a new API, how to implement it in a browser and how even hacking C++ code can be fun.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
