recordingDate: 1474446475
description: "Moving away from complex monolithic architectures has a range of well documented benefits but also dramatically changes how we have to think about security. How can we make the most of these new approaches without introducing risk to our applications and organizations?\nIn this session we take a look at securing microservice architectures and discuss tools, techniques and considerations to achieve this. Based around real world examples and demonstrating both attacks and defence techniques, we will learn how to be bad to our systems in the name of being good."
