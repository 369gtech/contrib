description: "A New Go-Based CLI for Managing UAA - Jennifer Hamon, Pivotal\n\nJoin UAA Anchor Jennifer Hamon to learn how you can get up-and-running with the new go-based CLI for UAA. Platform operators and application developers of all levels will leave this talk knowing how manage UAA resources including Users, Groups, Memberships, Identity Zones, and Identity Providers. We will also learn to create and test OAuth2 client configurations and discuss common troubleshooting scenarios. Long-suffering users of the old Ruby-based uaac will be excited to see how we've incorporated user feedback and design thinking into this new cross-platform tool.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/GATs/a-new-go-based-cli-for-managing-uaa-jennifer-hamon-pivotal"
