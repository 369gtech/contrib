description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 18 http://bit.ly/2P7SPII\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nINTERTWINGLING THE TIDDLYWIKI WITH ERLANG\nby Joe Armstrong & Jeremy Ruston\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nHypertext\nDocuverse \nXanadu\n\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nTed Nelson, who coined the term \"\"Hypertext\"\" also coined the lesser known word \"\"Intertwingled\"\" - this captures the idea that all there is is knowledge which is tangled up and linked together in a myriad of complex ways.\n\nComputer scientists think that we can organize knowledge in a systematic way but Nelson thought this was impossible. All there is is knowledge and links.\n\nA Tiddlywiki is a self-contained system that organizes data in a non-hierarchical manner allowing it to be read and authored in a non-linear manner.\n\nThis talk will go through the evolution of hypertext, following the evolution of ideas from Vannevar Bush to Ted Nelson and thence to the World Wide Web.\n\nOur goal is to extend the boundaries of the Tiddlywiki to a larger distributed system, that's where Erlang comes in.\n\nWe'll talk about the problems encountered in turning small consistent data collections of dense knowledge into larger distributed systems with sparse knowledge.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/jeremy-ruston/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JOE ARMSTRONG\nCo-creator of Erlang\n\nJoe Armstrong is a retired computer scientist. He got his grey hairs inventing Erlang, starting a few companies, writing a few books, doing some research and teaching people to program.\n\nMore on Joe Armstrong: https://codesync.global/speaker/joe-armstrong/\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JEREMY RUSTON\nCreator of TiddlyWiki\n\nJeremy Ruston cut his teeth writing books about the home computers of the early 1980s. He has worked at several startups, an investment bank, and enjoyed a stint as Head of Open Source Innovation at BT plc after his previous company was acquired by them. Jeremy is the creator of TiddlyWiki (\"a hypertext card index system from the future\") and has led the community for nearly 15 years. His passion is building tools that extend the capabilities of individuals and groups.\n\nMore on Jeremy Ruston: http://codesync.global/speaker/jeremy-ruston/\n\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
