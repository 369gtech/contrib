Prioritizing technical debt is a hard problem as modern systems might have millions of lines of code and multiple development teams — no one has a holistic overview. In addition, there's always a trade-off between improving existing code versus adding new features so we need to use our time wisely.\nWhat if we could mine the collective intelligence of all contributing programmers and start making decisions based on information from how the organization actually works with the code?\nIn this presentation, you'll see how easily obtained version-control data lets you uncover the behavior and patterns of the development organization. This language-neutral approach lets you prioritize the parts of your system that benefit the most from improvements so that you can balance short- and long-term goals guided by data [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:36 Lehman's \"laws\" of software evolution\n03:50 Technical debt\n09:15 Case study: Prioritizing technical debt\n19:28 Why hotspots work\n23:41 The legacy code link\n26:07 Case study: How quickly can you turn your current codebase into legacy code?\n34:26 Resources\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/2020/sessions/1452/prioritizing-technical-debt-as-if-time-and-money-matters\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Legacy #DeveloperProductivity #Teams #TechnicalDebt\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
