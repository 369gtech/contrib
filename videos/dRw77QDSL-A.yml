language: English
recordingDate: 1474486552
description: 'With modern-day enterprises looking forward to moving to the cloud from traditional onsite alternatives to make their business more manageable and scalable with reduced costs, it becomes critical to ensure that customers get the same level of performance with cloud-deployed solutions that they do with their on-premises counterparts. Application Class Data Sharing comes in really handy here, where sharing of application-class metadata across multiple VM instances can significantly optimize memory footprint and shorten startup time. AppCDS can be applied to any class loaded from arbitrary locations by a custom class loader, and this category of classes contributes to more than 50 percent of the classes in a typical enterprise application. Learn more in this session.'
