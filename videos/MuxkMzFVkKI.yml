description: 'This talk will cover the basics of creating good Docker images for your Go projects using multi-stage builds. Once we have that image ready we will need to run it somewhere, I think that a Kubernetes cluster could be a nice place to start. Of course, we don’t want to repeat those steps by hand everytime we want to do a new deployment so we will probably need to learn how to use a CI/CD tool to automate all the steps. And finally, the icing on the cake would be make this automagically run everytime we push code to our repository.'
