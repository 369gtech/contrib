description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS Conference 2017, June 8 https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nSam Bellen, Front-end Software Engineer at Hasselt\n\nAs a guitar player, I usually use some effect-pedals to change the sound of my guitar. I started wondering: “What if, it would be possible to recreate these pedals using the web-audio-api?”"
