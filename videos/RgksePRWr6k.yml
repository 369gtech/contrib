description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nAutomating Load Balancing and Fault Tolerance via Predictive Analysis - Steven Rosenberg, Red Hat \n\nJust imagine, wouldn't it be great if Kubernetes load balancing could predict application traffic in advance and react appropriately? We’ll explain how to improve performance, reduce costs, and increase reliability in order to provide more intelligent workload balancing.     The solution is Predictive Analysis which allows us to “predict” the future from historical events. We will discuss how predictive analysis can improve overall system performance while reducing costs and improve the reliability of Kubernetes and Hybrid Cloud based environments.     Attendees will come away with a better understanding of cutting edge technology for solving complex problems that are fast becoming the next generation of technological advances.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zenp"
