language: English
recordingDate: 1617145431
description: 'UNIX shell is an incredible tool that allows you to transform data from format to another. You can use it to extract information from logs or incoming streams or can help you take raw data, which is generally un-usable and transform it into a format or language that is usable, using UNIX shell. In this stream, Dr. G will show you how to use UNIX shell. She''ll walk through how to do basic file inspection with commands, to create, append and display files, write simple regex, search files, and create search and filters to help understand your data. This is part of our Learn with Dr. G mini series "What you didn''t Learn in School", where we explore all the tips and tricks for professional development that they don''t always teach you!
