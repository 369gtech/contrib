description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nThe ink on C++17 has merely dried, but the major compilers support most features already. It's high time for a reality check! \n\nThis talk is a report about the ongoing effort of porting sqlpp11 to C++17. I'll show real-world usage of the following features: \n\nCore: \ninline variables\nauto non-type template parameters\n[[nodiscard]]\nclass template deduction\nconstexpr if\nfold expressions\n\nLibrary: \nstring_view\noptional\n\nThis talk also comes with a realization about C++11.\n— \nRoland Bock: PPRO Financial Ltd, Principal Software Engineer\n\nFrom my days at the university, I hold a PHD in physics (although that was in the previous century and seems like a different life by now). Ever since then I have been developing software and/or managing engineering teams. In 2008, I started to learn C++ because I could not believe that it was as difficult as some people claimed. Turns out they were totally wrong and totally right at the same time.\n\nToday, I am still learning and I hope to continue to do so for a very long time!\n\nI am the author of the libraries sqlpp11 and kiss-templates.\n\nApart from C++ itself, I'd be particularly interested in talking about strategies for hiring C++ engineers.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
