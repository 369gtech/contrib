title: 'Cameron Manavian: Welcome to the Machine - Learning in a Browser With JS | July 2020'
language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1597960054
description: 'In this talk, Cameron Manavian will focus on the core concepts of ML and how it relates to AI, with as little mathematics as possible. We will cover Tensorflow.js, predictions, and a simple but widely employed machine learning method called a regression. All examples work in a browser and are directed towards intermediate JS engineers.'
