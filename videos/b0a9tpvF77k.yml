description: "Switching to serverless while actively developing applications can be an adventure - we committed fully and started changing our engines mid-flight. As an emerging technology, you find there are many new patterns and practices being discovered, but there are enormous benefits if you can fight through the learning process.\n\nThis talk covers: - Transitioning from Python and Elastic Beanstalk to Node and Lambda. - The key questions we had when starting, and our first failed attempts. - The evolution of our thinking and design towards a better serverless model. - What one app looked like before-and-after a serverless transformation and a live demo. - The remaining challenges for development teams and the community.\n\nWebsite: https://boston.serverlessdays.io"
