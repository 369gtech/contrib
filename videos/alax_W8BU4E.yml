title: 'Deploying apps for on-premises and hybrid ML+AI on SQL Server 2019 big data clusters - BRK3097'
recordingDate: 1557349360
description: 'The SQL Server 2019 big data cluster platform provides a scalable and enterprise ready technology that can handle data of any sort. Next to the native support for R, Python, Spark, SQL and HDFS, it also provides a way to deploy applications and machine learning models on the cluster. In this session, we will explore various scenarios for doing Machine Learning on big data clusters, including hybrid, and leveraging AI with containerized Cognitive Services.'
