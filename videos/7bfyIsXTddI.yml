title: 'Developing microservices applications on the Kubernetes platform - Shahid Iqbal'
recordingDate: 1542615825
description: "Developing microservices based applications is a hot trend in our industry.\nSometimes this decision is based not on trying solving the specific problems that microservices solve but unfortunately a desire to use the latest techniques or, even worse, a desire to adopt trendy new platforms such as Kubernetes and service meshes.\nIn essence the cart is placed before and horse and application architecture is dictated by platform decisions.\nHowever, let's assume that our audience on the other hand have clearly identified how microservices will benefit them.\nThis talk introduces a \"journey\" to microservices and highlights some new problems that are created by adopting such an architecture.\n\nWe then step through how we can leverage cloud native technologies such as Kubernetes and the even trendier topic of service meshes such as Istio to try and address some of these new problems.\n\nThis talk along with demos will cover many topics in an area which is rapidly evolving however we'll try and focus on the fundamental problems, and demonstrate tools that can help make the experience better or simply easier to manage. \n\nSome knowledge of microservices, containers and Kubernetes is useful but not essential we'll cover the basic topics\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
