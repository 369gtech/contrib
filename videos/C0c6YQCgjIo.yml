description: "Birds of a Feather: How to Train Your KubeAdmins - Stephany Spencer, USA TODAY NETWORK \n\nContainers and Kubernetes management is a new skillset. You can't go out and hire as many experts as you'd like, so how do you train your own? This BOF will describe how USA TODAY NETWORK brings new hires up to speed in this brave new world.  This is a chance to discuss what has worked well, not so well and what we can all do better going forward. Bring your on-boarding stories to share and discuss how we can build more Kubernetes \"experts\". \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrTf"
