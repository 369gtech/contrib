title: 'Code for Game Developers - Loop Unrolling'
recordingDate: 1422561600
description: "Unrolling loops reduces the amount of work an algorithm has to do. Often compilers can do this optimization themselves, but often they can't. Asymptotic running time aren't everything, it's important to also examine the constants of your running time.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/optimization-loopunroll\n\nNew video every Thursday.
