language: English
recordingDate: 1382019457
description: "Bob Ippolito was the CTO and cofounder of Mochi Media, and creator of Mochi Web. Bob started using Erlang in 2006 to prototype an ad server, and it quickly became the de facto platform for building servers at Mochi. Bob's open source contributions to the Erlang community include mochiweb, statebox, egeoip and kvc.\n\n\nIn this talk Bob will discuss different techniques and data structures for weighted random choice in Erlang. Random choice is an essential part of many systems, especially distributed systems, such as ad servers. The concepts in this this talk will be demonstrated with a \"learning\" IRC bot that builds a Markov chain and uses it to make sentences.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Erlang-User-Group-Krakow/events/142964072/\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Erlang-User-Group-Krakow/\nhttp://soerlang.tumblr.com/"
