He explains how to sync data between a phone and a laptop without sending it via a remote server. He also explores algorithms that allow several people to collaborate on a shared document, communicating via a peer-to-peer network.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon London 2018: https://bit.ly/2hxsoN1 \n\nThe next QCon is in San Francisco, Nov 5-7, 2018.
