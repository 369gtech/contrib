description: "Presented by Bill Pierce at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday May 29th 2015\nIn 2014, Intel launched the Edison, a tiny single board computer targeting the Internet of Things (IoT) and wearables markets. The Edison supports a full-featured Linux distro, providing a natural platform for rapid prototyping of IoT projects including Node.js and wifi connectivity out of the box. In this talk, Iâ€™ll present our experience using the Edison on the Chain Check project, applying machine learning and digital signal processing techniques to predictive maintenance for bicycles.\n\n* twitter.com/piercewilliam"
