description: "I'm going to go over the steps you can take to write your first research paper! Research papers have long been something only academics did, but the Internet has offered us several ways to democratize this process. Journals like Arxiv are open for public submissions, machine learning papers are generally open source so anyone can learn from them, and online communities offer advice in the way previously only a professor could. I'll go through these tips in order in as much detail as I can on how to write a research paper. \n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going. \n\nWant more education?
