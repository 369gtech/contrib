description: 'The Wall Street Journal already mentioned it in 2011: “Software is eating the world.” Nowadays, every company is an IT company. Product owners and other business representatives seeing their competitors release new features to end users every day are demanding the same from their own software teams. How do you measure up to this heavy pressure as an IT organization? How do you quickly make changes to software systems in fast-paced environments without losing your grip on quality? How do you build and test software in such a way that it''s always in a releasable state? This session explains the principles of continuous delivery and DevOps. You’ll leave with enough insights into how and where to get started yourself.'
