title: 'Solving large scale inverse problems in Python with PyLops - M. Ravasi, I. Vasconcelos and D. Vargas'
language: English
recordingDate: 1610654173
description: "Part 3\n\nInverse problems are at the core of many scientific disciplines. When working with large data and/or model vectors, an explicit matrix representation of the problem becomes unfeasible. In this tutorial we present PyLops, an open-source Python library that uses linear operators to solve matrix-free inverse problems. Examples of image deblurring and CT reconstruction will be presented as use cases.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
