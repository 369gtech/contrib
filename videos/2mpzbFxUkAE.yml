description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nEmbedded mobile data persistence has always been a complicated topic. For long, SQLite has been the only viable embedded database.\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce a new alternative for Kotlin on all platforms: an embedded NoSQL database with common Kotlin API available for multiple Kotlin targets such as Android through Kotlin/JVM and iOS through Kotlin/Native.\n\nFirst, we will demo its data and ORM API, showing how can Kotlin data objects can be seamlessly stored and retrieved. Next, we will go into more details about how indexes are being stored, how to use them, how to handle data schema update and the best practices to handle different scenarii. Finally, we will explore its strength and weaknesses and discuss its best use cases.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nI am the developer and maintainer of the Kodein multiplatform framework as well as the founder of the Kodein Koders company. Deeply rooted in the Open-Source philosophy, I am dedicated to making tools and libraries to make programming easier, safer, and more exciting. I also love boardgaming and flying small planes (which I have a license for)."
