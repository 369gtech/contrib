RecyclerView is still in the development and improvement cycle and Android developers continuously receive updates for it. Besides improvements made by the Google team, there are some techniques which can be applied to RecyclerView to make it more efficient. Some of these approaches were introduced by Google engineers, some were discovered by enthusiastic developers. I have gathered all these best practices together, added my own ones and some experiments on top of them."
