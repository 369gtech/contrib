title: '20,000 Leagues Inside the Optical Fiber - Ariya Hidayat Keynote'
recordingDate: 1433258570
description: "From Velocity Santa Clara 2015: What actually happens as we post a 100-character tweet, orchestrate new datacenters, chat with our remote colleagues, and let the operating system update itself? Numerous interactions are triggered in each of the seven OSI communication layers, but one thing that is not often discussed is the very important physical layer. The complicated network of undersea fiber optic cables, with its record-breaking transmission capacity (light can easily send the contents of a stack of Blu-ray discs in a few milliseconds), is the foundation of modern communications. This talk gives a historical journey through this remarkable achievement, a series of scientific milestones in recent human history. It covers topics including how to trap photons inside a hair-thin strand of glass, modulate them to carry useful information in 40 different wavelengths, force the photons to travel thousands of miles, and finally stitch back the bits and pieces for full reassembly. The talk will be entertaining and useful, yet the material will be technical enough to tickle the geeky side of the audience and inspire further exploration.\n\nAbout Ariya Hidayat (Shape Security):\nAriya Hidayat is an engineer/technical lead/FOSS fan/blogger/speaker. He is the author of Esprima and PhantomJS. These days, his activities are mostly in software craftsmanship around HTML5, JavaScript, and other web technologies.\n\nWatch more from the 2015 Velocity Conference: https://goo.gl/jS3T6Z\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
