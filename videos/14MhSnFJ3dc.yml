description: "Brian Leroux, Adobe software developer on the Apache Cordova team, engages the San Francisco HTML5 User Group in a conversation on the web beyond HTML5.\n\nIn this highly entertaining and lively presentation, Brian discusses the current status of HTML5 before moving into Device API's, possibilities, and challenges. Topics discussed range from Installable Web Apps, Carrier APIs, WebRTC, the highly ironic Battery API, PhoneGap, and Boot2Gecko.\n\nInspired by the Courage Wolf mantra, \"Bite off more than you can chew, then chew it,\" Brian comments:\n\n\"For the web to be a first class platform, there's a long way for us to go. The web versus native debate is silly. It's not whether or not we can do something, it's just whether or not we want to get to it.\"\n\n** For more free videos and resources on HTML5, head to http://marakana.com/s"
