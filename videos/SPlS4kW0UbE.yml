description: "Having readable code is a prerequisite to scaling your product and the organization behind it. Hard-to-read code not only intimidates your co-workers (and your future self) but also conceals bugs and hurts your teamâ€™s velocity, since every modification takes twice as long as it should. This talk shares the principles of writing clear, idiomatic JavaScript code, illustrated with real-world examples.\n\nEVENT:\n\nUtahJS 2016\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDmitry Pashkevich\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nDmitry and UtahJS Organizers provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WF4AjM-XW8&t=8s"
