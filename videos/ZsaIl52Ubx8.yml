description: "by Ben Poor\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/media_radio.webm\n\n\nhttps://tech.ebu.ch/news/2018/09/voice-controlled-hybrid-radio-demonstrated-at-2018-ibc \n\nThe EBU and NAB co-funded a project to create a demonstrator for a radio device able to be entirely controlled by voice. This demonstrates the concept of the 'Single Voice Service List', and uses openly-standardized metadata from the broadcaster (using RadioDNS lookup, ETSI 103 270,  and the Service and Programme Information data, ETSI TS 102 818) to automatically select between DAB+/IP/FM. The project was implemented by hacking the underlying Alexa Voice Service SDK. \n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:15:00+01"
