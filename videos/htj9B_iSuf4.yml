description: "The web is a dirty place. Traces of stacks litter the floor; memory leaking from cracks in the ceiling. Someone lost their context in the corner. Load times are slowly crawling along the window. Join me for a live debugging session as we find and squash different kinds of browser bugs. You leave armed to stomp out your own bugs and cleanup your JavaScript app.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
