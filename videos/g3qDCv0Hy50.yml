title: '#HITBGSEC 2018 COMMSEC: Learning How To Smurf With Honeypots - Emil Tan'
recordingDate: 1537131391
description: "Honeypot is not simply a piece of cybersecurity technology. I view it as a concept which value lies heavily on education rather than simply operations. I’ve been conducting research and development with students from polytechnics to experiment with honeypots to learn more about “the more interesting stuff” (i.e. the topics cited above) rather than honeypots itself. Many aspiring cybersecurity professionals chooses the path of red team by default because it’s something they can do on their own. You can’t beef up your blue team skill when you have no actual systems to defend.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll share my experience with honeypots, and how honeypots can make you a better blue team player (or smurf)! I’ll share the various research and development done on honeypots around the topics of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), Dev(Sec)Ops, Gane Theories, Attack Modelling, and more, and how they can improve your cybersecurity operations (SecOps).\n\n===\n\nEmil Tan has experienced in many cybersecurity trades – from research and development, to cybersecurity governance, risk management, consultancy and operations.\n\nEmil is also a significant contributor to the cybersecurity community. He founded and leads Edgis, a cybersecurity community group guided by the mission of promoting a vibrant cybersecurity community and safer cyberspace in Singapore. Emil also leads The Honeynet Project, Singapore Chapter – an international non-profit cybersecurity research organisation.\n\nEmil frequently speaks at various international cybersecurity conferences. He is also the organiser and co-founder of Infosec in the City, Singapore."
