description: "Online: wrestling web Copy/Paste to usability Defeating the API and implementation disasters in copy/paste\nby Michael Meeks\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UB4.136/online_wrestling_web_copypaste_to_usability.webm\n\nOvercoming the synchronous web copy/paste API's limitations in real\nbrowsers is extremely non-trivial. Come &amp; hear how we provide rich\ncopy/paste support across browsers, inside our app and hear a bit\nabout how this mess should be fixed.\nCollabora has been working to provide a good user-experience for Collabora\nOnline - bringing LibreOffice to the web, and a particularly\nchallenging aspect of this has been copy/paste. One of our challenges\nis that by design we keep our document data on the server, which is at\nthe end of an asynchronous web-socket. Another challenge is the\nimpossibly baroque and arguably mis-designed set of clipboard APIs\nthat we have to work with.\n\n\nHear a story of how we defeated the issues, as well as the somewhat\nsad UX compromises we were forced to make for the hard cases.\n\nRoom: UB4.136\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 15:00:00"
