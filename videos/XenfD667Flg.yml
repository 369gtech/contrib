title: 'DEF CON 29 ICS Village - Panel -  Protecting Critical Infrastructure from Ransomware'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632164398
description: "Moderator: Jamil Jaffer; Panelists: Ernie Bio; David Etue; Jennifer DeTrani\n\nThe recent attacks against Colonial Pipeline, JBS, and others have made it clear just how vulnerable U.S. Critical Infrastructure is to ransomware. While these attacks have been grabbing headlines, the path forward has not. A variety of tools and approaches will need to be tested by both the government and private sector to push back against the threat of ransomware and protect critical infrastructure from future attacks.\n\nThis panel brings together a variety of perspectives from the government, technology, and venture capital sectors to chart the path forward and detail what steps government and the private sector can take individually and together to protect critical infrastructure across the country."
