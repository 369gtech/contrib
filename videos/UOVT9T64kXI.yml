description: "Flying is exciting and useful, but it is also quite complicated. Especially for the machine which does not have years of experience in understaning what it sees, like we humans do. On the other hand, machines can be more focused on the task. When they sense something through their equipment, they can react much faster than we humans do.\n\nIn our project we try to make the machine understand its environment as it flies, and use that understanding to fly on its own, smoothly and safely in unfriendly environments. During this talk you will participate in all the stages of this exciting adventure from the first lines of code, through algorithmic struggles up to complete system ready to explore the world.\n\n Krzysztof Kudrynski\n8AM-4PM: Passionate problem solver and team leader with 10+ years experience in algorithms prototyping and software design. Focused strongly on business value and good team spirit. Currently involved in projects related to self-driving cars in TomTom. 4PM-0AM: Loving husband and father of three 0AM-3AM: Enthusiast of technologies of the future including artificial intelligence, robotics and virtual reality. 3AM-8AM: Sleepwalker\n\nBlazej Kubiak \nI ma enthusiast of all aspects of big data processing and all technologies that bring this enthusiasm from dream into reality â€“ like CUDA. For over ten years I have been involved in many challenging projects related to image and laser data processing. I am one of the authors of automated traffic signs detection and recognition systems and bird-eye image mosaic creation process"
