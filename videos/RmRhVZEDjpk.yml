description: "Machine Learning + Natural Language Processing + Source Code = code2vec\n \nFrancesc Campoy (@francesc), VP Developer Relations at source{d} joins us to talk about ML-assisted code review (Lookout) and the Public Git Archive. You’ll learn how and why source{d} makes uses a dataset based on many GitHub repos available as public datasets to train its models and how “assisted code reviews” apply ML, image processing, and NLP concepts – like word2vec – to code. \n \nFrancesc shares his favorite MLonCode moments, why it’s made him a better developer, what’s coming next, and where you can get started.  \n\n00:30 What’s Machine Learning on Code (#MLonCode)?\n\n01:27 How source{d} builds its datasets\n\n02:10 “How ML on Code’s made me a better programmer…”\n\n04:11 What’s “assisted code review”?\n\n04:57 Francesc’s favorite resources\n\nLearn more:\nhttps://opensource.microsoft.com \n\nCreate a free Azure account:\nhttps://aka.ms/OpenSourceShow/13\n\nLearn more about source{d}: \n• Blog: https://blog.sourced.tech/\n• Lookout: https://sourced.tech/lookout/\n• GitHub: https://github.com/src-d\n• NewStack.io: https://thenewstack.io/sourced-applies-machine-learning-help-companies-manage-code-base/ \n\nGet started with #MLonCode: \nhttps://github.com/src-d/awesome-machine-learning-on-source-code?\n\nLearn more about word2vec: https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-word-embeddings-part-2-word-vectors-nlp-modeling-from-bow-to-bert-4ebd4711d0ec"
