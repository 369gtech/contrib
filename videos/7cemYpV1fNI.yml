description: "Only 2 years after its inception, Spring Boot is already very popular amongst Spring developers, but also newcomers to the JVM. Boot is offering a new, comprehensive way of developing web applications. This session will cover the basics but also more advanced and new features of the project for the web tier.\n\nFirst we’ll go over the basics of a REST service powered by Boot. We’ll then gradually add more features that are typical to modern web applications. Along the way, we’ll see how Boot is helping us with front-end resources, security, error customization, template engines, embedded container configuration and devops features.\n\nJoin this session to learn how Boot helps you writing modern web applications."
