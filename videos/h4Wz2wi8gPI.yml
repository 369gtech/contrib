description: "Join us as we talk with Neta Haiby about new capabilities for Form Recognizer. Documents contain invaluable information powering core business processes. Extracting information from these documents with minimum manual intervention helps bolster organizational efficiency and productivity. As more and more processes and workflows get automated, the need for new features to help extract text and structures increases. \n\nThen we will check in on some new developments with PyTorch in Visual Studio Code with Jeffrey Mew. Visual Studio Code, a free cross-platform lightweight code editor, is one of the most popular among Python developers for both web and machine learning projects. We will be walking you through an end to end PyTorch project to showcase what VS Code has a lot to offer to PyTorch developers to boost their productivity. Stay tuned after as we get back to work on building our Roshambo game!\n\nJoin us on Learn TV https://aka.ms/LearnTV for closed captioning.\n\nLearn more about what’s new in Form Recognizer: \nWhat’s New in Form Recognizer - https://aka.ms/AIShow/FormRecognizer/WhatsNew\nTech community - blog https://aka.ms/AIShow/FormRecognizerBlog \nDocumentation - https://aka.ms/AIShow/FormRecognizerDoc \nGet started - https://aka.ms/AIShow/FormRecognizer/GetStarted \n\nLearn more about PyTorch VS Code:\nTutorial - https://aka.ms/AIShow/VSCodeDocs \nBlog - https://aka.ms/AIShow/PythonVSCodeRelease \n\nCreate a free account (Azure) - https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show - https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe \nFollow Seth https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nJoin us every other Friday for an AI Show livestream on Learn TV https://aka.ms/LearnTV​ and YouTube https://aka.ms/AIShowLive"
