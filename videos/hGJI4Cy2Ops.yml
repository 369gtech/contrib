description: "Code for America is a new type of public service for geeks to leverage their engineering skills to bring open source practices to communities across America. We'll talk about the growing geek corps and the challenges of leveraging each other's work in building our digital communities.\n\nDan Melton\n\nCode for America\n\nDr Melton is the CTO for Code for America, a national nonprofit bringing technologists (i.e 'geeks') into government for year-long fellowships. He is a public-minded, generation-net coder passionate about cities, urban affairs and civic action. Dan's past projects include Urbata, an urban data mapping tool for mid-sized cities; and the Kansas City DrillDown, a multi-layered urban data mashup of utility, credit and city records that recounts the population and challenges the US Census. A Ruby enthusiast, Dan has contributed to multiple open source gov't projects. Hailing from the midwest, he received his bachelor's degree in Economics and Political Science, his masters in Public Administration and doctorate in Public Affairs and Economics from the Henry Bloch School of Business and Public Administration at the University of Missouri-Kansas City."
