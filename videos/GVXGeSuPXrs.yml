recordingDate: 1523570402
description: 'Leaders can and should exist at all levels in an organization. When you fail to lead, you’re at risk for burning out no matter where you are in an organization - even if you only oversee yourself. Daniel Garcia-Mont and Michael Samuelson from Arizona State University will share observations gleaned from being thrust into leadership via two very different routes and from years of working with Drupal in the United State''s “#1 university for innovation.” They''ll also clear up the haze that clouds the issues that arise when people talk "leadership and management." $spoiler = (($managers !== ''bad leaders'') && ($leaders !== ''good managers''));'
