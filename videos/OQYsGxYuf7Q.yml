language: English
recordingDate: 1605021059
description: 'You want to try Helm v3, but perhaps you already have Helm v2 and need to migrate. We’ll look at a migration from Helm v2 to v3 using the helm-2to3 plugin. We’ll cover migration of config and data (chart starters, repositories, and plugins), in-place migration of releases, and cleanup.'
