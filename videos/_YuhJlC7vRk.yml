He’s best known for co-founding the controversial The Pirate Bay, the worlds largest filesharing system, but has also started numerous projects establishing an alternative narrative. Of the more known projects are Flattr, an alternative payment system that for a while was the only system allowing donations to WikiLeaks, and the VPN service IPredator, which is one of the most trusted VPN systems in the world. He’s now creating art under the label Konsthack.\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://www.instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
