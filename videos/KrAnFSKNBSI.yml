description: "Congratulations, you are expecting! Well, expecting to use Elixir that is. I’m sure you are flooded with questions including, “what is Elixir?” Don’t worry, I have you covered.\n\nStarting from Day 1 all the way to “Oh my, it’s OTP” we’ll cover all you need to know to get ready for your new app. This new stage of development will begin with your new syntax and tools. Then on to common frameworks, and finally an intro to Open Telecom Platform (OTP). It can be scary at times and you may get nervous but never fear. You’ll get through this and it’s all part of learning something new."
