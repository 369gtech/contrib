The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nThe Future of Serverless Java - Chad Arimura, OracleSDCC \n\n12 million developers across 80% of the enterprise, run Java. It is the number one language in the world, yet when it comes to serverless, you wonâ€™t find Java anywhere near the top of the rankings. Why is this?\n\nIn this session, I will review some of the recent enhancements made over the last year to the language, platform, and ecosystem, as well as offer a glimpse into some of the features in development that will impact how Java-based serverless applications should be built. I will include code samples and multiple tips on how Java developers can get serverless today!\n\nThe audience should come away with confidence that their skills in Java can be applied to the next generation of serverless workloads."
