title: '"A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To Reimplementing AlphaGo" by Xuanyi Chew'

description: "In 2016, AlphaGo defeated the reigning Go world champion, Lee Sedol. As humanity sighs in resignation of its place to its robot betters, much work is done to understand why AlphaGo won. I was more upset that AlphaGo wasn't implemented in Go (the language), and so early this year, having a bit of spare time, some friends and I set out to reimplement AlphaZero, the successor to AlphaGo in Go (the language) to play and win at Go (the board game). Along the way, I learned a few new things about AI, deep neural networks and a few new tricks.\n\nIn this talk, I will explain briefly the AlphaZero algorithm in simple, understandable English. Due to working under constrained scenarios, we developed some novel techniques that were used to accelerate the training of our reimplementation of AlphaZero. This talk will recount some of them which may be useful to both programmers in general and AI developers.\n\nAlong the way, I will explore the implications of our experiments and what it means for the goal of building an artificial general intelligence. If an AI can self-modify its own code, what does it mean for us puny humans? Do we have any future on this planet?\n\nSpeaker: Xuanyi Chew"
