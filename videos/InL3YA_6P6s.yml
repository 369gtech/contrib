description: "Whenever a new Mac malware specimen is uncovered, it provides a unique insight into the offensive Mac capabilities of hackers or nation-state adversaries. Better yet, such discoveries provide fully-functional capabilities that may be weaponized for our own surreptitious purposes! I mean, life is short, why write your own?\n\nWe'll begin this talk by discussing the methodology of subverting existing malware for \"personal use\", highlighting both the challenges and benefits of such an approach.\n\nNext, we'll walk-thru the weaponization of various Mac malware specimens, including an interactive backdoor, a file-exfiltration implant, ransomware, and yes, even adware. Customizations include various runtime binary modifications that will coerce such malware to accept tasking from our own C&C servers, and/or automatically perform actions on our behalf. \n\nOf course, in their pristine state, such samples are currently detected by AV products. As such we'll also walk-thru subtle modifications that will ensure our modified tools remains undetected by traditional detection approaches.\n\nIn conclusion, we'll highlight novel heuristic methods that can generically detect such threats to ensure Mac users remain protected even from such weaponized threats.\n\nPatrick Wardle\nPatrick Wardle is the Chief Research Officer at Digita Security and founder of Objective-See.
