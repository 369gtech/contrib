description: 'Like the Winter in some famous TV show, CDI 2.0 has been Coming for nearly 2 years. But now CDI 2.0 is Here (like the same Winter) and all the new stuff it brings will deeply change your Java EE, MicroProfile and Java SE experience. In this session I will review the major features introduced in CDI 2.0 and I''ll demonstrate how it can be used in various environment like Java EE 7 application server, MicroProfile platform or even Java SE. If you still think that CDI is a simple Dependency Injection solution bound to Java EE or think that there''s only one platform to bootstrap advanced service on Java SE, come and see that the CDI "Winter" can compete with "Spring".'
