description: "Serverless computing is quite the rage today. It enables companies to move to a platform with basically limitless capacity and it allows teams to embrace DevOps right from the start.\n\nSo, this is literally the silver bullet we have waited for and everybody should embrace it. Right?\n\nWell, it depends...\n\nIn this talk we will look at different scenarios and approaches to building and designing complex Serverless applications on AWS beyond your basic \"Hello World\".\n\nWe will cover architectures and patterns that help in adopting Serverless, for example how to design your Serverless landscape without getting lost in event-driven-chaos.\n\nCovering the whole development process, we will look at real world problems like testing, debugging, monitoring and securing your Serverless applications. Furthermore, we will use some of the essential tools that make working with AWS Lambda easier, such using Claudia.JS.\n\nFinally, we will discuss the drawbacks and misconceptions, like potential vendor lock-in and the illusion of NoOps.\n\nIf you find Serverless computing interesting, then this talk will show you how to adapt this architectural style without getting burned too much.\n\nDavid Schmitz is a consulting architect, programmer, coach and have been building applications for various rather large financial institutes and insurance companies for more than 15 years. Since greenfield projects are rare and precious, I have been using various tech stacks ranging from WS-* with EJBs to HapiJS on Node.\n\nCurrently I am focusing on cloud architectures, serverless computing, conversational user interfaces and any good reason to use Elixir."
