title: 'The Hidden Secrets of Move Semantics - Nicolai Josuttis - CppCon 2020'

description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\n\nMove semantics, introduced with C++11, has become a hallmark of modern C++ programming. However, it also complicates the language in many ways. Even after several years of support, experienced programmers struggle with all the details of move semantics. And style guides still recommend different consequences for programming even of trivial classes. And in the C++ community we still discuss semantic details.\n\nWhile I took the time to write up all the facts and details in my new book \"C++ Move Semantics - The Complete Guide (cppmove.com), I learned a lot I wasn't aware of. Note that the final book will have 200 pages.\n\nThis talk is about the most surpising facts, even experts sometimes don't know.\n\nSome hidden secrets so that you understand C++ a bit better.\n\n---\nNicolai Josuttis (http://www.josuttis.com) is well known in the programming community because he not only speaks and writes with authority (being the (co-)author of the world-wide best sellers The C++ Standard Library (www.cppstdlib.com), C++ Templates (www.tmplbook.com), C++17 - The Complete Guide (www.cppstd17.com), C++ Move Semantics - The Complete Guide (www.cppmove.com), and SOA in Practice), but is also an innovative presenter, having talked at various conferences and events.\n\nHe has been an active member of the C++ standards committee for more than 20 years.\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
