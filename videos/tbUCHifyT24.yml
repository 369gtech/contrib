We'll see how to build the most naive form of type erasure using heap allocation and virtual functions; then iteratively optimize that design to improve its performance. At the extreme, we'll see how C++2a std::function_ref achieves trivial copyability.\n\nAttendees will leave this session confident in their ability to implement type-erased classes, such as std::function, from scratch.\n— \nArthur O'Dwyer\nNew York\n\nArthur O'Dwyer is the author of \"Colossal Cave: The Board Game,\" \"Mastering the C++17 STL\" (the book), and \"The STL From Scratch\" (the training course). He runs professional C++ training courses, is occasionally active on the C++ Standards Committee, and has a blog mostly about C++.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
