description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Berlin 2016\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAnstract:\nScala has historically been a JVM-centric programming language. The situation has started to change with appearance of the Scala.js that opened a door of front-end development to Scala programmers. This talk will expand the horizons of Scala even more. Weâ€™re going to announce a new ahead-of-time compiler and lightweight managed runtime designed specifically for Scala."
