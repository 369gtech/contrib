description: "In this episode of 'Coffee with a Googler', we meet with Scott Jenson and talk about the Physical Web -- an approach to unleash the core superpower of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away.\n\nWatch the complete Coffee with a Googler series at: http://goo.gl/kWMbKq\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
