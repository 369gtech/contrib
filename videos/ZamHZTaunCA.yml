description: "DOES19 Las Vegas â€” This talk will discuss various advances in program analysis technology that enable a larger class of bugs to be detected earlier in development (and even to be automatically fixed in some cases). The talk will focus in particular on recent developments that enable tight integration of program analysis tools into DevOps processes. These new techniques have been pioneered by academia and operationalized at scale (billions of lines of code / thousands of commits per day) by large tech companies such as Google and Facebook. The talk will conclude with best practices for organizations interesting in incorporating modern program analysis into their development workflow.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
