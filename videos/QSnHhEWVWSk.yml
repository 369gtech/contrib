description: 'The idea of constantly-updated community maps are now the norm and the modifications are constant. The base data of the map you are looking at could have been updated in the past couple of days in time those updates will be instantaneous. The data layered on maps has also changed. No longer is it expected that data will be siloed or have restricted access. In addition to being realtime data is increasingly open and available for all to use. This is especially true when a community has been called on to create a dataset for an application. The combination of almost-realtime maps and open data have enabled mobile applications.'
