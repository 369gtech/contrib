description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nEvaluating Business Risk for Open Source Cloud Native Projects - Dawn Foster, VMware\n\nMost business decisions boil down to an assessment of risk and making tradeoffs. We should all be thinking about risks relative to how we’re using cloud native open source projects within our business. If we build our business on top of an open source technology, we want it to be as low of a risk as possible. This talk will: * Compare the risk between projects under neutral foundations vs. those owned by individual companies. * Provide details about how governance impacts risk relative to leadership selection, decision-making processes, and communication. * Evaluate business risk in terms of contributors and organizations to determine the level of risk associated with individuals or organizations leaving the project. * Look at how security and release processes can impact risk. The audience will walk away with practical advice about how to assess risk and evaluate projects for your organization while also learning about ways to decrease risk in your own projects."
