description: "Operationalising Data Science on Cloud Foundry - Ian Huston, Pivotal\n\nThe first part of the talk argues why Cloud Foundry is ideal for operationalising and scaling machine learning models. \n\nThe core of the talk describes a scalable cloud native architecture for operationalising data science models based on microservices. There will be a live demo of this architecture in action. \n\nThe last part of the talk explains the limits of Cloud Foundry in the context of data science and what still has to be achieved for Cloud Foundry to become an end-to-end data science platform.\n\nAbout Ian Huston\nIan Huston is a Senior Data Scientist at Pivotal Labs. Before joining Pivotal, Ian used Python to create and destroy baby universes inside numerical simulations of the inflationary phase of cosmology."
