description: "The era of brogramming is dead, and nothing of value was lost. In its place we’re entering an era where developers must learn to accept ethical and moral responsibility for the software we create, where we have a loud and powerful voice in dictating how we treat user privacy, and where everyone is encouraged to join our community regardless of their background.\n\nFor this to happen we need everyone on board and working towards the same goal. You – yes, *you* – need to be committed to working hard to build this future, because it’s not enough to sit on the sidelines and hope for the best.\n\nIn this talk we’ll look at some of the huge problems facing our industry, as well as some of the many ways people are trying to solve them. More importantly, you’ll get a variety of ideas for ways you can help shape our future for the better, because if things are going to get better we need to start with you."
