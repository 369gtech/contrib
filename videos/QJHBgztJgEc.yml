The technology that supports Big Data and analytics is Hadoop. \n                                                 \nApache Hadoop is an open source software project. Hadoop is written in the Java programming language and is the highest-level Apache project being constructed and used by a global community of contributors. \n\nThe underlying technology was invented by Google in the earlier days so it can be used to index the rich textural and structural information and thereby present meaningful and actionable results.  There were no preexisting tools that allowed them to do this. Hadoop was born out of such necessity and was developed by Google. Initially it was not called Hadoop, instead was a platform incorporated in to Nutch. Hadoop was later spun off from that. Yahoo has played a key role developing Hadoop for enterprise applications.\n\nTo know more about the course -\nhttp://www.edureka.co/big-data-and-hadoop\nPlease write back to us at hadoopsales@edureka.co or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information."
