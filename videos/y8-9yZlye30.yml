description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM America  2021 - codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sf-2021/\n\n100 Years of Erlang | Quinn Wilton - Technical Team Lead at Synopsys\n\nABSTRACT\nWhile Erlang first became commercially available in 1990, the language boasts a rich history leading up to that point, and many of the ideas we consider to be unique to the ecosystem instead trace their lineage back to far older technologies.\nUsing that history as a guide, this talk attempts to recontextualize our present understanding of the language, so that we're able to look toward some of the futures that may lie ahead.\n\n• Slides:\n  https://slides.com/rc-6/100-years-of-erlang-slimmed\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\n  LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/27159258\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
