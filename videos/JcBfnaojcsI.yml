description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nJiaqi Liu - Leader in Bridging the Gap between Data Science and Engineering\n\nABSTRACT\nData-intensive applications, with many layers of transformations and movement from different data sources, can often be challenging to maintain even after they are initially built and validated. To truly expand and develop a code base, developers must be able to test confidently during the development process and monitor the production system. Monitoring and testing data pipelines or real-time streaming processes can be very different from monitoring web services.\nJiaqi draws on her experience building and maintaining both batch and real-time stream data pipelines to discuss how to leverage monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to define and visualize metrics, how and when to alert on common health indicators, and how to gain visibility in monitoring not just the system health but the health of the data. General concepts she touches on include observability of pipeline health, interpretability of data results and building features into data pipelines that makes monitoring and testing just a little [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:56 Data Pipelines\n03:20 What could go wrong?\n05:16 Data pipeline concerns\n06:14 Interpretability\n07:42 Observability\n08:44 Pipeline features\n09:17 Immutable data\n10:52 Data lineage\n13:08 Dry run mode\n15:21 Testing, monitoring & alerting\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1321/observability-for-data-pipelines-monitoring-alerting-and-tracing-lineage\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Prometheus #Grafana #Data #Programming #Backend #DevOps #Streams #Frontend\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
