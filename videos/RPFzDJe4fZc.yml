title: 'Leveraging Standard Buildpacks to Migrate Not-So-Standard Apps'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327231
description: "Heritage apps come in all shapes and sizes. The wheel of technology rolls on and many of us find ourselves responsible for valuable software built with technologies that make us uncertain how to leverage modern cloud platforms.\n \n We’ve been helping customers tackle their not-so-standard apps for years, and buildpacks have become an indispensable tool in our toolbelt. The big question is: what do you do when you don’t have a buildpack that fits your app? We’ve found there’s almost always a standard buildpack that applies with a little work. In this talk, we’ll run through a few apps from our history, talk through our process of experimentation, and figure out how to get them running on Cloud Foundry together.\n \n This talk is for the app practitioners responsible for moving to the cloud but aren’t sure their app will fit. You’ll be surprised by the ways you can leverage just a little refactoring and the magic of buildpacks to help you get to the cloud in a standard way without a rewrite.\n\nBrandon Blincoe, App Modernization Strategist at VMware\n Matthew Campbell, Solutions Architect at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/leveraging-standard-buildpacks-to-migrate-notsostandard-apps"
