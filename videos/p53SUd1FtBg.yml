description: "Working as an external change consultant is great fun, a profitable business (most of the time) and a source of great learning opportunities (aka failures). In this talk I want to discuss the dilemmas I faced as a consultant and also share some of the concepts that supported my work with our clients. Let’s talk as one change agent with the other about some critical topics, like:\n\nThe best diagnostic tool we have as change agents is ourselves. How to “use” it then, while still staying in our role?\nIt sounds nice and true that in change processes the personal-team-organizational-larger system levels strongly interact and influence each other. How to remain focused without losing the complexity? (or vice versa)\nChanging together as an organization or team requires trust, connectedness and empathy and also clear boundaries, decisions and actions. How to apply both without compromising any of them?\nMy intention is to leave you with a few new and hopefully inspiring questions to think and talk about.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nStretch Leadership and Management Conference\nstretchcon.com"
