description: ".NET Core's CoreFX repo is a large repo with unique challenges to handle bugs, contributions, triage issues, etc. The repo size is a challenge to monitor due to high traffic.\n\nThe talk will explore some of the key challenges our team encountered and how we handle them.\n\nWe will cover:\n• Distributed monitoring model (per-area responsibility),\n• Data-driven decisions for porting APIs from .NET Framework,\n• Responding to new API proposals,\n• Why sometimes you say NO to perf improvements,\nHow being open-source is shifting our engineering culture and interaction with customers,\n• Similar models in other repos - ASP.NET Core, Mono, etc.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
