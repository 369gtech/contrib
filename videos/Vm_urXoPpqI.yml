title: 'Ivar Grimstad -- From Spring Framework to Java EE 7'
recordingDate: 1394181108
description: "Bio:\n\nIvar Grimstad is an experienced software architect with a strong focus on Enterprise Java.\n\nHe has been working with Java since the beginning and has over the years tried out everything from lightweight mobile applications to large scale enterprise applications. His experience covers all aspects of designing architectures based on a variety of technologies including standard Java EE as well as more lightweight frameworks such as Spring and a variety of open source products.\n\nIvar is always focusing on quality and on using the right tools and technologies for the right task to optimize the software development process.\n\nIn addition to being active in the local Java Community, Ivar has been speaking at several international conferences.\n\n\n\nPresentation:\nFrom Spring Framework to Java EE 7\nLanguage: EN\n\nBuilding Enterprise Applications using Spring Framework has been more or less the industry standard for several years. The introduction of Java EE 6 made it easier to develop enterprise applications based on standards without the need to rely on proprietary frameworks. With Java EE 7 this becomes even more evident. This session will highlight the advantages of using a standards-based approach and step-by-step migrate an existing application based on Spring Framework to a full-fledged Java EE 7 application."
