description: "The Tools that Shape Us\n\nhttp://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2014/andrea-magnorsky\n\nMaking great games is all about fast iteration. Giving the designers and content creators the ability to quickly test an idea and then grow that idea organically is critical to finding the fun. That means that we as developers need to make tools that make their workflows as painless and transparent as possible.\n\nOver the last year, we have been using F# in our game and this talk is a short reflection on how that has turned out. \n\nWe'll talk about: the language, the ecosystem, the tooling and the community with live examples from the game and the tool chain"
