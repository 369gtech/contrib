description: "Over the years as cloud-native architectures have matured, customer adoption has given us the opportunity to assess customer needs and understand the networking, security and policy use cases that customer expect from a platform such as Cloud Foundry. At CF we have decided to invest into integrating Istio Pilot and Envoy with Cloud Foundry to meet these customer needs, ranging from traffic management features such as weighted routing to encryption of all data in flight to Layer 7 policy enforcement. There are a diverse set of customer problems across the platform ranging from Security, Policy, North-South and East-West traffic that we could address through this integration. Let's talk about these use cases, and how we think integrating with Istio Pilot and Envoy would help address them.\n\nSpeakers:\nShannon Coen\nProduct Manager, Cloud Foundry, Pivotal\nUsha Ramachandran\nStaff Product Manager, Pivotal\nSree Tummidi\nProduct Manager, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
