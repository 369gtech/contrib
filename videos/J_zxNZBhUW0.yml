title: 'From cloud to the intelligent edge: Drive real-time decisions with Azure Stream - BRK3058'
recordingDate: 1557277957
description: 'Scenarios that require real-time insights to drive key decisions continue to grow rapidly. Many instances require running some of these analytics close to the data at the edge, and large-scale analytics in the cloud. This session will demonstrate how customers can create these streaming pipelines in minutes by leveraging IoT Hub and Event Hubs (including Kafka client) for massive scale data ingestion; Stream Analytics for real-time analytics; Azure SQL for stream augmentation and data archiving; Power BI for dashboarding & Azure Databricks for downstream batch processing. Â Downer group of Australia will showcase how they address scenarios such as remote monitoring and predictive maintenance with Azure Stream Analytics.'
