description: "I've been writing Haskell at Arbor Networks for about a year now, and while there are certainly a ton of benefits on the technical side, and a lot of interesting concepts, some of the most profound (and least discussed) impacts of Haskell occur on the personal and team levels.\n\nThis is a talk about what I've learned about the human side of Haskell over the passed year. It touches on\n\n   1. How it makes it easier to think through problems and express yourself.\n    2. How it facilitates clear communication within teams.\n   3.  How it allows for more agile decision making.\n   4.  How it makes good practices the easy and natural thing to do\n    5. Some of the challenges and negative impacts it has.\n\nIt may be of interest to anyone curious about what Haskell is like as a full-time, production language at a commercial company, or to people who are interested in a viewpoint beyond or other than a technical one.\n\nJosh is a software engineer at Arbor Networks, where he Defends The Internet(!). Or more accurately,  works to process the mountains of data that come off our mitigation and monitoring platforms, and try to turn it into something that's intelligible by humans.\n\nHe mostly work in Haskell, which is awesome.\n\nFor more on YOW!
