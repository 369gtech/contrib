description: 'Most of us have come across Conway''s Law - the observation that "organisations that design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of those organisations". From standalone web applications to open-source projects to large-scale enterprise applications, a project''s success (or failure) comes down to the team that''s trying to deliver it - so why do so many projects try to impose the right architecture on the wrong team structure?'
