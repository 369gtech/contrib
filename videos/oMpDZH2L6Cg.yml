description: "DOES18 Las Vegas - You want to increase organizational agility and flow across your large, traditional enterprise. Perhaps you are considering or others have decided to impose a scaling framework. Frameworks can be good, in their context. Equally they can and are being mis-applied in contexts where they may not be the optimal way of working. Organizations are complex adaptive systems, there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. This talk, which is based on lessons learnt from leading agility at scale across a 320+ year old organization with 80,000 people in 40 countries, shares an approach to enterprise transformation which appeals to intrinsic motivation, is invitation over imposition, has a clear focus on outcomes and is context and framework agnostic. You will leave with an approach which you can try as soon as you get back to the office.\n\nWant to Mandate One Set of Prescriptive Practices? Don't. Give people a VOICE.\n\nJonathan Smart, Former Head of Working Ways, Formerly of Barclays\n\nJon has 25 years experience of taking and leading an agile approach to change, starting out as a developer on the trading floor of an investment bank. Jon has, until very recently, been leading on Ways of Working across Barclays (328 years old, 80,000 people in 40 countries). Jon is a member of the Programming Committee for the DevOps Enterprise Summit and is a board member of the SD Learning Consortium.\n\nDOES18 Las Vegas\nDOES 2018 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
