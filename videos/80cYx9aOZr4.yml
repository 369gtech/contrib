description: "Hans Dockter will talk about the new Gradle-based Build System for the Android SDK. This new build system has been developed as a Gradle plugin by the Google Android team. It is full of innovation, many of them demonstrating the unique underlying capabilities of Gradle. We will also introduce Gradle as such with a special focus on the new features that have been developed as part of the Android effort. For example more generic, platform independent dependency management and the concept of library variants for different runtimes. We will show how these new features are extremely useful for other platforms like Javascript, Scala, Java and C++.\n\nThis talk is interesting for both people interested in Android and people interested in Gradle who don't have a background in Android."
