title: 'Vault ''19 - Optimizing Storage Performance for 4â€“5 Million IOPs'
language: English
recordingDate: 1554841125
description: "James Smart, Broadcom\n\nNew workloads and Storage Class Memory (SCM) are demanding a new level of IOPs, bandwidth, and driver optimizations in Linux for storage networks. James Smart will discuss how the lpfc driver was recently reworked to achieve a new level of driver performance reaching 5+ Million IOPs. James will discuss hardware parallelization, per-core WQs, interrupt handling, and shared resource management that will benefit both SCSI and NVMe over Fabrics performance. James will show performance curves, discuss Linux OS issues encountered, and work yet to do in Linux to improve performance even more.\n\nView the full Vault '19 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/vault19/program"
