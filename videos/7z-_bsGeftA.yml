description: "Not too long ago, I took up an Indiegogo project that included all of the parts to make an open source, self-replicating 3D printer. It has been a techie's dream, with immense portions of both challenges and rewards.\n\nEven more recently, I received my first Raspberry Pi, a $35 board that will almost fit in an Altoids case, but runs several Linux distros like a champ. Even though the first thing I did was see if it would run PostgreSQL (of course it did), my latest dream is to use the RP to drive the Python-based 3D printer software, and incorporate it all into a single unit capable of surfing for 3D objects to print, downloading them, converting them, and pushing them to the eMaker Huxley.\n\nEdward Snajder\n\nJive Software\n\nCurrently the database administrator at Jive Software, I have been having fun with DB Engines, SQL, ETL and BI for a little over ten years. Today I find myself amongst PostgreSQL and MySQL databases predominantly, though I am certified in SQL 2005, and do a fair amount of Oracle support. Some day I hope to understand and dislike all database engines equally."
