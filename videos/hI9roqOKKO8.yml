title: 'Sara Soueidan: Styling and Animating Scalable Vector Graphics with CSS [CSSConfUS2014]'
recordingDate: 1405550884
description: "Slides: http://bit.ly/1nATMi4\nScalable Vector Graphics, or SVGs, are the new \"big thing\" in web design today, and for a good reason. With the proliferation of retina screens and high resolution displays, we need to adopt techniques that allow us to serve graphics that look good on all screens in all circumstances, and because SVGs offer resolution-independent, fully scalable and crystal clear graphics, it is safe to say that they are the future graphics format of the web.\n\nIn this talk we're going to see how SVGs can be styled in CSS, and how they can be animated using CSS animations and transitions. We're also going to cover \"responsifying\" SVGs using CSS media queries, and how we can control the size and looks of SVGs allowing them to adapt to different screen sizes. We'll cover a short workflow from a vector graphics editor to a responsive animated graphic on screen."
