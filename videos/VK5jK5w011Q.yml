title: 'Which Integration Framework to Use: Apache Camel, Spring Integration, or Mule?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784669
description: "Applications have to be integrated, but they use different technologies, protocols, and data formats. Nevertheless, the integration of these applications needs to be modeled in a standardized way, realized efficiently, and supported by automatic tests. Three open source integration frameworks available on the Java platform—Apache Camel, Spring Integration, and Mule—fulfill these requirements. They implement well-known enterprise integration patterns and therefore offer a standardized, domain-specific language for integrating applications. This session compares the alternatives and presents live demos. It also recommends when to use a more powerful enterprise service bus instead of one of these frameworks.\n\n\nAuthor:\nKai Wähner\nKai Wähner works as Principal Consultant at Talend.
