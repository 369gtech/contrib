description: "Learn about LoRaWAN and The Things Network (https://aka.ms/iotshow/thethingsnetwork) from Johan Stokking, co-founder of The Things Network. Did you know a LoRa device can run for a few years on a single AAA battery? This makes LoRaWAN ideal for IoT scenarios. Johan also discusses the Things Network and its community-driven effort to build a global LoRaWAN network now at 8500 gateways. Also, The Things Network now simplifies provisioning of LoRa devices  with QR codes. Finally, watch a demo of how to connect the LoRa infrastructure and a LoRa device to Azure in order to detect the freefall of the object.\n\n#iot #lorawan #thethingsnetwork"
