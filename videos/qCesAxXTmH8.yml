description: "Intro + Deep Dive: Cloud-Provider SIG - Chris Hoge, OpenStack Foundation, Andrew Sy Kim, VMware, & Jago Macleod, Google \n\nThis SIG-Cloud-Provider session will begin with an introduction to the SIG activities in representing the collective interests of all participating cloud providers in the Kubernetes ecosystem. The session will then move on to the status of current efforts to remove the in-tree cloud provider code from the Kubernetes code base and replacing this code with the Cloud Controller Manager interface and external provider code. Time permitting, we will also cover collaborations with other SIGs such as Docs, Testing, and Cluster Lifecycle. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPkm"
