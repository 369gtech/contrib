description: "We're thrilled to announce IoT Plug and Play, which is based on an open modeling language that allows IoT devices to declare their capabilities.  That declaration, that we call a Device Capability Model, is then presented when IoT devices connect to cloud solutions like Azure IoT Central and Partner Solutions which can then automatically understand the device and start interacting with itâ€“ all without writing any code.\n \nLearn more about the Digital Twin Definition Language: http://aka.ms/DTDL\nFind IoT Plug and Play devices in the Certified for Azure device catalog: https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/\nTry Azure IoT for free today: https://aka.ms/aft-iot"
