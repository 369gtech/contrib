Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nKeynote: (Open)Telemetry Makes Observability Simple - Sarah Novotny, Open Source Wonk, Azure OCTO, Microsoft & Liz Fong-Jones, Principal Developer Advocate, Honeycomb.io \n\nObservability is a fundamental requirement for sustainably developing and operating cloud native applications. It must be accessible to a diversity of users and support a robust ecosystem of tooling around these common needs.  Liz and Sarah explain how OpenTracing and OpenCensus merging benefits the entire cloud native ecosystem. With OpenTelemetry, users and vendors alike can focus on distilling insights out of their data rather than duplicating instrumentation work. Sarah and Liz will show the progress so far, integrations with peer CNCF projects, and how you can participate! \n\nhttps://sched.co/UdJS"
