description: "When working with machine learning, you typically create a model which can predict outcomes. You create this model by training it, showing it existing data. The first step then to training a model is to setup some training data, and then some testing data to ensure the model is behaving in an expected fashion. Fortunately, this is where scikit-learn comes into play. We'll chat through the basics of the library, and about testing and training data.\n\nWatch the Python for Beginner series here: https://aka.ms/PythonBeginnerSeries\nFor the Full 'Intro to Python' course on Microsoft Learn: https://aka.ms/MSLearnPython\nAll video content will available at: https://github.com/microsoft/c9-python-getting-started/\nFirst series: https://github.com/microsoft/c9-python-getting-started/tree/master/python-for-beginners\nSecond series: https://github.com/microsoft/c9-python-getting-started/tree/master/more-python-for-beginners\nThird series: https://github.com/microsoft/c9-python-getting-started/tree/master/even-more-python-for-beginners-data-tools \n\n#microsoftdeveloper #evenmorepythonforbeginners #learntocode"
