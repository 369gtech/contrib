description: 'The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) in our daily life creates immense opportunities and benefits for our society. However, IoT security has not kept up with the same rapid pace of innovation and development. This situation creates substantial security flaws and putting our privacy at risk. This talk will present the new challenges we are facing with the new revolution of IoT, including concrete demonstrations. In addition, we will present possible solutions how to deal with those challenges. Finally, we will do some fun coding by a POC on one of these solutions.'
