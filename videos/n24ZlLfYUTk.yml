description: "RubyHACK 2018:  You Belong In A Room Full of Wizards by Isaac Sloan\n\nWe're all faking it, but in the meantime we accomplish great things. That's what programmers do! If you’re getting started don’t let the fear that everyone around you knows so much more keep you from trying. If you’ve programmed and want to do it professionally then you are a programmer. Everyone is this room probably knows something you don’t and that’s fine because you know things they don’t. There's more to know than you could ever understand, in that way you're the same as the best programmer to ever live."
