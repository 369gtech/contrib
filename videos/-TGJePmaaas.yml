description: "Time Theft: How Hidden and Unplanned Work Commit the Perfect Crime\n\nDominica DeGrandis, Director, Training & Coaching, LeanKit\n\nInvisible work competes with known work. Invisible work blindsides people, leaving teams unaware of mutually critical information, until it’s too late.\n\nMarried to this problem, is the question, how does one plan for, or allocate capacity for the invisible? It’s tough to analyze something you can’t see. Incognito work doesn’t show up in metrics. Hidden work stalls and blocks important priorities and masks dependencies. Risk accumulates from work delivered late and started late.\n\nThe solution is to put conditions in place that allow unplanned work to be seen and measured -- particularly high risk work involving far-reaching decisions. This talk shows you how to do just that.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
