description: "Suyash Joshi, Sr. Product Manager & Developer Advocate, Oracle\n\nIn this session, you will learn about the basic building blocks of machine learning, particularly building ML models in JavaScript and training and deploying them in a browser for fast execution. The concepts are explained with examples of computer vision and sentiment analysis with TensorFlow.js, TensorFlowâ€™s new open source machine learning framework (JET) for JavaScript developers. The code sample will be made available on GitHub for download experimentation."
