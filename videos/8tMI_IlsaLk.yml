description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/personal-healthcare-iot-on-pcf-using-spring-64854626\n\nDid Mom take her morning meds? Did she take the right meds?\n\nImagine a world where you receive notifications when your mother misses her morning medications and where her doctor automatically receives her Glucometer or Pulse Oximeter readings. This talk will be an introductory discussion about taking an Internet Of Things (IoT) approach to keeping our loved ones safe, in their own homes longer, and elongate their presence in our lives. We will be discussing the challenges around applying IoT technologies to personal healthcare and how we can use Pivotal Technologies to build a more efficient solution.\n\nThe discussion will start by reviewing the challenges with personal healthcare including the privacy and security concerns and considerations. We will also delve into how Arther C Clarke's third law can be used to describe IoT technologies. With this context, we will explore building a personal healthcare IoT solution on PCF using Spring Technologies.\n\nSpeaker: Jim Shingler, Cardinal Health"
