title: 'How Do ML Models Use Their Features to Make Predictions (or SHAP Values for ML Explainability)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1582483739
description: "SHAP opens up the ML black box by providing feature attributions for every prediction of every model. Being a relatively new method (arxiv.org/abs/[masked]) , SHAP is gaining popularity extremely quickly thanks to its user-friendly API and theoretical guarantees.\n\nIn this talk I will guide your intuition through the exciting theory SHAP is based on, and demonstrate how SHAP values can be aggregated to understand model behavior. Throughout the talk I will present real-life examples for using SHAP in the fraud detection domain at PayPal, and in the medical domain as provided by the SHAP authorsâ€™.\n\n\nEVENT:\nPyData Tel Aviv 2020\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nAdi Watzman\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish PyData talks.\n\n\nCREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yXtdkIL3Xk"
