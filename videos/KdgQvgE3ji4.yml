description: "** Data Scientist Masters Program: https://www.edureka.co/masters-program/data-scientist-certification **\nThis edureka video on Data Science will introduce you to the concepts of Data Science and how it is used to solve real-world problems. You will learn how Data Science works with an example on UBER. Data is everywhere, and its growing at an exponential rate. So, Data science is the process of using the data to find solutions / to predict outcomes of a problem statement. Below are the topics covered in this video:\n\n0:57 What is Data Science?\n1:11 How Data Science works? : Data Science at UBER\n2:06 Data Science Process\n    a. Business Requirements\n    b. Data Collection\n    c. Data Cleaning\n    d. Data Exploration and Analysis\n    e. Data Modelling\n    f. Data Validation\n    g. Deployment and Optimization\n4:17 Data Science Applications\n6:05 Who is a Data Scientist?\n6:18 Data Scientist Job Trends\n6:51 Data Scientist Skills\n\nSubscribe to our channel to get video updates.
