description: "Attacks on payment infrastructures are incredibly popular and many hackers are chasing easy money. On the other hand, payment security does not stand still – EMV, mobile wallets, bitcoin, digital banks without branches, business accounts opened in 1 day. We live in an era of digital technology that protects us from hackers. But does it? Each technology has been examined under the microscope and received its own attack, executed not only on the academic paper but also in the real world by real fraudsters. Over the past 2 years, our team has been successfully debunking the security myths about NFC, EMV, POS terminals, and ATMs. We will show how easy it is to steal money from a bank card, the money that the customer sometimes doesn’t even have in the account. Why isn’t the payment industry trying to take care of its customers’ security more than required by risk management and is waiting for problems to occur, without worrying about attacks that “haven’t arrived yet”?\n\n===\n\nTim Yunusov is an expert in the area of payment security and application security. He has authored multiple research in these areas including “For the Love of Money: Finding and Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Mobile Point of Sales Systems” (BlackHat USA 2018), “Apple Pay replay attacks” (Black Hat USA 2017). Tim is a regular presenter at Black Hat, DEF CON, POC, PacSec, CanSecWest, Hack In The Box, Nullcon, NoSuchCon, Hack In Paris, ZeroNights, Positive Hack Days (PHDays) and other industry conferences."
