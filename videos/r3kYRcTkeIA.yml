title: 'Gov 2.0 Online Conf: Understanding Islam through Virtual Worlds'
recordingDate: 1262661142
description: 'The idea for this project was hatched with a very specific idea in mind: How could people learn about other cultures in an authentic, experiential spaceâ€”specifically, how could we learn about cultures that self-identified as Muslim? In turn, how could this information supplement or augment the physical world work of foreign policy and especially public diplomacy practitioners? In this session, Rita King shows how she uses Second Life to better understand the Islam culture.'
