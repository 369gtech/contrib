description: "f(by) 2020\nOpening Keynote\n\nScala 2 to Scala 3 Transition: Community and Communication Management Perspective - Darja Jovanovic @darjutak\n\nThe Dotty team at EPFL, led by Prof. Martin Odersky, has been developing a new version of Scala for ~ 7 years now and in 2018 it was finally announced that Dotty will become Scala 3.\nTime has come to figure out a transition strategy. Who are the stakeholders, what are the main worries, who will provide the plan, and who is expected to execute it?\nIn this talk you will learn what is the Scala Center and what role it has in the Scala 2 to 3 transition.\nWe will touch upon the Scala Improvement Process, community involvement, and the importance of transparent communication to achieve the smooth transition. We are creating a road by walking on it thus this talk will be focused on how we navigated the processes so far, what we learned & how we plan to move forward.\nThis is a none-technical talk, although for the context we will include some projects we are working on.\n\nGeneral Partner - Evolution Gaming https://eng.evolutiongaming.com/"
