description: "Jake Dohm - Building Blazing Fast Sites with Gridsome\n\nDeveloper at @simplygoodwork | Organizer of @trianglejs\n\nVue.js is an amazing library for building user interfaces, but it (purposefully) lacks some of the bells and whistles of a full framework. That’s where Gridsome comes in! Gridsome is a framework built on top of Vue, that provides you features like pre-rendering, a centralized GraphQL data store, and a plethora of performance and developer experience improvements out of the box. In this talk, we’ll walk through the features of Gridsome and the reasons you should or shouldn’t consider reaching for it on your next project.\n\nVuejs Amsterdam 20th, 21st Feb 2020\n2494 Attendees over 2 Days\nFlying in from 50+ Countries\n16 Talks from JS Leaders\n20+ Sponsors\n\nLargest Vue Conference and Community Event in the World\n\nSign up and be first to get notified about Vuejs Amsterdam 2021 \nhttps://confirmsubscription.com/h/t/DD88027477DDD5A4\n\nFollow us on Social\nLinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/27123036\nTwitter https://twitter.com/vuejsamsterdam?s=20\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/vuejsamsterdam/\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/vuejsamsterdam/\n\nPowered by Passionate People\n\nWant to join their quest to be the lead Vue Consultancy on the planet? ;)\n\nhttps://passionatepeople.io/careers\n\nFollow on Social \nLinkedIn  https://www.linkedin.com/company/passionatepeoplefrontend\nTwitter https://twitter.com/passionpeopleNL?s=20\n\n#frontendlove #frontenddeveloperlove #vuejsamsterdam #vueamsterdam"
