description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeaker: Nivesh Gopathi, Gap Tech\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/secure-dynamic-app-config-at-gaptech\n\nAs organizations move to audit trails over managed processes, continuous delivery with aggressive MTTR, security first doctrines and ephemeral instances, a key enabler is a platform ability for dynamic application configuration and securely bootstrapping application secrets. In this session, we will go over what the use cases for dynamic configuration and application secrets management are with some high level requirements, how we are collaboratively solving for these at enterprise scale using Spring Cloud Config, Vault and Consul and whatâ€™s coming next."
