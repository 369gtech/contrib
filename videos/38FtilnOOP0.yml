description: "the current and future state of Ethereum  layer 1 scaling, layer 2 scaling, proof of stake and Serenity (Ethereum 2.0)\nby Aidan Hyman\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/the_current_and_future_state_of_ethereum.webm\n\n\nIf accepted, I will begin discussing the current state of infrastructural development in the Ethereum ecosystem. Starting with why we need scaling solutions, then discussing how layer 1 and layer 2 solutions work. I will then discuss the basics behind Casper Proof of Stake and how Serenity (Ethereum 2.0) fits into all of this. Our team is currently implementing a JS beacon chain which is part of the Serenity ecosystem and working on implementing layer 2 solutions, specifically custodial state channels. When Ethereum was created, the move to Proof of Stake was an inevitability. Layer 2 scaling solutions like state channels have always been a focus of collaborative research. In trying to explain everything Ethereum, I will begin by talking about the basics of blockchain consensus from the first Proof of Work (Nakamoto consensus) blockchain and what the different bottlenecks are with it. To the new blockchains implementing Delegated Proof of Stake, Bonded Proof Stake, and others. The focus will be to identify these bottlenecks and discuss the current research and development being done to solve these problems that have stopped Ethereum and most public blockchains from scaling to the masses. By the end of the talk, it is my intention that you will leave with an understanding of where Ethereum is currently, where Ethereum started, and where Ethereum is going. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 14:40:00+01"
