title: 'Akka Typed Channels: Implementing Type Calculations as Macros'
recordingDate: 1362765217
description: "The actor model has been established as an important tool for dealing with concurrency, parallelism and distribution, but it has one feature which seems at odds with Scala's statically typed setting: the fundamental communication mechanism is dynamically typed.\n\nIn this talk from the 2013 Northeast Scala Symposium, Dr. Roland Kuhn presents typed channels implemented as an Akka extension. The main focus will be on how types, macros and runtime compilation have been applied to sort actor messages into type-safe channels.\n\n** Let's face it, you need some more Scala in your life.
