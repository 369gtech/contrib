recordingDate: 1518793118
description: "Deep learning is the area that wins over the field of Artificial Intelligence. By using libraries like TensorFlow, it is now available to the wider audience.\n\nIn this tutorial, Barbara will walk the audience through the process of creating several types of neural networks. The session will start with explaining key concepts of deep learning and introducing datasets the computation will be performed on. Along the way, attendees will have the practical opportunity to use TensorFlow to build deep networks, train them and evaluate the results.\nAfter the session, participants will become familiar with how to use TensorFlow when shaping the architecture of neural networks. By the hands-on form of the tutorial, the audience will have the chance to gain some firsthand experience of how to apply deep learning to computer vision and natural language processing tasks."
