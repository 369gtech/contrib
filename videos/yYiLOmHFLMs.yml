description: "More: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/natural-language-queries-salesforce-scale\n\nNatural language is hard when your target is not a single organization, but the tremendous number of Salesforce customers, each with their own unique customization. \n\nIn this privacy-first world that Salesforce always operated in, it is even harder to do without having access to customer data to train machine learning models.\n\nIn this talk, we will describe how we implemented, deployed and nurtured Salesforce flavour of Natural language queries. Our approach is a battle-tested mix of deep-learning, solr search indexes, and basic engineering techniques. \n\nThis talk is presented by SalesForce."
