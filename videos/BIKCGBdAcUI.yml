Which practices and ideas can we adopt from these communities, in order to improve our own abilities as programmers? In particular, are there approaches to training and coaching, focused on deliberate practice, that we can develop to reduce the time and effort required to hone our technical skill, and develop our own unique personal styles?\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshIO\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
