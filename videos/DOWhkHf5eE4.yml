description: "by Ecaterina Moraru\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2213/ui_ux_trips_and_tricks_for_developers.webm\n\nI will present some general UI/UX tips &amp; tricks that will help you design better. Everyone should know the basic principles and patterns of design, and once you understand them you will naturally integrate them in your work. UI/UX is a craft. The more you practice it, the better you are at it. Some people argue that you need to have 'good taste' in order to be a designer, to be the 'artsy type'. While this might be true for Graphic Design, Branding and Visual Arts in general, when it comes to Interface, Interaction and Product Design, the focus is more on practicality and 'common sense'.\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 10:30:00"
