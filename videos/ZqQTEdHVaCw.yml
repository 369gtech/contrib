Rails' secret trick was convention over configuration or decreasing the decisions a developer has to initially make. Five years in, Kubernetes could benefit from a Rails moment. What could that moment look like, and what could it mean for developers who have to engage with Kubernetes? In this keynote, Bryan will explore what the landscape could look like with more developer-friendly tools and systems.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/UdQU"
