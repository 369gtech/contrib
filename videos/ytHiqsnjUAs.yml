description: "Anthony Dahanne, Software Developer, Software AG\n\nYou’re a Java developer? Already familiar with Docker? Want to know more about Kubernetes and its ecosystem for developers? During this session, you’ll get familiar with core Kubernetes concepts (pods, deployments, services, volumes, and so on) before seeing the most-popular and most-productive Kubernetes tools in action, with a special focus on Java development. By the end of the session, you’ll have a better understanding of how you can leverage Kubernetes to speed up your Java deployments on-premises or to any cloud."
