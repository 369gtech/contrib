description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAkri: Making IoT Devices Accessible to Your Edge Kubernetes Clusters - Kate Goldenring, Microsoft & Jiří Appl, Microsoft\n\nAs Kubernetes solutions move to the edge, nodes are taken out of the homogeneity of the cloud and put in environments surrounded by an array of IoT devices such as sensors and cameras. These devices are often too small to run Kubernetes, so how can they be dynamically leveraged by Kubernetes workloads? Akri is an extensible open-source Kubernetes-native project that aims to provide a solution. Akri provides an abstraction layer, removing the work of finding, utilizing, and monitoring the availability of IoT devices. We’ll dive into how Akri can discover IoT devices, advertise them as resources in your cluster, and then automatically deploy workloads to utilize those devices. Akri handles the dynamic appearance and disappearance of devices and automatically creates services, removing the need for an application to track the state of devices, pods, or nodes. Come learn about Akri and how it can be leveraged to build a more connected edge with Kubernetes!"
