description: "Working with date and time data doesn't need to be scary. Many developers know that time zones can be complicated, and go no further than that. You can do better! This talk will provide you with a framework to think about the different kinds of date/time data when you should record what information, and what challenges still lurk. I'll talk about the BCL types (System.DateTime and DateTimeOffset) as well as the Noda Time project I created to make life better for .NET developers. While many of the examples will be given in Noda Time, the same principles can be applied to the BCL types if you can't use Noda Time - it just won't be quite as simple. Confront your fear, and all will be well! (It won't be *easy* necessarily, but it'll at least be *feasible*.)\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
