description: "PyData Chicago Meetup \n\nIn 2015, Recursion Co. was founded in New York as a Fintech company integrating technology, finance, and big data. In 5 years, Recursion turned into an indispensable financial data provider for Wall Street firms and the government agencies.\n\nRecursion’s technology is built on Amazon Cloud, where a high performance column based database call “Redshift” is available at affordable cost. However, table design and maintenance routine are critical to tune the database to perform.\n\nUsing the big data technology, Recursion connects gigantic financial data collected from different sources and turned them into revealing stories and business intelligence in a timely manner.\nRecursion’s mission is to bring transparency to the financial market. We free the analysts by cut down thousands of hours of tedious data process work so they can focus on modeling and story telling. We made the analytics so easy and affordable that even small players can access. We call this “data democratization”.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
