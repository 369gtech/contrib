title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode - Erik Hunstad - Domain Fronting is Dead, Long Live Domain Fronting  Using TLS 1.3'
language: English
recordingDate: 1596654269
description: 'Domain fronting, the technique of circumventing internet censorship and monitoring by obfuscating the domain of an HTTPS connection was killed by major cloud providers in April of 2018. However, with the arrival of TLS 1.3, new technologies enable a new kind of domain fronting. This time, network monitoring and internet censorship tools are able to be fooled on multiple levels. This talk will give an overview of what domain fronting is, how it used to work, how TLS 1.3 enables a new form of domain fronting, and what it looks like to network monitoring. You can circumvent censorship and monitoring today without modifying your tools using an open source TCP and UDP pluggable transport tool that will be released alongside this talk.'
