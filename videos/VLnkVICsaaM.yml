description: "Bossa Nova - Beyond Agile - Preparing for Digitalization\n\nToday companies are expected to be flexible and both rapidly responsive and resilient to change, to both survive but also to thrive on disruptions. These challenges call for company-wide agility. Yet, doing Agile (the mechanics) is different from being Agile (the mindset). For example, substituting management meetings with daily Scrums or using a backlog for the board of directors doesn’t make a company agile.\nIn order to become truly agile (meaning flexible, responsive, adaptive, fast, and nimble), you need to think outside the (agile) box. Company-wide agility requires a holistic approach, a combination of different principles: First and foremost the principles of\nBeyond Budgeting (flexible budgeting & relative targets),\nOpen Space (leveraging the innovative power of all employees),\nSociocracy (flexible organizational structures and decentralized decision making), and –of course–\nAgile (inspecting & adapting).\nWe synthesized these proven principles into a wider perspective dubbed BOSSA nova: B = Beyond Budgeting, OS = Open Space, S = Sociocracy, A = Agile. Jutta will reveal a path toward company-wide Agility by showing the synthesis of BOSSA nova.\n\nJutta Eckstein works as an independent coach, consultant, and trainer. She holds a M.A. in Business Coaching & Change Management, a Dipl.Eng. in Product-Engineering, and a B.A. in Education. She has helped many teams and organizations worldwide to make an Agile transition. She has a unique experience in applying Agile processes within medium-sized to large distributed mission-critical projects. She has published her experience in her books Agile Software Development in the Large, Agile Software Development with Distributed Teams, Retrospectives for Organizational Change, and together with Johanna Rothman Diving for Hidden Treasures: Uncovering the Cost of Delay in your Project Portfolio.\n\nJutta has recently co-written (actually pair-written) with John Buck a book on Company-wide Agility. This book focuses on synthesizing Beyond Budgeting, Open Space, Sociocracy, and Agility.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
