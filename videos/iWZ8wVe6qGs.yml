description: "We will take a \"boring\" topic and make it extremely interesting and useful for Owners of Digital Marketing companies. \_They will walk away with a better understanding of the numbers behind how their business operates.\n\nWe will touch base on the financial and non-financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that all digital agencies should know and understand in order to effectivley manage their business. \_If used properly, the agency should be able to develop a dynamic forecast based on hard numbers that coincide with their strategic goals. \_And, if monitored regulary, the agency should by able to identify why they missed, hit, or exceeded those goals. \_Ultimately, the agency will be able to make \"Course Corrections\" well in advance of and shortfall in the future.\n\nThis talk is generally focused on the Co-Founder, CEO, COO, and/or CFO of a digital maketing agency."
