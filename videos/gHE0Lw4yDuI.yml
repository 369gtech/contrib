description: 'The Blender project - open source 3d creation - has taken off very well in professional areas in the past decade. One of the main success factors was establishing the Blender Institute in Amsterdam, with a studio where artists and developers work together on making compelling short animated films - while developing and testing a complete free and open software creation pipeline. Company founder and original Blender creator Ton Roosendaal will present a couple of development highlights and a vision of how to further grow Blender and open source development in the next decade.'
