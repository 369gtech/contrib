description: "Brett Pemberton, Slack\n\nRecently, a power outage in an AWS data centre, meant that our London region went offline without any of our connected users experiencing any downtime—something that would have been near impossible for us a year ago! In this session, I will share how we invested in automation to make horizontal scaling easy—too easy in fact, the perils of \"too much\" automation, how we collaborate with teams across time zones and how SRE can influence product architecture decisions for the better.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
