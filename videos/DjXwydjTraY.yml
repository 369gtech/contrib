title: 'Scalable Smart Caching for Spring Developers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538630523
description: "As enterprises move towards hierarchical microservices architecture, App Developers are tasked to develop performant and scalable microservices which necessitates the need for caching in microservices. And in today's world when App Developers are looking to rapidly prototype applications, there is a need for reducing all the boilerplate code - hence the popularity of Spring Ecosystem. In this session, we'll show how spring developers can quickly and easily develop their applications with common caching patterns like Lookaside Caching and write-behind Caching using Spring Data and Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC). Developers will also get insights on self servicing capabilities of PCC and ease of scaling the caching layer itself without any downtime required for microservices. This will be a live coding session, we'll showcase the spring data annotation support for getting started with PCC in minutes and how developers can mock the PCC behavior when testing on local development environment.\n\nSpeakers:\nPulkit Chandra\nProduct Manager, Pivotal\nNikhil Chandrappa\nPlatform Architect (Data), Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
