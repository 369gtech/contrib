Did it ever feel daunting to live update API masters or etcds? Can you automate such an operation?     We hope to share our musings at Lyft in solving the complexity of automating cluster upgrades and how that is incorporated into the design for - k8srotator - a Kubernetes custom controller.    As multiple components operating in cohesion make a cluster healthy, there are numerous points of failure that can occur during an upgrade cycle. Although there are varied ways of operating a Kubernetes cluster, the issues encountered during the process are common.    Attendees will walk away with knowledge about different cluster upgrade failures scenarios and ways to automate such operations without being in constant fear of losing the cluster state. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaYz"
