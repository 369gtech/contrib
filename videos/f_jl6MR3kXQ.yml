title: 'Raimo Niskanen - gen_statem - The Tool You Never Knew You Always Wanted - Code BEAM SF 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1521249644
description: "In Erlang/OTP 19.0 a new gen_* behaviour targeted at writing state machines was introduced - gen_statem. With its much richer feature set and a more general event model it was intended to replace the gen_fsm behaviour.\n\nThis talk goes through the gen_statem features, how they differ from gen_fsm and plain gen_server, and why they make gen_statem a better tool for writing any state machine except possibly the simplest."
