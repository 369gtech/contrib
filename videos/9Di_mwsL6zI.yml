description: "Alright, so maybe “bootiful” won’t ever work, but I tried, and it was worth it too because you’re reading this. Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring’s flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot aims to make address the common functional and non-functional requirements that gate quickly moving to production.\n\nJoin Spring developer advocate Josh Long for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it’s turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST, micro services, web, batch, big data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started."
