description: "Algorithms govern so much of our lives and dating is no exception! In this video, I frame dating as a data science pipeline and demo how to use AI algorithms to help facilitate discovery, first impressions, and even intimacy. I'll also explain how collaborative filtering and text generation are being used today to match people together with code examples. I hope this gives you a deeper insight into the role technology is currently playing in human relationships.
