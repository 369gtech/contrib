description: 'The idea of "THAT" started on a napkin during lunch just a few miles from where I still live today. That was 2010, but just one year ago I proclaimed "We''re just getting started". Fast forward and today, right this very instance, we need one another more than ever. People are the backbone of any community but our actions represent the things we can be proud of. I''m going to reflect on the past, address the present, and talk about my vision for a brighter future. Hint, hint, it started today and it''s all of us, THAT.US.'
