description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nHashes and caches, why another hash library ? \nProblems,shortcomings and advantages of current open source hash libraries. Includes split between open and closed addressing methods and how these can be combined to give a better solution without much trade off by exploiting the strengths of each. \n\nBenchmarks \nBenchmarks of the library with high and medium entropy data, mostly pictures. \n\nAnalogies \nA short description of the algorithms employed and why they work. This will include a short history of the library and why certain design decisions where made. Use of the birthday problem to model the low memory use evident from the benchmarks. \n\nPractical uses \nDemonstrate use cases of the library in treestore MySQL storage engine. Uses include concurrent version control algorithms and a mostly lock free allocation pool. This will include a short session with facebook link bench to illuminate possible advantages.\n— \nChristiaan Pretorius\nTechnical Lead, Retro Rabbit\nWriter maintainer of treestore MySQL storage Engine and Rabbit hash table library. https://github.com/tjizep/treestore \\rabbit\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
