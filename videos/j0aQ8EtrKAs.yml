description: "Note: This talk contains language that some viewers may find objectionable.\n\nIn Search of Security Shangri-la\n\nRich Smith, Duo Security\n\nSecurity has never been a hotter topic in the mainstream than it is now, from data breaches impacting entire populations, through state sponsored adversaries destabilizing geopolitical norms, to Mr. Robot - the global appetite for \"the cyber\" seems insatiable. In a world run by software where we can no longer ignore the importance of security and privacy, why are organisations still struggling to effectively include security into their wider technology processes? Ask developers and ops engineers and you will quickly hear how painful security teams are to work with as well as how security’s requirements and approaches are often slow to evolve to new ways technology is used to drive business value.\n\nAs someone who has worked in the security industry for almost 20 years, I agree with them.\n\nIn this talk I’ll share my journey from hacker to practitioner, how I denounced the Church of No, and some of the lessons I’ve learnt in the hopes they will help us all take a small step towards the devsecops utopia we have been promised for so long is just around the corner.\n\nThe search for security Shangri-La is ongoing but the more of us who are looking the better progress we’ll make.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
