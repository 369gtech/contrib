description: "Everybody agrees that concurrency and parallelism are two of the most important aspects of today’s and tomorrow’s programming. However, after years of object-oriented programming, we take for granted a style—including mutable data and locks and synchronizing access to them—that often proves to be inefficient and very error-prone. This presentation shows the principles of functional programming and how it can make the development of concurrent applications easier and more natural, facilitating the full exploitation of the potential of modern multicore CPUs.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMario Fusco\nMario joined the Java developers community during his studies at university, and has been a Java enthusiast since. He has a more than decennial experience as Java developer having been involved in (and often leading) many enterprise level successful projects in several industries ranging from media companies to the financial sector. Among his interests there are also the functional programming and languages, mostly Scala, and the development of Domain Specific Languages. By leveraging these 2 passions he also created the open source library lambdaj with the purposes of providing an internal Java DSL for manipulating collections and allowing a bit of functional programming in Java\nView more trainings by Mario Fusco at https://www.parleys.com/author/mario-fusco\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
