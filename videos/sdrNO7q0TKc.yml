recordingDate: 1486915969
description: 'TDD is well known approach to develop more clear and less buggy solutions, completely covered with tests as a bonus. But what about design? Some people think that TDD also helps design to emerge as implementation grows, so there will be just enough design in place when all cases are covered. Others think that without general design skills and experience output from TDD will be a garbage from design perspective. In this talk we will try to cover this topic in all details, focusing on TDD usage at different levels and with different styles.'
