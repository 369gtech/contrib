description: "http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/riccardo-terrell\n\nArtificial Neural Networks are a fascinating computational approach modeled to react similar to a biological brain to solve problems.  Neural networks are a very powerful tool that enable machines to teach and evolve themselves.  You can utilize this power in almost any application.  Don’t be intimidated by the equations and Greek symbols of this cutting-edge technology, I will guide you on how to slay this technology and make it bend to your will.\nIn this session, we are going to demystify the apparent Neural Networks complexity without the need of mathematical background providing an approachable overview. There will be very little math and lots of coding. The goal is for everyone to become acquainted with Neural Network from a pragmatic standpoint.\nJust when you think it couldn’t get any better, I will show you how to employ the functional paradigm to leverage multicore machines and GPUs to make your neural networks predictions infinitely faster through parallelism.\nBy the end of this talk, you will learn the basic concepts of Neural Network and how to apply functional concurrency to estimate future stock prices at blazing fast speeds…and perhaps get rich while practicing."
