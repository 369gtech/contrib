Everyone who works in software has heard of terms like ‘pwa’, ‘monoliths’, ‘headless’ , ‘microservices’ and even ’service oriented architectures’. We all know what they are, but how much do we really know about them? In this talk, we will show you the differences, the similarities, when to use them, when not to use them, the success stories and of course: the massive failures. Get ready for a half an hour of tech-comedy: architecture is going to be fast and fun!\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 🏆 🏆  Platinum Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\n🏆 🏆  Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nHarness → https://harness.io/\nBuddy → https://buddy.works/\nSonarSource → https://www.sonarsource.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nSentry → https://sentry.io\n\n🏆  Silver Sponsors\nMoogsoft → https://www.moogsoft.com/"
