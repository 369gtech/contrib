title: 'Google I/O 2013 - How to Build Multi-Platform Maps with Google''s APIs'
recordingDate: 1368895164
description: "Developers can learn more about the Google Maps API at http://goo.gl/58Hk5\nPresenters: Enoch Lau, Jack Kwok, Jez Fletcher \n\nThe Google Maps API is now on multiple platforms, JavaScript, Android, and iOS. Each platform has itâs own special strengths and limitations, and requires special attention. But what if youâre building for all three platforms? How do you approach that problem? This session will look at the specialized development for the individual platforms versus generalized development for all three, and the trade offs inherent in each different approach. We will look at when to use our web services, and how to build a strong back-end infrastructure.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
