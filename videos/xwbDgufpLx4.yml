description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/berlin2015/thomas-arts\n\nIn September we released the QuickCheck Mini 2.0, the second free, scaled down, version of QuickCheck. With QuickCheck Mini you can generate tests automatically. By specifying a data generator and a property of the software that should hold, QuickCheck generates test cases that verify whether your property indeed holds.\n\nThis talk introduces you to QuickCheck Mini and the cool things you can do with it from an Elixir user perspective.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Learn property-based testing\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Elixir programmers, but  Erlang programmers are very welcome\n\nAbout Thomas\n\nThomas Arts co-founder and CTO of Quviq has worked at Ericsson's computer Science Lab in the nineties. Together with Joe Armstrong, Simon Marlow and Phil Wadler, he tried to build a type system for Erlang. That being of little practical use, he later worked on verification tools for Erlang. After a short return to academia as professor at Chalmers, he is now fully devoted to amzing testing tools.\n\nQuviq is the company that produced QuickCheck, a tool that automatically generates tests. The tool is written in Erlang, but can be used to test systems written in a variety of languages. Among other successes, it is heavily used within the telecom and automotive industry, for example for testing 5G base stations and AUTOSAR standard software."
