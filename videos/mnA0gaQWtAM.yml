description: "Neto Marin explains how to implement the In-App Billing API V3 in your Android app. In-app Billing on Google Play provides a straightforward, simple interface for sending In-app Billing requests and managing In-app Billing transactions using Google Play. In-app billing relies on the Google Play application, which handles all communication between your application and the Google Play server. You can use the service to sell a wide range of content, including downloadable content such as media files or photos, virtual content such as game levels or potions, premium services and features, and more.\n\nThis video covers how to your existing app or how to create a new project to support the In-App Billing API, how to connect to the Google Play service, list product details, start a purchase or subscription flow, and how to handle API responses.\n\nFor more information about in-app purchase, visit: \n* In-app Billing reference: http://goo.gl/C253Nh\n* Selling In-app Products: http://goo.gl/mafl1N\nDownload the in-app billing sample application Trivial Drive.\n\nWatch the Zen of Monetization here: https://goo.gl/EqvweO\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
