description: "Get the Code Here: http://goo.gl/OzbXM\n\nWelcome to my tutorial on Java Stacks and Queues. The data structures most are used to such as Arrays, linked lists, trees, etc. are best for data that represents real objects. Stacks and Queues are instead used to complete a task and are soon after discarded.\n\nA major difference is that stacks and queues allow only a single item to be added or removed at a time. Stacks then provide access to the last item in, while queues provide access to the first item in."
