description: "Materials for this talk are available at http://teapotahedron.com/littlelangs.pdf\n\nLanguages are an underrated tool for solving engineering problems, in part because creating them has been difficult. Rust's unique combination of features make it an excellent language for writing compilers ranging from the Rust compiler itself to small domain specific languages. This talk will describe the implementation of a compiler for a query language for protocol buffers and how much easier it is to write one in Rust compared to C.\n\nhttp://www.rust-belt-rust.com"
