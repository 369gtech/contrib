description: "Find more information here: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/migrating-data-stack-aws-azure-raspberry-pi\n\nMigrating a full data stack completely (http://www.slideshare.net/soobrosa/6w-bp-datashow) relying on AWS services (and a lots of them) to Microsoft Azure does not seem to be an enlightening and funny task. How we managed to do it with open sourcing tools as roadkills and what we learnt about the barebone necessities ending up within the sole body of a Raspberry Pi may shock the absolute believers of distributed computing. An adventure in bash, make and SQL with a detour in Moore's law and falling memory prices."
