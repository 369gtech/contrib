description: "At NDC Security two years ago we looked at some of the lesser known web application vulnerabilities that were arising in popularity due to bug bounty programs.\n\nIn this talk we will look at what has happened since then. We will discuss some recurring and some newer vulnerabilities that have surfaced since then. As last time, there will be demos and we will discuss how and why the bugs occur, and how we can find and get rid of them.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-security.com/"
