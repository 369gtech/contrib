description: "Inside Rails: The Lifecycle of a Response by Krystan HuffMenne\n\nThis breathtaking documentary series combines rare action, unimaginable scale, impossible locations and intimate moments captured from the deepest depths of Rails internals. Last year, we followed the lifecycle of best loved, wildest and most elusive Rails components through a request, from the browser to a controller action. This year, our journey takes us across the great text/plain, following the flow of HTTP streams, taking in the spectacular Action View as we find our way back to the browser. Join us to unearth the amazing lifecycle of a Rails response.\n\n__________\n\nKrystan HuffMenne is an engineer at Tilde, where she works on Skylight, the smart Rails profiler. She writes code in Ruby, JavaScript, and Instant Pot. Sheâ€™s a Florida-native living in Portland, OR with her husband and two kids."
