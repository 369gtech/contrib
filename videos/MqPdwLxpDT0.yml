description: "Diversity Lunch & Panel: How Women in Tech are Chasing Grace - Sponsored by Google & IBM - Introduction by Caitlyn O'Connell, Marketing Communications Manager, Cloud Foundry Foundation - Keaty Gross, Swetha Repakula, Abby Kearns, Sarah Novotny, Emamurho Ugherughe\n\nThe tech industry is the place to be for creative, strategic thinkers who want to be at the forefront of technological change. Open source in particular is a home to progressive, collaborative strategists -- so why do women in these industries continue to face adversities their male counterparts are blind to or simply refuse to acknowledge as problematic? Former VP of communications at the Linux Foundation and long-time open source professional Jennifer Cloer delved into this question in her new documentary series The Chasing Grace Project. At today’s luncheon, we will show the trailer for the series, share how you can get involved, and interview a variety of panelists working in open source about topics related to each of the series' six episodes. If you are interested in finding out how to be a better male ally, hearing your colleagues’ stories, and joining the conversation around how we can work together to retain valuable employees in tech, please join us.\n\nAbout Caitlyn O'Connell\nCaitlyn O’Connell runs content for the Cloud Foundry Foundation, including the blog, white papers, messaging and more.
