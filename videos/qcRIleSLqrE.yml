title: 'Refactoring Monolith to Microservices (Orkhan Gasimov, Ukraine) [RU]'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1528193023
description: "Distributed design is the way to go for most of the modern applications. However, when you have a startup with 1-2 backend developers in a team, it’s much easier to start with a monolithic app and refactor it when necessary.\n\nIn this talk, we will answer two questions:\n\n     1. How to design a “correct monolith” to be able to quickly refactor it to microservices?\n     2. How to refactor an existing monolith to microservices.\n\nWe will cover patterns, anti-patterns and real-life examples from personal experience. Examples will use Spring Cloud, as nowadays:\n\n     1. There are many applications developed with Spring.\n     2. Spring is used for quick development of projects from scratch.\n     3. Many apps migrate to or start using Spring."
