title: 'Building Resiliency to Discomfort'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327349
description: "Discomfort—we’ve all felt it before. It can be a rush of heat to the face, rapid heartbeat, sweaty palms, and the overwhelming desire to remove ourselves from whatever situation we’ve found ourselves in. In these moments, we benefit from understanding how our brain is trying to protect us and how that can get in the way of us living in alignment with our values. In this breakout session, Ellie Tumbuan, Head of Strategy and Culture at The Justice Collective, will geek out on the neuroscience of mindfulness, how it can mitigate bias, and share techniques to self-regulate when you get hijacked by your nervous system.\n\nEllie Tumbuan, Head of Strategy and Culture, at The Justice Collective Nicole Nelson, Manager of Marketing and Communications at The Justice Collective"
