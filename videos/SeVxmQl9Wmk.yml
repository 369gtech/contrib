description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotgo.eu on March 25th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nLast year, the Go team introduced two draft designs related to errors in Go: one introducing new syntax and the other focusing on improved library support. With the help of community feedback, they have turned the latter into a proposal. An implementation, which is planned to be part of Go 1.13, is now in the Go source tree for evaluation. Marcel explains its design and how to use the new functionality today."
