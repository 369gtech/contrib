description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeaker: John Davies\nFew companies have been quite at the forefront of implementing Spring Integration (Batch & Data etc.) as Incept5, this year's VMWare EMEA cloud partner. John will cover a few of the more interesting implementations from an architectural point of view, looking at the choices, the reasoning, design and some of the issues behind the implementations. From projects with no SI skills ramping up to teams of several dozen programmers to experienced teams just looking for training, best practices and better data services integration.\n \nA number of large banks are already in production with Scala-based SI workflows, is this still leading edge or have it moved into main-stream? What next for spring Integration and the tooling, what are the clients using and asking for? John will be joined by some of the Spring Integration team so an excellent opportunity to look at the present and future of Spring Integration and tooling."
