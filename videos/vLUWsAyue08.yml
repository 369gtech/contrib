description: "Before Kotlin Coroutines (async programming in Kotlin) was stable, they were launched in a way that made them difficult to maintain and track down. Structured Concurrency introduced changes to solve these problems but also involved an ideological shift in order to use them. In this talk, you'll learn how to do async programming in Kotlin using Structured Concurrency principles covering topics such as launching coroutines, scopes, error handling and testing.\n\nInterviewed Speaker:\nManuel is an Android Developer in the Developer Relations team at Google where he works to help other developers succeed."
