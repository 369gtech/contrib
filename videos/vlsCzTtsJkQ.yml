title: 'The reactive landscape by Clement Escoffier'
recordingDate: 1519313108
description: "Reactive Programming, Reactive eXtensions, Reactive Streams, Reactive Systems, Reactive Manifesto, that’s a lot of 'reactive' thingies. Just to make it even more confusing, 'reactive' is often associated with asynchronous, scalability, RX libraries (RX Java, RX-JS), back pressure, streams, observables, futures, promises, spreadsheets and so on…. That's a lot to digest…This session helps you understand what's behind the reactive word. It explores the reactive landscape and explains what all these 'things' are and how they are related. By providing a global overview of the reactive landscape, this session also provides to the attendees a general understanding of the 'reactive' trend, and why it matters.\n\nClement Escoffier, Red Hat\nClement Escoffier (@clementplop) is a principal software engineer at Red Hat.
