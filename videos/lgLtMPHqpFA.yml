Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nMost of us in the digital space think of UX as something that happens inside our screens, but user experience is in every product, service or space we encounter. Why do street signs look the way they do? Why are some parking lots infuriating? Why did it take me 17 minutes to open that package of batteries? Analyzing the world through the lens of UX can help us discover opportunities for improvement and inspiration that we can infuse back into the digital things we make.\n\nMatt Hryhorsky\nDesign Director, Filament\nhttps://twitter.com/matt_hy\nhttps://www.instagram.com/matt_hy/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
