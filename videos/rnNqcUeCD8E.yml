description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSIG Architecture Intro and Update - John Belamaric, Google & Derek Carr, Red Hat \n\nSIG Architecture maintains and evolves the design principles of Kubernetes, and provides a consistent body of expertise necessary to ensure architectural consistency over time. The SIG takes care of evolution of conformance definitions, API definitions/conventions, deprecation policy, design principles, and other cross-cutting concerns. In this talk, we will provide an introduction to SIG architecture, including its role and the various subprojects that support its activities. Additionally, we will provide a community update on the status of those efforts. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekGs"
