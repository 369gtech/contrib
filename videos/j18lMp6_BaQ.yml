title: 'Climbing the Summit with Open Source and POWER9'
recordingDate: 1548375319
description: "Michael Neuling\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/155/\n\nIn June 2018, the POWER9-based Summit supercomputer benchmarked as the world's fastest. The journey to this milestone started over 4 years ago and has seen the IBM OzLabs team drive the use of Open Source with POWER9.\r\n\r\nPOWER9 was a huge shift in functionality from previous designs. The new design introduced completely new interrupt controller and memory management architectures, and upgrades to IO, like next-generation PCIE and new acceleration interfaces - NVLink and OpenCAPI.\r\n\r\nTo take this highly technical, innovative and complex system from early concept through to the top of the supercomputer world required not only bucket loads of code, but organisational and risk management. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll share our experiences of this journey and show how Open Source is used with POWER9.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
