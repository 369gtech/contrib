description: "ðŸ—£Valeriane Venance\n\nWhen you start a brand new app or service, you need to think about how you will manage authentication and permissions. But if you are like everyone else, you genuinely do not want to actually think about this. If someone else could do that for you, life would be great. And this has actually happened, you have the choice between several boilerplate projects or authentication/authorization libraries. In fact, you have a lot of options. Which one to choose? Letâ€™s have a closer look to them!\n\nAt the end of this talk, you will have a good overview of the common existing solutions and their benefits."
