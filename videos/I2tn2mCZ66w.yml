(https://sonic-pi.net/) It's going to be fun for all ages so round up your kids and tell your friends! \n\nThis session is FREE - please consider supporting Sam's Sonic Pi work on Patreon: https://patreon.com/samaaron\n\nJoin YOW! Online for more great monthly content like this from our international expert speakers, as well as discounted online conferences and workshops: https://www.yowconference.net/home\n\nSonic Pi is a free code-based music creation and performance tool that targets both education and professional musicians.  It is possible for complete beginners to code fresh beats, driving bass lines and shimmering synth riffs. All this whilst learning core computer science concepts such as sequencing, functions, variables, loops, data structures and algorithms.\n\nIn this Sonic Pi discussion and performance we’ll briefly cover its history before taking a nose dive into some of the core technical innovations which give access to powerful, live expression of music all whilst learning the basics of code. We’ll finish the introduction with a live coded DJ performance demonstrating the full potential of Sonic Pi with practice.\n\nAbout Sam:\nDr Sam Aaron is the creator of Sonic Pi, an internationally renowned live coding performer, public speaker and science communicator.  Sam has a PhD in Computer Science and held a research position at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory where he initially developed Sonic Pi.\n\nSam regularly engages audiences of all ages and backgrounds with the creativity of code through keynotes, workshops and performances. He has live coded internationally featuring in the Royal Albert Hall, Berlin Warehouses, Music Festivals, on the BBC and even school assemblies. Sam has received two Google prizes for his Open Source work, was listed amongst Fast Company's \"Most Creative People in Business 2020\" and The Rolling Stone magazine described his Moogfest performance as “transcending the present”."
