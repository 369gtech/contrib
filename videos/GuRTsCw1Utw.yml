description: "LISA16 - Unik: A Platform for Automating Unikernels Compilation and Deployment\n\nIdit Levine, Dell EMC\n\nUnikernel­s, executable images that can run natively on a hypervisor without the need for a separate operating system, ­are rapidly gaining momentum. To integrate unikernels into the echo-system, cloud-computing platforms as a service are required to provide unikernels with the same services they provide for constrainers. Here we present Unik, a open source orchestration system for unikernels. Unik handles the compilation of libraries and applications for running on a variety of cloud providers, manages their scheduling, and ensures their health. To provide the user with a seamless PaaS experience, Unik is integrated as a backend to Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud Foundry runtime.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
