description: "After giving and watching many technical talks, I have opinions on what makes better talks (and not). If you're interested in giving tech talks yourself, come along and get some tips (or at least some of my opinions) on how to make non-terrible talks.\n\nThe talk is in three acts:\n\n1) A terrible tech talk\n2) An analysis of what made that talk so terrible\n3) A list of tips and techniques for making your content and presentation style terrific, instead.\n\nChet is the Chief Advocate for Android at Google. He joined the Android team in 2010, led the Toolkit team for several years, and now spends his time helping developers to create better Android applications."
