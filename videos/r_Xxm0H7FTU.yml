description: '– So where is your documentation? It should has been done yesterday! – There is no documentation in Agile – replied a lazy developer. – “Working software over comprehensive documentation” – explained another agile one. – Let’s create a change request – PM rubbed his hands – you may generate a Javadoc! – Isn’t our code self-documenting, Uncle? – asked an XP developer. – No document unless it''s need is immediate and significant – confirmed Bob. How many times have you heard such conversation? Probably you are not surprised with a common reluctance concerning software and code documentation. However, do you feel comfortable with Github projects having poor readme.md? This topic is addressed to developers who want to forget about documentation and return to the code. It may also interest people who feel that the time of docx files faded away. I will talk about modern and diverse methods or documentation replacements. I will show among others how to: create living documentation which won’t be outdated tomorrow; replace user stories and executable specifications with tests (still clear to business people); generate documentation elements without waffle; create graphs and diagrams without legacy UML; document API without Swagger’s hell of annotations.'
