description: "As we use Machine Learning in our software - we need to understand the impact on what we build. The Design team at Google has created a framework named Human-Centered Machine Learning (HCML) to help us focus and guide that understanding. I will introduce this concept and show how you can use it in your development process. I will show how HCML can be used to answer important questions like: Is ML right for this problem? What unique solution does ML provide? Are we using the right information to train our system? What is the impact of wrong results? Just like with the web and mobile revolutions, ML will force us to consider new possibilities for every experience we build. We must stay grounded in human needs while solving them in unique ways. HCML provides techniques to help us accomplish this.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
