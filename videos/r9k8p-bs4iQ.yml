recordingDate: 1495974911
description: 'By looking at different ways to animate things in the browser (CSS, canvas, WebGL, layout) we take a brief look at the innards of the browser graphics engine - what does it do internally when we choose different ways to control it? Which cogs move when we spin the wheel? For example why is the GPU "faster" at doing things? What does the compositor do vs. the layout engine? How can knowing the engine help us develop front-end solutions effectively?'
