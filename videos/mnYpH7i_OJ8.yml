For their training, it is desirable to have data sets that are diverse and as close as possible to real conditions. On the other hand, embedded platforms often have limited resources, so when creating an additional service, there are a number of technical problems and limitations that need to be addressed. We will discuss what problems arise in such cases and approaches to balancing resources in such cases."
