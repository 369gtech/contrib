description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nWith Kotlin/Native, we can now compile Kotlin code to run on various platforms, including Raspberry Pi. This cross platform ability has drawn the attention of many developers. Through the process of building a hand game robot which can play rock paper scissors with human beings, this talk aims to show you the possibility of using Kotlin to control GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi and other experiments such as performing machine learning operations in Kotlin using TensorFlow backend, thanks to the interoperability with C libraries.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains #RaspberryPi #TensorFlow\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nPassionate about on-device Machine Learning & TechForGood subjects."
