description: "Big companies can create really big software disasters. Some of the worst commercial failures have come from undersized production systems. Millions of dollars get thrown into hardware at the last minute. Just moving to the cloud doesn’t help. It lets you get the (virtual) hardware in place faster, but you still might spend a lot more than you expect for capacity. This session will present a technique for analyzing your system’s capacity–either during development or as you contemplate changes. Using these techniques could save you a lot of embarrassing downtime and your company a lot of money.\n\nMichael Nygard strives to raise the bar and ease the pain for developers across the country. Highly-available, highly-scalable commerce systems are his forte. Michael has written and co-authored several books, including “97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know” and the best seller “Release It!”, a book about building software that survives the real world.\n\nFor more on YOW!
