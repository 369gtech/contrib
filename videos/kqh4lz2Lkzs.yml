title: 'React is Fiction | Jenn Creighton'
recordingDate: 1572485843
description: 'You don''t know it but you are an author. You write stories every day. You build narratives, characters and plots — but you aren’t writing a novel, you’re writing components. I came to engineering from the world of creative writing and what surprised me the most is how similar code is to fiction. React itself follows tenants of creative writing and when you lean into those rules, you create solid component architecture. Inn this talk you’ll learn how to write React like its fiction and what you can gain by doing so.'
