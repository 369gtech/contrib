recordingDate: 1639167899
description: "Join us on this weekly Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database, where the OML team will give an update on the many new features of OML, from OML Notebooks to OML Services, and answer any questions.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks offers an easy-to-use, interactive, multi-user, collaborative interface based on Apache Zeppelin notebook technology, and support SQL, PL/SQL, Python and Markdown interpreters. It is available on all Autonomous Database versions and Tiers, including the always-free editions.\n\nOML includes AutoML, which provides automated machine learning algorithm features for algorithm selection, feature selection and model tuning, in addition to a specialized AutoML UI exclusive to the Autonomous Database.\n\nOML Services is also included in Autonomous Database, where you can deploy and manage native in-database OML models as well as ONNX ML models (for classification and regression) built using third-party engines, and can also invoke cognitive text analytics.\n\nVideo Highlights:\n00:48 Topics for Today\n01:15 OML Notebook updates - additions and updates\n03:28 Updated structure for OML and OML REST URLs\n06:02 REST API Authentication\n06:45 Where to find the URLs for my tenancy?\n07:57 Token acquisition for OML4Py REST APIs and OML Services\n09:37 Link to access Oracle Machine Learning for Autonomous Database\n10:03 OML Services - new support for ONNX clustering models\n11:50 OML Services - Cognitive Text new support for the Italian language\n12:37 OML Services - New filters for modelType and shared attributes\n13:18 New ESA Wiki model for Database 19c\n14:07 Steps used by Oracle to process Wikipedia data\n16:00 Where can I download the new ESA Wiki model?\n16:38 Demo: New URL to access OML\n18:24 Demo: OML Services new URL\n19:07 Demo: OML Services new modelType filter\n19:52 Demo: OML Services new Clustering ONNX model support\n22:10 Demo: OML4Py REST APIs new URL\n24:29 Q&A"
