title: '"Haskell: What To Do When Success Can''t Be Avoided" — Keynote by Sukant Hajra (Haskell eXchange ''21)'
language: English

description: "Many programming languages have a start with an academic foundation, but few languages carry such a deep sense of academic identity as they cross over into adoption in the industry. Haskell seems so different from the rest.\n\nSimSpace has been using Haskell at scale across nine teams, collectively maintaining over 400k lines of Haskell, developed over five years. We have a number of shared experiences and can speak to lessons learned over the years. This talk is an opportunity to share those experiences and give some helpful advice to others on a similar trajectory of using Haskell commercially.\n\nThere's such a rich and historic narrative coming from the academic side of Haskell. This talk seeks to complement that narrative with an industrial perspective."
