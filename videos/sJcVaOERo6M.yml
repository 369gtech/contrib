description: "Spring I/O 2018 - Barcelona, 24-25 May\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/vpavic/introducing-spring-session-2\nGitHub: https://github.com/vpavic/springio18-spring-session-2\n\nSpring Sessionâ€™s goal is to help you with management of user's session in a consistent and application container neutral way. This includes support for clustered sessions backed by data store of your choice, easy integrations with RESTful APIs, WebSocket session and Spring Security.\n\nWhile Spring Session 1.x was focused solely around Servlet API, 2.x brings support for reactive programming model by integrating with Spring WebFlux. This session will introduce you with all the new stuff in Spring Session 2 while focusing on practical usage with demos. We will also demonstrate how easy it is to extend Spring Session by providing your own session data store while reusing the existing infrastructure."
