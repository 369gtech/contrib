title: 'Maciej Górski – Make your Android banking app open-source!'
recordingDate: 1513950708
description: "Maciej Górski, Software Engineer\n\nMaciej is a big fan of open-source and He believes almost all apps could do as good and often better if they were open. Maciej also thinks that anybody willing should be able to see the code executing on their devices.\nWhat about banking apps? Or let's even generalize that to ad-supported or paid apps? Can you imagine these kind of apps with source on GitHub? You may argue software could be copied and someone else would make money on it, but if you start thinking where the value of software lies, you will soon start to agree with me.\nDuring the presentation Maciej will show you one way on how to retain the value (and indirectly money flow) of open-source apps. We will go deep into possible technical solution to keep our users while allowing them to browse our code. Warning: this presentation is aimed at developers and will be very technical."
