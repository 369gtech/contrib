description: "Byte-sized talks from CERN engineers\nIn 2012, at CERN we started the deployment of our private Cloud Infrastructure using OpenStack. Since then we have moved from a few hundred cores to a multi-cell deployment spread between two data centres. After 6 years deploying and managing OpenStack at scale, we now look back and discuss the challenges of building a massive scale infrastructure from 0 to +300K cores. With this talk we will navigate through the history, architecture, tools and technical decisions behind the CERN Cloud Infrastructure."
