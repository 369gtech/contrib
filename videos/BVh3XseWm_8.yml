recordingDate: 1506347270
description: 'You’ve probably heard the term before, but unless you’ve already participated in one, you’re probably wondering: what is a hackathon, exactly? It sounds so trendy and exciting, but what does it actually entail? In this talk Adi shares her two cents about hackathons and her secret sauce for winning them (a good team, winning ideas, working prototype, exciting presentation and much more). But even if you don’t win, there are many practical perks for participating in these awesome programming projects (except for all of the fun of course). Adi explains why participating in a hackathon is great for self-development, and shares examples of creative projects that won. And finally, she talks about how startups and corporates can utilize hackathons for innovation creation.'
