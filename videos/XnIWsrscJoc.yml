description: "\"From Power Chords to Power of Models: Insights from History of Rock Music via Machine Learning\"\n\nWho were the most influential bands of Rock history? Which bands could not exist if there was no Velvet Underground? How much Shoegazing subgenre is related to the Drone music?\n\nRock music history was perhaps full of drugs and alcohol but we are sobering up to represent it in terms of (social) networks and find mathematical relationship between artists, trends and subgenres. Full of DataViz and interesting relationships, we will pick up a few common clustering and network analysis algorithms to analyse the publicly available Wiki data. Expect lots of air guitar power chords and virtuoso solos."
