title: 'Kubernetes as a distributed JVM by Bilgin Ibryam'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510225553
description: "Java is the most popular language for creating enterprise software today, and containers are becoming the de facto deployment mechanism for it. And the common thing between the two is Kuberbetes as the automation tool for distributed systems. In this talk, we will demonstrate how Kubernetes complements Java with new primitives and abstractions for creating distributed applications. We will explore what are these new primitives and the foundational building blocks available for developers, what principles dictate the design of containerized applications, the resulting repeatable patterns and overall benefits of Kubernetes for developers.\n\nBilgin Ibryam (@bibryam) is a Senior Architect at Red Hat and committer at Apache for Camel, OFBiz and Isis projects. He is a blogger, speaker, open-source enthusiast and the author of Camel Design Patterns and Kubernetes Patterns books. In his day-to-day job, Bilgin enjoys mentoring, training and leading teams to be successful with application integration, distributed systems, microservices, devops, and cloud-native applications in general."
