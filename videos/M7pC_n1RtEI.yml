description: "Speaker: Kushal Das (Fedora Project)\n\nTalk of 20 minutes\n\nMicro Bit (or micro:bit) is an ARM-based embedded system designed by the BBC for use in computer education in the UK. It will be given to every 11 year old student in UK. MicroPython is an \"official\" solution for the micro:bit. The Python Software Foundation are one of the partners in the project and the BBC asked us to provide such a solution (ntoll is leading the efforts from the PSF side of things). \"Mu\" is a community generated (i.e. from the Python community) editor that *initially* targets the micro:bit. In the wider Python context, there's been talk of a kid/teacher/beginner friendly editor that's recommended for Python \"in general\". Plans are afoot to make \"mu\" meet this requirement.\n\nAbout Kushal Das:\n\nKushal Das is a core developer of CPython, and a fellow at Python Software Society. He is a long time Fedora contributor. He is currently working as Fedora Cloud Engineer in the Fedora Engineering team at Red Hat.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.fossasia.org/schedule/#HW-04\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCcI/"
