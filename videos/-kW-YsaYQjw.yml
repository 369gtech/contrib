description: "Continuous integration, test-driven development, and continuous delivery or deployment are the primary supporting pillars of successful agile development. Hudson is a full-fledged execution and scheduling engine used by many enterprises today. However, using it not merely as an execution tool but also as a real continuous integration build server requires planning and architecting of the build units to meet the conditions necessary for achieving the flow from continuous integration to continuous delivery. This session explores the nuances of continuous integration to continuous delivery and how to set up Hudson as a true continuous integration build server for your agile team and includes a simple real-world example.\n\n\nAuthors:\nDuncan Mills\nDuncan Mills is a Senior Director and Architect at Oracle with responsibility for helping Oracle's own development teams get the most out of the Oracle Application Development Framework.\nHe has been working with Oracle in a variety of application development and DBA roles since 1988.
