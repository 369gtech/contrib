description: "With the availability of SVG and CSS filters and blend modes, our browsers have become very powerful image rendering engines. From creating faux surrealist infrared effects to 3D images, the artistic possibilities are endless. But what about some practical use cases for filters and blend modes? How can we use them in our every day user interfaces to improve performance and aid in design? This talk will cover just that, and show some practical examples of using filters and blend modes.\n\nAbout Una: http://una.im\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
