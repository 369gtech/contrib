description: "The requirements for build automation are constantly growing these days as having a well designed continuous delivery pipeline is essential to deliver features and bugfixes quick to customers. This growing complexity results in more complex custom build logic. This causes developers and build authors to invest more in custom build logic which should be a pleasant experience as writing production code. With Gradle now supporting Kotlin, a statically typed and pragmatic language for the JVM, for writing Gradle build scripts, build masters can easily detect potential misconfigurations at compile time which can reduce problems at runtime dramatically. Kotlin ships with first class IDE support for Eclipse and IDEA that allows more sophisticated tooling support for editing build logic than you have ever seen before by supporting auto completion, documentation lookup, refactoring etc.\n\nThe last couple of months the Gradle Team and the Kotlin team have collaborated closely to provide a great expericence to Gradle users. In this session we’ll take a closer look on the Kotlin based Gradle DSL and the IDE support. Furthermore we discuss best practices and future plans.\n\nRene Groeschke\nApart on working on the Gradle core, René supports teams all over the world to deliver better software faster by giving in depth Gradle classes and providing remote and onsite support on implementing software automation, continuous delivery and continuous integration patterns.\n\nUnderstanding software development as a craftsmanship, he loves getting out of his comfort zone, learn about new tools, technologies and techniques.\n\nFrom time to time he’s involved in other open source projects or he’s talking at different local usergroups and international conferences. Earlier he shared his passion and experience with bachelor students lecturing agile methologies. He's also one of the founding members of the famous hackergarten initiative.\n\n[STH-6071]"
