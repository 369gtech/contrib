description: 'Did you ever asked yourself a question: What really happens when your Java program runs? After the transformation from Java source through bytecode and machine code to microcode, and the various optimizations that take place along the way, the instructions that are actually executed may be very different from what you imagined when you wrote the program. This session shows you tools and techniques for tracing that path. Youâ€™ll see what a simple program actually looks like when it really hits the hardware.'
