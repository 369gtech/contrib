description: "\"Running EuroPython 2020 as an online conference\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Microsoft\nOnline\n\nBy Marc-Andre Lemburg\n\nWe had been planning the EuroPython 2020 conference in Dublin, Ireland ever since late in 2019, when we ran the CFP. In March, it became apparent that the COVID-19 crisis would not be over by July 2020 and so we had to make a hard decision to either drop the event for 2020 or go online.\n\nSince we wanted to support the community even in difficult times, we decided to go for the online version -- even though this would be much less engaging than the in-person event.\n\nFor the past months, we have been creating a concept for the conference from scratch. The talk will present our approach, how it came to be and which challenges we faced. The concept should be usable by other conference as well.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
