description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nBecause they offer many similar capabilities, it’s easy to confuse a Platform as a Service with a Kubernetes as a Service system, but they are fundamentally different, and that can have serious implications if you choose the wrong option. In this webinar, Mirantis’ Nick Chase explains the difference between the two and how to choose which will be better for your particular use case. Attendees will learn:\n\n* How both systems generally work, and what they offer\n* How to provide developers with ready access to the resources they need\n* How to avoid hamstringing operators with too restrictive an environment\n* How to determine which approach is more appropriate for you"
