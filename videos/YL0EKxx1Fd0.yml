description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nScala is a very powerful language, with lots of features supporting many different development paradigms. But there’s still quite a way from there to running, real-world production applications that are easy to test and safe to work on for many developers, especially ones that may be new to Scala.\n\nVarun and Andrew will talk about x.ai’s experience of using Scala to build an advanced production system that magically schedules meetings. Specifically, they’ll focus on some of the key coding and architecture lessons that their team learned on the way to safely building a testable application.\n\nAndrew and Varun will introduce a number of important coding and testing patterns, and libraries that the team adopted (and open-sourced ;-)). They’ll also describe the team’s transition to a functional “I/O vs. pure” architecture, discuss how and why this approach has improved application testability at multiple levels, and share tips on how you can evolve your applications’ architecture in a similar way."
