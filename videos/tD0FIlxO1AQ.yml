description: "Reproducible Development and Deployment with Bazel and Telepresence - Christian Roggia, Engel & Völkers Technology GmbH \n\nAs the system grows in size and complexity the pain of maintaining an up-to-date local environment becomes less and less sustainable. Developers will eventually have to deal with large docker-compose YAMLs and strict build guidelines, slowing down the development process and encouraging build-push-deploy cycles instead. This talk will explore a better approach to the issue by making both development and deployment fully reproducible, reducing required efforts and allowing for more reliable releases. Attendees will be introduced to the Bazel ecosystem combined with Telepresence’s proxying capabilities. The final goal is to understand how Bazel can help developers achieve a fully hermetic and reproducible build environment, and how locally produced images can be connected from developers’ machines to the remote cluster through the two-way communication proxy offered by Telepresence. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXE"
