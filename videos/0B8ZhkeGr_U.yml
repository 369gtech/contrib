recordingDate: 1541715074
description: "So, you built a Django application. That’s great! Now, how do you get the app connected to your fancy domain name for the world to see? During this talk, you’ll learn about the phone book of the internet, otherwise known as the Domain Name Systems (DNS). We’ll go over topics such as: why DNS was created, how it works, and why it’s important for developers have a good understanding of DNS.\n\nAs a web developer who has launched hundreds of websites, I’ll tell you stories of some of my own DNS disasters and odd quirks that I’ve ran into over the last 5 years. If you’ve ever wondered why you can see your newly launched website but your coworker can’t, or if you’re ready to launch your first client website, but not take down their email in the process, you won’t want to miss this talk."
