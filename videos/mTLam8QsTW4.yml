title: 'Herding Docker to Production - Marco Pegoraro'
recordingDate: 1505214784
description: "MalmöJS is a monthly meet-up for front-end web developer passionates who are pleased to share knowledge, problems and ideas with each other. \n\nArguments drifts around the HTML5 environment with a pitch on Web App development in Javascript and rich page design with CSS. \n\nTaking Docker to production should be straightforward. For me it was not. When it was time to hit the button I faced many different options, constrains and general troubles. \n\nWe are going through some of those options, check out pros & cons and finally we are going to deploy a Wordpress project into a DigitalOcean virtual machine. \n\nActually we are going to see an end-to-end experience from Development to Production!\n\nMarco Pegoraro just can't stay a full weekend without playing around with his mac. Instead of gaming he's playing around with new stuff trying to make his daily job experience more easy and fast. He secretly dreams of cutting down his working hours by half after retirement. \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
