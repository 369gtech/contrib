description: "Deep Learning has become the hottest topic in the IT industry: a week hardly goes by without a new breakthrough. In this talk, we値l give you a tour of the state of the art: through code-level demos based on Open Source libraries like Apache MXNet or Keras, we値l demonstrate advanced models based on CNN, GAN and LSTM architectures, which solve complex problems such as image detection, image generation and machine translation. \n\nWe値l also show how to customize models on your own data set and how to use them in your own applications. Last but not least, you値l learn how to deploy these models in production with just a few lines of code thanks to Amazon SageMaker.\n\nTalk by Julien Simon at Devoxx Poland 2018.\n\nThanks to Devoxx for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk. We're just excited to bring more exposure to to it!\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.org\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
