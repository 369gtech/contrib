Throughout the engagement, the SPARROW Team, leveraged every dimension of the Pivotal Teams capabilities from discussions of product strategy, architecture principles, design approaches, identifying areas of improvement, best practices and production deployment (standby support), this was truly a partnership. In parallel, Pivotal collaborated with the APS NTCE (New Technology Center of Excellence) to start educating our engineers on cloud technologies, micro-services, DevOps, Continuous Delivery & Deployment which was very helpful in enabling our engineers to change mindset. In fact, the relationship went significantly further then trying to sell software the relationship was focused on solving our business problems both technical and non-technical. The SPARROW Team was able to observe in production many of the design patterns that came out of the cloud-native transformation, we anticipate more than a 50% reduction in infrastructure systems, 30% improvement in productivity based on feedback from the development team during Iteration Planning & Retrospectives. In our early stage of production deployments we have seen 1% improvement in activation success already… This has been an unexpected journey.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeaker: James Taylor; Architect, Comcast"
