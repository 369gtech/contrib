We'll also explain how to bypass commonly recommended security controls, dispelling attack and defense misconceptions that have been disseminated in blogs and social media posts.\n\nThis talk will include a number of demos using Singularity, our open source DNS rebinding attack framework that includes all the parts you need to get started pwning today, including:\n\nRemote code execution and exfiltration payloads for common dev tools and software\nPractical scanning and automation techniques to maximize the chance of controlling targeted services\nWe'll also show an interesting post-exploitation technique that allows you to browse a victim browser network environment via the attacker's browser without the use of HTTP proxies.\n\nYou'll leave this talk with the knowledge and tools to immediately start finding and exploiting DNS rebinding bugs.\n\nGerald Doussot\nGerald Doussot is a Principal Security Consultant at NCC Group, with over 20 years experience in information technology.
