Better stop wasting time? Not quite the expert you thought they were? Or perhaps you respect their honesty? Perhaps this opens the opportunity to explore the issue together and reach a better outcome without assumptions?\n\nWhat we can learn from those that admit they don't know might surprise you. I'll share some of the valuable insights I've gained from admitting there are things I didn't know and being prepared to try things with an open mind. I have seen many newcomers excel because they've admitted they don't know and many experienced people fall from refusing to admit the opposite.\n\nHaving joined a team that had finally been given the much requested green light to restart a high budget high stakes project from the ground up, I saw first hand how fear of the unknown could stop a great team of great engineers dead in their tracks. I will share my experiences of how admitting we don't know has freed us to try things without the fear of failure and, ultimately, delivered results we can all be proud of.\n\nNathan Murados \nFrom agilelabs.io\nAs an avid developer that genuinely enjoys being able to use my expertise to solve problems, I have found myself moving away from using technology as the sole way to solve problems and instead towards using technology as one option in an ever growing toolkit. From initially taking a big interest in the conversations front-end development provides to moving to various corners of the .NET stack, I have gained many cross cutting skills that are technologically agnostic and applicable in a wide array of situations, both in work and out of it. Hopefully sharing this knowledge with others can go someway in making the world a happier place to be :)"
