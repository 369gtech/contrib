description: "We know the “right thing” to do is to work together, to remove bottlenecks, to automate, automate, automate. But when the status quo is finger-pointing, mistrust, blame, and over-exhaustion from increasingly complex manual releases, it seems impossible to find a way to climb out of the downward spiral. How did an IT department turn this around to become a harmonious department with common goals and over 10x faster cycle times?\n\nWinning the hearts and minds needed for lasting DevOps change requires something more than just great automation. This is the story of how Wotif found a way to incentivise a DevOps transformation across an entire IT department, resulting in cycle times measured in hours instead of weeks/months. While this journey involved technology such as DropWizard, Puppet & ZooKeeper, Matt (dev) and Alexandra (ops) extract principles that they hope can be applied to any organisation at grassroots and leadership levels using existing toolchains to support not only the best ideas of the present but also the legacy of the past and the unknown innovation of the future.\n\nAlexandra Spillane is a senior system administrator at Wotif and Expedia. She is passionate about DevOps, configuration management, web operations and management, and the cultural challenges facing organisations at all levels as they move to more rapid and predictable software delivery. She has 15 years experience in the travel, education, e-commerce and printing industries, with a BInfTech from Queensland University of Technology. Contact is welcome at alexandra@spillane.me.\n\nMatt Callanan is a senior software engineer in the DevOps team at Wotif and Expedia. He has 16 years development experience including DevOps implementation and agile mentoring in small teams and large enterprises. He is most passionate about helping companies realise their potential through automation and reducing feedback cycles to quickly deliver value to customers. Matt has spoken internationally on DevOps, is a well-received presenter to IT departments and executive teams, and co-organises DevOps conferences and Meetups.\n\nFor more on YOW!
