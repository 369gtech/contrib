description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\nIn these COVID-19 times the phrase ‘the new normal’ has become ubiquitous - this enforced disruptive change has resulted in challenges to long-held beliefs about how organisations are able to function effectively.  Bob Willis is an Enterprise Agile Coach in the IBM European Centre of Competence. In this session he will discuss experiences from the trenches of remote Agile coaching and training in support of organisations’ need to embrace flexibility and adaptability. Post-COVID, a period of reflection and rebuilding will naturally occur but using this crisis to refocus on culture and mindset as it pertains to Business Agility and Organisational Design is of paramount importance - those that embrace this opportunity will be better placed to succeed."
