description: "Have you ever tried to design a complicated bit of software and ended up with a great big tangled mess? Designing software is hard and formal processes can be frustrating. Is there a better way to approach this task? Mind maps are a fun and intuitive way to brainstorm and organise your ideas on paper or a whiteboard. In this talk, Rina shows how to use mind maps to design software well, convert your thought process into an excellent technical spec, and break it down into workable tasks, while leaving lots of room for agility and flexibility.\n\nBio: Rina Artstain is a full stack developer at Dropbox with 15+ years of experience in a variety of technologies at small, mid-size and enterprise companies, a blogger and a mentor. Rina is passionate about excellent software practices and teams working well together, and has been known to have opinions about things, though not about tabs vs. spaces."
