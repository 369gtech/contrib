description: "by Vitaly Kuznetsov\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2213/vai_enlightening_kvm.webm\n\n\nIs running a Windows guest any different from Linux from KVM's perspective?\nKVM can pretend being Hyper-V and this is actively used for running Windows\nguests. Following Hyper-V naming convention, individual features are named\n\"enlightenments\": some of them are already mature, some of them were just\nadded to KVM and some are still waiting to be implemented. What are these\nfeatures and how Windows guests use them? How is it different from Linux? Attendees of the talk will get to know the current status and the ongoing\nwork for Hyper-V emulation in KVM, how this impacts Windows guests. Some\nbenchmarks won't be missing too.\nThe talk is intended for virtualization development engineers as well as\nsystem administration running KVM in production. In the talk both the internals\nof Hyper-V emulation in KVM and practical advises on how to run Windows guests\non KVM will be discussed. \n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 10:30:00+01"
