description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nManaging Apps Dependencies and Kubernetes Versions with Kraan and Flux - Adrian Vacaru, Fidelity Investments\n\nThe Fidelity platform team supports internal users on different Kubernetes versions and gives cluster admins from different business units permissions across EKS, AKS, and on-prem (with Rancher). Their OSS Kraan project helps create this seamless experience in a highly regulated industry by using Kubernetes and CNCF Flux.    This talk covers Fidelity’s enterprise use case and how users can use Kraan to provide modular and reusable components across different Kubernetes clusters. Platform teams can spin up K8s clusters and install application “layers” using Kraan. Eg. an “IoT layer” comes with Prometheus, Grafana and InfluxDB for storing data from IoT sensors. Cluster admins don’t have to deal with complex deployment/upgrade logic because the kraan-controller, helm-controller and source-controller take care of that. Kraan also has a versioned layer dependency system that simplifies dependency management between addons. Add-ons can be certified and mapped to different Kubernetes versions.
