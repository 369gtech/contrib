title: 'The Art of Web API Design - Paweł Zajączkowski'
language: English
recordingDate: 1638982840
description: "Web applications don't talk with front-end and database only anymore. They increasingly often talk with each other. In order not to get crazy in this communication mess, it’s good to take a look at many aspects of creating web API. We will answer the \"why\", \"what\" and \"how\" questions to begin with. We will meet the three wizards: Morville, Fielding and Richardson. We will play with resources, behavior, relations, parameters, headers, collections, versioning, errors, security, throttling, cache, HATEOAS, management performance, health and business. There will be a bunch of tips on how to make consumers of our API happy. Warning: may contain traces of snakes and camels.\n\nPresented by Paweł Zajączkowski\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
