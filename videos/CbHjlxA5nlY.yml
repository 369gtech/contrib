title: 'HTML5 for game development: Jesse Freeman interviewed at Fluent 2012'
language: English
recordingDate: 1338323490
description: "HTML5, it's the 800 lbs gorilla in the developer room. I tried to resist it for as long as I could but in the end I had no choice but to embrace it. So to have a little fun I decided to make a game. But not just any game, I created a crowd sourced RPG built on top of ImpactJS and powered by Wordpress. Crazy right? Well I was happy to find out that it actually wasn't that hard to do!\n\nIn this talk I will cover Impact, which is a HTML5 game framework. I'll cover my development workflow, how I converted my AS3 code over to HTML5, asset management (sprite sheets generation) and discuss the future of HTML5 gaming. I'll also cover some basics of Canvas and how I used Wordpress to power my game.\n\nThis talk is for anyone interesting in learning more about HTML 5 game development and how to transition over to JS from AS3. Not only will I cover the basics of game design including how to organize your game ideas and build them but I will also go in depth into my own game projects from Flash to HTML 5 and how I am able to use the same skills across each platform. This talk is NOT about converting people from Flash to HTML 5. HTML 5 gaming is still in its infancy but has the potential to explode just like Flash gaming did 10 years ago. This talk attempts to open its viewers up to the future of web gaming as HTML 5 becomes more widely adopted.\n\nJesse Freeman\n\nMicrosoft\n\nFor more than 13 years, Jesse Freeman has been on the cutting edge of interactive development with a focus on the Web and mobile platforms.
