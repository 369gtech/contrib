description: "Time is Money. Understanding application responsiveness and latency is critical but good characterization of bad data is useless. Gil Tene discusses some common pitfalls encountered in measuring latency and response time behavior. He introduces how simple, open sourced tools can be used to improve and gain higher confidence in both latency measurement and reporting.\n\nGil Tene\nAZUL SYSTEMS\n@giltene\n\nGil Tene is CTO and co-founder of Azul Systems. He has been involved with virtual machine and runtime technologies for the past 25 years. His pet focus areas include system responsiveness and latency behavior. Gil is a frequent speaker at technology conferences worldwide, and an official JavaOne Rock Star. He pioneered the Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector (C4) that powers Azul's continuously reactive Java platforms. In past lives, he also designed and built operating systems, network switches, firewalls, and laser based mosquito interception systems."
