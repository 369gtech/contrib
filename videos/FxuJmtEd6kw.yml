description: "DevOpsDays Baltimore 2019 - Ignite: Migrating A Legacy App to Modern Infrastructure by Dan Ivovich\n\nSo you've got a great legacy app that's been running great for years; you've kept the OS up-to-date, kept adding features, and kept the client and users very happy. Good news! Your client is growing, but now their infrastructure is feeling a bit constrained. A lot has changed in the world of cloud hosting in the several years since this was last architected. Weâ€™ll review a successful migration of a 4 node Linode setup to a 6 node + RDS setup on AWS. We brought in a few new tools, had lots of moving pieces, experienced a few hiccups, and learned several lessons. See how teams of all sizes can benefit from our experience planning this datacenter migration, using the robust tools available, planing for future system bottlenecks, and ultimately give your clients room to grow.\n\n#confreaks #devopsdaysbmore"
