title: 'Putting the "D" in TDD - Shai Yallin'
recordingDate: 1435679437
description: "Shai - Software Philosopher @ Wix - explains how he put the \"D\" in TDD. \nWhat is software design? How does it relate to writing code? many of us are using agile methodologies nowadays, but how can we reconcile these with the concept of software design as we currently know it?\nIn this talk, Shai shared with the audience his personal journey with Test-Driven Development (and Design) over the last 4 years, a journey that started with him assuming that he knows what TDD is and how one should write tests and over time has repeatedly proved Shai wrong, making him more humble and open to new ideas - and by way of that, helped him become a better engineer.\n\nThis is not a talk about code. It's about adopting a Zen-like approach to software design, using TDD as our guide.\nEnjoy!"
