This talk is about the practical engineering challenges of turning deep learning, classical machine vision and sensor fusion algorithms from research prototypes into real-world automotive-grade systems. We will summarize the many safety critical standards in general for C++ and specifically for autonomous vehicles (AV). These include the updates to MISRA, AUTOSAR, and our own SG12 which has been processing updates from WG23 for C++. We have been working hard in these standards bodies and with industrial partners to deliver automotive-grade, safe, high performance AI software development tools.\nWe will further review C++ Directions that supports this and reveal the road map for what is possibly the earliest Safety Critical C++ that is also capable of heterogeneous dispatch for AV.\n— \nMichael Wong\nVP Research & Development, Codeplay Software\nwongmichael.com/about\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
