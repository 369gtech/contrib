title: 'Do Your GC Logs Speak to You? The G1GC Edition'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433260507
description: "The Garbage First Garbage Collector is touted as being the collector of the future. Although it’s supposed to be more self-tuning than any previous collector, it still requires that you provide it with several parameters. Each of these parameters is used to affect different aspects of the collector function and internal memory pool sizing. This session covers how the internal memory pools are structured and how the collector functions. It also discusses G1 GC logs and how to use that information to understand how to configure the G1 GC.\n\n\nAuthor:\nKirk Pepperdine\nKirk works for Kodewerk as a consultant offering Java performance-related services and training.
