title: 'Webinar: Managing your policies and standards'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604524965
description: "Governance in engineering refers to the ability of the operations team to verify and enforce certain policies and standards across the entire organization or within specific clusters. The policies and standards you want to enforce come from your organization’s established guidelines or agreed-upon conventions, and best practices within the industry. It could also be derived from the knowledge that has accumulated over the years within your operations and development teams.\n\nIn this webinar, we will go through a real example of how we implemented a simple governance framework using Rego and OPA. We will focus on a simple policy and go through its full life cycle. The same process could be applied to other policies and you can easily extrapolate from this example to meet your own specific needs.\n\nObjectives:\n– What is governance and why it is important\n– How to establish a governance framework\n– How Open Policy Agent and the Rego language could help\n– Example policies for Kubernetes\n\nPresenter:\nAhmed Badran, Chief Technology Officer @Magalix"
