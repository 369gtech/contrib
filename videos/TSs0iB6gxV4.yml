title: 'A Practical Type of Empathy - Indi Young Keynote'
recordingDate: 1433011492
description: "From Velocity Santa Clara 2015: The deeper insight derived from developing empathy with the people you support is about the reasoning and guiding principles that run through a person’s mind as he achieves an intent or purpose which is larger than the tools he is using. This deeper insight leads the way to tighter connection and greater detail between an offering and the purposes and intents of the people it is aimed at, whether those people are internal or external to the organization. This deep knowledge also allows organizations to confidently branch away from the competition.\n\nBig data, data visualization, data-driven decisions… organizations hate risk. They love trying to predict your next choice based on what you chose the last time. How many times have you been chased for weeks by ads for shower fixtures because your friend was telling you about her renovation project and she wanted your opinion about finishes? These predictions are based on inferences and assumptions, not on the actual thinking that’s going on. Perhaps only 20% of real-life thinking is represented by the numbers and the predictions.\n\nThe only way to find out the other 80% of the story is to take time to listen to people. Explore how each person makes decisions in many similar scenarios — not just the one involving your product or service. Develop a sense of empathy that you can use later in your own decision-making.\n\nIf you listen to many people, you’ll start to see patterns in how they reason, react, and guide their decisions. These patterns are what you use to balance big data. It’s pretty simple, but mention to your boss that you want to go listen to how people think, and he’ll assign you three new projects just to avoid that fuzzy qualitative data you might bring back. In an atmosphere where “hard numbers” and “scientific approaches” are held in greatest esteem, you have your work cut out for you to demonstrate that words are not useless fuzzy concepts.\n\nYour best weapon in this struggle? Understand how your bosses think. Understand the reasons numbers are held so dear. Develop empathy with your bosses, then address the underlying goals confidently with your qualitative data.\n\nAbout Indi Young:\nIndi Young is an empathy researcher and writer.
