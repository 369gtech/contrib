description: "Clone a GitHub repository from scratch. Starting with installing NodeJS, npm, and git all the way to installing packages and running a local version of a project.\n\nNote: NodeJS and npm are NOT necessary to clone a repo from GitHub. They are used in this video for running our cloned project locally. Not all GitHub projects use Node and npm, so they will not always be needed.\n\nVideo from Jesse Weigel.\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
