description: "Speaker(s):\nBrendan Burns, Craig McLuckie\n\nDescription:\nHave you ever wondered about the core technologies that enable Google to rapidly build reliable distributed systems, while simultaneously increasing data center reliability and efficiency? In 2006, Google developed Linux container technology that enabled world leading fleet utilization, efficiency and scale.  More recently, these same core technologies formed the foundation of Docker, the popular, new open source container environment.  \nJoin us in this session and see how containers are re-making the cloud computing landscape. Learn how Google Cloud Platform is making itself the best place in the world to run container images.  Come see how containers and Google Cloud Platform make it easier to build, run and maintain distributed systems, by building on the same core container technologies that power all of Google.  Get a first look at Kubernetes, the new open source container cluster management implementation that turns these concepts into reality. Come learn how containers and Google Cloud Platform make the technology and application architectures that power Google available to all developers across the world. \n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
