description: "We’ve got a problem with cyber – trust me – I know a lot about hacking. We’re getting cyber hacked on a regular basis and it could be Russia, but it could be China using the Norks to intimidate us and it could also be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, ok? Even 10 year old kids are so good with these computers it’s unbelievable!\nI’ll tell you what – no computer is safe – I don’t care what they say, no computer is safe. I think that computers have complicated lives very greatly, the whole age of computers have made it where nobody knows exactly what’s going on. We need to talk about cyber and really understand what’s going on, we need to make cyber great again!"
