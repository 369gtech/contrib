title: 'Fireside Chat #9: Managing Technical Debt'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628789616
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso, Mashooq Badar, and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss how to manage technical debt. What is technical debt? How does it get created? What skills are involved in identifying and remediate technical debt? Is technical debt a bad thing? Should we strive for perfection—no technical debt? What practices help to reduce or increase technical debt? What are all the different ways technical debt can be managed?\n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
