description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nUsing TUF to Mitigate Repository Compromises - Marina Moore, NYU & Justin Cappos, NYU \n\nThe secure distribution of software is critical to the overall security of a system. In this talk, Justin Cappos and Marina Moore will provide an introduction to The Update Framework (TUF), a CNCF project that has been used throughout the cloud native community for compromise resilient software updates. TUF provides a flexible framework for secure updates even through a compromise of signing keys or the update repository. You will come away from this talk with an understanding of why secure distribution of software is important and how TUF can be used to achieve this goal. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaio"
