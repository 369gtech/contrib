description: "Question:\nI am really keen on getting some React JS experience but anywhere I apply to, they seek an experienced React engineer. I have learn React on my own and recruiters do not seem to appreciate it. Further, at this stage at the big companies, I reach 1-2 rounds behind the final round and then they say they found a more experienced person for the role. Recently I got a rejection from the [COMPANY X] and [COMPANY Y . These both required 5-6 years of industry experience. My application took me to the initial rounds and they seemed interested in gauging my potential - only to find I was not as good as somebody they were looking for.\nNext week I am appearing for a full stack role at [COMPANY Z] but it is clearly out of my league - they are seeking at least 6 years experience in JavaScript. I am pursuing it for interview experience + what if it works out somehow?\nI do not know many people who can refer me. How do I get my first React job [without any industry experience]?\n\nAnswer:\n[See video]\n\nAbout Preethi:\nPreethi Kasireddy is an engineer based in San Francisco.
