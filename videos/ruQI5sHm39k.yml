description: "Ever wanted to use the Kubernetes API to describe not just your Kubernetes objects but also resources on which your applications\ndepend? Well, with AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK), now you can! Describe that RDS database instance using a Kubernetes manifest and let\nmanage its lifecycle. Need to ensure that an S3 Bucket exists for your application to store objects in? ACK can handle that for you as well.\nJust describe the S3 bucket in a Kubernetes manifest.\n\nCome learn about the design and usage of ACK from one of its authors and see how you can contribute to its roadmap and development. \n\nPresenter:\nJay Pipes, Principal Open Source Engineer @Amazon Web Services"
