title: '"Dieter RAMs: the ten principles of good API design" - Leigh Brenecki (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612101815
description: "Leigh Brenecki\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/60/\n\nIn the late 1970s, industrial designer Dieter Rams wrote his \"ten principles of good design\", a set of aphorisms outlining how he saw his work. Rams and his ten principles have been hugely influential on design to this day, and that influence extends far beyond Rams' realm of shelving systems, wristwatches and FM radiosâ€”Apple chief designer Jony Ive cites him as an influence, and articles applying the principles to web or UI design are a dime a dozen.\r\n\r\nBut we as developers are designers too, whether we like it or not, and not just on those occasions where we build something that faces an \"end user\". Our fellow developers are also our users, and the APIs and the developer tools that we build are products that are designed, intentionally or otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll use Rams' ten principles to explore good design of APIs and developer tools, and the things we should keep in our minds to build APIs and developer tools that are designed for our peers to use.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
