description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKeynote: Multi-Cloud and Multi-Cluster with CNCF’s Kuma on Kubernetes and VMs - Marco Palladino, Co-Founder + CTO, Kong Inc.\n\nOrganizations are well on their way to adopting microservice architectures, and as a result applications have grown to become decoupled and distributed - with connections spanning across geographies, clouds, and even workload platforms. Establishing service mesh as a “Day-0” solution for every team and application allows these organizations to deliver, livecycle, and troubleshoot applications faster and at global scale.\n\nIn this talk, Marco Palladino, Kuma maintainer and Kong CTO, will introduce you to Kuma, an open-source service mesh built on top of Envoy and a CNCF project focused on delivering simplicity and scalability to every application.\n\nWe’ll cover:\n\n    Kuma’s unique feature set designed for enterprise architects. \n    Give you a first look at Kuma’s unique multi zone deployment, including hybrid Kubernetes and VMs.\n    Walk you through a short demo to see Kuma in action across multiple clusters and clouds."
