recordingDate: 1613505850
description: 'Jelena graduated from the University of Derby with an economics degree back in 2009. In 2016 she got a diploma in Pedagogy. Then she spent several years being a teacher in Latvijas Kultūras Koledža and RTRIT. On part-time, she was also a photographer and owner of a small business that organizes events. Sometime around 2019, a friend told her about Accenture Bootcamp and the possibility to get into the IT world. After the She Goes Tech program, a DevOps Bootcamp, 3 months of internship, and hard work for about a year, Jelena finally recognizes herself as the DevOps unicorn. She has a story to tell!'
