title: '"Kernel hacking like it''s 2020" - Russell Currey (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579132528
description: "Russell Currey\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/145/\n\nThe Linux kernel has been around of a long time, and most of the tools that were used in its early development are the same ones most developers are using today.  After all, it's pretty simple - you need a text editor and a compiler, an email client to send your changes, and git might be helpful too.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, other projects seem to have all these nice things, like:\r\n \r\n - modern editors *gasp*\r\n - type-checked code completions\r\n - linters built-in to their editors\r\n - easy to use interactive debuggers\r\n - a giant matrix of configurations and platforms tested on each commit automatically\r\n - many different kinds of test suites\r\n\r\nIn this session I'll show you that the kernel hasn't been left that far behind, and there's lots of awesome tools out there to make working on the kernel easier - whether they're the new hotness or an oft-forgotten gem.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
