title: 'YOW! Connected 2016 Perryn Fowler - Microservices and IoT: A Perfect Match.'
recordingDate: 1485479406
description: "Microservices always sound nice and neat, but it can be all too easy to end up building what amounts to a distributed monolith instead. Luckily streaming data (such as that from IoT devices) lends itself well to a style of architecture that realises the benefits of microservices, while avoiding many of the difficulties and pitfalls. In this talk I will describe such an architecture developed at Urbanise using Amazon Kinesis and idempotent, horizontally scalable, fault tolerant, microservices for processing of sensor data.\n\nPerryn is a hands-on software architect with a passion for simple design and pragmatic process that enables effective and efficient delivery of world class software solutions. His extensive experience as a software consultant means he can say things like that with a straight face. He is a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls or crushing ice, and is the subject of numerous documentaries. He is an expert in stucco, a veteran in love and an outlaw in Peru. Perryn washes whiter. He can cook 2 minute noodles in one and a half minutes, and may already be the winner in the Publisherâ€™s Clearing House Sweepstakes. He enjoys writing speaker bios in the third person.\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
