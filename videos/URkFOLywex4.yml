description: "You can program higher-order functions in Groovy quite easily by using closures, but the benefits of closures go far beyond that. Groovy has a variety of capabilities hidden in closures. This presentation unlocks that treasure and explores ways in which we can design applications by using Groovy closures to apply different design patterns, to create fluent interfaces, and even to program asynchrony.\n\n\nAuthor:\nVenkat Subramaniam\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., and an instructional professor at the University of Houston.\n\nHe has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences.
