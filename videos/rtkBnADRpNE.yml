description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nGitOps+Jenkins-CI With Declarative Everything - Kingdon Barrett, Weaveworks\n\nFlux is the incubating CNCF tool that ushered GitOps on to the scene, and Jenkins is the OG build machinery name-to-know for large enterprises. Learn to deploy Jenkins declaratively with Flux's Helm Controller, how to build an app repo with Jenkins for deployment with Flux, how to test a Helm chart with Helm Test through Flux's Flagger, and how to deploy new releases automatically with Flux’s Image Automation Controller and Helm controller. Declarative delivery with Helm and Kustomize does not require Jenkins to have direct access to the cluster; Flux runs as an agent inside a cluster and uses a pull-based model for delivery of apps, treating the git repository as a single source of truth. Configuration as code runs under the hood of an all-declarative Jenkins infrastructure from end to end, a declarative Jenkinsfile, pipeline for branches and PRs to build and push images. Flux is first configured to pull new image builds into a cluster, then Porter modernizes our image build process!"
