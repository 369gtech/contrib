description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHow to put a Database in Kubernetes - Jeffrey Carpenter, DataStax\n\nThe idea of running a stateful workload in Kubernetes can be intimidating, especially if you haven’t done it before. How do you deploy a database? Where is the actual storage? How is the storage mapped to the database or application that uses it? In this talk, we’ll demystify the deployment of databases and stateful workloads in K8s by showing that databases are just applications composed of compute, network and storage. We can deploy them like any other Kubernetes application and take advantage of resources that K8s provides including Storage Classes, Persistent Volumes, Persistent Volume Claims, and Stateful Sets. We will demonstrate how to make it all work by deploying a relational database (MySQL) and a NoSQL database (Apache Cassandra)."
