title: 'API team characteristics and best practices - Nahid Farrokhi'
recordingDate: 1572604401
description: "After years of designing and developing APIs, I realized the value of API teams as a key component to build and manage APIs.\nWhat do API teams do? In “API-as-a-Product”(AaaP) approach, API teams maintain close communication with product customers and developers using their product while they create an API program.\n\nThis enables API teams to design API based on customers needs. API program will eventually become a strong product that will survive longer in a world with ever-changing innovations and fierce competition.\nConsidering structural differences in organizations, I will focus to discuss the main characteristics and best practices based on scope of responsibilities for each role.\nI will also demonstrate examples of output artifacts created by each member of API teams in the API program.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
