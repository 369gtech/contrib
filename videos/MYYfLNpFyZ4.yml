description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nBUILDING AN IDE, COMPILER AND RUNTIME FOR A GRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTED DATA FLOW LANGUAGE IN ERLANG\nby Peer Stritzinger and Barbara Chassoul\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nIoT, PLC, IDE\n\nABSTRACT\nControl systems have their own programming languages and paradigms. Progammable Logo Controllers (PLCs) are used to control everything from a garage door opener to a whole factory. We have built a compiler for a distributed variant of PLC programming language (IEC 61499) that compiles to BEAM files which run in Erlang VMs. As a web frontend to an Erlang node we built an IDE for the textual and graphical representation. PLC programme run distributed from small embedded systems to the cloud unchanged.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/peer-stritzinger/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - PEER STRITZINGER\nReal bare metal Erlang with GRiSP, Board member Erlang Ecosystem Foundation\n\nPeer ported Erlang to Hard-Realtime Operating system RTEMS (www.grisp.org). He developed the Hydraprog automotive control unit flashing device, which has been used successfully all over the world for over a decade. Since 2007 the firmware of the device is written mainly in Erlang - including protocol stacks for all existing automotive protocols. He currently serves as Board member in the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (www.erlef.org). \n\nPeer's previous experience ranges from low level device drivers to functional languages in industrial and automotive applications, he initially mastered in physics at the Technical University Munich. He has been working self-employed as a developer since 1987 and also consulted in applied cryptography and protocol design and implementation. He is currently living and working in the idyllic countryside west of Munich, Bavaria.\n\nMore on Peer Stritzinger: https://codesync.global/speaker/peer-stritzinger/\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BARBARA CHASSOUL\nSoftware Engineer at Peer Stritzinger GmbH\n\nAs a former physicist Barbara found her way into coding a few years ago, she is always having fun learning new things. Focused on dynamic languages, she has worked with Erlang, Luerl and JavaScript.\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
