title: 'Machine Learning for Self-Driving Cars: Behavioral Cloning - Marcus Ulmefors'
recordingDate: 1505131004
description: "What are Convolutional Neural Networks and why are they popular in Deep Learning image recognition applications? We will compare modern Neural Networks to \"classic\" Machine Learning methods and thereby understand Behavioral Cloning. We will use Behavorial Cloning to teach a car to drive itself by copying human driver behavior. Don't worry, we'll drive in a simulator. Safety first! \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
