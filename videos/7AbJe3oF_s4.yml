language: English
recordingDate: 1632327282
description: "One of the most common frustrations you’ll hear from Agile teams is that stakeholders always want too much, too soon, for too little. Why? The Magic Box problem is often the culprit. Your software org is in that box, and helping stakeholders see inside greatly contributes to smoother interactions between the business and your org. In this session we’ll discuss how we got into the box, effective ways to make the box less ‘magic’, and develop business-friendly transparency into how your teams actually work to deliver value.\n\nDaniel Witenberg, Senior Product Manager at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/the-magic-box-problem-and-how-to-get-out-of-it"
