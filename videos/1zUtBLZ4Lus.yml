description: "DOES18 Las Vegas — Why is it that some DevOps transformations stall while others continue to flourish?\n\nThis talk will make the case that Operations is the most predictable differentiator. So much of the energy of the DevOps movement has gone into activities that start in Dev and move towards Ops—agile practices, automated deployment pipelines, automated testing, and of course, the unofficial mantra of “deploy, deploy, deploy.“\n\nHowever, when it comes to Operations, too many DevOps transformations have stuck with the status quo and left problematic Operations practices in place. By not fully engaging with and transforming Operations, companies are preventing themselves from realizing the full potential of their DevOps investments. This gap is the last mile problem of DevOps.\n\nThis talk will first examine the trouble with the various siloed, ticket-driven, low trust, and centralized practices that have been accepted as status quo in Operations for far too long. Then we will look at the specific techniques being used by high-performing Operations organizations who are fundamentally transforming how they operate.\n\nOperations: The Last Mile\n\nDamon Edwards, Co-founder and Chief Product Officer, Rundeck\n\nDamon Edwards is a Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer of Rundeck, Inc., the makers of Rundeck, the popular open source operations management platform.
