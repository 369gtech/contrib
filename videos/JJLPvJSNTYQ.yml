title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Career Hacking Village  - Mike Murray  - Building Teams is the New Normal'
language: English
recordingDate: 1596874766
description: '2020 has created massive change across our industry, both from the perspective of COVID-19 as well as the social movements that have changed the way we view ourselves. Nowhere has this affected the industry more than the experience by which we onboard employees - as an example, before 2020, even most remote employees had in person interviews in the process. In short, the "new normal" that is evolving requires us to hire and interview differently. From where and how we find (especially diverse) candidates, our interview processes and the way we onboard employees in to our culture, everything requires a thoughtful new approach. In this talk, Mike will talk about everything he has learned and how he has modified his own processes to promote diversity, find the best people to join the team, and brought them aboard as part of the culture.'
