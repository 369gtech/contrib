description: "Video with transcript included: http://bit.ly/2QvBuaj\n\nJustin Ryan talks about Netflix’ scalability issues and some of the ways they addressed it. He shares successes they’ve had from unintuitively partitioning computation into multiple services to get better runtime characteristics. He introduces us to useful probabilistic data structures, innovative bi-directional data passing, open-source projects available from Netflix that make this all possible.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon San Francisco 2019: http://bit.ly/38sivWf\n\nThe next QCon is QCon London 2020 – March 2-4, 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq\n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQ’s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#Scalability #Performance #ProjectManagement"
