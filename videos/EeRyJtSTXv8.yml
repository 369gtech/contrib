description: "RubyConf 2018 - The Developer's Toolkit: Everything We Use But Ruby by Noel Rappin\n\nAs developers, our work is mediated through many tools besides languages. We use terminals, browsers, git, and the os. Not to mention editors. These are powerful tools that can be infinitely customized and extended. The tools can make common tasks easier or less error prone to perform. Or they can give you visibility into system behavior. But the options are bewildering and each customization has a cost. It’s time to make your environment work for you. This isn’t just a list of tips and tricks, but will also suggest how to evaluate whether a power tool or shortcut is worth your time."
