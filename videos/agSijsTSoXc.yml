description: 'The implementation of agile methods can differ per organizations and teams; however patterns of agility are universal. The success of agile adoption process is not hidden in methodology itself, but it should correspond with inside company culture. That''s something which part of the agile community already forgot and most of the companies never really understood. There is no cookbook how to adopt agile methods, but indeed there are some better and easier ways how to get there. And there are some, which you should better avoid.'
