description: "DOES18 Las Vegas â€” DXC's White Belt DevOps Dojo is DevOps 101 for 100,000 technologists in our company. That's 100,000 technologists issuing their first GitHub pull request, creating their first Jenkins pipeline, and writing their first Ansible playbook. In this talk, we will share the content, and how we built it to be delivered.\n\nGetting 100,000 Employees to DevOps - DXC Technologies\n\nOlivier Jacques, Principal, DevOps transformation, DXC Technology\nJoan Watson, Dir. DevSecOps, DXC Technology\n\nOlivier is DevOps Principal at DXC technology, rolling out the DevOps culture and Continuous Delivery Pipeline practices across all the employees (100,000 technologists). He initiated DXC's DevOps dojos back in 2016, a balanced mix of training, hands-on coaching for teams to reach one goal: stop talking DevOps and start doing DevOps.
