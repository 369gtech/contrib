description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nLast year CBT, the new build tool for Scala, showed a simpler way to build Scala programs. But there were still a number of big open questions. Those have since been answered. We'll present elegant and simple solutions to task-scoping, dynamic configuration and multi-project builds. Finally we'll talk about the joined work with Scala Center to use CBT for bootstrapping Dotty and how we did it."
