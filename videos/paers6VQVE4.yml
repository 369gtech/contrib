description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\n\nThe rapid growth of mobile technology has ushered in an age where time and attention is an increasingly scarce resource. Instead of technology enhancing our abilities as humans, we’ve seen it become a vehicle for extracting our attention, monetizing our personal information, and exploiting our psychological vulnerabilities. Designers and developers play a key role in the creation of such technology, and it’s time we take responsibility for the impact that these products and services we build are having on people it should serve.\n\nIn this session we’ll explore some common extractive design patterns in addition to alternatives that focus on user well-being instead. These patterns will be framed through the lens of guiding principles to follow when designing ethically humane products and services.\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#Humane%20Design%20Patterns-Jon%20Yablonski"
