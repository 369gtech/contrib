Yet it is relevant today more than ever, because Microsoft has bet its entire modern WinRT API on it (starting with Windows 8/10). But, if you’re familiar with the “old” COM with its idioms and SDK helper classes, you’re in for a treat. With the advent of modern C++ 17, using COM objects and new Windows APIs in your applications feels like a completely new experience. \nIn this session, we’ll explore how using modern C++ features can radically transform the shape of your COM code. By eliminating a lot of boilerplate, your code will be much more readable and maintainable. Classic COM idioms around activation and QueryInterface() can feel totally different with modern C++ helpers. A beautiful example of modern COM usage is C++/WinRT (now part of Windows SDK). This is a standard C++ language projection for the new Windows Runtime API. \nCOM memory management, data marshalling, string handling can all feel quite mechanical in nature and very error prone, so a little help from modern C++ facilities would be more than welcomed. Error handling and debugging can be cumbersome for COM like APIs; we’ll explore some tricks to improve this experience, as well. \n— \nVictor Ciura, CAPHYON\nSoftware Developer\n\nVictor Ciura is a Senior Software Engineer at CAPHYON and Technical Lead on the Advanced Installer team (http://www.advancedinstaller.com). \nFor over a decade, he designed and implemented several core components and libraries of Advanced Installer.\nHe’s a regular guest at Computer Science Department of his Alma Mater, University of Craiova, where he gives student lectures & workshops on “Using C++STL for Competitive Programming and Software Development”. \nCurrently, he spends most of his time working with his talented team on improving and extending the repackaging and virtualization technologies in Advanced Installer IDE, helping clients migrate their Win32 desktop apps to the Windows Store (MSIX).\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
