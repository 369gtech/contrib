language: English
recordingDate: 1506670895
description: "The cornerstone of this presentation is SignalR, a library that facilitates bi-directional communication between the server and the browser over the WebSocket protocol. You will see the NServiceBus messaging framework integrating with SignalR over RabbitMQ.\n\nWhen the basic set-up is up and running, Marcin will venture into making the system scale to many server instances.\n\nFinally, you will learn about the concept of a backplane that forwards messages to all server instances so that a client connected to one instance can receive messages sent from another one. For dessert, Marcin will show you how to use Redis as a SignalR backplane.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl) \n13-15 September 2017"
