description: "Join us for our next conference: https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\nYou’ve been programming for a while now. You know your way around the code, and you’re becoming a go-to for technical advice. And it looks like someone else noticed, because you’re the technical lead on your next project. Congratulations! But now what? It’s a lot more than just coding: The technical lead can be responsible for designing software architecture, writing requirements, interfacing with clients or management, or dividing work amongst the team– and those are just the parts of the job they tell you about ahead of time.\n\nWe’ll talk about how to oversee the technological vision for the project without losing sight of what’s happening on the ground, how to motivate your team members without overstepping your bounds, and some tactics to deal with challenges you might not anticipate, but will almost certainly encounter.\n\nEryn O’Neil is a Minneapolis-based freelance PHP developer and tech lead. Grounded in the agency world, she has worked on everything from e-commerce and online promotions to a proprietary framework and CMS. Her philosophy is to build software by placing humans first: both the people who will use it and the developers who will build it with you (and maintain it afterward).\n\nLiving in Minnesota, Eryn spends most of her free time teaching blues dancing, flying on a trapeze, and wishing it weren’t snowing.\n\n---\n\nWhen you’re busy leading a team, coding and maintaining standards, how do you find the time to stay ahead of new technologies and develop yourself as a technical lead?\n\nThe Lead Developer conference features practical advice from experts on leading and motivating your team and high-level sessions on new and disruptive technologies.\n\nGet tickets at theleaddeveloper.com"
