title: '#bbuzz 17: Holden Karau - A Brief Tour of the Magic Behind Apache Spark'
recordingDate: 1497522452
description: "Further information: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/session/brief-tour-magic-behind-apache-spark\n\nApache Spark is one the most popular general purpose distributed systems in the past few years. Apache Spark has APIs in Scala, Java, Python and more recently a few different attempts to provide support for R, C#, and Julia.\n\nThis talk covers the core concepts of Apache Spark, but then switches gears into how the \"\"magic\"\" of Spark can have unintended consequences on your programs. You will gain a better understanding of impact of lazy evaluation, the shift away from arbitrary lambda expressions to \"\"statements\"\", and of course the \"\"dreaded\"\" shuffle (plus a few more concepts). Based on that the presenter will then shamelessly try and self-promote her own book (for one slide I promise :p) and then look at (free) resources for learning more about the magic behind Spark.\n\nSpeaker:\nHolden Karau"
