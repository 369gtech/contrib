When a build fails, it is vital to pinpoint the culprit changelist (CL)/changelists quickly, so that it can be fixed to get the build back to green.\nCulprit detection solutions exist for small and medium sized builds, but not for large integration builds.\n\nOur culprit finder targets finding the culprit CL for large builds automatically, in a very short time-frame with high success. Based on production usage on multiple projects in the last 9 months, culprit finder provides very promising results. Come see our talk to see how we implemented the culprit finder, how successful it is in production and what it feels and looks like."
