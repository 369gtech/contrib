description: "Using Kubernetes+CF Stack as a Part of Blockchain CI/CD Pipeline - Yauheni Kisialiou & Arsenii Petrovich, Altoros\n\nThis session explores how to deploy DApps to Cloud Foundry using the platform’s native role-based access model and cf push to automate the process of preparing images and containers. Attendees will learn how to use CI/CD instruments to ensure DApps versions are always the latest. In addition, we’ll show how to store the state for blockchain nodes using Kubernetes, as well as achieve stable and secure communication across DApps in Cloud Foundry and services in Kubernetes using kibosh.\n\nThe session will be essential for operators and the community around the blockchain technology, as well as anyone who runs heavy-load DApps in Ethereum-like networks.\n\nAbout Yauheni Kisialiou\nYauheni has previous experience of speaking at SpringOne 2018 in September together with Preter Blum from Pivotal.The topic of the speech was \"Credhub for Kubernetes Deployments.Now Yauheni is currently working on Tezos project.\n\nAbout Arsenii Petrovich\nArsenii currently is working on Colu, POA, Tezos projects.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
