Being able to monitor complex heterogeneous federated cloud environments is key.\n\nSkydive is a real-time and post-mortem topology and packet analyzer. To do so, it listens for networking kernel events, monitors network namespaces, watches external components such as OVSDB and Docker. Skydive can make use of AF_PACKET or eBPF programs to capture traffic. Thanks to its classifier Skydive is able to map the network traffic with the topology.\n\n\n\nSylvain Afchain"
