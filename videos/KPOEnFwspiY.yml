description: "Sponsored Keynote: Expanding the Kubernetes Operator Community - Rob Szumski, Principal Product Manager for OpenShift, Red Hat \n\nOperators enable you run those “tricky” stateful services and complex distributed systems on Kubernetes. Kubernetes Operators are embedded with all of the special knowledge for running an app, from the experts in the open source community, so that every end user doesn’t need to be one. Discover Operators ready to use on your cluster with OperatorHub.io and learn about the tools at your disposal to build, test and ship an Operator. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MRyx"
