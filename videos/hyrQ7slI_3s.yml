recordingDate: 1506430786
description: "Pages are dead - long live components.\n\nDo you recognise any of the following problems:\n\nDesigners design pages which then need to be broken up by frontend developers\nElements of a page are poorly named or misunderstood\nStatic HTML prototypes and style guides produced early in the project can't be easily ported into the backend CMS\nThe static prototype and real site begin to drift away from each other as the project goes on, there is no longer a clear representation of the frontend\nThe Drupal theme becomes complicated and confused.\nThe design has become lost in translation and walls of indirection have sprung up between design and development teams.\nThis talk describes a component based approach to web design and development.\nRather than having the designers design some key pages of a site, get them to design components instead. Breaking things down into small and easily identifiable pieces or 'componentisation' is a practice used by developers and designers alike to help them solve complex problems.\n\nWith a component based approach your development team can maintain a catalogue of templates independent of the backend CMS.\n\nWhen the backend work starts, these components will then be integrated into Drupal. This talk will describe a method for doing this which does not cause complex themes or copying pieces of template code out of the frontend prototypes.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\nThe general approach to component based development\nA method for developing components independent of the backend system which will be used\nHow to integrate the components with Drupal 8\nAn overview of the advantages of this approach"
