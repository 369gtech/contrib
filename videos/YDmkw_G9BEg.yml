title: 'Graham Knop - "Continuous Integration for CPAN"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498020382
description: 'Continuous integration helps you catch issues in your modules across a more diverse set of configurations than is easy to check manually. Travis-CI and AppVeyor are free CI solutions for open source projects that will allow automatic testing on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Extra tools exist for easy testing with more configurations than Travis-CI has built in support for.'
