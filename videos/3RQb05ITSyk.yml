language: English
recordingDate: 1628185141
description: "The past two years have seen the rise of Golang-based malware from its beginnings as a way to win at CCDC and red team engagements to its current use by actual threat actors. This talk will break down why Golang is so useful for malware with a detailed tour through the available components used for exploitation, EDR and NIDS evasion, and post-exploitation, by one of the main authors of the core components. Although focused on the offensive perspective, there will be valuable insights into the challenges in detecting Golang malware. Interested in learning Golang? Interested in writing or detecting malware? This is your invitation into the weird and wonderful world of Golang malware.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nList of Golang Security Tools:\nhttps://github.com/Binject/awesome-go-security\n\nC-Sto:\nhttps://github.com/c-sto/goWMIExec\nhttps://github.com/C-Sto/BananaPhone\nhttps://github.com/C-Sto/gosecretsdump\n\ncapnspacehook:\nhttps://github.com/capnspacehook/pandorasbox\nhttps://github.com/capnspacehook/taskmaster\n\nVyrus / gscript crew:\nhttps://github.com/gen0cide/gscript\nhttps://github.com/vyrus001/go-mimikatz\nhttps://github.com/vyrus001/msflib\n\nsecretsquirrel / Josh Pitts:\nhttps://github.com/secretsquirrel/the-backdoor-factory\nhttps://github.com/Genetic-Malware/Ebowla\nhttps://github.com/secretsquirrel/SigThief\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/16292\n\nmalwareunicorn on OSX loading:\nhttps://malwareunicorn.org/workshops/macos_dylib_injection.html\n\nMisc:\nhttps://github.com/sassoftware/relic\nhttps://github.com/EgeBalci/sgn\nhttps://github.com/moonD4rk/HackBrowserData\nhttps://github.com/emperorcow/go-netscan\nhttps://github.com/CUCyber/ja3transport\nhttps://github.com/swarley7/padoracle\n\nCommand and Control:\nhttps://github.com/BishopFox/sliver\nhttps://github.com/DeimosC2/DeimosC2\nhttps://github.com/t94j0/satellite\n\nObfuscation/RE:\nhttps://github.com/unixpickle/gobfuscate\nhttps://github.com/mvdan/garble\nhttps://github.com/goretk/redress\n\nOf interest for defense, but breaks Docker & Terraform:\nhttps://github.com/unsecureio/gokiller"
