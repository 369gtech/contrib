title: 'YOW! Connected 2017 Luke Sleeman / Marc Edwards - Build Better Android Apps with Vector Assets'
recordingDate: 1510441202
description: "There are many advantages to using vector-based assets in your Android apps â€” smaller binary size, faster loading, easier support for all pixel densities, dynamic drawing, and more ways to animate. Despite the upsides, SVGs and VectorDrawable assets are more complex to author and use.\nLuke and Marc explore everything needed to create, export, and implement SVGs and VectorDrawables on Android, including common issues and their remedies.\n\nLuke is a freelance Android developer, based in Melbourne Australia.  Luke has developed great apps for digital agencies, tiny startups, global brands and everything in between.  He also regularly speaks on Android and Mobile development.\n\nMarc Edwards is director and lead designer at Bjango where he's working on the next-generation interface design tools like Skala, the famed iStat Menus and iStat for iOS, and much, much, more. A musician and broadcaster, Edwards also hosted the design-centric Iterate show, regularly speaks at conferences and writes on Photoshop and other topics at the Bjango blog.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
