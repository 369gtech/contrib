description: "It seems as if the whole world of software development is jumping on the bandwagon to move to a microservices architecture. There are a lot of good aspects to architecting a system in this fashion, but what about the downsides? Are microservices a silver bullet and will they solve all our problems?\n\nRachel and Cassie will present a debate in which they take opposing sides on whether to implement services in a “micro” fashion. In a knockdown style, our discussion will feature the zings and gotchas to each side of the argument. The debate will ultimately leave attendees with a better understanding of the things to consider and practices to follow to decide whether or not microservices are the best approach for them."
