title: 'When your Twin is Digital. And in 3D - Petri Wilhelmsen'
recordingDate: 1535549352
description: "The concept of Digital Twins has been around for many years; often used to virtually simulate the dynamics and elements of real world systems and industrial assets, or to digitally visualize real-time data on these objects. Due to its complexity and demanding computational power it has not been possible to leverage these effectively until recently. With modern technologies such as advanced 3D graphics, HoloLens, mixed reality, virtual reality, and even augmented reality on smart phones, it's now possible to view and inspect these virtual replicas in a completely new ways.\nIn this session we will take a look at some examples of digital twins and how you can interact with them. We will also take a look at how you can render and develop these yourself using Unity3D and the how well the reactive event-driven approach of the open source line-of-business Dolittle platform fits in here.\n\nThis session is aimed for those interested in Digital Twins in general, and to those who wish to get an introduction to how these can be developed.\n\nExpect it to be demo and fun heavy!"
