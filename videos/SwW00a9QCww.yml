language: Dutch
recordingDate: 1506326619
description: "Making apps for people with a disability with Xamarin tells you about making apps for people with an intellectual disability. Former, people thought people with an intellectual disability cannot read, thus a smartphone isn’t really realistic for them. But nonprofits and startups started to explore this userbase and found out a way of apps people with an intellectual disability can use.\n\nWhy is this important? Well there are two big reasons: first of all: If people with an intellectual disability can use your app, they can get info about their life-situation and that empowers quality of life. Smartphones by example uses Text-To-Speech and principal the need to “can read” isn’t there anymore.\nFor you as developer or startup there’s also a big benefit of apps for these people: nearly every market is discovered for mobile apps. Every market has big concurrency. But the market of apps for people with a disability is quite less discovered, so if you are good, you can rule a hole market!"
