description: "Promises are an important abstraction for dealing with asynchronicity and uncertainty in JavaScript.

The talk will consider advantages of promises-based architecture over the use of callbacks and publish-subscribe approaches.\n\nYuri Takhteyev\nCTO, rangle.io\nhttps://twitter.com/qaramazov\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
