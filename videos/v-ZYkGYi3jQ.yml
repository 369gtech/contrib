The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nLightning Talk - Connecting and Migrating Heterogeneous Applications with Consul Service Mesh - Luke Kysow, HashiCorp \n\nWithout question, systems are moving to a highly decoupled distributed approach running on modern schedulers like Kubernetes. There are two challenges which practitioners are often faced with while on this journey. How do you migrate legacy applications safely and without interruption to the new world? Once you have migrated, how do you ensure the connectivity and security of applications, potentially running in multiple Kubernetes clusters?\nThis talk takes a demo driven approach to how the service mesh can solve both of these problems. You will learn how Consul Service Mesh can help to seamlessly and safely migrate an application from Virtual Machines to Kubernetes. Also, how Consul Service Mesh can help connect and secure heterogeneous applications running in multiple Kubernetes clusters."
