description: "Get the Code: http://www.newthinktank.com/2013/01/code-refactoring-4/\n\nI wanted to cover in this video a bunch of questions I've received lately. Everything after this code refactoring tutorial will be more complex.\n\nIn this video, we'll cover converting simple types into class objects. We'll also look at how to move fields and methods into other classes and a bunch of tricks to get the most out of that. I also show a few of the many ways Eclipse can help you write code quicker. More tips on Eclipse are planned later in the tutorial."
