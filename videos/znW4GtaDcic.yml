description: "I have spent the past year and a half building an evidence-based engine intended to help oncologists treat cancer patients, more effectively. Our application leverages the exciting boom in Next Generation sequencing technologies to allow treatment choices to take into account the patientâ€™s genetic makeup. As a developer, this project has afforded me a unique insight into the commercialization of Genomics, Bioinformatics and Oncology. We became particularly privy to the challenges that exist in going from research to industry in these fields. We were forced to innovate to overcome the hurdles we encountered, but in the end, we successfully deployed a version of the engine for Clearity Foundation to scale treatment for Ovarian Cancer patients. I look forward to sharing some of the considerable learning I did from my work within such a rapidly changing and critical field. Especially around our creative use of technologies like Clojure, Neo4J and others.\n\nMridula Jayaraman\nThoughtworks Inc.\n@MridsJayaraman\n\n\nMridula Jayaraman is a Consultant Developer at ThoughtWorks Inc. She has been with them for 3 years. During her career at the company, she has worked with many industries ranging from Retail, Airlines and Medical Technologies. Before ThoughtWorks, she completed her Masters in Bioinformatics from the University of Michigan Medical School. The Ovarian Cancer Project4 has allowed her to leverage her educational background in helping the development team successfully build an application for Clearity Foundation. Mridula is passionate about open source technology. Development teams often build small tools and utility suites to help them on projects. She feels they should be diligent in open sourcing these tools when possible. This can aid and prevent scores of others from reinventing the wheel. \n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop conference (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Oct 2013."
