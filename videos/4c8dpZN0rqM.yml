description: "Talk recording from JSNation Live 2020, the biggest JavaScript conference in the cloud: https://live.jsnation.com \n\n# Say No To Complexity With AlpineJS\n\nModern JavaScript is powerful, but big frameworks like Vue or React add an overwhelming amount of complexity to a developers' workflow. That’s why I wrote AlpineJS. It’s less than 10kb, requires no build process, takes almost no time to learn, yet gives you the declarative templating and reactivity you can’t live without. I can’t wait to show it to you."
