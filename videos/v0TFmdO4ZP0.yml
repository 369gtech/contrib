description: "Slides: http://afabbro.github.io/jsconf2013/\n\nI am not an expert developer. I am also not a beginning developer.\n\nI'm an intermediate developer, and I want to navigate the path from being a mediocre or good developer, to becoming a great or expert level developer.\n\nHow in the heck do I do this?\n\nThe tutorial ecosystem of the web is heavily skewed towards beginners, but what about the rest of us?\n\nIf you identify with these statements in the slightest, then this talk is for you. With ideas from cognitive science, education, and some advice from admired programmers along the way, we are going to explore what it means to be a world-class developer and what we need to do to get there. I'll talk a little bit about the philosophy, attitude, and habits (both good and bad) required for learning how to learn better, and then we will talk about the kinds of skills and knowledge that an expert programmer in general needs. Along the way we'll touch about various myths and cognitive biases about who can and cannot be a great programmer, and leave you with a path to get started. By the end of the talk, I will have proposed a curriculum of topics that should take an intermediate developer and turn them into an advanced one, and special attention will be given to mastery of the JavaScript language.\n\nMeet Angelina\nAngelina Fabbro is a programmer based in Vancouver, Canada and works at Steamclock Software. Angelina has a background in cognitive science, building clever robots and researching what people pay attention to. Her record as a web developer is balanced with modern iOS experience and a keen sense of design. Angelina also both teaches and mentors for the Vancouver chapter of Ladies Learning Code."
