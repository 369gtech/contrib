description: "“JavaScript is a toy language because it doesn’t support multithreading.” Heard that one before? Although the event loop means our program does one thing at a time, JavaScript is actually well-suited for a plethora of concurrency problems while avoiding typical multithreading woes. You might say JavaScript is single-threaded… just so it can be multithreaded!\n\nUsing functional programming techniques with Async IIFEs, Web Worker clusters and SharedArrayBuffers, you can elegantly architecture highly concurrent multicore web apps and backends… without spaghetti.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/jonathan-martin/"
