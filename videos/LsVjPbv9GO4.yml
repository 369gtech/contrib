description: "Agile methodologies have had us moving away from Big Up-Front Design to evolutionary, emergent design. But how does that work in the real world? Using experiences gained when creating the new Java driver for MongoDB, this session's speaker takes you on a design journey on which the answer to every question is,  It depends,  the users of the system and their use cases are unknown, and lurking at the back of every decision is the question  But will it be backward-compatible?  Weâ€™ve all been there, trying to work out how to implement requirements, but have we really thought about the process of design? \n\n\n\nAuthor:\nTrisha Gee\nTrisha is a developer at MongoDB Inc.  She has expertise in Java Concurrency and agile processes, and mostly loves talking at people about technical stuff with a smattering of fluffy-people-stuff.  Trisha is heavily involved in the London Java Community and the Graduate Development Community, she believes we shouldn't all have to make the same mistakes again and again.\nView more trainings by Trisha Gee at https://www.parleys.com/author/trisha-gee\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
