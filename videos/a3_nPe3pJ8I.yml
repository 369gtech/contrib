description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nOwned by Statistics: Using Kubeflow to Defend vs Attacks on Your ML Models - David Aronchick, Microsoft \n\nMachine learning continues its spread across the tech world and is now in use by more than 80% of enterprises world wide. However, with the increased reliance on this technology, the spectre of additional security attack surface areas rises up. Machine learning attacks are a new area of opportunity for adversaries, and require a new way to approach defense. In this talk, we will cover several of the most common ML attacks today and how to defend against them. We will also show how to use a sophisticated, cloud-native pipeline with Kubeflow will to enable organizations to detect, remediate and defend against future attacks. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekBz"
