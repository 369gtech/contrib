title: 'GoWayFest 2017 - Ivan Danyliuk - Visualizing Concurrency in Go'
recordingDate: 1503407065
description: "One of the primary strengths of Go programming language is a built-in first-class support for concurrency. Go is designed with concurrency in mind, backed by solid mathematical theory, and has incredibly good tooling for testing and developing concurrent software.\nI offer a completely new approach to understanding and representing concurrency by visualizing it in 3D space. This new approach allows you to see what’s happening inside the real code—from a simple “Hello, World” to real production-level high-loaded servers. It leverages the power of open source technologies, such as Go and WebGL, to help you understand the complex but astonishing world of modern concurrent software."
