description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nApp Testing at Scale: How Bitnami Tests Thousands of Releases Per Month - Juan Jose Martos Castro, VMware \n\nBitnami publishes a collection of over 180 open source applications and components on over twenty platforms, resulting in thousands of unique image builds and releases every month. Every single one of those releases is automatically tested in the environment in which it will be deployed by users, before being pushed to its destination. In this session, we will show you how we automate thousands of tests across multiple platforms including public clouds, vSphere, containers and Kubernetes, and even Windows installers. Using the popular open source blog application WordPress as an example, we will demonstrate how we accomplish this scale of testing and how you can apply what we have learned to your own testing best practices. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekB4"
