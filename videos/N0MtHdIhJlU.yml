description: "The Python language has grown dramatically in popularity and use over the past decade. With this growth has come both a greater focus on testing as well as a significant increase in the sophistication of the testing tools available for Python.\nIn this talk we’ll take a tour of some of the testing technologies that Python developers can bring to bear on their projects, covering not just fundamental packages like `unittest` and `pytest` but also tools for more exotic techniques like mutation and property-based testing. People new to Python testing will learn how to start and see what’s possible, while experienced Python testers stand to learn a new set of tricks."
