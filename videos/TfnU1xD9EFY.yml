title: 'Webinar: Building Zero Trust based Authentication in Healthcare with SPIRE'
language: English
recordingDate: 1588192453
description: "Traditional zone-based security approaches that worked well in the data center for the past 30 years struggle with elastically-scaled and dynamically-scheduled platforms like Kubernetes.\n\n\nThe Zero Trust security model, which requires internal systems and services to communicate with each other as if they were potentially compromised, needs to become the new normal. In this webinar, experts from Anthem, Doc.ai, and HPE discuss the unique requirements of a typical healthcare organization for implementing a Zero Trust based security model.\n\n\nPresenters share how to use CNCFâ€™s SPIFFE and SPIRE projects along with other Cloud Native technologies such as Network Service Mesh (NSM) to build a solid foundation for operating Zero Trust security models.\n\n\nAttendees will learn more about the architecture and design tradeoffs, core capabilities, and a broad range of use cases around Zero Trust along with the ecosystem that is emerging around them. Each speaker represents a different stakeholder and shares their unique perspectives and priorities about the technologies. \n\n\nPresenters:\nBobby Samuel, Staff VP, AI Engineering @Anthem Inc\nFrederick F. Kautz IV, Head Edge Infrastructure @Doc.ai\nEmiliano Berenbaum, Chief Technologist @HPE \nMadhukesh Wali, Software Engineer @HPE."
