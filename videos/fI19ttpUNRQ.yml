description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nC++20 has a large number of new library features. This survey course provides students with a broad overview of the changes and new facilities in the C++20 standard library. Ranges are briefly discussed, but the focus is on the myriad of other standard library changes targeted at C++20. Fast paced, and chock full of example codes, this tutorial will focus on practical application of the new c++20 standard library facilities.\n\nThese include expanded chrono support, string output formatting, span, associative container enhancements, uniform container erasure, threading and atomics support, bit manipulation facilities, iostream updates, and various math utilities.\_ Note that due to time constraints some of these topics will be covered very briefly, but with pointers in the slides for futher study.\n\nThe tutorial is up to date with the latest working draft following the Cologne meeting and will include pointers to current implementations as well as the state of compiler support.\n— \nJeff Garland has worked on many large-scale, distributed software projects over the past 25+ years. The systems span many different domains including telephone switching, industrial process control, satellite ground control, ip-based communications, and financial systems. He has written C++ networked code for several large systems including the development high performance network servers and data distribution frameworks.Mr. Garland’s interest in Boost started in 2000 as a user. Since then he has developed Boost.date_time, become a moderator, served as a review manager for several libraries (including asio and serialization), administered the Boost wiki, and served as a mentor for Google Summer of Code. Mr. Garland holds a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University and a Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering from the University of Arizona. He is co-author of Large Scale Software Architecture: A Practical Guide Using UML. He is currently Principal Consultant for his own company: CrystalClear Software, Inc.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
