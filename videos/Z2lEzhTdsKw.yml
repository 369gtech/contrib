description: "Moderator Ken Finnigan is joined by special guests for this panel session delving into Eclipse MicroProfile.\n\nEclipse MicroProfile is bridging the gap between Enterprise Java and Microservices, fostered through open collaboration of the Enterprise Java community. Though still being in its infancy, great strides have been taken already with many more to follow.\n\nThe panel will briefly cover what has been achieved in the first year since inception, and also cover upcoming releases and proposals being worked on in the community. Most of the BOF will be our panel answering questions from you, the community, about where Eclipse MicroProfile is heading and general discussion of ideas that the community considers important for Eclipse MicroProfile.\n\nKen Finnigan is a Principal Software Engineer for Red Hat Middleware and has been a consultant and software engineer for 20 years with enterprises throughout the world. Ken and Bob McWhirter lead the WildFly Swarm project, which aims to bring together the worlds of microservices and Java EE. Ken has previously served as the project lead for LiveOak, along with other JBoss projects. Ken has written two books, including \"JBoss Weld CDI for Java Platform\", and is currently writing a book on Enterprise Java Microservices for Manning.\n\nMark Little leads the technical direction, research, and development for Red Hat JBoss Middleware.
