description: "In the age of spinning up instances on the fly, reliability often becomes overlooked. At one point you need a monitoring system for your servers and services. Most of us don’t see the benefits before it’s too late. At that point we are probably crying somewhere and trying to fetch backups that someone setup a long time ago and never looked at again.\n\nMonitoring is a must in every production running system. This talk will go through the process of choosing and implementing various monitoring services, with comparisons between them on each step of the way. Having more than 100 projects, 30 servers and _insert_large_number_here_ external services, we need to add and monitor these services quickly and painlessly.\n\nLet's see what can be achieved with smart monitoring tools so you never loose sleep again!\n\nFilip is a DevOps engineer at Infinum, a software agency based in Croatia.\n\nWith passion for both web development and system administration, he found himself supporting and scaling servers on an infrastructure holding more than 100 web applications.\n\nHe is a strong advocate of doing things right and doing the right things while constantly improving."
