title: 'Justin Schneck - Functional IoT with Elixir and Nerves'
recordingDate: 1557970658
description: 'Nerves defines an entirely new way to build embedded systems using Elixir. Rather than depending on the traditional plethora of Linux init scripts or systemd configuration files, the Nerves philosophy is that you already have a powerful, concurrent language to define what the system should do at startup time: Elixir. Nerves boots directly to the BEAM VM, giving your Elixir app control of the entire system, just a few seconds after boot. This talk demonstrates several principals of programming embedded devices like Raspberry Pi using Elixir and how Nerves can revolutionize the industry by leveraging the battle tested Erlang VM. Hardware is a physical extension of our software and our senses. Creating devices and systems which enhance our environment is fundamental to our nature. Join us for an exciting demonstration into the creation of enhanced embedded systems using Elixir and Nerves. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf3'
