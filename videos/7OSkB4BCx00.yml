This session will present to the listeners a range of concrete methods and techniques applicable in different phases of a design process, to handle specific challenges. This will include design patterns, personas, wire framing, paper prototype testing, progressive disclosure, card sorting and creative workshops and many of the methods and techniques will be accompanied by examples.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
