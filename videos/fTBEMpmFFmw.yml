description: "So you wrote a nice new clojure library and are about to release it as open source to the public? What could go wrong? I learned some lessons the hard way and will show what mistakes I made designing the API of the library, what I learned and which part macros played in that game.\n\nAbout the speaker: Self-Employed web developer since the beginning of the web. Migrated from Java/J2EE to clojure in 2012 and not regretted it once. Author of liberator. Father of Four."
