title: 'Embracing Security - A Changing DevOps Landscape by Stefanie Chaplin'

description: "Todays pace of innovation and need to out innovate competitors can often cause developers to bypass key portions of Gene Kims Three Ways of DevOps - specifically to never pass a known defect downstream and emphasise performance of the entire system.\n\nAs we embrace movements like CI, CD and Devops to cut down on release cycles - and innovate faster, we as developers must also embrace the reality that the risk landscape is too complex to leave security to just those with security in their title. Traditional methods do not cut it anymore  its time for DevSecOps.\n\nAttendees of this session will walk away with a walkthrough of how security principles have been embedded in a CICD pipeline and what standards for implementation are beginning to follow suite."
