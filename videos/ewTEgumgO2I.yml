Azure Pipelines combines continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to consistently test and build your code and ship it to any target.\n\nIn part 4 of our DevOps For ASP.NET Developers series, Abel and Jeremy show us how to get started with creating a build definition using Azure Pipelines. We will learn how to customize a pipeline for our project using tasks from the marketplace, edit the YAML build definition, and also use Yo Team to scaffold a pipeline for a project.\n\n\n[01:40] - Creating a build pipeline from scratch \n[03:04] - YAML versus the visual build editor\n[05:30] - Working with the visual editor\n[07:25] - Adding tasks to your build\n[08:55] - Selecting a build agent\n[11:56] - Viewing the YAML for the generated pipeline\n[12:56] - Adding build agents to the pipeline\n[13:44] - View the results of automated tests\n[17:14] - Scaffolding build pipelines with Yo Team\n\n\nAzure Pipelines - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/index?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=devops-channel9-cephilli\n\nAzure Pipelines extension for Visual Studio Code\nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azure-devops.azure-pipelines\n\nYo Team http://donovanbrown.com/\n\nYo Team on GitHub https://github.com/DarqueWarrior/generator-team\n\n\nStart with Azure DevOps for Free:\_http://dev.azure.com\nCreate a Free Azure Account:\_https://aka.ms/c9-azurefree"
