description: "From Outages to SLOs: Focusing on BOSH Performance - Marco Voelz, SAP SE\n\nThe advent of on-demand service brokers made your customers rely on BOSH for every 'cf create-service'. Therefore, the expectations to BOSH's performance and availability have increased almost as dramatically as the number of deployments it has to manage. \n\nTriggered by concrete issues in our production environment, the BOSH Europe team has been benchmarking, testing, and improving BOSH performance at scale over the last months. We're now moving more towards testing proactively for performance and will ideally end up at defining SLOs and an operator's guide.\n\nIn this talk, we tell you about the small and quick wins, the slow and painful ones, and what didn't work. Furthermore, how to improve YOUR BOSH's performance and how we're ensuring performance doesn't degrade with upcoming releases.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyV/from-outages-to-slos-focusing-on-bosh-performance-marco-voelz-sap-se"
