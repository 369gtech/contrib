language: English
recordingDate: 1449594410
description: "DevOps is short for “working together to do continuous delivery.” Too bad many are worried about the “together” part and like to say that DevOps is a “culture.” Really? A fast-paced project without stress or finger-pointing, tight but achievable deadlines, interesting technical challenges. This is not culture; it’s what we want as developers! Continuous delivery is the cool way to do it! Sometimes we need to be pirates in our projects. Scout ahead, jump through hoops, do what needs to be done. That’s what this presentation is about: real practical advice, examples, and tricks you can use today in your Java project to get your team into the same boat: DevOps. Don’t miss this session if you are serious about changing your Java project for the better.\n\nSpeakers:\nBruno Souza, Developer, ToolsCloud\nThe Brazilian JavaMan, the Guy with the Flag, Bruno Souza is a Java Developer and Open Source Evangelist at Summa Technologies, and a Cloud Expert at ToolsCloud.
