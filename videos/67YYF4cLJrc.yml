We make commitments to deliver pre-purchase verification predictions with very low latency.\n\nWhen we built the ML system powering the Identity Check Confidence Score we faced the following challenges:\n\nThe pipeline that trains our model had to digest a large amount of transaction data\nWe had to perform a large set of validation experiments to ensure each new release caused no disruptions for our customers\nAt the same time, the model had to perform in a real time, low latency environment\nIn this talk I discuss how we met these challenges by building a Spark- and XGBoost-based training and experimentation pipeline that delivers our models as a custom predictor library, to allow seamless integration with the production environment. Our embeddable library enables super-fast predictions real-time. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/channel/JUMjvCF2ucj"
