description: "Google Tech Talks\nAugust 22, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPhoto Technology Lecture 27: Focus on Resolution.\nWe investigate the digital image acquisition process for factors that adversely affect the quality of acquired imagery.\n\n# The physical properties of optical systems impose a fundamental limit to the resolution of captured imagery.\n\n# Real-world optics manifest several types of aberrations, and we show how these types of aberrations affect resolution.\n\n# Image acquisition devices are imperfect, and have aliasing and other sampling artifacts that affect resolution.\n\n# We derive the 70% rule for digital imagery, and verify it experimentally.\n\n# There is a distinction between resolution and..."
