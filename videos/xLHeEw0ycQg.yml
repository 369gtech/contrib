title: 'GeeCON 2018: X. Rene-Corail / I. Balosin - Building evolutionary architectures in agile environments'
recordingDate: 1532331016
description: "The era of big upfront design has passed, we living in a world with a high degree of volatility in software. A new term has recently coined out: evolutionary. During our session we will share guidelines and tactics in order to design and protect an evolutionary architecture in agile environment. Nowadays, the Architect role seems blurry in light of Agile environments, especially due to Agile Manifesto Principle #11 which states “best architectures […] emerge from self organizing teams”. On the other side, the business driver wants the product to be delivered in time, to be flexible, extensible, modifiable and easy maintainable. In regards to that blending Agile and Architecture in most of the projects is not an easy task, especially when the focus is towards delivering functionality and less on internal product quality. Our talk is supposed to cover below topics:\n\nWhat are the Agile Manifesto traps/missconceptions in lights of Architecture?\nAre Agile and Architecture real enemies or just friends? Do they share the same goal?\nGuidelines to create an Agile Architecture.\nHow can Agile Architectures be protected by time, to avoid degradation across its Architecturally Significant Requirements?\nWhat are the pitfalls and anti-patterns in creating Agile Architectures?\nBased on our experience (Xavier’s as Agile Catalyst at Murex and myself as Software Architect at Luxoft) we will cover all of above topics and provide attendees real life examples from our working environments about how to create agile (e.g. evolutionary) architectures in a successful manner."
