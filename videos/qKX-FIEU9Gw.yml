description: "Using VIM makes you question whether we have really made progress in the realm of software development tools. Some of the \"old\" concepts and ideas are really golden and when you've seen what we once had it's difficult not to ask whether the cost we've paid for the \"progress\" we've made was worth it or not. With strands such as microservices we may be returning back to small apps with confined responsibilities and in these days there is then much to learn from old but great software like VIM.\n\nIn this series we look at arguments as to why you should be using VIM or a similar text editor instead of some bulky monolithic IDE. \n\nGEAR USED\n► CAMERA: Canon 70D http://amzn.to/29wR8wG\n► LENS: Canon 18-55mm http://amzn.to/29vwIYV\n► TRIPOD: JOBY Gorillapod Zoom http://amzn.to/29AdkHT\n\nOriginal upload date:\nJul 10, 2016"
