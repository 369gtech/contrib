Use job stories that acknowledge causality and stop designing based on assumptions and imaginary attributes. Design in context by defining user motivation instead of outcomes. Look at how people currently solve problems or interact with products to create feature or UI solutions that have real meaning and empathy. Using cause and effect scenarios, this session will help you learn to write for events by defining motivation instead of implementation.\n\nAndrew Smyk\nEducator & UX Designer, Sheridan College\nhttps://twitter.com/andrewsmyk\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
