description: "Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, IoT, Geo-location, RFID, cloud, mobile, Big Data, blockchain ... the industry & community focuses on these and similar buzz-words with a lot of attention to algorithms, methods, inner-workings, frameworks, benchmarks, libraries. On many occasions, we overweigh the “how” (how things work internally) over “why” (why is this useful) and “what” (what do I do with it). Yet, the technology alone, which is the “how” part of the story, does not solve any problems or generate any value. Moreover, the technology – in many cases – it’s here and it’s ready for the prime time! So instead of digging deep into it, we should dig deeper in figuring out what we are going to use it for. \n\nIn my talk, I’m going to concentrate on real use cases. I’m going to touch topics that may seem super-advanced. Yet, integrating them into working products turned out to be relatively easy. I’ll cover three cases of RFID in smart fitting rooms, geo-location beacons in school buildings and machine learning in an internal, corporate social network – without soldering, gradients, tensors or custom printed circuit boards... But with a lot of fun!\n\nThe speech took place on 8th of May on Fullstack Stage during Infoshare 2019 in Gdansk, Poland.\n\n#Mobile #FullStack #SoftwareEngineering #Tech"
