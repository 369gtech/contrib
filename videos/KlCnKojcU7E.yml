recordingDate: 1513953111
description: "Netflix optimizes for speed of development and high availability. Our cloud native architecture has developers running what they wrote and deploying code continuously using tooling and and patterns that minimize the impact of any production issues, and provide rapid visibility and automated response to reduce exposure. The Netflix platform has been released as a collection of open source components at http://netflix.github.com so that others can embrace and extend it.\n\nAdrian Cockcroft has had a long career working at the leading edge of technology. He’s always been fascinated by what comes next, and he writes and speaks extensively on a range of subjects. At Battery, he advises the firm and its portfolio companies about technology issues and also assists with deal sourcing and due diligence.\n\nBefore joining Battery, Adrian helped lead Netflix’s migration to a large scale, highly available public-cloud architecture and the open sourcing of the cloud-native NetflixOSS platform. Prior to that at Netflix he managed a team working on personalization algorithms and service-oriented refactoring.\n\nAdrian was a founding member of eBay Research Labs, developing advanced mobile applications and even building his own homebrew phone, years before iPhone and Android launched. As a distinguished engineer at Sun Microsystems he wrote the best-selling “Sun Performance and Tuning” book and was chief architect for High Performance Technical Computing.\n\nHe graduated from The City University, London with a Bsc in Applied Physics and Electronics, and was named one of the top leaders in Cloud Computing in 2011 and 2012 by SearchCloudComputing magazine. He can usually be found on Twitter @adrianco.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
