description: "Custom Controllers to the Rescue: Tailoring API Objects to Your Needs - Stephen Chan & Davi Arnaut, Airbnb \n\nExternal controllers and admission controllers are a great way to extend Kubernetes and enforce cluster policies that are particular to your needs. In this talk, we’ll showcase how to use controllers backed by real examples used in production at Airbnb. We’ll show how controllers can help the scheduler spread a deployment’s pods across zones more evenly, enforce maximum pod age, and taint nodes based on conditions set by node-problem-detector. We’ll also show how we use admission controllers to enforce naming conventions and security constraints such as container image source on API objects submitted to a cluster. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrUC"
