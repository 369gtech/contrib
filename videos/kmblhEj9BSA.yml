description: "“Your code is bad and you are bad. Have a bad day.” Too many code reviews feel like this, and it saps the enthusiasm that drives open source. Instead, let’s explore how to give reviews that are truthful but encouraging, boosting the skill level of contributors and the quality of the project. We’ll look at “tact hacks” that nudge communication in a friendly direction, antipatterns to avoid, the pesky human emotions that can tempt us into reviewing poorly, and techniques for leveling up newcomers without losing all your coding time.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyCon 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nErik Rose\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
