title: 'How we almost delivered 100 tons of Stracciatella Mousse - Björn Wendland & Tobias Schröder'
recordingDate: 1603114872
description: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!\nHow often do we read or hear this saying?\nAt what point in time are you confident to say that it's a feature?\n\nIs it when your service has a very good test-coverage, a user-focused design and never acts out of line because it utilizes fancy front-end testing tools and canary-releases?\nEven with seemingly perfect coverage along all levels of the test pyramid, we wonder why bugs appear.\n\nThis talk is about how we almost delivered 100 tons of Stracciatella Mousse. On time!\nThis was not a bug in production. A store employee confirmed that specific order.\nNevertheless this behaviour sounds strange enough to investigate.\nThat's why we stepped back. Took a deep breath and had a look at our metrics.\n\nCan we actually detect anomalies before someone drowns in a pool of tasty Stracciatella Mousse. Join the talk to find out!"
