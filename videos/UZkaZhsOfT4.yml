description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nOctober 22, 2010\r\n\r\nPresented by Dirk Eddelbuettel and Romain Francois.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe R Intergrouplet has invited long-time R contributors Dirk and Romain to give a joint tech talk about some of the recent developments on their open-source R packages. The Rcpp package provides a consistent C++ class hierarchy that maps various types of R objects to dedicated C++ classes. Object interchange between R and C++ is managed by simple, flexible, and extensible concepts which include broad support for popular C++ idioms from the Standard Template Library. RInside is used to embed R in C++ applications, and RProtobuf is the Protocol Buffers API for R."
