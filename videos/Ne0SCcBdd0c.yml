language: English
recordingDate: 1433259184
description: "Domain-driven design (DDD) promises to simplify enterprise application development and is gradually gaining traction as an alternative to traditional four-tier architectures originally popularized by J2EE. As the name implies, DDD is an architectural approach that strongly focuses on materializing the business domain in software. This session demonstrates firsthand how DDD can be implemented with Java EE via a project named Cargo Tracker. Part of Java EE BluePrints, Cargo Tracker seamlessly maps concepts such as bounded contexts, layered architectures, entities, value objects, aggregates, services, repositories, and factories to realistic code examples.\n\n\nAuthors:\nReza Rahman\nReza Rahman is a long time former independent consultant and now officially a Java EE/GlassFish evangelist at Oracle. He is the author of the popular book EJB 3 in Action. Reza is a frequent speaker at Java User Groups and conferences worldwide including JavaOne and NFJS. He is an avid contributor to industry journals like JavaLobby/DZone and TheServerSide. Reza has been a member of the Java EE, EJB and JMS expert groups. He implemented the EJB container for the Resin open source Java EE application server.\n\nReza has over a decade of experience with technology leadership, enterprise architecture, application development and consulting. He has been working with Java EE technology since its inception, developing on almost every major application platform ranging from Tomcat to JBoss, GlassFish, WebSphere and WebLogic. Reza has developed enterprise systems for well-known companies like eBay, Motorola, Comcast, Nokia, Prudential, Guardian Life, USAA, Independence Blue Cross and AAA using EJB 2, EJB 3, CDI, Spring and Seam.\nReza has over a decade of experience with technology leadership, enterprise architecture, application development and consulting.
