title: 'An intro to improving the security of your code with free analysis tools'

description: "Jason C Cohen\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/119/\n\nIt would seem that, despite the exponential growth in security products, security services, security companies, security certifications, and general interest in the security topic; we are still bombarded with a constant parade of security vulnerability disclosures on a seemingly daily basis. Why?  Most often, vulnerabilities come down to a flaw in either the source code, the logic of code, overall architecture, and in some cases the hardware design.  In this talk, we will take a look at one way to reduce the attack surface of your software; testing via static code analysis and dynamic analysis.  We will touch on the theory of how this technology works, when to use it during your development cycle, and then do a few live demos of a sampling of popular tools available for free to the Open Source community that you can leverage today to produce more secure software.  The talk and demos are geared towards new developers to build an initial awareness of the topics.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
