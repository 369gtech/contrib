recordingDate: 1518604943
description: "Production hates you. The machines, the networks, the very users you hope to provide a service hate you. This is reality, and it makes production a hostile battleground. In this talk Russ Miles will talk about how to turn this pain to your advantage.\n\nFollowing on from his popular “Why don’t we learn?”(https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Why-Dont-We-Learn) talk, it is now the time for the sequel. Through a sequence of case studies, personal stories and code examples Russ will talk about how sociotechnical systems, like your very own software development teams, development team, improve through chaos and the stress that results.\n\nThrough each case study Russ will show how you can turn pain to your advantage through experiments and learning loops so that it is no longer about “how do we avoid the pain” but rather “how do I embrace and thrive on more”."
