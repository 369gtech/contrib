description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nIn the six years that Compiler Explorer has been running it has gone from a hacky bunch of shell and Javascript code running on a basement server, serving tens of requests a week to a slightly less hacky bunch of shell and Javascript code scaling out to many computers in the cloud handling tens of thousands of requests a day.\n\nIn this talk, Matt will explain the journey Compiler Explorer has been on, how it has changed over the years, and how it works now. Along the way Matt will show some of his favourite compiler optimisations discovered while using the site, some little-known Compiler Explorer features, and the future direction of the site.\n\nAttendees should be aware there's not very much C++ content in this talk: it's mostly DevOps and blood, sweat and tears of a low-level C++ programmer trying to hack together a website, and discovering an amazing community along the way.\n— \nMatt Godbolt\nAquatic Capital Management, LLC\nDevelopment Engineer\nGreater Chicago Area\n\nMatt Godbolt is the creator of the Compiler Explorer website. He is passionate about writing efficient code. He has previously worked at a trading firm, on mobile apps at Google, run his own C++ tools company and spent more than a decade making console games. When he's not hacking on Compiler Explorer, Matt enjoys writing emulators for old 8-bit computer hardware.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
