What about BDD? \nWhat about H (Hypothesis) DD?\n\nDid you know that SDD (Stackoverflow Driven Development) is a thing? What about Fowler Driven Development or Beer Driven Development?\n\nI spent some time working with some colleagues on the A to Z of *DD. The result was a full alphabet of things that at least one of us had experienced during our careers. Some serious, some less so, some good, some undeniably indifferent to bad to plain stupid.\n\nBut out of all of this I wondered what should REALLY drive our development? In this lightning trip around the alphabet of absurdity I will tell you the one guiding principal that we should all stick to when deciding what should drive our development.\n\nJames Birnie From Thoughtworks\nI started working in software delivery in the late 1990s when TDD was something you studied but never did and a pipeline was something for carrying oil. In 2005 I joined a startup and started to feel I could really make a difference. After nearly 10 years I moved on to a career in consultancy with ThoughtWorks. After 3 years I still feel like every day is different. I'm constantly meeting great people, learning new things, finding new challenges and helping to solve different problems."
