description: "In preparing my Love Letter to Conferences (https://itrevolution.com/love-letter-to-conferences), I looked back at a decade of photos I’ve taken at conferences. Holy cow, it brought back so many memories, and I was so surprised to see how many people showed up in these photos year after year, and how friends from so many domains all ended up joining the DevOps movements, from information security, audit, operations, ITIL, and so much more.\n\nI admit to spending way too much time collecting photos, but I wanted to share them with you—I suspect you’ll laugh when you see so many of us in the DevOps Enterprise community when we were much, much younger. 😂😂😂\n\nBut looking at these pictures of all these amazing people who I’ve met at conferences, I felt blessed to have made these friends in this amazing journey—at one point, I even found myself tearing up, thinking, “How long will it be until we can all see each other in person again?”\n\nI showed them to some friends and asked what they thought of them. Some of the things they said:\n\n    -These are lifelong relationships.\n   \_-These are people learning together and having fun together.\n    -These are an ever-growing community of people sharing.\n\nAnd this one from Margueritte Kim, my wife and CEO of IT Revolution:  “It makes me miss conferences so much now.”  So true.\n\nLet me know on Twitter (https://twitter.com/realgenekim) of any memories these photos evoke!\n\nRead my full Love Letter to Conferences here: https://itrevolution.com/love-letter-to-conferences"
