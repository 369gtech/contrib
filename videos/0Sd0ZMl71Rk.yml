language: English

description: "We use async and await a lot nowadays and every library must support it. But is it a good idea? Is the whole pattern implemented well? What are the problems and why using async may not be a good idea? In this talk I show why async is far from being perfect. I cover problems with global state, exception handling, deadlocks and garbage collection. I explain why crucial programming principles were ignored when designing the mechanism and how broken it is.\n\nLevel 200, basic understanding of async/await is required.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/vmTMSOXE1Ftw8A\n\nDotFest: https://2020.dotfest.ru/lecture/10"
