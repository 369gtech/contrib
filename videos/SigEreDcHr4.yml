description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nSpeakers: Michael Wilmes, Lufthansa and Laurent Doguin, Couchbase\nData / Integration Track\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/inflight-asset-management-with-spring-data-and-neo4j\nWe invite you to join these two speakers from the Spring Data community, each speaking about their respective projects for 45 minutes.\nMichael Wilmes from Lufthansa Systems will speak about Graph-based Asset Management with the Spring Framework. He is part of a flagship project that brings next-generation Inflight-Entertainment systems onto passenger aircrafts, and tackles the operational aspects of managing IT systems in flight, on ground and anywhere in between. Within his talk he will give insight on how Lufthansa Systems leverages the Spring Stack for solving an asset management problem scope with Spring Data and Neo4j.\n\nNext, Laurent Doguin from Couchbase will tell us how to \"Manage Time-base data with Spring Data Couchbase\". A common thing to do in the big data world is store time-based data. It can be logs, user events, social media metrics, market data indicators or even more common now sensor data. You can do that very easily with Spring Data Couchbase. I this talk I will tell you what you need to know before starting to store time-based data. I'll talk about use cases, data modeling, how Couchbase is a perfect fit for this kind of job and code a little demo that reflects all of this."
