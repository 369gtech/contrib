description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - "How I made a career in the Tech industry writing horrible code" by Luca Sartoni - In the last fifteen years, I have been a computer programmer, a network administrator, a security specialist, a Perl developer, a communication consultant, a web TV producer and host, a media trainer, a marketing manager. I worked alone, and I led teams across multiple continents. I started a few companies and contributed to Free Software projects. I can safely say that my code has always been horrible. Nevertheless, my responsibilities, goals, and results have always been growing. Let me tell how to make a career in this industry against all odds.'
