title: 'Neo4j and the Panama Papers'
recordingDate: 1475913833
description: "In May 2016, the ICIJ stunned the world by making available a download of \"The Panama Papers\". \n\nThis remarkable dataset represents the largest leak of offshore financial networks ever, at least 10 times bigger than the previous largest leak. Luckily for those of us keen to analyse this data, they made the data available as a ready-to-run instance of the Neo4j graph database, with all data pre-loaded. In this presentation we'll show you how to download and run this database, and how to perform various queries using the Cypher query language to gain insights into the structure of the offshore financial networks used by people and corporations around the world.\n\nAnd don't worry, you won't need to know Neo4j or Cypher, or even what the Panama Papers are. We'll introduce everything before pulling out the Cypher queries!\n\nSpeaker\nCraig Taverner is an open source software developer, technology enthusiast and entrepreneur working on many kinds of projects, especially those involving GIS and Neo4j. For the last two decades he has been working in telecoms startups, managing development teams in Europe and Asia. His most recent startup was a customer of Neo4j since 2009, and for the last two years Craig has been working within the Neo4j development team, focusing on Cypher, Spatial and Security.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
