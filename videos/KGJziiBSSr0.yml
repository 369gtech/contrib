description: "Our world. Moved by Java. 25 years of ongoing innovation\n\nThe world has been Moved by Java for a quarter of a century, but weâ€™re just getting started. The pace of innovation of Java has only accelerated in the past few years, and projects like Amber (making Java more productive, expressive, and less ceremonial), Loom (making highly-concurrent applications easier to write and maintain), and ZGC (low-latency garbage collection) are delivering features into the hands of developers today, while longer-term projects like Valhalla (value types) have the potential to change the game.\n\nJoin Chad Arimura, Vice President of Developer Relations, to hear about the latest innovations in Java and what makes it the #1 development platform in the world after so many years."
