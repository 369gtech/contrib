description: "When Sara Ford gets excited she talks fast. Very fast. So fast in fact that she decided to race the clock at the Visual Studio Launch Event in Mountain View, CA and attempt to demo 101 Visual Studio tips in under 55 minutes.\n\nThis webcast is a rematch of Sara against the clock. Last time she missed by 15 seconds. Will she succeed? Watch and see!"
