description: "Speaker: Marcin GÄ™bala (@maarcingebala)\r\nLead Developer, Saleor (https://saleor.io/)\r\n\r\nGraphene is currently the most popular framework for building GraphQL in Python and it's also an obvious choice for many people who decide on adding a GraphQL layer to their Django applications. After using it for over a year we've successfully built an API with about 50 queries and over 100 mutations on top of existing Django project (Saleor), but we've also learned many hard lessons and discovered shortcomings of the framework that we had to overcome.\r\nIn this talk, I'd like to show practical tips on some of the most common problems that a Django developer has to face to build an optimized and maintainable API with Graphene e.g.: - using useful abstractions to build queries and mutations faster - optimizing database queries in a graph - structuring a large Graphene project - unified error handling.\r\n\r\nEvent Page:  https://www.meetup.com/GraphQLHongKong/events/269158848/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/C0I3Q/"
