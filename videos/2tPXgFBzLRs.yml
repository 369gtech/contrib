description: "Most designers have a standard set of tools for organizing projects (users personas, task flows, site maps, wireframes, etc). These are supposed to be communication tools, but how effective are they at communicating to a client. Can these tools actually become barriers? Are they accessible to people who don't think like designers?\n\nMegan Erin Miller, Web Designer at Stanford Web Services, has come up with an innovative way to work with clients. She calls it the \"Tactile Design Kit.\" Her strategy transforms website design, which can be an intimidating or arduous task for some, into a engaging game that anyone can understand.\n\nShe hopes that this presentation, delivered at Cascade SF, will help you to rethink your design and discovery process.\n\nFollow along with Megan's slides: http://crcl.to/5gkct\n\nMore free UX resources: http://crcl.to/7hukr\nProfessional HTML5 & CSS3 training: http://crcl.to/8v8uk\n\nFor more information on Cascade SF: http://www.meetup.com/cascadesf/"
