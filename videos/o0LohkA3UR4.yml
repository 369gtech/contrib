description: "We often hear the term Pythonic thrown around, but what exactly does it mean? This talk will take you on a tour of some of the more important pythonic concepts. You will see many examples of perfectly functional Python code that is quite non-pythonic. We will evolve that code into more an idiomatic form that fits better with the Python language and its users. \n\nEVENT:\n\nPyCon SK 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMichael Kennedy\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nPyCon SK YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Tzn82aG4zdvtqlrfsLgSA"
