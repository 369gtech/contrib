description: "PyData LA 2018 \n\nMy team at Hulu makes a tool called Glyph that is used internally to create realtime reports to monitor app health and feature usage. While existing telemetry tells us the who and when of Glyph usage, it does not tell us why it is used. To gain insights into how Glyph is used by product and tech, I built a flask app to mine JIRA data for references to Glyph reports using the Python jira library.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
