description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nElastic Scheduling with TiKV - Song Gao & Yutong Liang, PingCAP \n\nIn the world of cloud computing, it is well-known that Elastic Scheduling can automatically balance the cost and load of stateless applications, but it is rare to see distributed database systems have the elastic scheduling feature as scaling is always not easy for the stateful system. Yutong Liang, Song Gao and their teammates implemented the Elastic Scheduling feature based on TiKV, a cloud-native, distributed Key-Value database , which helps TiKV automatically handle the burst of load and traffic. In this session, Yutong Liang and Song Gao will share their experience of implementing elastic scheduling in TiKV on Kubernetes and introduce the mechanism behind it. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekGd"
