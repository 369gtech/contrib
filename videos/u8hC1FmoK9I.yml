Ideally, we would like to minimize both the latency and the energy consumption. Actually, it is difficult to do. Sweeping a bunch of technologies, from WiFi to LTE-M, through 2,3,4,5G, we will see the mechanisms that are put in place to preserve the autonomy of a device and which inevitably induce latency.\n\n \nPierre Cr√©pieux \nFrom Orange\nI have been working in the telecoms field within Orange for 15 years. After spending half of my career on server side developments related to voice communications (H.323, IMS, Intelligent Network), I switched to mobile development on Android. Today, I enjoy cultivating this dual experience and investigate issues happening at the boundary."
