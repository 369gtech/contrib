title: 'Path to Production: Value Stream Mapping in a DevOps World'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538631913
description: "Over the last few years we've seen some staggering deployment numbers from large organizations that have made the shift to delivering and operating their applications on a cloud-native platform. Companies like Allstate, for example, have deployed applications to production using Cloud Foundry 11,500 times in 2017. Liberty Mutual performs 2,500 daily builds and 1000 production deployments per day. Finally T-Mobile has reduced the time and effort to deliver software to production from 7 months and 72 steps to a few days. How did these organizations transform to achieve this speed and volume for delivering applications to production? They leveraged Value Stream Mapping (VSM). Value stream mapping is an essential tool in understanding how business organizations deliver software value to customers. It calculates the most important metric in business today, time-to-value. In this session we will discuss the ideas and concepts of value stream mapping and how its been applied to software delivery and DevOps to achieve these incredible results while maintaining security and financial control.\n\nSpeakers:\nBen Kamysz\nManager, Platform Architecture, Pivotal\n\nJamie O'Meara\nAdvisory Platform Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
