language: English
recordingDate: 1591902105
description: "During this talk we’ll do a walkthrough of Cluster API (cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io), a project of SIG Cluster Lifecycle to bring declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration, and management. After introducing the project, we’ll do a live demo, showing how to quickly create a cluster using AWS, scaling it up, upgrading it, then spinning up an Azure cluster. Finally, we’ll leave some time for Q&A.\n\nPresenters:\n\nKatie Gamanji, Cloud Platform Engineer @American Express\nNaadir Jeewa, Senior Member of Technical Staff @VMware"
