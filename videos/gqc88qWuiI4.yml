description: "Chelsea Derrick \n\nIt's tempting to view CSS optimization as a dark art, for initiates only.  This session will focus on identifying and resolving slow renders, with an emphasis on layout and paint times.  We'll use Chrome DevTools to find, benchmark, and debug slowness in the render-side of an application.  Uncovering a number of sluggish culprits, we'll explore where the time is spent and dig into profiling data from Chrome's internals. You'll walk away with a better understanding of how to use your time wisely while making your application scream with speed, and smart workarounds that address common CSS performance problems.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
