description: "Android security is nowhere near where it should be. I have been able to hack and get sensitive information from a few different apps and I’m just an amateur hacker at best.\n\nWhether it’s because we are exposing information when making HTTP requests to our backend servers or because we’re simply storing things we shouldn’t in our apps, it’s easy to forget mobile devices aren’t as safe as we think they are."
