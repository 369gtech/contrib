title: 'Migrating to Java 9 Modules with ModiTect by Gunnar Morling'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510225708
description: "The wait is over -- Java 9 finally adds modularity to the platform. Well-defined module interfaces, small-sized runtime images containing just the modules an application needs, the advantages of the module system are manyfold. How to migrate existing applications and their dependencies, though? Automatic modules help, but they don't work with modular runtime images as created by jlink.\n\nIn this code-centric session we'll introduce ModiTect, a Maven-based tool for modularizing legacy JARs. Find out how to generate descriptors based on your application's dependencies, add them to existing JARs and create a fully self-contained Java 9 runtime image with an Undertow-based web service clocking in at just 22 MB, batteries included.\n\nGunnar Morling is a software engineer and open-source enthusiast by heart. He’s leading the Debezium project, a tool for change data capture (CDC). As part of the Hibernate team, he contributes to Hibernate Search, OGM and Validator. Gunnar is the spec lead for Bean Validation 2.0 (JSR 380). In his spare time he leads the MapStruct project. Prior to joining Red Hat, he worked on a wide range of Java EE projects in the logistics and retail industries. He’s based in Hamburg, Germany."
