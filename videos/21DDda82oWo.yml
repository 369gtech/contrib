language: English
recordingDate: 1590564323
description: "Video with transcript included: https://bit.ly/2ZFfjVl\n\nDaniel Situnayake talks about how developers can use TensorFlow Lite to build machine learning applications that run entirely on-device, and how running models on-device leads to lower latency, improved privacy, and robustness against connectivity issues. He discusses workflows, tools, and platforms that make on-device inference possible.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon San Francisco 2019: http://bit.ly/38sivWf\n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQâ€™s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#TensorFlow #DeepLearning #MachineLearning"
