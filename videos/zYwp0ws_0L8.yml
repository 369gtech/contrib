description: "Meetup #AperiTech della Community di GraphRM \n\n- Building Graph-Backed GraphQL APIs With Neo4j -\nGraphQL APIs expose application data modeled as a graph and allows clients to query arbitrary traversals through this data graph. In this talk we explore why graph databases are the perfect backend for GraphQL and take a look at using open source tooling for building GraphQL APIs backed by the Neo4j graph database.\n\nSpeaker:\nWilliam Lyon, DevRel @ Neo4j\n\n- Lightning fast Zero to Production with Spring, Neo4j and jHipster -\nJHipster is a development platform to generate and deploy Spring Boot applications with different modules and configurations. Neo4j support has been recently added to the JHipster ecosystem and in this talk we’ll introduce you to this amazing platform and it’s tools. We will also do a live coding session to help us understand how fast is to get production ready code with JHipster and Neo4j.\n\nSpeakers:\nDavide Fantuzzi, Developer @ LARUS\nGiuseppe Villani, Developer @ LARUS\n\n\nPer restare aggiornato su tutti gli #AperiTech:\nTelegram #AperiTech https://t.me/aperitech\nCalendario del Developer https://bit.ly/devcalendar\nCodemotion Tech Community https://bit.ly/CodemotionTC"
