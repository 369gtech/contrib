description: "by Molly Wilson\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.120/designing_for_security.webm\n\n\nGood security requires usability. If a secure technology isnâ€™t usable, users will simply use something else - or worse, they might work around the technology to do what they need to do. We will demonstrate this universal truth with a handful of examples and supplement them with good design principles. We will cover UX of key handling, password managers and anti-phishing, and also spend some time on why these products and services so often lack usability. We also won't miss this opportunity to introduce simple human-centered design methods to incorporate in the development process! \n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:00:00+01"
