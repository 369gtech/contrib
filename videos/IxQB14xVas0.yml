description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotjs.io on December 5-6, 2019 in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nIn the past few years, UI libraries have taken the web development world by storm, however, this shift in how web applications are built has also increased the complexity of tooling needed to be productive.\nIn reality, it has gotten easier as new a new segment of tooling was created to aid in creating scalable and performant web applications. These “Web Frameworks” focus on providing great end-user experience while also making developers more productive.\nTim explores what web frameworks are, why they exist, and how you can immediately improve your end-user experience and developer experience by applying low-level concepts from web frameworks in your application."
