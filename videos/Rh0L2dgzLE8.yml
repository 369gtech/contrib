description: 'In the perfect world model, software developers are highly intelligent professionals with sharp logic, exceptional analytical and problem solving skills and give the business they work for innovation and competitive advantage. Unfortunately, in reality they are too often plain code monkeys, treated accordingly and wasting their potential. Behavioural patterns that lead to those unfortunate results, symptoms of code-monkey-ism and guidance on how to avoid being code-monkeys and get closer to the real-world model will be covered in this topic.'
