The Singleton pattern is both easy to understand as well as useful.\_I'll demonstrate first how to implement the Singleton pattern. Then I'll provide and example of its usefulness with a Scrabble example.\n\nThreads can sometimes play havoc with this pattern, so I'll show you how to avoid those problems. I'll also review how to use threads, LinkedLists and more."
