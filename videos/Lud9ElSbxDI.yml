description: "Join https://micro.sphere.it/ - free online sessions for tech enthusiasts!\n\nAbstract:\nHear the story behind Jenkins Operator Service, a cloud-native Jenkins platform for scalable and cost-effective continuous integration in public cloud. Starting from the the OSS project to partnership with Microsoft Azure, we will discuss the most relevant steps of this project: the community adoption, how we’ve managed to join the official Jenkins CI org, the road towards GA, as well as packaging everything on Azure Marketplace. We will walk through high-level steps, pain points to results – product overview and roadmap to future improvements.\n\nBio:\nI’m an engineering manager in a cloud-native world managing a mid-sized cross-functional team at VirtusLab.\nThese days I usually build cloud platforms and help with large transformations in the area of cloud-native. I’m still actively involved in technical design and programming."
