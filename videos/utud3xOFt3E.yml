title: 'GeeCON Prague 2019: Wlodek Krakowski - Pyramid of Refactoring'
recordingDate: 1574262735
description: 'Everyone has heard about test pyramidâ€¦ and refactoring pyramid is its twin. Using Pyramid of testing we can set up the tests coverage of the existing functionality reaching given level (UI, modules, packages, classes, methods). This allows us to have a look at corresponding pyramid of refactoring and figure out what kind of refactorings can be performed safely. We start from the bottom of testing pyramid (simpler conditions, smaller methods) and climb up towards the highest level that is covered by tests. This concept will be presented using live refactoring of simple logic into interpreter design patterns. This way we will experience that refactoring at higher levels (design patterns, classes) can be continued only once lower levels like small methods, small classes, interfaces are being taken care of. You need to experience to understand.'
