title: 'Making BDD Work For You (Intro Into Behavior Driven Development)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1520184600
description: "Adopting new methods and technologies is always hard. And it's even harder to know if it's worth the effort. Behavior Driven Development promises to let you spend more time coding and less time pulling your hair out by increasing collaboration and thus trust between developers and business stake holders. Although with all the tools and process BDD seems to require, its implementation costs are often deemed to high.\n\nBut BDD can work without any special tools or dramatic process changes. This talk gives you a hands-on introduction to Behaviour-Driven Development - aka Specification by Example - and shows you a light-weight or even guerrilla-like approach of making it work for you, in your project, with your tools.\n\nEVENT:\n\nThis talk was given at the Dutch PHP Conference in 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nNikolas Martens\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt_1whpJhwA"
