description: "From Legacy to Strategy – From Ops to DevOps\n\nAndrea Hirzle-Yager, Head of Department, IT, Allianz Deutchland AG\n\nI’d like to take you along on our journey and share some of our most valuable insights.\n\nStepping into a time machine that takes us back one and a half years…\n\nWe will look at why, when and how we embarked on this challenging endeavor toward digitization. Ops pushing just as hard as Dev to move toward a common mindset. It wasn’t until after we were already on our way, that we realized we were doing “DevOps”. We were doing it because it MADE SENSE.\n\nDevOps is an absolute paradigm shift and it does NOT just affect IT, it affects and needs to be embraced by the entire organization (top down/bottom up and all the way across).\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
