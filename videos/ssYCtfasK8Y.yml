description: "by Pjotr Prins\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.201/minimalismintro.webm\n\n\nMinimalism matters in computing. To trust systems we need to be able to understand them completely. Openssl heartbleed disaster was caused by code no longer being minimalistic, even if it is free and open source software. Hardware manfucturers and proprietary closed source solutions make things even worse with expectations of intrusion to privacy and backdoors if we don't aim for free hardware, software and minimalism. In this talk I will discuss minimalism in a broad context and narrow down on what the free software community can aim for. \n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:05:00+01"
