language: English
recordingDate: 1531123730
description: "We build design systems to help our teams communicate to accomplish a shared goal—often, in the case of web development, improving a product. Design systems provide shared reusable patterns aimed to reduce code bloat and establish harmony across applications. However, the most significant benefit to building a design systems is that they create resiliency and dynamic conversations across our teams. A good design system is the first step to establishing autopoiesis—a cybernetic feedback loop—within our design and development teams and organization, which is a requisite for maintaining a viable system. By the end of this talk, I hope we will see how the act of building and maintaining a design system not only aids our teams but takes us one step closer to reimagined futures.\n\nCSSconf EU will be back on May 31st 2019: https://2019.cssconf.eu/"
