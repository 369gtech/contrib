language: English
recordingDate: 1538632150
description: "Fiserv has been on a journey to transform their business. This session is to talk about how Fiserv, Pivotal, and Magenic have teamed up to make that vision a reality. Fiserv needed to define their business goals around improving their customer’s success utilizing the power of the cloud. At the same time they had the goal of reducing their operational costs and gaining efficiencies. A large part of this journey is migrating all of Fiserv’s legacy .NET applications over to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform. This was an in-depth process that had each partner playing a key piece. Pivotal provided the industry best practices and patterns, such as http://steeltoe.io. Magenic has been the trusted advisor helping with the lean application portfolio rationalization and making decisions around which applications needed replatforming/modernization versus partial to full rewrite considerations. Fiserv has also had to help change it’s internal culture from a project to product mentality. Together, this three way partnership has helped accelerate Fiserv’s journey to the cloud and transforming their company for the future.\n\nSpeakers:\nShuchi Mittal\nDirector, Cloud Enablement, Fiserv\n\nRobert Sirchia\nLead Consultant Cloud Practice Lead, Magenic\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
