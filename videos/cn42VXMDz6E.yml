Our platform gulps down the twitter firehose and other social data sources to help you filter, augment and create data feeds and insights for your apps or business. We enrich social data so you know the sentiment, influence, geolocation, etc of conversations. And we're about to launch historical twitter data so you can do trend analysis. Best of all we have super-fast developer APIs and transparent pricing so you can get started today."
