description: "RubyConf 2019 - Late, Over Budget, & Happy: Our Service Extraction Story by Amy Newell & Nat Budin\n\nA 3-month project stretches out to 9 months. It's widely viewed as over-engineered and difficult to work with. But months after deployment, it's considered successful. What happened?\n\r\n\nIn this talk, a principal engineer and a director of engineering recount the extraction of a social feeds GraphQL service from a decade-old Rails monolith. Along the way, we'll cover topics including selling a big project, complexity in remote work, complexity in deployments, and complexity in emotions. We'll tell you about the scars we acquired and the lessons we learned.\n\n#rubyconf2019 #confreaks"
