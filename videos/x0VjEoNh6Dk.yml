recordingDate: 1451260122
description: "As humans we process information as it is presented to us. We use the information presented to us to decide on how to react and possibly adapt to the current situation. This trait has a lot of advantages and has served us well over many years. Our approach to the security of our systems should be much the same. Join Aaron as he introduces patterns for processing potentially malicious activity and weaving an adaptive security system.\n\nAaron is the creator of Repsheet, an open source threat intelligence framework. He is the co-author of Programming Clojure, 2nd Edition and a frequent open source contributor.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
