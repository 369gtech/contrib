description: "In early 2016, Lauren packed up her studio in New York City in pursuit of the ultimate form of inspiration: travel. After exploring the world for a year, she was surprised to discover that she didn’t feel more inspired than before. The truth is, she’d actually found more inspiration for her work in her normal, everyday life than in her epic world trip.\n\nThat’s not to say that travel can’t be wildly inspiring – it totally can be. But what if she told you that there’s just as much inspiration in fighting with your spouse as there is in traveling the world? Would you believe her if she told you that she’s gotten more inspiration from a night of drinking than a night of watching TED talks? What Lauren hopes to teach you today is that EVERY experience in your life can be used as inspiration. You are the secret source of inspiration you never even knew you had – you just need to know where to look.\n\nLauren Hom\nOwner & Designer, Hom Sweet Hom\nhttps://www.twitter.com/homtweethom\nhttps://www.instagram.com/homsweethom\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
