title: 'My 1st CRISPR Simulation'

recordingDate: 1578416411
description: "CRISPR is a new gene editing technology that has gotten a lot of attention the past few years. In this episode, I'll use a simulated lab environment provided by Labster to use CRISPR in order to reverse the effects of breast cancer in skin cells. This was my first time doing any kind of CRISPR lab work (either real or simulated), so it was definitely a learning experience. The point of this exercise is to show you that you don't necessarily need expensive equipment to get started learning about biotechnology, you can use the cloud! There are a lot of biology terms that I had to learn and am learning, you'll notice a lot of them used in this video. I hope this inspires you to start experimenting yourself, enjoy! \n\nFind and share 1 learning resource related to gene therapy on social media using the hashtag #moleculardharma!
