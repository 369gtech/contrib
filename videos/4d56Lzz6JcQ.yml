description: "Rus: https://youtu.be/bJ5jmjXXPos\n\nKubernetes allows a lot. After discovering its features, it’s easy to think it can magically transform your application deployment process into a painless no-event. For Hello World applications, that is the case. Unfortunately, not many of us do deploy such applications day-to-day. You need to think about application backward compatibility, possible rollback, database schema migration, etc. I believe the later is one of the biggest pain point. In this talk, I’ll demo how to update a Spring Boot app deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with a non-trivial database schema migration with the help of Flyway, while keeping the service up during the entire update process.\n\nNicolas Frankel is developer Advocate with 15+ years experience consulting for many different customers, in a wide range of contexts (such as telecoms, banking, insurances, large retail and public sector). Usually working on Java/Java EE and Spring technologies, but with focused interests like Rich Internet Applications, Testing, CI/CD and DevOps. Currently working for Hazelcast. Also double as a teacher in universities and higher education schools, a trainer and triples as a book author.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/MeVefll6-qBsBw\n\nDevOpsFest: https://2020.devopsfest.ru/"
