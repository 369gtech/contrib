description: "Google Tech Talk\nJanuary 29, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by Anthony F. Voellm\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWikipedia states:  \"Cloud computing refers to the on-demand provision of computational resources (data, software) via a computer network, rather than from a local computer. Users or clients can submit a task, such as word processing, to the service provider, without actually possessing the software or hardware.\"\n\nAnthony F. Voellm, a.k.a. Tony, a member of the Cloud Security, Performance and Test Team, defines Cloud Computing as \"An elastic set of programmable computing resources that can be used on a pay-per-use basis over a network that allows the user to control the computation and focus on the problem being solved and worry less about the physical hardware, software systems, and location.\"\n\nThe world of building software is undergoing rapid changes with the shift from desktop applications to highly connected and ubiquitous applications served from the Cloud. The shift to the Cloud poses new challenges (eq: how do you run xUnit frameworks on PAAS?) and opportunities on how to test while also creating whole new ways of testing in general (eg: fuzz testing on hundreds of machines for little cost).\n\nThe Google Cloud Platform allows you to build applications and websites, store and analyze data on Google's infrastructure.  In this talk, Tony will provide an overview of the Google Cloud Platform, give a demo of the Google Cloud, and also discuss unique strategies for ensuring that is fully tested and functional.\n\nTony currently leads the Google Cloud Test team and has a wide range of experience from kernel and database engines to graphics and automated image and map extraction from satellite images. Anthony is an avid inventor with 7 technology patents issued. He is focused on delivering Performance, Reliability, and Security to existing products like Google Cloud Storage and Dremel while also innovating new offerings."
