description: "From OSCON 2015 in Portland: In the software world, architecture often gets a bad reputation. I’ll talk about why it matters, and how we can pay attention to it without falling into traps.\n\nAbout Martin Fowler:\nMartin Fowler is an author, speaker, consultant, and self-described general loudmouth on software development. He concentrates on designing enterprise software – looking at what makes a good design and which practices are needed to come up with good design. Fowler has been a pioneer of various topics around object-oriented technology and agile methods, and written several books including Refactoring, UML Distilled, Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, and NoSQL Distilled. For the last decade he’s worked at ThoughtWorks, which he considers a “really rather good” system delivery and consulting firm. He writes at martinfowler.com.\n\nWatch more from OSCON 2015: https://goo.gl/vD6vda\nFind out more about OSCON: http://oscon.com/open-source-2015\nDon't miss an upload!
