recordingDate: 1400655860
description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/istanbultechtalks/itt-2014-max-seelemann-hello-textkit\n\nMax presents TextKit - probably the most significant recent addition to UIKit. iOS 7's new interface replaces icons and bezels with text, all of which is now driven by the new framework. Max covers how TextKit came to be, what it's all about, and, by means of a couple of examples, how things that took weeks before can now be solved in a few lines of code."
