description: "As the Java EE specification becomes more flexible and modular, it becomes easier to build application server profiles specific to your applications. This has the benefit of being lightweight, but it adds a significant risk that out-of-date documentation will cause applications to fail or behave unpredictably if a required feature is missing. The introduction of OSGi bundle support in GlassFish, JBoss, and WebSphere means that applications can now be self-describing. All the runtime features you need can then be matched with capabilities by use of the OSGi resolver, and a server runtime can be dynamically provisioned for your application as it is deployed. This session shows how to achieve this by presenting examples from Apache Aries and other open source projects.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTim Ward\nTim Ward is a Senior Consulting Engineer and Trainer at Paremus, a co-author of Enterprise OSGi in Action, and has been actively working with OSGi for over six years.
