title: 'Continuous Delivery with Containers: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly by Daniel Bryant'

recordingDate: 1510225708
description: "Implementing a continuous delivery (CD) pipeline is not trivial, and the introduction of container technology to the development stack can introduce additional challenges and requirements. In this talk we will look at the high-level steps that are essential for creating an effective pipeline for creating and deploying containerized applications.\n\nTopic covered include:\n\nThe impact of containers on Java and Continuous Delivery\nAdding metadata to container images\nValidating NFR changes imposed by executing Java applications within a container\nLessons learned the hard way (in production)\nA supporting O'Reilly report \"Containerizing Continuous Delivery in Java\" will also be available, and this contains instructions and code for how to create a Jenkins-based continuous delivery pipeline that takes a series of Java applications and containerizes them, ready for functional and nonfunctional testing, and ultimately, deployment.\n\nDaniel Bryant works as an Independent Technical Consultant, and is the CTO at SpectoLabs. He currently specialises in enabling continuous delivery within organisations through the identification of value streams, creation of build pipelines, and implementation of effective testing strategies. Daniel’s technical expertise focuses on ‘DevOps’ tooling, cloud/container platforms, and microservice implementations. He also contributes to several open source projects, writes for InfoQ, O’Reilly, and Voxxed, and regularly presents at international conferences such as OSCON, QCon and JavaOne."
