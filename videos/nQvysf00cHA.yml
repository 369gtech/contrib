description: "Real-time reactive user interfaces need to scale from handling dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of updates per second, to changes in data on a daily or weekly basis, as well as handling input from users. This means that literally everything is a stream of data.\nWe will discuss how the trading applications we've built make extensive use of Reactive Extensions, GraphQL and other streaming technologies to compose these streams to provide real-time, correct information about the state of the market, and the system. We'll talk about the internal architectures of real time trading applications built to handle this sort of complexity."
