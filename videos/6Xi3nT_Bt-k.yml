title: 'Beautify your steps with helper modules | Dana Scheider | CukenFest London 2017'
recordingDate: 1500402757
description: "As much as we all love Cucumber, the fact remains that step definitions tend to get ugly. Lengthy conditionals, hard-coded data, and unneeded variables and parameters all contribute to step definition code that is lengthy, confusing, brittle, and hard to read and maintain. In this talk, Dana Scheider will explain how to use helper modules to keep your step definitions concise, readable, and robust.\n\nDana Scheider is a member of the Cucumber core team and lead author of Rambo, a contract testing tool for Ruby. She is particularly interested in testing, REST API design, and improving processes within engineering organizations. Dana lives in Portland, Oregon, USA with her two dogs and loves opera, math, travel, and foreign languages."
