title: 'JDK 9, 10, 11 and Beyond: Delivering New Feature in the JDK'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538587003
description: "JDK 10 was released only six months after JDK 9, demonstrating that the new fast cadence for the OpenJDK works. Even with such a short development cycle, there were still over a hundred new features covering the language, core libraries and the JVM. In this session we'll take a look at how the Java platform is evolving with the introduction of big features like the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) in JDK 9, local variable type inference in JDK 10 and dynamic class file constants in JDK 11. We'll also cover many of the smaller features that will make your life as a developer easier. What might JDK 12, 13 and 14 include? To answer that question, we'll explore some of the longer-term plans for Java, like project Amber, Loom and Valhalla.\nSpeaker:\nSimon Ritter\nDeputy CTO, Azul Systems\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
