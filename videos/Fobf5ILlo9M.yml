title: 'GalecinoCar - a self driving car using machine learning, webservices, Java, and Groovy!'
recordingDate: 1543661697
description: 'We''ve developed a 1/16 scale self driving car using the new Micronaut framework for the big anniversary of Gr8Conf! This is a port of DonkeyCar project that was leveraged at re:Invent 2017 - a Python based project to use Java and Groovy. We''ll show how we built such a thing with this great new technology and show you how we build it. We will have a demonstration, perhaps in the Lobby afterwards of the car driving around. Learn about how machine learning, Raspberry Pi 3, Micronaut, Groovy and Java are used to make such a wonder! Co-presented with Lee Fox.'
