title: 'Raimo Niskanen - Gen_statem - the tool you never knew you always wanted - Code BEAM STO'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531413322
description: "In Erlang/OTP 19.0 a new gen_* behaviour targeted at writing state machines was introduced - gen_statem. With its much richer feature set and a more general event model it was intended to replace the gen_fsm behaviour.\n\nThis talk goes through the gen_statem features, how they differ from gen_fsm and plain gen_server, and why they make gen_statem a better tool for writing any state machine except possibly the simplest.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/raimo-niskanen/"
