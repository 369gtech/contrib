title: 'A journey to GraphQL at TV 2 PLAY'
recordingDate: 1585727057
description: "TV 2 is a commercial broadcasting station based in Denmark. Beside traditional broadcasting TV we also run a video streaming service called TV 2 PLAY which serves both video on-demand and TV 2s own live channels.Based on TV 2 PLAY I will be talking about our journey from REST based APIs to a GraphQL API, our motivation for doing so, and what we have learned.In the talk I will:\n\n  briefly talk about the history of TV 2 PLAY form monolith to microservices and our motivation for making that decision.\n  describe the issues we were facing with a REST API and why it wasnâ€™t a good fit for us.\n  talk about why we chose to change to a GraphQL API, what problems it solves for us and some of the problems we have run into.\n  talk about the anatomy of GraphQL vs. REST.\n  introduce some context by showing the GraphQL API behind TV 2 PLAY as an interactive graph.\n  show examples on how to query a GraphQL API with downstream services."
