recordingDate: 1447110757
description: "Are you ready? Here are some lessons we have learnt making virtual reality work at realestate.com.au in no particular order:\n\nNobody can describe what VR actually is\nVR is a bit yuck\nEverything you’ve learned about UI is now probably useless\nThe psychological effects are unknown\nHardware sucks. And so does software\nGoogle will probably win\nEveryone who saw Lawnmover Man in 1992 is a frickin expert\nIf you can buy it in Kmart, it’s probably not a revolution\nYou can now tell your Mum all those hours on Quake 3D are totally paying off\nScience fiction tells us the long term prospects are grim\nNot sure people will ever be convinced to wear things on their heads\n\nNigel Dalton is Chief Information Officer at the REA Group in Melbourne, and a veteran agile evangelist with over 14 years of experience applying agile principles to IT and product development in the USA, Australia and NZ. Nigel was also the co-founder of Luna Tractor, an Australian business consultancy taking agile, lean and systems thinking beyond software development to all areas of business and organisations. Luna Tractor leveraged the experience gained in the transformation of Lonely Planet between 2007 and 2011, with over 20 teams running variants of agile, kanban and lean methods to support their aim to make amazing guides in all formats for customers.\n\nAt REA-Group Nigel takes a strong interest in broad application of lean, agile and systems thinking approaches around the workplace.\n\nHis greatest career regret is having once tried to apply agile techniques to a rock and roll band. The result was not pretty.\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
