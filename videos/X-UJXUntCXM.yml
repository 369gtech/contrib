description: "Running an open source B2B business is a tough gig. Not only can anyone see where the bodies are buried but there’s a constant tension between various stakeholders: OSS enthusiasts, customers, and employees with respect to the software. At Neo4j we see architecture as one possible organising principle around which all stakeholders can gather. In this talk I’ll describe Neo4j and its architecture and discuss how we communicate and evolve the product to bring along all stakeholders. I’ll also talk about some of the hardships that architecture alone cannot solve and look to the audience to help us out with some of our thornier corner-cases.\n\nDr. Jim Webber is Chief Scientist at the popular open source graph database Neo4j, where he where he works on R&D for highly scalable graph databases and writes open source software. Jim has written two books on integration and distributed systems: “Developing Enterprise Web Services” on XML Web Services and “REST in Practice” on using the Web for building large-scale systems. His latest book is “Graph Databases” which focuses on the Neo4j database.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.a"
