description: "As the complexity real-world scenarios grows, data scientists often rely on powerful modeling frameworks that are more and more opaque, whose underlying decision making is not intuitively obvious. Therefore, data scientists must also emphasize the usability and interpretability of their modeling, and consider how business partners can best utilize and trust the results of these black-box approaches. Here at ThirdLove, we built an application using Plotly Dash to enable our marketing team interact with our marketing Media Mix Model (MMM), which forecasts orders as a function of dollars spent in each channel. By obviating the legacy approach our marketing team had been relying on with this usable MMM dashboard, we've witnessed a profound impact on our budgeting, and a significant return on investment. I will demo a simple version of the application and share the code that we used to build out the user interface in Dash, as well as the budget optimization feature using CVXPy.\n\nThis talk will be relevant for Data Scientists who want to increase adoption of their models, as well as any practitioner who is interested in applications of convex optimization in business applications. The audience should be familiar with python. Any other expertise in marketing or convex optimization is not required.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
