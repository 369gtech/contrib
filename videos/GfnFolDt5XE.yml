title: 'Keynote: Two roads diverged in the woods - Liam Westley'
language: English
recordingDate: 1638521824
description: "The pandemic has made many people reconsider their career path. The issue of how you work is now becoming as important as where you work and the people you work with.\nEmployees now have a greater opportunity to make these decisions, and Liam will discuss those he made that led to a distinctly unusual career path.\n\nYou may take a different road to Liam, but hopefully you too might still end up on this stage giving a keynote at NDC Oslo"
