description: "This webinar was recorded on March 21st 2019. \n\nWhen creating our scenarios, we want to fully describe the desired functionality, but not over-describe it. We want our scenarios to do more than check for correct operation. We want to paint a picture of whatâ€™s intended that aids understanding by others (or even ourselves) in the future.\n\nWhich details should we leave visible, and which should we hide? In this webinar presentation, we will look at ways to distil our scenarios down to their essence and remove distracting incidental details.\n\nThis webinar is relevant for anyone in a modern agile software team is enthusiastic about building high-quality, accurate software.\n\nPresenter: George Dinwiddie - george@cucumber.io and @gdinwiddie on twitter."
