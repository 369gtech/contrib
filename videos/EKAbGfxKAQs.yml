description: "This episode provides a review of consensus algorithms that are used, primarily for consortium based deployments.  This include the popular Proof of Authority, Proof of Work and a variant of BFT.  The core concepts of the algorithms are introduced and a demonstration of using the popular GETH client to provision a PoA based network, and how the consensus can be chosen at blockchain creation time, demonstrating the popular pluggable consensus.  \nAdditional details and sample code are available on GitHub: https://aka.ms/bt-consensus"
