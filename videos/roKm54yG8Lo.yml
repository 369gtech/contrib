description: "Why Python is at the heart of Smarkets\n[EuroPython 2018 -  - 2018-07-26 - Smarkets]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nSmarkets is heavily invested in Python and this is why we've decided to\nbe the Keystone sponsor of EuroPython 2018! In this talk, we'll tell you\nmore about what we do at Smarkets, why we think we're a unique place to\nwork, the interesting things we're doing at the Conference and of course\nhow we use Python every day. We'll also tell you about some of our\ncurrent challenges in upgrading from 3.6 to 3.7, evaluating asyncio in\nproduction and what we've learned from type hinting over the past two years.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
