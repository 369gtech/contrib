description: "by Mikhail Shilkov\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.201/typescript_for_infrastructure.webm\n\n\nModern cloud applications consist of many moving parts, so they are hard to manage without employing Infrastructure-as-Code approach. \n\nTraditionally, tools like CloudFormation, ARM templates and Terraform employ text-based templates, which tend to be verbose and hard to create and reuse. \n\nWhat if instead of configuration files you could just use Typescript? Meet Pulumiâ€”an open-source library which brings types, components, conditionals, and much more to your cloud infrastructure definition. \n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:00:00+01"
