description: "Samuel Littley, Google\n\nIn the server side world, we can and do lean heavily on redundancy, scaling, and direct control to engineer reliability; however, in the mobile world these well known facets of SRE (amongst others) are virtually non-existent. We typically have no binary rollbacks or downgrades, no forced updates/upgrades, and no ability to turn it off and back on again. Users rely on mobile applications more and more, and it's important that SREs consider client-side reliability. This talk discusses practices, principles, and processes that can be applied in the mobile world to make client-side code a first-class citizen, along with real-world case studies of what has and hasn't worked.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
