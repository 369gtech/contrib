recordingDate: 1551086976
description: 'As developers we aspire to write the perfect projects: Have a proper design, write elegant code, use the best technology etc. And then life gets in the way: strict deadlines from management, old projects that aren’t written properly, technical limitation of projects. In this talk, I will give a critical view of the relationship between product managers/management and developers, and try and give some useful advice on how to bridge that gap. Share some ideas of what to compromise on and what not, how to plan the project so we can eventually get closer to our dream project and not end up with a Meh project.'
