description: "RubyConf 2019 - Thomas Edison vs Three Teslas in a Trenchcoat by Coraline Ada Ehmke\n\nAs a company grows, adopting new technologies becomes more complex, costly, and risky. But as developers we want to keep our skills up-to-date and are often drawn to the latest and hottest tools. So how can we effectively experiment with new technologies at work in a responsible way? This talk will recount the famously adversarial relationship between Thomas Edison and Nicola Tesla, and from their story we will learn ways to balance and exploit the tension between the boring and the new, the familiar and the shiny, the safe and the unknown.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
