Or, better yet, you need to offer different, yet complimentary functionality, while retaining shared code between your web site and mobile app. Welcome to the beautiful world of Vue and NativeScript, which, paired together on the web and on mobile, make for a great user experience.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn about Jen’s experience building Elocute, a web app for language teachers with a paired mobile app that students use to perfect their spoken language skills. You’ll discover how to build for the web and mobile platforms using NativeScript and Vue, making the most of the best of both platforms – data entry on the web, and speech-to-text on mobile.
