description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nOver the last 100 years we’ve moved from radio, to tv, to phones, and now to spatial computing. Technology moves so fast that in order to design for it, you need to take a trip to the future. But how do you convincingly do that and still manage to bring a souvenir back, when all you’ve got is a dumb cardboard box?\n\nWhen you need to know where you’re going, but the cost of planning often exceeds the cost of actually trying, you build a prototype. In this session, Basheer will walk through his methods and madness for feeling his way through the dark in order to use scraps as fuel for the future.\n\nBasheer Tome\nHardware Interface Designer, Google\nhttp://twitter.com/basheertome/\nhttp://instagram.com/basheertome/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
