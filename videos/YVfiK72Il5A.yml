description: "Jeff Nickoloff - Principal Consultant and Member, All in Geek Consulting Services, LLC\nElton Stoneman - Developer Advocate, Docker, Inc.\n\nMigrating apps out of Virtual Machines is difficult, especially distributed apps with multiple components, and even more so when the components run on different operating systems. But with the Docker platform and the Image2Docker tools - which extract Linux and Windows apps from existing VMs into containers - it's easy. In this session we'll take a PHP front-end application running in a Linux VM, which connects to a .NET Web Service running in a Windows VM, and convert the whole stack to Docker automatically. Then we'll run the app on a hybrid Docker Datacenter cluster, where we can manage the Windows and Linux components from a single pane of glass."
