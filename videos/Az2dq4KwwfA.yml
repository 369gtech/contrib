description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Commvault - Many Apps. Many Locations. One Storage Solution.\n\nSpeakers: Abhijith Shenoy, Xiangyu Wang\n\nEnterprises are moving their applications to the cloud at an unprecedented pace. The pandemic has accelerated this journey and hybrid-multi cloud is now a foundation of modern enterprise architectures. Along the way, you’ve become comfortable optimizing for where, when, and how your applications run. So, why wouldn’t you be equally comfortable using distributed storage that:\n\n• Provides location transparency for all your stateful applications\n• Runs anywhere SDS for predictable enterprise-grade resilience, scale, and performance delivered in an application-aware model\n• Integrates natively with K8s and your existing workflows\n\nContainerization promises application portability, yet legacy infrastructure relies on traditional snapshot and replication technology to migrate data across locations, becoming a bottleneck for modern DevOps environments.\nWith distributed storage, you can provision cloud-native, programmable storage when you need it with self-service access and know that your data is instantly available across multiple locations (edge, core, clouds) using our distributed architecture. In this session, you will see distributed storage in action in a K8s environment and learn how to:\n\n• Easily setup and manage persistent volumes using our new Commvault Distributed Storage Operator\n• Establish enterprise-grade high availability for stateful applications across regions and zones\n• Benefit from the simplicity and efficiency of sharing the same storage across multiple OpenShift and K8s clusters\n\nModern solutions don’t come from bolt-ons to legacy technology – they come from a foundational architecture rooted in multi-hybrid cloud distribution."
