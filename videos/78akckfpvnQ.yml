title: 'Priyatam Mudivarti - The Poem as Value'
recordingDate: 1395792558
description: "A million poems live buried in the public domain. Hundreds of literary magazines archive thousands more that go undiscovered. Humansâ€”even machines, can't curate, annotate, and interact with poems in realtime.\n\nWhat would Walt Whitman build to restore poems together?\n\na) Curate poems in edn\nb) Render typography with lambdas\nc) Build a human api for linguistics\nd) Discover poems with Om and Elasticsearch\nIn this talk, I'll share my experience building these apis.\n\nI'll discuss how poets and editors think, how they identify semantic scopes, and what we can learn from them. I'll demo my code with Poetroid, a LightTable-inspired platform, that builds on three similar concepts to discover poetry together: Content, Annotations, Collections."
