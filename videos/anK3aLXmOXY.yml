title: '"Automated acceptance tests for terminal applications" - Roman Joost (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579138467
description: "Roman Joost\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/63/\n\nAcceptance testing is a method of testing an application from a users point of view. In this talk, I will demonstrate our approach to full automated testing a terminal email application (purebred) with the tasty-tmux framework. I'll elaborate the benefits and trade-off's, what problems we experienced and how we solved them.\r\n\r\nAutomating acceptance testing is challenging, because the tests can not adapt to timing sensitive changes in the application. This causes random failures and unresponsiveness. The longer these problems are ignored, the longer value diminishes and investment increases for workarounds and fixes.\r\n\r\nThe audience will get a better understand of what it takes to automate timing sensitive tests. The concept, problems and solutions are language agnostic applicable to any terminal platform and application.\r\n\r\nProject URL: https://github.com/purebred-mua/tasty-tmux\r\n\r\nTalk Outline:\r\n\r\n    What is acceptance testing and why should you automate it\r\n    What other choices of testing did we have and why we haven't chosen them\r\n    The effort we put into automating our tests\r\n    What we gained with automating our acceptance tests\r\n    Future ideas\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
