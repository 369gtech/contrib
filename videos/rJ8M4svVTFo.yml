description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nBuilding and nurturing a flourishing design culture at scale is hard. All designers have unique skillsets and personalities, and it’s vital for design leaders to be able to identify their strengths and weaknesses, help designers grow and evolve professionally, while partnering them in a meaningful way to complement each other’s strengths. This talk is about how they’re doing it at Capital ONE Design, and the framework that they’re working on to guide us along the way.\n\n\nKit Oliynyk\nSenior Creative Director Capital One"
