description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nDevOps on the Edge! - Prasanjit Singh, STARZPLAY\n\nThese are exciting times! Three contemporary technologies are on course to define the next decade! \"Containers\", \"AI & ML\" and \"5G Networks\". Why so? That is because, this combination paves the way for a massive disruption - 'Edge computing'. For the uninitiated, 'edge computing' is a distributed computing architecture that moves applications as close as possible to the user base. Edge computing bundled with 5G tech & ML will transform how enterprises run applications and services today. Core to this transformation is the ability of deploying these applications to edge locations. Kubernetes & its ecosystem of utilities will play a defining role here as the edge orchestrator.\n\nIn this lightning talk, Prasanjit Singh will articulate on DevOps tools & tailored practices that will define the journey to edge computing and assess where we stand today in terms of edge capabilities."
