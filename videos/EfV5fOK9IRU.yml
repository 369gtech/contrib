description: "Building upon the success of Helm 2, Helm 3 has recently been released and the server-side component, Tiller, is finally gone (yay)! Writing Kubernetes files from the ground-up is an intense process, but not to worry â€” Helm has you covered. In this webinar, you will learn about what Helm is, the changes from Helm 2 to Helm 3, and how you can use it for easy deployments of your Kubernetes applications.\n\nPresenters:\n\nDan Garfield, Full-Stack Engineer @Codefresh\nAnna Baker, Software Engineer/Technical Writer and DevOps Evangelist @Codefresh"
