In the world? There are many cases to be made. But this talk explores what I think is a pretty good candidate, which C++ calls std::accumulate(). Tucked away in ＜numeric＞, perhaps relatively unregarded when compared with workhorses like std::find_if() and std::partition(); nevertheless, std::accumulate() is in some sense the ur-algorithm on sequences.\n\nLet’s explore the result of looking at code through an accumulate-shaped lens, how tweaking the algorithm for better composability can unlock many more uses, and how it can be further genericized with applications to parallelism, tree structures, and heterogeneous sequences.\n\nstd::accumulate(): it’s not just for adding things up!\n— \nBen Deane\nPrincipal Software Engineer, Blizzard Entertainment\nBen has been writing games for almost 20 years, and in C++ for most of that. He is currently a Principal Engineer at Blizzard Entertainment where he works on the Battle.net team. He's always looking for useful new techniques in C++, and he likes functional programming.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
