Do you want to use the cool libraries, tools or methodology you saw at this conference? This talk will show you how to combine legacy code with bleeding edge technology.\n\nOften the use of new technology and protocols is limited by fear of change in existing applications. Yet, as developers, we want to remain relevant and have fun with all the disruptive changes in our industry.\n\nThis talk will drill-down from a high-level architectural view to the actual implementation of modern, strangling services in a legacy monolith, using DDD to define bounded contexts, in a safe and controlled manner.\n#LegacyCode #Innovation #DDD #BoundedContexts\n\nPresented by Bart Blommaerts\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
