title: 'Scaling Personalization: DevOps at Stitch Fix'
recordingDate: 1512085440
description: "Scaling Personalization: DevOps at Stitch Fix\n\nRandy Shoup, VP Engineering, Stitch Fix \n\nStitch Fix takes a unique approach to retail which combines art and science -- we send our clients clothes we think they will love; they keep what they want and return what they donâ€™t. Based on years of data science and machine learning, we develop personalized algorithmic recommendations for each client, and one of our thousands of human stylists hand-curates those recommendations to choose what goes in each box. By continually iterating and improving how we serve our clients, we have grown to 6000 employees and $700M in yearly revenue. \n\nThis talk will discuss the technology approach and modern development practices we have put in place to make this model succeed. To reduce the coupling that stifles velocity and innovation, we are actively rearchitecting around microservices and event-driven approaches. To get the agility that comes from rapid iteration, we practice TDD and Continuous Delivery. To get the ownership that drives optimal results, we organize around small, independent teams that run what they build (DevOps). To take advantage of our rich data, we maintain a robust data pipeline and offer data as services. All of these practices work synergistically, and each benefits from and reinforces the others.\n\nSimilarly, these scalable practices have allowed us to both support a large organization with a relatively small engineering team, but also to seamlessly grow that engineering team from 25 to 75 over the course of a year.\n\nThe talk will conclude with lessons we learned on this journey, and will offer concrete ways other organizations can do the same.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
