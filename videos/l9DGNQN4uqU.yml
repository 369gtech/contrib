description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2019 Conference: https://jsnation.com\n\n# Using WebGL and PWA to build an adaptive game for touch, mouse and VR devices\n\nWeâ€™ll see how to build a cross-platform game using an adaptive gameplay. This will allow the same web app to be played on touch screens, using a mouse or pen on desktops, up to the ultimate immersive experience thanks to WebVR! By using PWA, it will run totally offline, can be pinned on your mobile home screen or even be pushed to the Microsoft Store. \n\nWe'll see how to build the 3D scene using glTF, create the loading screen using the latest CSS features, manage the gameplay and finally how to use a service worker in the best way possible in collaboration with IndexedDB. I'll share what I've learned while creating the game. Fun topic but serious learnings. \n\nI'll demo the game on desktop, mobile and on a VR headset which provides a very cool gameplay via the VR controllers! :)"
