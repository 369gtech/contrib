description: "There are lots of things around us that make our lives easier every day, but we never really think about how they work. How does a train make turns? How do fridges work? Why do we need specific adapters to charge our devices? How does sunscreen protect our skin? and so on. It’s a relief that we don’t need to know the answers to take advantage of those things! But wouldn’t it be fun to find out anyway? In this short talk, we’ll try to figure out how Pubgrub—the new dependency resolver of Swift Package Manager—resolves our dependencies and makes our lives easier.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPerformed at FrenchKit 2019, iOS & MacOS developers conference in Paris\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMert Buran"
