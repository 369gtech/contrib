Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nTesting in A Distributed Systems World - Fernando Mayo, Undefined Labs \n\nWhile microservices are becoming the norm due to advancements in development, deployment and monitoring techniques in the last few years, we are still using the same testing methodologies we used for monolithic apps. In this talk, we look at how distributed tracing can be applied to testing modern, distributed applications, from unit to end-to-end tests, to continuously give developers invaluable insight on how entire applications behave, and when and why they fail, before they are deployed to production. We'll also discuss the power of distributed context propagation and how it can be leveraged for testing purposes, from safely testing in production to failure injection."
