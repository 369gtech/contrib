description: "Marketing technology and operations are increasingly accepted as a critical function for executing successful marketing programs and delivering a remarkable customer experience. But we're still in the early days of systematically harnessing its potential.\n\nIn this keynote, Scott will distill \"The New Rules of Marketing Technology & Operations\" that are being shaped by best-in-class marketing teams:\n\n- Centralize everything you can.\n- Automate everything you can.\n- Decentralize everything you can.\n- Humanize everything you can.\n- Embrace continuous change.\n\nThese might sound paradoxical, but there are ways we can both centralize and decentralize, automate and humanize, and that's where the magic of modern marketing operations happens.\n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on Inspire Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n\n#infoshare2019 #Marketing #Technology #MarTech"
