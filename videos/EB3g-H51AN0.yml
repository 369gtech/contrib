description: "Speaker: Michael Minella, Pivotal\nOne of the major promises of the cloud is that of flexibility. Today, most applications deployed to the cloud are long running processes that use the flexibility of cloud scaling. But computing is full of short lived tasks that start up, do their work, and then terminate. These tasks are excellent cloud use cases since resources can quickly be provisioned - and reclaimed.\n\nIn this webinar, we’ll explore a new project in the Spring Cloud portfolio, Spring Cloud Task, a new framework for developing and orchestrating short-lived microservices. We’ll explore various use cases, build your first task, and discuss how to orchestrate tasks using various techniques. Finally, we’ll peek into the roadmap for the Spring Cloud Task project."
