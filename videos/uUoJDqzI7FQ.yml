description: "Almost everybody knows Old Faithful Jenkinsâ€¦ and probably hates its job configuration pages. Although being 10 years old, Jenkins actively adopts modern trends like DevOps and Continuous Delivery. One of the hottest areas is Jenkins Pipeline, which allows describing complex automation flows as code in a Groovy-based DSL.\n\nWe will talk about Jenkins Pipeline and its fresh-new features. How does it help to organize automation in your projects? How does it improve the developer experience? What is BlueOcean UI? How to chose between declarative and imperative definitions in DSL? How to scale automation with Pipeline? And finally, does it make sense to migrate and what obstacles to expect?"
