description: "This session takes you on a JSF tour with the help of Java EE 7, together with PrimeFaces and the NetBeans IDE. The tour begins with an introduction of PrimeFaces and its features, such as UI components and themes. Focusing on Java EE 7, it examines HTML5-friendly templates, resource libraries contracts, Faces Flow, EL operators, and lambda magic. Throughout, you will be shown how to apply the principles and concepts learned, via working examples in the NetBeans IDE. The presentation is brought to you  from the horse's mouth —that is, by PrimeFaces and NetBeans IDE engineers.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMert Caliskan\nundefined\nView more trainings by Mert Caliskan at https://www.parleys.com/author/mert-caliskan\n\nMartin Fousek\nMartin Fousek is Software Engineer living in Prague, Czech Republic.
