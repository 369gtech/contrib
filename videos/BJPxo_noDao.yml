title: 'Coding for Curiosity - John Sundell'
recordingDate: 1574093656
description: 'There can be many different reasons for starting a project and for writing code. Not all code we write needs to end up in production - and coding for learning, to build prototypes, or to satisfy your inner curiosity can be really valuable. In this talk, John will show how he approaches new coding projects, how he breaks down what at first might seem like impossible tasks, and why he loves to code for curiosity.'
