description: "\"Attractive GUIs with PySimpleGUI\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-23 - Ni\nOnline\n\nBy Ruud van der Ham\n\nIn the Python landscape, there are several high-end GUI packages. Of course, thereâ€™s tkinter which is part of the standard library. And there is wxPython and several versions of Qt. What they share is that they are very flexible but not only have a steep learning curve but also take considerable development effort to realize even a simple user interface.\nAt the other of the spectrum, there are several design tools that either generate code of a layout structure. In many cases, the functionality is rather limited, though.\nRelatively recent, an independent open-source developer (not me) has made a product that tries to bridge the gap between these two worlds: PySimpleGUI. This package runs on top of tkinter, QT for Windows, wxPython and Remi.\nIn this talk, I want to show the design methodology behind this fascinating product that might change the way people look at GUIs.\nI will start with live coding a simple yet not evident program that shows the basic concepts. With this, I will demonstrate the design philosophy.\nPySimpleGUI can also be used to implement a user-friendly interface as opposed to command-line interfaces.\nFrom there, I will give an overview of some more elements present in this package.\nFinally, I will show a full-featured GUI program with several bells and whistles.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
