title: '2019 - Neil Boddy - Case Study of Moving from CRUD to Log Based State Management'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573929914
description: 'While big data techniques such as log based systems, pioneered by the tech giants, offer robust and salable state management, crawling data at scale is not without its challenges. Presented is an approach developed for managing the state for a master data management system using MongoDB that, through the use of auxiliary information, facilitates accelerated traversal of a multi-dimension time series, in addition to improving the overall utility of the data. We feel that this is a novel design technique, and although developed specifically for master data management, may be more broadly applicable to other applications managing batch oriented state at scale. This technique has helped us lay solid engineering foundations for rich state management and hence feel it worthy of sharing our motivations, approach and experiences. This paper is presented in the form of case study and may be of interest to any practitioner considering adopting and advancing non-CRUD based state management.'
