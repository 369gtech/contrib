description: "You've figured out how to split up your backend services into microservices and scale your teams to the moon! But what about the front-end? Are you still building monoliths for your UI? This session will talk about the history of web frameworks, the microservices explosion, and techniques + frameworks for complementing your microservices with micro frontends. It'll include developer stories from folks implementing micro frontends and recommendations for learning more about them.\n\nMatt Raible\nOkta\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
