title: 'ASP.NET Core for Angular, React, Knockout etc  developers - Steve Sanderson'
recordingDate: 1472122108
description: "What’s it going to take to convince you to build your next single-page app (SPA) on ASP.NET Core instead of Node.js? Our goal is to make ASP.NET Core the most productive, most flexible, and best performing cross-platform server-side web technology for hosting modern Angular / React / Knockout / etc apps. In this talk, I’ll demonstrate how you can:\nSeamlessly integrate your server-side code with your client-side code\nCode faster: Have your development-time server automatically rebuild TypeScript/LESS/etc in realtime as you edit code, and use Hot Module Replacement (HMR) to sync those updates into your pages instantly without reloading or losing state\nBoost performance and SEO: Enable server-side prerendering of your Angular2/React components, and optimise the delivery of JavaScript/CSS to the browser\nUse advanced client-side debugging features thanks to tie-ins with Redux and Webpack"
