description: "Peter van der Burg\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/XLL9US\n\nThe artwork’s description is: “Using the Fibonacci sequence as the basis for the work, I create a dynamic image of the \"whole\"- an intact and technological world, transitioning through to what appears to be broken and in crisis. The  four Fibonacci boards move in a cyclic and synchronous way from an \"S\" to the whole \"O\" back to the \"S\" enhanced with the use of colour LEDs progressing from red to green back to red palette expressing my narrative.”\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on the MicroPython code that synchronises electro-mechanical aspects of the project and how I overcame the specific challenges of keeping a ‘hobby’ servo in sync with the LED light sequencing.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 14:05:00 2020 at Curlyboi"
