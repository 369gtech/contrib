description: "Central Service Broker Management and Service Instance Sharing Across Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Florian MuÌˆller, SAP SE\n\nThe Open Service Broker API sets the standard for how a single instance of Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and other platforms create services instances and bind those instances to applications. But managing which services are available across multiple instances of those platforms is a challenge when there are hundreds of potential services that need to be managed across thousands of platform instances.\n\nAnother challenge is managing service instances across those platforms. There are several use cases where a service instance created within one platform must also be accessible within another platform. For example, a database instance created initially by a Cloud Foundry application must be accessible by a Kubernetes application.\n\nIn this talk we present the Service Manager, a central component to manage service brokers and service instances across many platforms and different types of platforms. The OSB API enables this component to work without any platform changes and support for the native platform tools.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyh/central-service-broker-management-and-service-instance-sharing-across-cloud-foundry-and-kubernetes-florian-muller-sap-se"
