description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nThis session is intended to help the advanced programmer to understand what coroutines and fibers are, what problems they solve and how they should be applied in practice. \nThe session begins with an overview of these concepts, comparing them with threads, and demonstrating how they are exposed by the Boost libraries. \nApart from being clean and succinct as Boost libraries typically are, the authors of these libraries have gone to great lengths to ensure that fibers and coroutines expose a programming model consistent with that of threads. This will make them seem very familiar. \nDuring the session I will demonstrate how fibers and coroutines can be used together with the powerful Boost.Asio library to solve some commonly occurring problems. \nTo conclude, I will provide some practical tips and guidelines for those who are adding fibers and coroutines to their programming diet. \n— \nDavid Sackstein: codeprecise. Developer, Consultant, Trainer\n\nDavid is an experienced C++ and .Net developer and lectures on advanced topics in these languages. He is a great believer in the need to apply good engineering practices and clean code and assists his customers to implement them. He delivered a 90 minute session at ACCU 2015 on the topic of coroutines in C++ and C#.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
