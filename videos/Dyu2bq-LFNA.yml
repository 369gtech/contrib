description: "Kyma: Next Gen Extension Model for Enterprise Applications - Sayan Hazra, SAP\n\nEnterprise customers have a high demand on customizability and extensibility to fit the software they are using to their needs. In the past they had access to central parts of the software and could integrate changes on code level. This is not possible in cloud applications.
