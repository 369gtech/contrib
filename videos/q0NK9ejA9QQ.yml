description: "Have you always been curious about what machine learning can do for your business problem, but could never find the time to learn the practical necessary skills? Do you wish to learn what Classification, Regression, Clustering and Feature Extraction techniques do, and how to apply them using the Oracle Machine Learning family of products?  Join us for this third chapter of the series “Oracle Machine Learning Office Hours – Machine Learning 101”.\n\nIn this \"ML Regression 101\" we learned how to set up a data set for regression modeling, build machine learning models that predict numeric values such as home prices, evaluate model quality and compare algorithms, as well as use AutoML for Regression.\n\nVideo Highlights\n01:01  Next session announcement: 102 Regression\n02:01  Machine Learning 101 - Regression   \n03:07  What is Regression\n05:31  History of Regression\n08:00  Data for our example\n10:30  Terminology\n11:11  Data preparation\n13:43  Linear Regression model intuition\n19:35  Model evaluation\n22:47  AutoML\n23:12  Demo for Machine Learning 101: Regression\n23:50  Data Exploration\n33:53  Regression model build\n38:12  Linear Regression: Predicted vs. Actuals and Residuals\n40:02  Computing the goodness-of-fit statistics in OML4Py\n42:08  Linear Regression with feature creation and feature selection\n43:57  Support Vector Machines Regression\n47:35  Neural Networks Regression\n49:25  Ranking of models so far\n49:40  AutoML algorithm selection\n51:04  AutoML GLM Ridge\n52:37  Final ranking of models\n53:20  Q&A\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/  \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
