title: 'Linux Containers on Windows - The Inside Story'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509731817
description: 'At the last DockerCon, we showed an early prototype of a Linux container running natively on Windows Server, kickstarting the “LCOW” (Linux Containers on Windows) project. Since then, LCOW has expanded to involve multiple Docker projects, including LinuxKit, ContainerD, and Moby, as well as work from many teams within Microsoft. In this session, John Starks, the architect of Windows containers and lead of the Linux team in Windows, will present an insider’s view of LCOW’s architecture and implementation.'
