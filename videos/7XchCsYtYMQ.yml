description: "Theres a new trend on the interwebs called 'Deepfakes', a machine learning system that can be trained to paste one person's face onto another person's body, complete with facial expressions. The effect isn't yet more convincing than conventional computer graphics techniques, but it could democratize Hollywood-level special effects fakery - and, potentially, lead to a flood of convincing hoaxes. I'll explain how DeepFakes works both programmatically and thoeretically in this video. It's essentially 2 autoencoders trained on 2 image datasets and then we reconstruct image A using image B's decoder. \n\nCode for this video (with coding challenge):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/deepfakes\n\nChallenge winner:\nhttps://github.com/ivanklimuk/DNA_to_RNA\n\n\nRunner-up (Paramdeep):\nhttps://github.com/ParmuSingh/autoencoder-mnist \n\nPlease Subscribe!
