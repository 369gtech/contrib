recordingDate: 1449100276
description: "From Strata + Hadoop World 2015 in Singapore: When data is hidden and crunched, and used purely for organization and optimization, we may be losing out on a crucial value it can offer – that of empowerment, engagement and impactful behavioral change.\n\nInstead, when Data is made visible, understandable, or open source and collaborative and allow for the input and feedback of the larger masses: it becomes truly empowering and therefore useful. Those involved in the big business of Big Data need to remember that our very human citizens and consumers are walking emotional data points that need factoring into the development of experiences and solutions, if we want them to have truly large scale and long term usage and impact.\n\nAbout Tara Hirebet (R/GA): Tara Hirebet is the Regional New Business Director for R/GA overlooking New Business Consulting, Intelligence and Innovation, working across the R/GA Singapore, Shanghai and Sydney offices covering the Asia Pacific Region. Before that she was Head of Asia Pacific for Contagious Consulting. Tara has an eclectic background in copywriting, advertising, market research, trends, foresight and innovation. She has worked as a creative for agencies like Publicis, Ogilvy and TBWA Singapore on accounts ranging from Nike to Heineken, Olay, M1 and Singapore Airlines. She spent three years in China working in advertising on Dell and Alienware at Enfatico/Y&R Beijing and then moved into qualitative market research with Flamingo Shanghai and Chinese youth consultancy, China Youthology, where she travelled around China and hung out with consumers for brands such as Wrangler, McDonalds, Puma, Sony, Pepsico, Diageo, and Mercedes-Benz. After China, Tara returned to Singapore, to set up trendwatching.com’s APAC trend office tracking the latest Asian consumer trends and worked on a global “Future of Youth” FMCG project at WPP’s The Futures Company.\n\nTara is frequently invited to speak on Asia and has at: SXSW2015 (panel on Chinese female digital behaviour and User Experience Design) SXSW 2014 (How Overcrowded Asian Cities Inspire Innovation), TEDx Women, the Mashable Social Good Summit Singapore, the United Nations Development Program, The American Chamber of Commerce, Visa Technology Office, Spotify, Google APAC, Grey Goose, Friesland Campina, Ogilvy, JWT Kuwait, FCB New Zealand and more. Tara has also written columns and opinion pieces on how brands and agencies can innovate for Asian consumer needs for both Campaign Asia and the Korea Times.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop Singapore 2015: https://goo.gl/lBSB0b\nVisit the O’Reilly data website: oreilly.com/data\nDon't miss an upload!
