description: "In the early days of the 20th century, department store magnate John Wanamaker famously said, \"I know that half of my advertising doesn't work. The problem is that I don't know which half.\" The consumer internet revolution was fueled by the use of massive amounts of data to answer that problem. Now, the same transformation awaits in healthcare.\n\nThe opportunities are huge: for entrepreneurs and data scientists looking to put their skills to work disrupting a huge market, for researchers trying to make sense out of the flood of data they are now generating, and for existing companies (including health insurance companies, biotech, pharmaceutical, and medical device companies, hospitals and other care providers) that are looking to remake their businesses for the coming world of outcome-based payment models.\n\nTim O'Reilly\n\nO'Reilly Media, Inc.\n\nTim O'Reilly is the founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media, Inc., thought by many to be the best computer book publisher in the world. O'Reilly Media also hosts conferences on technology topics, including the O'Reilly Open Source Convention, the Web 2.0 Summit, Strata: The Business of Data, and many others. O'Reilly's Make: magazine and Maker Faire has been compared to the West Coast Computer Faire, which launched the personal computer revolution. Tim's blog, O'Reilly Radar, \"watches the alpha geeks\" to determine emerging technology trends, and serves as a platform for advocacy about issues of importance to the technical community. Tim is also a partner at O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, O'Reilly's early stage venture firm, and is on the board of Safari Books Online."
