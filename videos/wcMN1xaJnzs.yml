description: "Let's Bring System Dynamics Back to CS!\n\nMarianne Bellotti, Rebellion Defense\n\nSystem Dynamics is the process of modeling systems in feedback loops. Developed by computer scientists at MIT, System Dynamics as a technical approach eventually fell out of fashion in favor of formal verification. And yet as we build distributed applications and the environment of automation to support them we see more and more outages triggered by dysfunctional feedback loops. These problems are impossible to model in formal verification but can be reasoned about in System Dynamics. This talk will discuss the history of System Dynamics, what tooling is available for software engineers to build and run models, and how to represent various architectures using the abstractions of System Dynamics.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
