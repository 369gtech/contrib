language: English

description: "Chris Saxon\nDeveloper Advocate\nOracle\n\nSQL is a powerful language for accessing data. Using analytic functions, you can gain lots of insights from your data. But there are many problems which are hard or outright impossible to solve using these. Introduced in 12c, the row pattern matching clause, match_recognize, fills this gap. With this it's easy to write efficient SQL to answer many previously tricky questions. This session introduces the match_recognize clause. It will use worked examples to show how it works and show how it's easier to write and understand than traditional SQL solutions. This is useful for developers and data analysts that need to search for patterns in their data."
