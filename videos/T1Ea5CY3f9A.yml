description: "The C# team has continued to strive for openness since first making the Roslyn repository open source on CodePlex 3 years ago. There are features in the language that have been developed entirely by community members.\n\nThe C# language spec (draft) is published on GitHub. There's an entire repository dedicated to language proposal discussions. In this session, you'll learn how these changes should affect your relationship with the language, how to keep up with changes, and how to participate. We'll also survey significant upcoming changes to the C# language."
