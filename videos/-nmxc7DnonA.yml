description: "Streams of data and pipelines are everywhere. It’s a useful conceptual model: you have an input; you wire some little functions together to compose bigger and more complex pipelines; and you produce an output. To reach prominent throughput, we need to make these functions asynchronous, and parallelize them over input data.\n\nAkka Streams is a toolkit that provides a way to define and run a chain of asynchronous processing steps on a sequence of elements, using tried-and-true actor model under the cover.\n\nIn my talk I’m going to explain the motivation of using Akka Streams, and cover the following topics:\n\n- Problems of streaming data\n- Actor model in the nutshell\n- Problems of actor model from stream processing point of view\n- Problems of buffers and mailboxes overflow\n- What is back-pressure\n- How Akka Streams helps with resolving these problems\n- Code examples in Akka Streams"
