description: 'Note: First 5 minues of video do not have Peter Ledbrook visible. Sorry... Grails is geared towards an MVC architecture with a database back-end and a service layer. But is this the only way to write Grails applications? Is it even the best approach? In this talk, I''ll look at how we should approach the design of our Grails applications and show you some other architectures you might use. More importantly, you''ll learn why you might use them.'
