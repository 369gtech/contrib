description: "The same kind of nfc chip that you have in your credit card, I have implanted in my hand. I wanted to be a personal stakeholder in a revolution that can benefit the whole world, but may also facilitate death and destruction. \n\nThis talk will be about the risk assessment that lead up to the decision to make an implant. What’s the potential of having a chip implant for authentication? How does it differ from other identifications, like passwords, passports or Bank-ID? And what if I say you all already are cyborgs? \n\nEmma Lilliestam has a higher vocational degree in it security technique aswell as a bachelor of arts in journalism. She has been passionate about information security themes for the past decade. Currently she is a service desk analyst, and by night she writes and talks about user security. She is also a chip implanted cyborg full time. \n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
