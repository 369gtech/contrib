description: "This talk reviews two types of workers: web workers and service workers. We explore their similarities, differences, the most popular communication APIs, and some common use cases. We also go over some communication patterns and some real-world examples of how these patterns are used by sites and web apps for speed, reliability, and better user experience, including websites like 1-800 Flowers, Tinder, and Squoosh.\n\nResources:\nWorkers overview → https://goo.gle/33BxTil\n\nSpeakers: Demian Renzulli, Andrew Kean Guan\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers here → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\n#chromedevsummit #chrome #pwa"
