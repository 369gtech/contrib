title: 'Strategies for creating an environment of continuous learning'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608129862
description: "Roles naturally develop over time, new skills will be needed and new competencies developed. But the sign of a strong engineering culture and strong individuals within it is to be constantly learning and developing, so that when changes happen people are able to adapt immediately. \n\nIn this session we’ll consider how to build an organisation that values learning and development, thinking about the programmes we can put in place to help aid that growth, but also how to create an environment that provides time and space for engineers to learn. We’ll also think about how to build intrinsic motivation for growth and how to put in place structures that facilitate further development."
