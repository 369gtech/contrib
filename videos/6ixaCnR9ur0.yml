description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nThis hands-on tutorial teaches students to scale Pandas and Scikit-Learn on a cluster with Dask. Students will be given on a cloud-hosted cluster running Jupyter notebooks and Kubernetes that allows them to scale out to moderate size. They will learn common workflows, how to understand and track performance, and some of the challenges of parallel computation.\n\nSlides - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17roiO4Rk-e9-MFCUVATEM16RpGIWvxgH_ND8UTpuiSA/edit?usp=sharing\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
