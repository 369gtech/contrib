title: 'Matti Schneider - Improve collaboration in guerilla user testing'
language: English
recordingDate: 1475437729
description: "Description of talk: „Guerilla user testing” is a recurrent theme in Lean Startup and Lean UX. The idea is that user tests are more efficient and less costly with direct contact on the field, with little preparation, rather than in usability labs.\n\nIndeed, only courage, openness and strong observation abilities are needed to discuss a value proposition, evaluate prototypes and iterate over wireframes. With those and a little imagination, a train station, a bar, a conference can all become excellent testing contexts.\n\nHowever, this approach usually shows its limits when the time comes to share observations between team members. Most often, the time saved in preparing is spent in synchronizing.\nWe used this approach to design web applications targeting young and isolated people, with teams of 6 people meeting more than 40 people in sessions of 3 to 5 days. We found representations and schedules that greatly improve collaboration on making the observations actionable.\n\nI will first present these artefacts, then will facilitate a collaborative improvement session to ease their adoption.\n\nMatti Schneider\nTransdisciplinary engineer.\n\nBuilding software, studying humans, designing interactions, thinking society.\n\nCurrent main occupation: updating the French government. \n\nMore information can be found here: mattischneider.fr\nhttp://2016.agileturas.lt/vilnius/speakers/matti-schneider/"
