So now, what do you do? In this session, Dan explains what web performance actually means, and how to measure the performance of your website.\n\nDan shows tools and techniques you can use to locate performance bottlenecks, and various methods and technologies you can use to overcome them. Mostly he provides a list of action-items for improving the performance of your websites."
