description: 'Develop, Deploy, Iterate Often. Todayâ€™s developers are developing and deploying multiple releases per day, sometimes per hour. Architectural designs are changing from monolithic applications to microservices that have smaller granularity and use lightweight protocols. Developers are building modern applications engaging customers over multiple channels via mobile, chatbots and even virtual reality. An API first approach is critical in tying all this together allowing cloud native applications to access data and processes, enabling collaboration between front-end and back-end developers. With modern app development platforms, developers can easily build, connect and elastically scale all web and mobile applications services across any device. Microservices and chatbots are driving real need for all enterprises to adopt an API-first strategy. www.apiary.io'
