description: "Junyi Yi, Software Engineer, Developer, Microsoft Corporation\nXiaokai He, Senior Program Manager, MICROSOFT\n\nVisual Studio Code started off as a lightweight editorâ€”and people love it for its superfast performance, its lightweight nature, and its supersmart code understanding. All of this is now available for Java and Spring Boot too. Installing the right extensions in VSCode results in a powerful yet lightweight code editing experience that comes close to the feature richness of existing Java IDEs. This session shows how you can use Visual Studio Code to write and debug Java and Spring Boot applications. It discusses which extensions to use and how they can be used, including support for Spring Initializr, Maven, Git, Java code editing, JUnit, Java debugging, and using the all-new Spring Tools 4 for Visual Studio Code."
