description: "SREcon19 Americas - Visibility into Loggers (and Other Low Level Services)—Seeing the Trees from the Forest\nDanny Chen, Bloomberg LP\n\nLoggers and tracers have become crucial components of computing systems, providing invaluable visibility into the runtime behavior of our software. Ironically, these vital components are opaque when it comes to their own runtime behavior. We typically only look at logging as suspects in performance-related incidents as part of post-mortem analysis.\n\nWhy do we have such blind spots when it comes to components that are pervasively used in our systems? We explore possible explanations and present example solutions.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
