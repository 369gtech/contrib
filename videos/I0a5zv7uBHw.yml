description: "RubyConf 2019 - In the beginning, there was \"require\"... by Adam McCrea\n\nAlmost every Ruby program begins with the \"require\" method, but many of us don't pause to think about what it's doing until it fails us.\n\nWhat happens when we call \"require\"? How does Ruby find what we're looking for? Is Bundler somehow involved? What about \"requirerelative\" and \"requiredependency\", and what the heck is a \"binstub\"?\n\nThis talk will guide beginner and intermediate Rubyists through these foundational concepts that power our Ruby programs, from single-file script to a behemoth Rails 6 app.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
