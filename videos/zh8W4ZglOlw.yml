description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch,  5 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBoth by accident and by design, C++ supports a number of different\nstyles and approaches to programming. Its evolution from C gives it\nobvious support for a procedural systems programming style based on C\nidioms, but past, present and future language support opens up a wealth\nof other approaches and idioms, including object-oriented programming,\ngeneric programming and some elements of functional programming.\n\nThis diversity is both a strength and a weakness. It can lead to code\nthat is crisp and well matched to its problem. But it can also lead to\ncode that is at best considered an exercise in groundless post-modernism\nor, less favorably, an unmaintainable and incoherent mess.\n\nThis talk examines some of the styles and approaches, including their\nkey strengths and accidental complexities, as well as consequences of\nand techniques for combining them.\n\nSpeaker: Kevlin Henney\nKevlin Henney is an independent consultant and trainer based in Bristol,\nUK.
