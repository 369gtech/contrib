description: "Speaker: Danny Hyun\nDanny's notes: https://github.com/danhyun/spring-ratpack-2016\nWith the advent of Ratpack and Spring Boot, people think you need to choose between one or the other. That couldn’t be further from the truth. The only place where they overlap is in serving web requests. Spring Framework is a very rich ecosystem including but not limited to DI, web mvc, data, security, etc.\nRatpack focuses on rapid web app prototyping and iteration balancing low resource utilization, high performance and developer friendliness. We’ll explore the ways in which Ratpack and Spring Boot work in harmony."
