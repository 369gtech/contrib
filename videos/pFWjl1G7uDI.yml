description: 'In this session Andy Rivenes (@TheInMemoryGuy) and Maria Colgan (@SQLMaria) reviewed how Automatic In-Memory (AIM) works in 18c and then discussed how the new 21c AIM changes work. We ran some demos to show the new HIGH mode of AIM and how it can automatically manage the contents of the IM column store based on segment activity.'
