recordingDate: 1537130990
description: "In this talk I will provide the introduction of machine learning and it’s process flow. I’ll be going to discuss on the supervised or unsupervised learning methods.\n\nI’ll discuss cognitive automation with machine learning in different areas of cyber security domains like Risk Analytics, Threat Analytics, Fraud Detection, Improvement of a security incident, Intrusion Detection. In addition, I will also cover incident and event-based management analysis by analytics engine with the predictive model builds, maintenance and dynamic assessment. It will involve network traffic analysis, forensics capabilities, impact assessment, behavioral monitoring, threat intelligence feeds, payloads analysis, threat correlation and other different analytics operations.\n\nI’ll also showcase how machine learning adds value to the business of fraud detection and its mechanisms while comparing the traditional means on how they will be improvised with the help machine learning.\n\n=== \n\nRishi has wide experience in the different areas of cyber security domains includes Security Auditing, Application security, Risk management, Threat and vulnerability management and Business Continuity & Disaster recovery. He has been recognized by great companies like Google, Nokia, Adobe for discovering application security flaws. His expertise helps him to lead the big project like setting up of centralized TVM system, IT-Sec Governance of one of south-east Asia bank hosted in 5 countries, Design & Development of Cybersecurity unit for a billion-dollar company, Cyber Security Lab setup. He also has a Masters degree in engineering with Information security discipline that influences him to review IEEE white papers and write the various article on the different topics of cybersecurity."
