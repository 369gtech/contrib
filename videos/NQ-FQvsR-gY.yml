title: 'Building user-adaptive interfaces with preference media queries | Workshop'
language: English
recordingDate: 1621628198
description: "In this Workshop, we are transforming and adapting a plain hypertext markup language (HTML) form with cascading style sheet (CSS) only, making it themeable, responsive, and animated. We use device-based media queries, user-based media queries, logical properties, and relative units to customize the interface to the context and preferences the user needs. As we customize, we use DevTools to inspect, emulate and verify that our design can adapt to as many users as possible.\n\nSpeaker: Adam Argyle\n\nWatch more:\nWeb at Google I/O 2021 Playlist → https://goo.gle/io21-ChromeDevs\nAll Google I/O 2021 Workshops → https://goo.gle/io21-workshops\nAll Google I/O 2021 Sessions → https://goo.gle/io21-allsessions\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs​ \n\n\n #GoogleIO #Web\n\n\n\nproduct: Chrome - General, Chrome - Web - Chrome DevTools; event: Google I/O 2021; fullname: Adam Argyle; re_ty: Livestream;"
