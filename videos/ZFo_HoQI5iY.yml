description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nJan will talk about building, maintaining and evolving production microservice systems over a many years. He will show architectural and implementation choices to implement distributed systems in vehicle IoT, reliable medical messaging, biometric security, and video streaming. The talk will cover everything from good Scala code, through best practices in use of Akka (Persistence, Cluster, HTTP, Streaming): highlighting the need for asynchronous I/O and messaging, while managing the complexity of implementation, debugging and monitoring, distributed state and the implication of maintaining distributed state particularly when it comes to consistency, all the way to documentable and expressive protocols and APIs.\n\nCome to Jan's talk if you are about to start a large-scale microservices system and wonder what potential challenges await you: learn how to make the most of the Lightbend stack ecosystem of tools and frameworks, together with the necessary infrastructure to keep the system running. The examples Jan will show, together with the code on his GitHub repository, will give you the needed boost—years of consultancy experience—to your microservices project."
