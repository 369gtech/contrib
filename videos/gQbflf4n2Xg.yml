title: '[VDT18] Stateful & Reactive Stream Processing Applications Without a Database by Hans-Peter Grahsl'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540486757
description: 'Time and again we should move out of our comfort zone and take the opportunity to experiment with new ways to build applications. Based on an easy to understand example we will look at a different, for some of us unconventional and radical way to build modern data-centric applications. For that purpose, we are going to discuss a stateful streaming application on top of Apache Kafka and integrate with Spring Boot 2.0 in order to provide a reactive WebAPI which allows clients to consume data changes in near real-time. All of this without explicitly using or managing an external database.'
