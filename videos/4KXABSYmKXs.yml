description: "Bringing the promise of WebRTC, from conception to reality, takes more than writing a few lines of javascript. It requires a lot of detail, a range of considerations, and usually a lot of troubleshooting. \n\nBen Strong, CEO at vLine, wants your experience building apps for WebRTC to be easier. This presentation provides you with a series of best practices that Ben says he learned from months of banging his head against the wall.
