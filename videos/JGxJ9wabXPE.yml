description: "Luerl: Lua in Erlang Luerl introduction emphasizing its trade-off as scripting skin on top of the BEAM ecosystem.\nby Jean Chassoul\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.201/luainerlang.webm\n\n\nLuerl is an implementation of standard Lua 5.3 written in Erlang/OTP. Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language common in games, IoT devices, machine learning and scientific computing research. \n\nThe Luerl VM is a mixture of interpreting Lua VM instructions and using Erlang directly to implement function calls. \n\nThrough the use of Erlang functions, Luerl can be augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, creating a customized language sharing a syntactical framework. \n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:50:00+01"
