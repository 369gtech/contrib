description: 'When performance hits rock-bottom everybody (and their dog) is called upon and all of a sudden developers should have been responsible for last half a year or so and code with performance in mind (and deadlines, but that of course goes unsaid). So, here I''m talking about what can a dev do to meet those unreasonable demands and what might he do anticipating them. Strictly JVM, mostly Sun Hotspot impl, but number of points can be used to other JVMs as well.With more time, I usually show also tools available both on OS and JDK side.'
