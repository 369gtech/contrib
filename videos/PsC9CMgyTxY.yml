recordingDate: 1331231001
description: "Ethics of Big Data is about finding alignment between an organization's core values and their day-to-day actions in a way that balances risk and innovation. As Big Data brings business operations and practices deeper and more fully into individual lives, it is creating a forcing function that raises ethical questions about our values around concepts like identity, privacy, ownership, and reputation. How we understand those values and align them with our actions when innovating products and services using Big Data technologies benefits from a framework that provides a common vocabulary and encourages explicit discussion.\n\nThe material will address the intersection of ethics and Big Data; what it is and what it isn't. Specifically, how to approach and generate dialog about an abstract subject with direct, real-world implications. A general framework for talking about ethics in the context of Big Data will be introduced.\n\nAspects include:\n\n -Direct relevance to your data handling practices\n-How Big Data is influencing important concepts including identity, privacy, ownership, and reputation\n-Ethical Decision Points\n-Value Personas as a tool for encouraging discussion and generating           agreement and alignment between values and actions\n-Balancing the benefits of Big Data innovation and the risks of harm\n\nThe webcast will present key concepts from the forthcoming book Ethics of Big Data\n\nAbout Kord Davis:\n\nKord Davis is a former Principal Consultant with Cap Gemini and has spent nearly 20 years providing business strategy, analysis, and technical consulting to over 100 organizations of all sizes including: Autotask, Microsoft, Intel, Sisters of Mercy Healthcare, Nike, Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Northwest Energy Alliance (NEEA), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Western Digital, Fluke, Merix, Roadway Express, and Gardenburger.
