Due to war Lana had to leave Damascus and decided not to let the war stand between her and achieving her dreams. She pursued again dental medicine studies at the Charité in the german capital.\nAs a very strong believer in the co-creation design model and her Syrian origins, Lana plays a vital role in shaping the ReDI program and building bridges between the new comers and Berlin locals, as the ReDI program focuses on innovation and co-creation in tackling the refugees crisis under the motto, \"don't talk about refugees, talk to them!”. ReDI focuses on connecting technology and humanity together, to facilitate building ideas and solutions together. This social startup sees the new-comers as enrichment and a great opportunity for a diverse and prosperous Europe.\nLana believes that her role at ReDI is her active way of giving back and building solid and coherent integrated society.\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://www.instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
