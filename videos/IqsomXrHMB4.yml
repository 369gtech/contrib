recordingDate: 1320883743
description: "Vladimir Vuksan\r\nPrincipal Systems Analyst, Broadcom\r\n\r\nHow Back-end Monitoring Can Make Your Applications Faster and More Available\r\n\r\nYou have worked hard on optimizing your HTML, CSS and JS but have you looked at your application back-end. Do you know what your average or 90th percentile back-end response times are? Do you know what HTTP 200/300/400/500 codes are and what their relevance is? Do you know how quickly some of your common queries execute or what external API response times are? In this presentation we'll attempt to answer some of those questions by showing how those basic metrics relate to your performance and try to get you thinking on what else you should add to have better insight into your infrastructure. Some of the tools shown will include Ganglia and statsd, but concepts will be applicable to a wide variety of other tools."
