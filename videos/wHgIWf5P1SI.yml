description: "Bradford Wetmore, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\nXue-Lei Fan, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\n\nThe long-awaited Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.3 is in the last stages of approval by the IETF. This is a major overhaul of the existing TLS 1.2 standard, which provides network communications with authentication, confidentiality (encryption), and message integrity. TLSv1.3’s main benefits include improved security and better performance:\n• Modern cryptographic algorithms were added, and obsolete and insecure algorithms such as static RSA, DH, SHA-1, RC4, DES, 3DES, and MD5 were removed.\n• Most handshake messages are now encrypted.\n• The number of round-trips required during TLS handshaking was reduced.\n\nThis session shares details and the current status of the JDK TLS v1.3 implementation."
