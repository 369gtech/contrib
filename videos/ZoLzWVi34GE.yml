description: "Full video course: https://angularmaster.dev\n\n0:00 - Start of transmission\n12:49 - Start of the webinar : Micro Frontends with Module Federation and Angular 12\n1:23:31 - Course explanation: Angular Architecture Online Course: Strategic Design with Nx and Micro Frontends\n1:34:23 - S&A Session\n\nMicro Frontends with Module Federation and Angular 12:\nWhen? How? What's next for Angular 12?\n\nThe much-discussed Micro-Frontends have challenges and trade-offs. Many wonder whether their benefits would pay off for their projects and how to implement them.\nThis session sheds some light on the matter.\n\nWe start by exploring several real-world use cases I have helped plan and implement in recent years. They are from different industries: Finance and accounting, banking, and insurance. We also discuss projects where we deliberately decided against Micro-Frontends. With this background, we set out reasons to use, or not use, this new architectural style.\n\nIn the second part we look at implementation strategies such as Module Federation, a game-changer for Micro-Frontends even beyond SPA. After seeing how to integrate it with Angular and the CLI, we discuss consequences, trade-offs, and alternatives.\n\nAlso, we discuss new possibilities in cooperation with Angular 12 and @angular-architects/module-federation. Be there when we announce some hot new features.\n\nBy the end, it will be clear whether Micro-Frontends are a good choice for your project and how to implement them."
