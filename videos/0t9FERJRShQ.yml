description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2018 Conference https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nThe dark ages of IoT\n\nAdvertisements suggest that we are at the zenith of mankind's scientific knowledge and technological power, but when it comes to IoT and the so-called 'Smart Home', we are clearly not. In fact, we are in the middle of the dark age. I'll explain the challenges that we're facing today (from an implementors perspective), what's 'wrong' with our current products & show you how a smart 'Smart Home' experience could look like in the near future."
