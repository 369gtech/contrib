description: 'Discussions abound about the ‘future of Java’ though most of them are actually focused on the here and now. What are the consequences of Java 9 modularity, of moving JEE to Eclipse, of running your application in the cloud? All questions that are important now. but what are the important questions for tomorrow? In this talk learn about IBM’s view on the real future of Java. See how new hardware technologies, new software approaches and new ideas are powering Java towards a life far removed from that envisioned at its inception. It’s time to look up and see how you will need to change how you think: Whether it’s driven by AI or Quantum Computers the problems of tomorrow demand new approaches and new thinking. Are you ready?'
