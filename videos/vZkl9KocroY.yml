description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nUnraveling the Mystery of Versioning CRDs - Harsh Thakur, Civo\n\nCRDs have given birth to a lot of projects by extending Kubernetes. As these projects grow, the definitions of the resource start to evolve and maybe completely change, thus requiring versioning of CRDs. Versioning of CRDs can be tough as the end users need to be provided with seamless upgrades, zero downtime and backwards compatibility. Have you asked yourself questions like: “Do I need a conversion webhook if I am just changing the validations?” , “How do I migrate the existing CRs to the new version?” .This talk aims to explain the CRD lifecycle and help users quickly catch up with the changes happening in the CRD ecosystem."
