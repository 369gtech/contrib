description: "Sarvesh Nagpal and Toby Walker, Microsoft\n\nAbstract: \nGo beyond standard analytics and dive into a world where you can see your product from your user’s perspective. In the wild west of devices and browsers, what you think you are serving and what your users see can be completely different—devices, plugin, proxies and networks can all change and degrade the quality of your experience. And these problems are expensive. In one case at Microsoft a user experience issue caused millions of dollars in lost revenue.\n\nIn this talk we'll share how to close the gap between what the user experience you think you are providing and what your actual users experience. By combining rich client and server telemetry, integrating it with big data visualization and ML-based detection, we show how you detect user experience issues and understand their impact on your product. We’ll share case studies of how we apply this to Microsoft’s large scale product in solving real-world problems and identifying opportunities that drive business growth.\n\nCome join us to learn more and see how this can help solve your own product issues.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
