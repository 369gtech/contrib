title: 'FAKE + Paket â€“ PowerTools for .NET developers - Steffen Forkmann'
language: German
recordingDate: 1499244117
description: "FAKE - F# Make is a build automation system with capabilities which are similar to make and rake. It is using an easy domain-specific language (DSL) which allows you to express your build logic in F#.\n\nPaket is a dependency manager for .NET and mono projects, which is designed to work well with NuGet packages and also enables referencing files directly from GitHub repositories. It enables precise and predictable control over what packages the projects within your application reference.\n\nThe talk will show you how to set up basic build scripts with FAKE and gives you an overview about dependency management with Paket. This talk is for every .NET developer that wants to get rid of the problems that come with XML build scripts and NuGet dependency chaos."
