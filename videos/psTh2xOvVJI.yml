description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWhose Sign Is It Anyway? - Marina Moore, NYU & Matthew Riley, Google\n\nCode signing is the security foundation of the software supply chains we rely on every day. But if you let yourself think about it for too long -- like we have -- it starts to seem weird that we’re so sure a random download won’t steal our credentials or ransom our data just because someone, somewhere happened to choose a very special point on an elliptic curve.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore what a digital signature really means -- and what it doesn’t. We’ll look at the implications of policy choices around key handling, what gets signed, and when we call a signature \"valid\". And we’ll dive so deeply into the very idea of identity that you may begin to question the nature of your reality."
