description: "Dashboards for DevOps: How to Set Up the Right Reports\n\nBrian Price, Vice President of Commercial Services, Stratus Solutions\nDave Page, Senior Systems Engineer, Stratus Solutions\n\nWhat metrics matter to you and your team to monitor their efficiency and effectiveness to deliver software? And are these the same metrics that matter to other teams you work with? \n\nJoin us as we discuss the tactics used to highlight the information teams need to track their deliveries and pipelines and provide relevant insight across the entire development environment. Learn how easy it is to expose metrics that allow teams to:\n\n• Predict production release and deployment success rates leveraging CI/CD metrics from ElectricFlow\n• Empower Ops teams and give them more confidence in application updates by providing shared visibility of the end-to-end deployment pipeline\n• Troubleshoot and optimize the end-to-end DevOps pipeline with a consolidated view to identify potential bottlenecks\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
