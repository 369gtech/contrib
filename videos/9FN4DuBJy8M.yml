description: "Agile Integration with Apache Camel microservices in containers on Kubernetes\n\nHow to get started developing Camel microservices (or any Java technology for that matter) on a local Kubernetes cluster from zero to deployment. As a Java developer it may be daunting to know how to get started how to develop container applications that runs on Kubernetes cluster. Using minikube its very easy to run a local cluster and with the help of fabric8 tooling its even easier to install and run using familiar tools like Maven. In this talk we will build a set of Apache Camel and Java based Microservices that uses Spring Boot and WildFly Swarm. With the help of fabric8 maven tooling you will see how to build, deploy, and run your Java projects on a Kubernetes cluster (local or remote). And even live debugging is easy to do as well. We will discuss practices how to build distributed and fault tolerant microservices using technologies such as Kubernetes Services, Netflix Hysterix, and Camel EIP patterns for fault tolerance. In the talk you will also hear about related open source projects where you can go explore more such as fabric8, openshift.io, istio, etc. This presentation is a 50/50 mix between slides and demo."
