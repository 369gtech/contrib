description: "Dan Mcghan, Oracle\n\nDrivers make it easy to connect to and run statements against a database. That means they’re perfect for creating RESTful APIs, right? Well, you’ll want to add some pagination capabilities, maybe sorting controls, and what about some generic filtering options too? You could do all that with the driver and some smart code, but isn’t there an easier way? Of course there is! In this session, attendees will learn about some of the challenges associated with manual API creation using drivers. Once those are understood, the presentation explores several tools that offer similar functionality out of the box, including Loopback, Sails, and ORDS."
