description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nIn this session, Kevin will present a condensed history of open source software: its origins, motivations and effect on the world of software development. He'll then talk about open source *beyond* software, and various ways that students can get involved in open source projects to develop useful (and marketable) skills. These are skills which are not taught in most degree programs, but are very valuable for jobs in scientific and engineering disciplines.\n— \nI manage community development and evangelism at Bloomberg, spanning our activities in the open source, open standards and academic communities. Ask me about open source software, open source licensing, and C++!\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
