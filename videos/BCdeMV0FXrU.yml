description: "Setting up the server infrastructure for an application is tough enough, but the real challenge lies in keeping those servers running. What if we could do away with that headache?!Amazon Webservices has been building out their platform at a breakneck speed over the past few years.\n\nBut with the recent introduction and now maturing of AWS Lambda we have the missing piece of the puzzle to get rid of our servers entirely.In this talk we will be discussing how I build 404check.io. A real, almost infinitely scalable application that integrates many of the hosted solutions offered by Amazon to achieve that dream of no more monitoring of servers & processes.We will see how AWS Lambda makes it very easy to integrate API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cloudfront, Simple Queueing Service and Simple Email Service into a coherent whole in a serverless architecture."
