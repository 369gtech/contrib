description: "Just like any other technological breakthrough, Artificial Intelligence also triggers a lot of extreme opinions. Some see it as the end of humanity, while some call it the biggest revolution ever and something that will solve all our problems.\r\n\r\nWith the quick progress in AI and all the noise around it, it is hard to keep track of where we are. This session will take a step back and review the state of AI systems as of today. In some areas, AI can do better than humans, while there are areas that are unlikely to be tackled anytime soon. This guide will help you get a broader sense of where AI is today, where it may be in the near future, and how you can get involved.v - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf with the Ustream Mobile App"
