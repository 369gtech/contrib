description: "William Lin is one of the world's all-time greatest competitive programmers. This champion is only 18 years old, got into MIT, and is already an International Grandmaster on CodeForces. I decided to invite him to my game show to test his skills by challenging him to a mixture of classic CP questions from CodeChef & novel Machine Learning CP questions. Will he be able to answer each one successfully? Can he win the 1MM point prize? Is Python better than C++? Find out in this episode, enjoy! \n\nPlease Subscribe! And Like. And Comment.
