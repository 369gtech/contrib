description: "AI design requires a fundamentally new type of design thinking. How can we identify and address the new challenges of designing intelligent and connected devices and experiences for people? In this talk, we’ll discuss what we’ve learned, market opportunities, design trends, methods for prototyping, and new opportunities for innovation — and that Billy Bass Alexa hack.\n\nBrian Kane currently lives and works in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He received a BFA in painting from Rhode Island School of Design in 1987, where he also teaches. His sculpture, interactive, and video work has shown in many museum and gallery exhibitions, and his pioneering real time video sampling techniques was influential to a generation of media artists. He was a founding member of the video art group EBN, and a primary collaborator with Amorphic Robot Works. His latest work “Healing Tool” is a disappearing billboard."
