title: 'Build containerized microservices faster and ship with confidence using Visual Studio | BOD122'
recordingDate: 1590415095
description: "\"A typical developer workflow for developing microservice applications that target Kubernetes involves modifying code, building a container image and deploying that image to a Kubernetes cluster. All this, just to see the changes manifest. The complexity of this workflow multiple times a day impedes developersâ€™ ability to perform the core of the inner loop tasks. This process should and can be easier.\nJoin us in learning how to use Visual Studio Code, Azure Kubernetes Service and Dev Spaces to achieve a faster-inner loop experience while using familiar dev tools. Then push your changes to GitHub and let the pull request workflow create a review environment where updates can be tested end-to-end.\"\n\nMicrosoft Learn -- https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nMicrosoft Docs -- https://docs.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nChannel 9 -- https://channel9.msdn.com/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\n\n\nRelated Sessions\nINT158C -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT158C?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco\nINT158B -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT158B?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco\nINT158A -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT158A?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco"
