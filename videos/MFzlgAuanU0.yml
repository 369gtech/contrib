title: 'CON6851   API Design with Java 8 Lambdas and Streams'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449578951
description: "During Java’s 20-year history, a set of API design idioms and styles has emerged, based on the existing language features and APIs. Certain language features, such as generics, have had a great impact: 12 years after their introduction, APIs that use raw types look distinctly old-fashioned. Java 8 has introduced lambda expressions, methods implementations in interfaces, and a new Streams library. These changes raise new design issues for API designers. Like previous changes to the language, the new Java 8 features will have an impact on the way APIs are designed and used. This presentation examines a variety of techniques and idioms enabled by these new features and shows how API design has already begun to evolve in Java 8.\n\nSpeakers:\nBrian Goetz, Java Language Architect, Oracle\nBrian Goetz is the Java Language Architect at Oracle, and was specification lead for JSR-335 (Lambda Expressions for the Java Language.) He is the author of the best-selling book \"Java Concurrency in Practice\" and is a frequent presenter at major industry conferences.\n\nStuart Marks, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\nStuart Marks is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Java Platform Group at Oracle. He is currently working on a variety of JDK core libraries projects, including Collections, Lambda, and Streams, as well as improving test quality and performance. He has previously worked on JavaFX and Java ME at Sun Microsystems. He has over twenty years of software platform product development experience in the areas of window systems, interactive graphics, and mobile and embedded systems. Stuart holds a Master's degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University."
