title: 'Codemotion Berlin 2019 I Predicting the Future of Web Development - Richard Feldman, NoRedInk'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601628139
description: "The Web has changed a lot since its creation as a platform for static articles. Early Web apps used servers generating HTML on the fly. PHP was huge, then declined as JS rose. Flash came and went. Today, the one thing we can be sure of is that more changes are yet to come. What changes can Web developers expect between the Web of 2019 and the Web of 2020? What about 2025? In this talk, Richard draws on 12 years of professional Web development experience, and of being an early adopter of React in 2013 and Elm in 2014, to justify several concrete predictions about the Web in 2020 and 2025.\n\n\nAbout:\nRichard Feldman, Head of Technology - NoRedInk\n\nRichard is the author of “Elm in Action” from Manning Publications, and the instructor for the Frontend Masters Introduction to Elm and Advanced Elm workshops. He is a member of the Elm Core Team and works at NoRedInk, which has over 300,000 lines of Elm code in production, and which has employed Elm creator Evan Czaplicki since 2016. In his free time, Richard hosts the Philadelphia Elm Meetup and maintains open-source Elm libraries such as elm-test and elm-css. Some have said he’s “a fan of Elm,” but he’s not sure where they got that wild idea."
