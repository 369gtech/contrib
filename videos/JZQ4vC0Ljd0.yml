description: "Infrastructure, especially in a cloud-based environment is complex, dynamic and consists of many unique components. If you take a quick look under the hood of any cloud-based infrastructure project, you will find that many of elements involved are tightly intertwined leading to higher maintenance costs and a chaotic environment.\n\nFortunately, using infrastructure as code goes a long way to resolving these issues but if consistent standards are not enforced, you may be left with the same kind of mess you were trying to avoid in the first place.\n\nIn this presentation, I'll show how easily you can define your whole infrastructure stack, including all of the myriad relationships between components and the standards that govern them, in a simple Groovy DSL using the InfraDSL project as an example. Implementing this approach will make managing your systems easy to do and scalable."
