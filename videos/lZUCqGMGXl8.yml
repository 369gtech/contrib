title: 'Doing it the Hard Way - Building a Vulkan VR Engine for Linux'
recordingDate: 1548377895
description: "Pete Black\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/118/\n\nAfter becoming frustrated with the lack of support for Linux by the major graphics/game engine vendors, Pete set out to climb one of the steeper learning-curves in modern computing, and  write his own Vulkan VR Engine. \r\n\r\nThis talk will provide an overview of the current state of VR technology on Linux, information gained from first-hand experience developing with the Vulkan API, and  share a developers journey from 'first-triangle' to some of the cool stuff the engine now supports, some of the doors that this work opened, and what the future holds.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
