I owe my career to learning, starting from when I signed up for a bootcamp and plunged headfirst into Rails. I did not learn alone--I was surrounded by a group of people who came together around a set of educational goals.\n\nAfter three years of working on software teams, I find myself intrigued by questions that take me back to my undergrad studies in the social sciences. In this talk I will weave together my personal experience in tech with social science research to start a conversation about creating inclusive, knowledge-sharing communities."
