language: English
recordingDate: 1590610813
description: "It’s 10 PM...do you know where your APIs are?\n\nThere is growing adoption of Kubernetes apps alongside legacy application clusters, and this change is accelerating with the adoption of hybrid clouds and the use of multiple cloud providers. However, multiple K8s and legacy app clusters introduce operational challenges for application discovery, delivery, and security -- especially with the rapid spread of APIs. This session will focus on understanding these challenges and introduce an architecture that can alleviate them across any cloud, including a developer’s local machine.\n\nIn this webinar, Jakub and Madhukar will cover:\n\n* The API-related challenges of modern application delivery across multiple Kubernetes clusters and locations\n* How a distributed cloud architecture can address end-to-end the discovery, delivery, security and observability of APIs\n* A live demo of discovering, delivering, and securing APIs across multiple clusters\n\nPresenter:\n\nJakub Pavlik, Director of Engineering\_@Volterra\nMadhukar Nayakbomman, Lead Solutions Engineer\_@Volterra"
