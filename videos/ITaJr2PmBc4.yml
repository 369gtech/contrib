description: 'Everyone who calls themselves a "coder" had to start somewhere. For some of us, that start was in an unrelated field. This talk brings you along on a young doctor''s joyous journey from the wondrous world of medical academia into the terrifying territory of tech. We''ll reflect on differences and similarities between the medical and technical worlds and the learning process after a career switch. We''ll discuss practical insights in what makes tech learning unique and what might make it better, and "behind the scenes of tech" glimpses that left this newbie coder wishing for blissful ignorance.'
