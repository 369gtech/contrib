language: English
recordingDate: 1614254618
description: "Developing technical skills is a crucial aspect of achieving business agility. Many organisations are trying to deliver “potentially” shippable product every iteration but setting a time limit for our iterations and doing stand-ups is not going to be enough to get the job done.\n\nIn the last session, José E. Rodríguez Huerta, Managing Director at Codurance Spain, took a bird’s eye view of the technical coaching process, tools available, content you can use, etc. Here, we will focus on discovering the current team context, creating a baseline and setting learning objectives through which to develop and measure the team’s technical skills effectively.\n\nThank you José for this amazing talk!\n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
