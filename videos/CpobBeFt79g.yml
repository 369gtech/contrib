description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeakers: Andy Clement, Martin Lippert, Andrew Eisenberg\nMore and more applications are being built with JavaScript, and not only for the client side but also utilising JavaScript server side. As the complexity of JavaScript applications increases there is a need for the tools to improve -- textmate isn't necessarily the answer! The user shouldn't need to lower their expectations when stepping out of amazing Java tools and tackling JavaScript development. In this session we will present our vision for tooling for the JavaScript era and demo some early versions and prototypes of what we think the next generation JavaScript tools could look like.\n\nAttendees will see a lot of live demos during the session. At the end we will open-up the session for feedback on what we've talked about and demo'd."
