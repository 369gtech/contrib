title: 'Plenary: Neighborhoods Banding Together: Reasoning Globally about Programs - Lisa Lippincott -CppCon'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601780410
description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nOur most detailed reasoning about programs is done locally: we consider a neighborhood of a program — usually a single function and the interfaces surrounding it — and reason about its behavior without reference to the remainder of the program. But this reasoning is in service of a larger goal: we want to ensure that the entire program behaves correctly.\n\nIn this talk, I will take local reasoning for granted, and look at the process of joining neighborhoods of local reasoning together, and the global reasoning that ensures they form a coherent whole. I will show how we can prevent incoherent joining, and prevent the emergence of unbounded non-local recursion as the program is linked together.\n\nThis talk builds upon the discussion of local reasoning in last year's talk \"The Truth of a Procedure,” but is intended to be understandable independently.\n\n---\nLisa Lippincott designed the software architectures of Tanium and BigFix, two systems for managing large fleets of computers. She's also a language nerd, and has contributed to arcane parts of the C++ standard. In her spare time, she studies mathematical logic, and wants to make computer-checked proofs of correctness a routine part of programming.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
