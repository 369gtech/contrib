description: "Tanner Lund, Microsoft\n\nMany companies become frustrated with their postmortem and incident review process, feeling that it is a burden, or that it does not provide meaningful insights, or that the repairs and learnings generated do not help prevent repeats or other incidents. Fortunately, there is a better way to do things, backed by decades of scientific rigor and proven in industries where outages can mean a lot worse than lost revenue.\n\nJoin our fictional company, \"Potato Systems‚\" as they deal with the aftermath of a catastrophic incident. As they struggle to learn from it and move forward, they—and we—will come to understand the stark contrast in outcomes and effectiveness of Safety I vs Safety II thinking.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
