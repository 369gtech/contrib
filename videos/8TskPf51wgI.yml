description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWhat You Need to Know Before Using Local Persistent Volumes - Sebastien Guilloux, Elastic\n\nAs Kubernetes matures, it becomes easier to run distributed databases and other stateful workloads on top of it. In order to do so, one important thing to figure out is how to manage persistent data. Local PersistentVolumes, as opposed to network-attached ones, can be particularly tricky to operate at scale. In this talk we will explore various options to make use of local volumes, along with a few important gotchas to be aware of. Come learn about static vs. dynamic provisioning, storage-aware scheduling problems, host failures, upgrades, and why your Pods may stay stuck in a Pending state."
