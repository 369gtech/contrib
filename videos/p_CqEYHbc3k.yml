title: 'Getting an Edge with Network Analysis with Python || Alon Nir'
language: English
recordingDate: 1591409712
description: "Networks are all around us. People, places, things and even ideas are inter-connected in innumerable networks, and these can have a great (yet sometimes inconspicuous) impact on our lives.\nThe purpose of this talk is to provide an introduction to network analysis and its importance, and present the basic building blocks for applied network analysis with Python (using the friendly NetworkX library). I hope this talk will encourage members of the audience to consider network analysis approaches in their line of work/research and intrigue them to learn more.\nThe talk will weave theory and practice, and given the limited time compared to the breadth of the topic, the focus would lean towards intuitive understanding of concepts and seeing them in practice, over deep theoretical formulations and hardcore mathematics.\n\nSPEAKER:\nAlon Nir\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish PyData talks.\n\nCREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxTLG7l-Fr0"
