description: "Nearly every app needs a database. Two of the most popular databases in the world are open source, and free to use. After 22 years in the industry, VMware knows everything about running databases in mission-critical environments and in the cloud. Now, we blend that expertise with our leadership in Kubernetes to bring you Tanzu SQL. We make it easy for Operators to set up a database service which provides cost-efficient and flexible deployments on-demand, automates time-consuming administration tasks, and satisfies enterprise requirements — on any cloud, anywhere.\n\n---\n\nJudy Wang\nJudy is the Product Manager for VMware Tanzu SQL, MySQL on Kubernetes and VMs. She enjoys exploring cloud native data solutions and strategies for enterprise customers to move their data onto the cloud.
