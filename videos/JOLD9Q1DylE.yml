Using functions to represent pictures, Henderson defines a small set of combinators to create a replica of Escher's recursive tessellation \"\"Square Limit\"\". It's a nice kata for functional programmers. However, you could also implement Henderson's combinators in concatenative languages, which excel at composition! In this talk, I'll show you how. For choice of language, I turn to PostScript, a proven and battle-worn concatenative language that has been on the plateau of productivity for decades. It's also rather good for drawing. With one neat trick, values on the stack can be captured inside an executable array, to simulate closures. And the rest is easy.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/einar-hoest/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - EINAR HØST\nComputer at NRK\n\nEinar W. Høst is a computer at NRK, the Norwegian public broadcaster. He thinks that programs should be written for people to read and also for machines to laugh at. He has a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Oslo.\n\nMore on Einar Høst: http://codesync.global/speaker/einar-hoest/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
