description: "Are you interested in developing high quality code by using Apache Geode? Do you want to simplify deployment processes for Apache Geode operators? Are you looking for no downtime CI-CD solution for Apache Geode? If your answer is yes, then this session is for you.\n\nApache Geode is a powerful open source in memory data grid (IMDG) solution based on distributed system architecture and design, however, devops against distributed systems in general is not trivial. In this session, Anu and Jeff will cover how to use Spring Boot, Ansible, and Concourse for Apache Geode application development, mock/integration tests, automated Apache Geode operations, and no downtime CI-CD pipeline that greatly improves Apache Geode devops experiences.\n\nSlides:\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/apache-geode-test-automation-and-continuous-integration-deployment-cicd\n \nAnupama Pradhan, Sr Technology Architect, HCSC\nJeff Cherng, Advisory Data Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
