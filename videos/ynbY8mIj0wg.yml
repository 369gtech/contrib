description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay 16, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAdium is now a widely-known multi-protocol chat program for the Mac, but this was not always so. Beginning as a single developer's pet project to learn Cocoa, Adium has evolved considerably through its 6 year history. This talk will discuss the best features of Adium, the major milestones in Adium's development, and where it looks to be going.\n\nSpeaker: Matt Handley\nMatt Handley is a PhD candidate at the University of Illinois - Chicago studying peer-to-peer massively-multiplayer online games. He was part of the SoC 2007, and implemented a brand-new AppleScript dictionary into Adium. This year, he is co-mentoring a project on unit testing with Peter Hosey.
