description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nMaven - Taming the Beast\n\nLove it or hate it (and a lot of people seem to hate it), Maven is a widely used tool. We can consider that Maven has been the de-facto standard build tool for Java over the last 10 years. Most experienced developers already got their share of Maven headaches. Unfortunately, new developers are going through the same hard learning process, because they don?t know how to deal with Maven particularities. \"Why is this jar in my build?\", \"I can't see my changes!\", \"The jar is not included in the distribution!\", \"The artifact was not found!\" are common problems. Learn to tame the Maven Beast and be in complete control of your build to save you countless hours of pain and frustration.\n\nRoberto Cortez, Tomitribe\n\nRoberto Cortez is a professional Java Developer working in the software development industry with more than 9 years of experience in finance, insurance, and government. His first contact with Java was in 1998 and he never looked back! He mainly works with Java EE technologies and is involved within the community to help other individuals to spread the knowledge or to just hang out. Working as a Freelancer it gave him the freedom to travel around the world and speak at conferences such as JavaOne, Devoxx FR, Jfokus, GeeCon, and others. He is also the leader of the Coimbra JUG and a regular blogger about Java related technologies. Now, he enjoys being part of the Tribe; working on the servers where everything happens, instead of just developing applications that run on a container."
