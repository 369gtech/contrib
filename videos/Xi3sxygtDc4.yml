description: "From its friendly developer experience to its performance benefits, a lot has been said about GraphQL. Underlying it all is the GraphQL query language, made possible by GraphQL schema language. These surprisingly versatile features have the potential to provide a single interface for all modern web app development concerns.\n\nWe will start with a case study on how we use GraphQL queries as an universal interface to resolve data over a variety of datasources ranging from remote HTTP requests, to local CSV files, and in-memory data stores. Next we will explore these ideas further, using GraphQL queries as an interface over the DOM and various other web APIs.\n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/michael-mifsud/graphql-towards-a-universal-query-language.html"
