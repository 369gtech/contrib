title: 'Andreas Nauerz - Wiring a Microservices Application Architecture to Respond to Events'
language: English
recordingDate: 1472140971
description: 'Cloud-native applications are heading towards a world of microservices, with application logic encapsulated in small projects. Responding to events generated by humans and machines is emerging as an element of these architectures. Save a document and a PDF copy is prepared for you, upload an image and a thumbnail is built in the background, send a video and it gets tagged automagically. This session will look at how event-based services allow developers to focus on the application logic while the services hide the complexity of the infrastructure and handle auto-scaling'
