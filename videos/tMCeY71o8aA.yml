description: "Intro + Deep Dive: Kubernetes (Docs) SIG - Zach Corleissen, Linux Foundation & Rael Garcia, CAPSiDE \n\nThis session covers Kubernetes (K8s) documentation. We'll do an overview of the docs--how they're organized, and how they're maintained--then contribute to the docs ourselves. During the introduction, we'll look at the docs repository (kubernetes/website) and how we organize content. We'll also look at the website stack: how we preview and publish docs to kubernetes.io. We'll talk about the docs workflow: how SIG Docs does the work to review and publish docs. During the deep dive, we'll explore the docs contributor guide and do some hands-on contribution. Remember that contributing to docs is a pathway to Kubernetes membership! \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPlA"
