description: "Being a mobile developer today looks nothing like it did five years ago. These days developers are finding themselves in board rooms and being consulted on platform strategies, revenue models, UX design and customer service. Mobile developer portfolios are greatly strengthened when a candidate can point to an app in an appstore and discuss not only the coding challenges he or she overcame, but also answer the business and marketing questions that are sure to come up. Without an app, developers must still find a way to differentiate beyond code. Developers who have adapted to this new reality are thriving and many are building their own companies with much success.\n\nIn this presentation, Pete Erickson, will discuss the shift that's taken place over the past three years and share his insights into the future role of the mobile developer.\n\nAbout Pete Erickson:\n\nPete Erickson is a nationally recognized leader in the technology scene facilitating and speaking at events across the country.
