title: 'The State of Kotlin Support in Spring'
language: English
recordingDate: 1571262145
description: "The first part of this talk is an overview of the state of the art of application development with Spring Boot 2.2 and Kotlin:\n- Immutable @ConfigurationProperties data classes\n- Testing with JUnit 5 and Mockk\n- The new router DSL for Spring MVC\n- Coroutines support for WebFlux, RSocket and Spring Data\n- Kotlin code snippets in Spring Framework documentation\n- MockMvc Kotlin DSL\n- Best practices (extensions, constructor based injection, etc.)\n\nThe second part is a live coding of a Spring Boot application configured with the Kofu, the Kotlin DSL currently developed in the Spring Fu incubator I have created a few months ago. It is an alternative to Spring Boot auto-configuration designed for configuring your application explicitly with auto-completion and custom configuration slices while still supporting most of Spring Boot features.\n\nSpeaker: SÃ©bastien Deleuze, Spring Framework committer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/the-state-of-kotlin-support-in-spring"
