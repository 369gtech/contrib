title: 'The Business Benefits of GitOps'
language: English
recordingDate: 1633494554
description: "\"GitOps may very well be the center square of the buzzword bingo card these days. However, in spite of all the fervor, there are real business benefits to be gained by embracing GitOps. Although leveraging the existing skill sets of developers seems like a good idea, there are many other elements of GitOps that can yield significant gains tied to business outcomes—but only if they're done right.\n\nIn this session, Cornelia Davis of Amazon will cover key GitOps principles and practices, and tie them to measurable IT outcomes, such as change failure rates and mean time to recovery—IT metrics that are intrinsically tied to digital transformation initiatives. Davis will also review research that has shown a correlation between these measures and where companies fall on the spectrum from high to low performers in terms of business outcomes.\"\n\nCornelia Davis, Product Management at Amazon\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/the-business-benefits-of-gitops"
