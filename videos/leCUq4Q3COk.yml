description: "Is UX and UI design reserved for people with artistic skills that can \"feel\" what's right? Or is there a more systematic approach we can take? We will talk about how you can predict, detect and avoid bad UI and UX, using a no-guess system created by Microsoft Research.\nWe will also look at a lot of user interface bloopers so that you can learn from others mistakes and don't have to fall into common UI traps."
