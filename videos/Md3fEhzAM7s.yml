description: "How to Do SRE When You Have No SRE\n\nJoan O'Callaghan, Udemy\n\nThis talk is for engineering organisations that don't have anyone dedicated to SRE type work, but you know enough to know that you really REALLY need it.\n\nWhere on earth can you even start? You want to make things better but you already have at least 2 other jobs to do as well. It doesn't seem possible.\n\nUnfortunately, you're also the person that will be stuck fixing things when it all breaks so it's doubly in your best interest to try to prevent disasters if you can.\n\nThis talk gives extremely practical and realistic advice of how to get started, even if you only have 1 hour a week to dedicate to it. It'll help you find your weakest points and make things a little better, even without dedicated resources. Step by step, you'll be able to make your org much more reliable and reduce your stress levels. Also, less things will be on fire.\n\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
