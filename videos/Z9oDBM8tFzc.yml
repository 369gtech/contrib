description: "The web has always been a place that is shaped by its community of users. In this spirit, Adobe's Test the Web Forward is a grassroots campaign to improve the quality of the web, by hosting hackathons and connecting people who care about the future of the web. \n\nRebecca Hauck, Computer Scientist on the Web Platform Team at Adobe, has been heavily involved in the program since its beginnings. She visited SFHTML5 to talk about web standards, how Test the Web Forward got started, and then invites you to join the movement!\n\n**Take a look at some additional video content on the latest topics in HTML5: http://marakana.com/s/tags/html5"
