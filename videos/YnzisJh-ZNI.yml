All via a series of live coding exercises, like you've probably never saw in your life!\n\nYou will hear about: Bloated Lambdas, A Happy Predicate, Stream Wrecks, How to Kill The Biggest Bug, Monads, Passing-a-block, The Loan Pattern, and 5 Ways to Implement Type-Specific Logic. Of course, as a Clean Code Maniac, Victor will always strive for maintainable, readable, elegant code. So you'll see a lot of refactoring.\n\nPS: You know, some Joe will maintain your Java8 code at some point. So let's just hope Joe would be a nice safe guy...\n\nVictor Rentea \nFrom Independent Trainer\nVictor is one of the top Independent Technical Trainers of his country (victorrentea.ro) - he mentored, trained and coached almost 1000 developers of top companies. At IBM, even though they call him a Lead Architect, he loves to write code each day: he's maniac about Clean Code, so prepare for some hard-core refactoring. Victor is Associate Professor of Politehnica University of Bucharest and an active Java community member: organized the largest 3 JUG meetups in Romania. He's a regular conference speaker. His live-coding sessions are insane, lightning-fast but well crafted, full of enthusiasm, insights and take-away tips. Things that he learned the hard way during his 14 years of experience. You'll love his sessions!"
