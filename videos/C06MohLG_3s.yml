title: '[JavaScript] Master the Art of the AST and Take Control of Your JS'

description: "Think about the new tools that are taking over the JavaScript ecosystem: Babel, TypeScript, Rollup, ESLint, and smarter IDEs. What do they all have in common: they all take JavaScript source code as input, and some emit JavaScript code as output. This talk will be a deep dive into the basic building block all these tools share: Transforming your code into a JS Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). You'll learn to read, traverse, and manipulate the AST so you can extend Babel by writing your own plugins, or by writing custom ESLint rules to enforce your team's code conventions. You'll also learn how to create super powerful \"code-mods\" to automatically convert thousands of legacy ES5 scripts to ES6 in seconds.\n\nEVENT:\n\nFull Stack Fest 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nYonatan Mevorach\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W9tUnALrLg&t=3s"
