recordingDate: 1548365414
description: "Christopher Lameter\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/233/\n\nAn introduction to Linux memory management at the levels of the basic mechanisms. The basics of paging. Understanding hardware memory management and the difference between virtual, physical and swap memory. How do determine the hardware installed and how to figure out the use of that memory by processes. How a process uses physical and virtual memory effectively. How to control overcommit and virtual and/or physical memory limits. \r\n\r\nAlso includes an introduction to the basic knobs in Linux to control memory management and system calls so that a process can control its memory usage.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
