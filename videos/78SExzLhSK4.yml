description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2018 Conference https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nHow to Sort Your Socks Using JavaScript \n\nNo matter your experience in JS, you have probably came across the Array#sort method at some point. Do you remember the first time you tried sorting numbers? You were probably astonished that the sort method does not sort things out quite as we might expect. Believe it or not, there is actually much more going on than meets the eye! Let’s get our computer science hat on and explore some useful sorting algorithms currently implemented by JS engines used by Node such as Chrome's V8 and Microsoft's Chakra. As a developer, learning how these algorithms work, why and when to use them will help you create more performant and consistent applications!"
