And yet, chaos engineering as applied to application, information, and cloud security still remains limited.\nAs we embrace cloud native technologies and application ecosystems that rely heavily on OSS dependencies to build ever increasing complex systems, we become severely challenged in our ability to secure our dev and ops lifecycle.\nIn this talk, Crystal will look at emerging patterns, concepts, and tools in the industry. Crystal will also highlight some discoveries from running [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:40 Why does bringing security into the mix matter?\n11:26 Getting started with security chaos engineering\n18:39 Game day exercises\n25:42 Realizing a strong DevSecOps culture\n29:27 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/february-2021/sessions/1705/discovering-risks-in-systems-design-chaos-engineering-in-application-and-cloud-security-how-dbs-dispelled-the-myths-of-chaos-engineering\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ChaosEngineering #SecurityChaosEngineering #Programming #SRE #SystemsDesign #CloudSecurity #Security #GameDay #OWASP #k8s #Kubernetes #DevSecOps #DevOps\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
