description: "JSLA May 31st, 2012 - Bartek Drozdz @bartekd\nI usually find technologies that interest me, experiment with them, publish demos I do and eventually use them in a commercial project. With WebGL it was different - my first contact with this technology was through a client project.\n\nI had to learn WebGL on the go. It took me a few months to actually start appreciating it, but once the project was over and I thought I know everything about it, I decided to write my own engine that I baptized simply J3D. After a good start, I realized I didn't know that much about WebGL after all... Since then I spent many day & nights (mostly nights) learning and creating what I believe is a good tool for other developers to start creating 3D applications in the browser.\n\nIn my presentation I talk about specific challenges when working WebGL projects and how J3D addresses them. I will also take you on a short walk-through of it's features and present some demos."
