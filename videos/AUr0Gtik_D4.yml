description: "From Strata + Hadoop World 2015 in London: We are at a pivotal moment in the history of healthcare. Information is now available on almost everything that determines our health, which in turn can be translated into better, more effective and more efficient care. Our healthcare system should be a digital pioneer, using data to provide better outcomes for the taxpayer and patients through improved and streamlined care.\n\nThe huge amount of data currently stored by the NHS represents an enormous untapped resource, when considering how our healthcare system can be made more effective. By centralizing these records and mining the information, crucial insights will be found into how resources can be allocated as efficiently as possible, and where the gaps in healthcare provision are to be found.\n\nIt is in all of our interests to embrace big data; however, the benefits of such a project have not been fully communicated to the public. More needs to be done to mitigate the fears and concerns of those worried about the use of our data and explain the life-enhancing benefits of data-driven healthcare.\n\nOne hospital in California has utilized Hadoop technology to build predictive models and algorithms that monitor trends to intercept and avert infections, and monitor patient recovery for complications, drastically improving the level of care provided for patients. Doctors are informed immediately when patients’ vitals cross a key threshold, enabling round-the-clock observation of large numbers of patients. The hospitals of the future are very much within reach, and here in the UK we should be leading the way.\n\nBig data can also be utilized to get to grips with the outbreak of an epidemic, enabling humanitarian agencies to determine where a disease is going to spread to next and therefore allocate resources in a target way to bring the outbreak under control. Real-time multi-center ingest collating unstructured data from a diverse array of sources offers unprecedented insights into how and where best to respond, and where precious resources would have the biggest impact.\n\nSponsored by WANdisco\n\nAbout David Richards (WANdisco):\nDavid is CEO, president and co-founder of WANdisco, and has quickly established WANdisco as one of the world’s most promising technology companies.\n\nSince co-founding the company in Silicon Valley in 2005, David has led WANdisco on a course for rapid international expansion, opening offices in the UK, Japan, and China.
