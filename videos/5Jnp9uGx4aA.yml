language: English
recordingDate: 1507317377
description: "Boris Scholl, Vice President, Product Development, Oracle\n\nClaudio Caldato, Oracle\n\nToday's microservices development and deployment choices are many and varied. Finding the right combination of tools, platforms, and practices can be daunting. With so many options, and so much of it \"free\" for the taking—that is, open source—how do you know before you start if your choices are right for your requirements, and if they afford the competitive advantage you seek? In this session learn how Oracle is building a platform on managed Kubernetes that puts developer productivity first, providing superior performance, security, networking, and manageability, while keeping full autonomy and choice in the hands of developers. Whether you build containerized microservices or use FaaS as part of your architecture, Oracle's new platform approach has you covered."
