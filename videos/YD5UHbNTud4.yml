description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nPanel: Tales from the Edge: Is the Edge More Important Than the Service Mesh? - Matt Klein, Lyft; Alyssa Wilk, Google; Lin Sun, IBM; & Bjorn Freeman-Benson, Ambassador Labs \n\nThe service mesh hype cycle is well and truly in effect, and almost everyone believes their organization needs a service mesh, even if some don’t fully understand the use case this technology covers. But what about the edge? Practically every Internet-based application needs to get traffic from users into backend services. Join this panel to learn about the importance of both use cases from a range of experts in the traffic management domain. Topics to be discussed include: - Opinions on the relevant importance of both the north-south (ingress) and east-west (service) traffic management use cases - Real-world adoption stories of cloud native proxies, such as Envoy - Experiences on migration to cloud native edge gateways - Tell-tale signs that an organization should consider adopting a service mesh (or not) - Technology choices in the edge gateway and service mesh space \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekD6"
