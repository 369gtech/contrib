title: 'Basic REST enablement (Video 1 - Oracle Cloud Native and Project Helidon)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1637245281
description: "In this video we explore how to use Helidon MP to simply REST enable a class using annotations.\n\nThis is part of a series of videos introducing Helidon MP, a Java based microservices framework from Oracle that implements the Eclipse MP standard.\n\nIn this set of videos we explore how Helidon can be used to modernise existing code (or of course create new code) and create microservices using Helidon MP with minimal effort. We see how to REST enable methods in the code and require authentication, to understand the importance of scope and how to utilise dependency injection and configuring using external properties, how to simply get access a database in a secure transactional manner, easily create client code to communicate between your microservices, implement features for availability in frameworks like Kubernetes and to generate self describing REST API Documentation.\n\nThe videos are based on a hands on lab, and if you wish you can follow along, details of how to get to the labs and template source code are at the end of each video.\n\nFor more information on Helidon please see http://helidon.io \n\nLink to other videos: https://youtu.be/1RCqF2zYUvo"
