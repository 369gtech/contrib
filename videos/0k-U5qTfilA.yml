And Cloud Run has become a defacto container runtime service to production in seconds. Based on practical examples we will demonstrate how Cloud Run scores high in terms of developer experience. It differs from functions runtime as You can bring your own container, your own code, a folder, or binarys and it pairs great with the container ecosystem: Cloud Build, Cloud Code, Artifact Registry, and Docker. Each Cloud Run service gets an out-of-the-box stable HTTPS endpoint, with TLS termination handled for you. Map your services to your own domains and use either for web sites, backend APIs, workflows, invoke and connect services with the newest protocols of HTTP/2, WebSockets or gRPC (unary and streaming). Cloud Run is serverless containers, which means you don't have to fiddle with infrastructure or back-end resources to run applications.\n\nSpeaker\nMarton Kodok https://twitter.com/MartonKodok"
