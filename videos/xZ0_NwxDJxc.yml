title: 'Migrate your Web Apps to ASP.NET Core, one page at a time - Mark Rendle - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623401602
description: "Do you have an ASP.NET WebForms or MVC application that you’d like to migrate to ASP.NET Core, but it’s going to take ages and you can’t justify the time? \nWhat if I told you there was a way to migrate one page at a time, keeping everything else running normally? Well, there is. In this talk, I’ll show you how to include Microsoft’s reverse proxy in an ASP.NET Core MVC application to proxy requests to your old ASP.NET app, but intercept specific pages and render them using shiny new Razor. With this approach, you can gradually migrate and upgrade your application at the same time as maintaining and supporting it. It may take years, but you’ll get there in the end!"
