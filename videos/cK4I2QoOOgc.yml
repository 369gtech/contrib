description: "Coming Soon to a Cloud Near You: Multiple Buildpack Support - Keaty Gross & Stephen Levine, Pivotal    \n\n\"The Buildpacks Team just wrapped work on multiple buildpack support and we want to share the good news!\nThis latest Cloud Foundry feature allows applications to leverage a mixture of different technologies in one `push`, permitting strategic use of multiple languages in one app or app-embedded additional processes. This will come as welcome news to users interested in building apps of this type in the future, or to users who already have but had to switch to Docker containers or custom buildpacks to achieve these ends.\nAttend this talk if you’d like to learn more about what multi-buildpacks do under the hood, how they differ from their predecessor the multi-buildpack buildpack, or where this feature might come in handy in the future. As an added bonus for the uninitiated, we’ll even provide a bit of insight into what exactly happens when you `cf push`. Appropriate for all experience levels.\"\n\nKeaty Gross\nSoftware Engineer, Pivotal\nKeaty Gross is a Pivotal CF engineering manager, currently enjoying allocation to Buildpacks team. She has given talks about (P)CF products at CF Summit Shanghai and SpringOne Platform.\n\nStephen Levine\nStephen Levine is a Pivotal CF Product Manager on Buildpacks team. He’s been known to leave unsuspecting coworkers’ keyboards set to Dvorak. This is his first time presenting, so be nice."
