title: 'The quantum computers are coming by Alasdair Collinson'

description: 'Many people may not know it, but we live in a time where the first quantum computers have been created - and they’re pretty damn cool. Why? Because while regular bits are limited to only two boring values, QBITs can take near infinite values and operate singularly or in harmony with each other. This outstanding property gives rise to a new kind of algorithms (and a lot of fun!). Follow me on a journey from Zuses Z3 computer and Schrödingers cat to supercooled quantum processors and parallel universes - no PhD in physics required.'
