However, we oftentimes struggle even turning very few of them into software that is not only well usable but also used well.\n\nThat's because hitting the market with a new idea is hard. Even bigger companies and corporations oftentimes take years to develop an initial version of their product just to figure out that much of what they did is not what the user needed.\n\nThe MVP (Minimum Viable Product) philosophy helps avoiding those pitfalls by starting a product with the minimum possible features and incrementally launching a product to more and more people. With the right strategy, one can launch an initial product within 30 days instead of 6-12 months with a much smaller budget.\n\nVideo Partner â€“ Wargaming (https://wargaming.com/ru/)"
