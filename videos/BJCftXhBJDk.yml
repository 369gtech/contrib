Most if not all of the data acquired from connected and intelligent devices is modeled as Time Series. And extracting value from time stamped data, require some thoughtful design in storage, processing and the type of algorithms necessary to extract insights from the said data.\n\nIn this talk we intend to describe how with tools we find in today's big data ecosystem we can build powerful intelligent applications from connected devices."
