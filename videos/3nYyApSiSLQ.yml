language: English
recordingDate: 1463632932
description: "Eddystone beacons mark important places or objects in a way that your phone understands. The Google beacon platform re-writes the traditional beacon app feature flow, making the humble beacon a versatile, remotely manageable, shareable piece of context infrastructure. Starting with Beacon Tools, a new Google app for managing beacons, weâ€™ll dig into the Proximity Beacon API and web dashboard for managing beacon infrastructure, including the added security of Eddystone Ephemeral ID. Deliver the great context awareness that users expect, through Google products, open and shared beacon networks, and your own apps.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
