description: "The way we work has changed dramatically during the last 20 years. Physical presence at the office is losing its importance in decision making process and getting work done. With modern tooling and adequate approach even a big software development enterprise can easily go virtual. This opens huge perspectives to disabled people who have the chance to work part time in the office and at home enabling them back to life. Letâ€™s make disabled enabled again!\n\n# Dmitry Aleksandrov\nCurrently principal expert developer at T-Systems. Over a decade experience mainly in Java Enterprise, but interested in dynamic languages in JVM and experimental features. Open source contributor, blogger. Bulgarian Java User Group co-lead. Conference speaker and organizer."
