title: 'Abhishek Gupta - Parcel - Bundler: New Kid on the Block'
language: English
recordingDate: 1530178551
description: "Parcel is a new web application bundler which doesnâ€™t require a config file whereas in webpack 3, even for a very basic project, we need to configure a `webpack.config` file. So webpack team recently released a new version of webpack (webpack 4) which implements zero config.\n\nI might help in deciding whether one should head over to Webpack 4 or look towards Parcel and what advantages both have."
