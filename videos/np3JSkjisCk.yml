description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Adam McNeilly, OkCupid.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=176420\n\nHave you ever been blocked from being productive at your job because you're waiting on a change from the API team? Started building a page only to find out the API response doesn't actually have what you need? With GraphQL, we don't have to wait for someone else. In this talk, we'll introduce the benefits of a client side API and understand why this will be the approach of the future. You'll learn what tools are available for consuming GraphQL APIs on Android, and tips for having them coexist with the REST APIs you already support. You'll leave this talk with a clear roadmap on how you can begin migrating your apps to this new technology."
