description: "Titel: Introduce kids to STEAM and reduce the gender gap\n\nScience, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) is what our society needs to focus on if it wants to be competitive in the future. But in order to succeed with that, it also needs to let kids discover the best career for them without any negative influence from gender stereotypes. This session presents our journey to the first Hackdays4Girls, a one day event we organized in our company to engage girls into coding in a fun and easy way. We will guide you through several hands-on activities using Scratch and the microcontroller boards Calliope and BBC Micro:bit, as well as some other ways to encourage kids to get into technology. Our aim is to let others know how easy it is to organize such an event and bring advice for those planning it.\n\nSpeaker: Laura Luiz - Software Engineer - commercetools\n\nLaura Luiz is a Software Engineer at commercetools, where she designs and builds open-source libraries and applications running mainly on the JVM. After working at Fundaci√≥ i2CAT in Barcelona, she moved to Berlin in 2012 to help commercetools in developing a modern commerce platform. She leads the Sunrise project, which includes a demo store running on Vue.js and communicating via GraphQL to the backend, as well as a Java/Scala framework to build online stores on top of the REST API of the platform. When she is not coding, she can be found playing video games, very likely a good old classic."
