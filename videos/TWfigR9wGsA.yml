title: '[VDM19] Your Program as a Transpiler by Edoardo Vacchi'

description: 'The term "transpiler" indicates a program that translates source code from one programming language into another target language; but transpilers are close cousins to compilers; and, at the end of the day, compilers are just programs that transform an input into an output. As GraalVM become more and more relevant, with new native-first frameworks such as Quarkus coming into the picture, we have the opportunity to get huge performance boosts in our applications; but we need to learn to think differently of our own code, recognizing the parts that can be processed statically and those that need to be processed dynamically. In other words, we need to understand what is the "compiler" part in our own programs! We will explore together this brave new world and get a sneak peek on what is coming next in the Drools rule engine and the jBPM platform.'
