description: "Building your own real-world, secure & scalable GraphQL API is a lot of work. With AppSync, robust GraphQL APIs including schema, resolvers, and data sources are created & configured automatically and instantly through either the AWS Amplify CLI or the AppSync console, abstracting away much of the complexity traditionally involved with setting up a new GraphQL backend.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll demonstrate and discuss the more interesting and powerful functionality that AppSync offers and do so in a way that developers will walk away with a confident understanding of how AppSync works and can be extended to help them in their day to day.\n\nWe’ll also create a real AppSync API & connect to a React application in a demo to demonstrate what we discussed in the talk in a live coding exercise, showing how to create queries, mutations & subscriptions directly from a client-side application.\n\nEVENT:\n\nReactiveConf 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nNader Dabit\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
