title: 'Stream SQL with Flink @ Yelp -  Enrico Canzonieri'
recordingDate: 1571152614
description: 'Yelp has been using Flink for over 2 years to power the entire Data Pipeline infrastructure. We’ve built several components to power a modular architecture that allows our users to solve complex use cases that translate to critical product features. In this talk I’ll present a component called Stream SQL, which is a service built around the Flink SQL API. I’ll discuss how we integrated the Flink SQL API into Yelp’s Data Pipeline infrastructure, the strategy we follow to run Flink acceptance testing and deployment, which has evolved over time to meet a constant increase in demand and scale.'
