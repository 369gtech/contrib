language: English
recordingDate: 1430330471
description: "Rizwan Reza became interested in the Ember.js run loop because he didn’t understand it. He describes his initial encounters with it as “kind of a black box.” Even then, though, he recognized that it was significant engineering feat on the part of Ember Core, so he decided to investigate further.\n\nThis is talk is all about demystifying the Ember.js run loop. We talk about what it is, how it processes tasks into different queues, and some of the design decisions that guided its creation.\n\nMore free tutorials on Ember.js: http://bit.ly/1ERza4g\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Ember-SF/"
