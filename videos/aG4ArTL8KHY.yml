title: 'Asynchronous Programming with Kotlin Coroutines in Spring'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538670880
description: "Coroutines is a new feature in Kotlin. It allows for writing an asynchronous code almost like it was regular/synchronous. If you combine it with Spring you'll get a powerful tool for creating fast, scalable, non-blocking applications. In this session, I'll show how coroutines can be used in Spring-based applications, what sort of problems can be encountered and how to solve them. I'll also present a glimpse of the spring-kotlin-coroutine library, which is a one-stop solution for Spring/coroutines interoperability.\n\nSpeakers:\nKonrad Kami≈Ñski\nSoftware Engineeer, Allegro.pl\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
