description: "The talk from Embedded Fest 2019 in Kyiv, Ukraine. \r\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/37YeRmX\n Fb: https://www.facebook.com/EmbeddedFest/\r\nWebsite: http://www.embeddedfest.com\n\n\nThe idea of the talk is to discuss various approaches and historical aspects of Software Architecture and Software Development Process. We'll focus on 2 specific examples, namely, Object-oriented Design and Agile.\nCarl Hewitt and Alan Kay laid the foundation and coined the term OOP which has evolved in hands of Bjarne Stroustrup and his followers into something dramatically different. The result was widely commercialized in the early 90-s offering limitless code reuse possibility and bright future for everyone. The bright future has come. Code reuse - not so much.\nWe'll use open-source software including Linux kernel as a base for practical use cases.\nDespite seemingly different areas whatsoever, the underlying idea behind the introduction of Agile Process methodology was pretty similar and bearing the same curse. While chasing the elusive goal of controlling chaos in software development for growing code base, it still to this day lacks scaling possibilities it meant to bring to the table in the first place.\nWe'll use examples from practical hands-on experience."
