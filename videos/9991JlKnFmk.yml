description: "Let's detect the intruder trying to break into our security system using a very popular ML technique called K-Means Clustering! This is an example of learning from data that has no labels (unsupervised) and we'll use some concepts that we've already learned about like computing the Euclidean distance and a loss function to do this. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/k_means_clustering\n\nPlease Subscribe!
