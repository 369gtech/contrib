title: 'Vector Normalization'
recordingDate: 1376570942
description: 'Shows how dividing a vector by its magnitude results in a vector of length one (a normalized vector). This is not the same as vector normals. Vector normals are vectors that are perpendicular to a surface. Vector normals are generally normalized (length 1), but they need not always be.'
