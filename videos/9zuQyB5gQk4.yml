language: English
recordingDate: 1587724899
description: 'As a long time .NET developer working mostly in the Microsoft ecosystem, I was surprised to learn that not only is AWS a member of the .NET Foundation but that they have a lot of APIs and tooling dedicated to .NET developers. In this short session, I’m sharing a look at my latest experiment: publishing an ASP.Net Core API as an AWS Lambda Function.'
