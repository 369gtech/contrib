title: 'Azure Functions and Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision API - Todd Fine'
recordingDate: 1499244183
description: "Functions have been the basic building blocks of software since the first lines of code were written and the need for code organization and reuse became a necessity. Azure Functions expand on these concepts by allowing developers to create \"serverless\" event-driven functions that run in the cloud and can be shared across a wide variety of services and systems, uniformly managed, and easily scaled based on demand.\n\nIn this presentation, we will create an Azure Function that monitors a blob container in Azure Storage for new images, and then uses Microsoft Cognitive Servicesâ€™ computer vision API to perform automated analysis of the images, scanning and evaluating them for adult content, and then storing the scores returned by the Computer Vision API in blob metadata."
