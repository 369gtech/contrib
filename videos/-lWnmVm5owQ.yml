recordingDate: 1529425998
description: "These days, public discussion can seem really difficult and painful. Trolls making deliberately destructive comments, exaggerated dramatic statements and even abuse seems common, whether the discussion is online or in-person.\n\nMany of us have experienced real pain and suffering in these discussions. How can we stop it?\n\nIndividuals and communities can take action to keep honest and valuable discussions from degenerating into useless drama. In this talk, Ruth shares ideas for managing your own perceptions of what is happening in a rancorous conversation. She shares a framework that enables you and your communities to vaccinate your discussions against trolls and drama, reclaiming useful public discourse for us all."
