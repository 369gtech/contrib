description: "Jayant Sharma, Senior Director, Product Management, Oracle\n\nPython has become an extremely popular scripting language for working with geospatial data. A rich ecosystem of Python geospatial libraries provides algorithms to answer questions such as “How are outcomes correlated with location?” “What areas are the most or least similar?” and “Where are the hotspots?” Using a dataset of nationwide traffic accident data, this presentation shows you how to address these questions by combining the geospatial features of popular Python libraries and Oracle Database."
