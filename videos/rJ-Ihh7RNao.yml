description: "Elliotte Harold\nSWE\nGoogle\n\nNo feature of the Java programming language is as original or as misused and controversial as exception handling. More than twenty years after Java was introduced more developers don’t understand exceptions than do. That’s not surprising given that most textbooks and tutorials get exceptions seriously wrong by focusing on the rules you must follow rather than the reasons you should follow them. And yet just three core principles cover 99% of what you need to know about exceptions. Follow these simple principles; and your programs, libraries, and APIs will be cleaner, simpler, and more robust."
