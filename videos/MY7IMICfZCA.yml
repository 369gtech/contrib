description: "\"Introduction\nHistorically, it's been difficult to build large data or remote data tools in JupyterLab\nThe fundamental issue is the low level architecture of the notebook server\nThe contents api always eagerly creates a local copy of any loaded data\nThere have been several failed attempts\nRecently, three lab extensions have emerged that offer solutions\nJupyterLab large/remote data extensions\nEach of these lab extensions have found their own creative workarounds for the limitations of the contents api\njupyterlab-remote-data: Ian R Rose\nAn experimental package that relies on an experimental alternative contents handler (remotecontentmanager) within the notebook server itself\n@jupyterlab/hdf5: my own contribution\nAvoids the contents api by serving its data via its own custom server extension\nThe server extension lazily fetches data in chunks via h5py\nThe frontend is implemented via @phosphor/datagrid, which can be set up to fetch data only as needed\nTogether, this means that @jupyterlab/hdf5 can be used to work with very large (TB) files in remote environments\njupyterlab-data-explorer: Saul Shanabrook, et al\nAt it's core, a flexible tool for loading datasets, and for transforming one kind of dataset into another\nAlso supplies a tree and a number of grid widgets for exploring data\nFlexible enough that it can be easily integrated with other tools. For example @jupyterlab/hdf5 includes support for data-explorer\nThe future of big data handling in JupyterLab core\nCurrently there are plans to replace the built in filebrowser in JupyterLab\n...along with its obligate dependence on the contents api\nAt the moment, jupyterlab-data-explorer is the leading candidate to replace the filebrowser\nWe also plan to add a set of hooks that will make it easy to load data using data-explorer and then consume the data within notebook code\"\n\nThough Jupyter notebooks are a useful tool for working with datasets of all shapes and sizes, until now a user has had to write their own custom code within the notebook in order to marshal and load large or remote datasets. Recently, significant progress has been made towards adding tools to the JupyterLab UI that will enable working interactively with such datasets.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
