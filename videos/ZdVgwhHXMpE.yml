title: 'When Python Practices Go Wrong'

recordingDate: 1623197696
description: "Just because a programming pattern or convention becomes popular doesn’t always mean it’s a good idea! Let’s dig into the consensus the Python community has built around what constitutes “Pythonic” code and look at the cases where the conventional wisdom is wrong. In the process, we’ll learn how code in a dynamic language can become more readable and more effective.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\ncode::dive conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish the code::dive conference tech talks. \n\nCREDITS:\ncode::dive conference YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU0Rt8VHO5-YNQXwIjkf-1g"
