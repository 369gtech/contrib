title: 'Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development'
language: English
recordingDate: 1523141496
description: "Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. Modern language features, such as closures, type inference, pattern matching, and trait-based generics, are supported in tandem with low-level features like zero-cost abstractions, efficient C bindings, and a minimal run-time. With the stable 1.0 release of the language in May 2015 Rust has seen widespread growth and adoption as well as continuous iteration on both the language and the libraries. This talk will explain the fundamentals of Rust and how they're leveraged to achieve the language's lofty goals as well as give a preview of some of Rust's upcoming features.\n\nEVENT:\n\ncode::dive 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAlex Crichton\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\ncode::dive conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\ncode::dive: http://codedive.pl/index/speaker/name/alex-crichton/year/2017/"
