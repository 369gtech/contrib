description: "\"Unidirectional Data Flow with Android Architecture Components and Kotlin Coroutines\"\n\nThe introduction of Android Architecture Components made things are easier for the less experienced developers. However, In order to build robust, testable and scalable applications we need more. That's where the Unidirectional Data Flow architecture comes in, borrowed from Flex and Redux on the web. \n\nThe approach is based on the idea of an immutable state that represents the state of our app. All the components are decoupled from each other, and they work together taking advantage of Kotlin's language features. We solve the asynchrony problem using Coroutines, specifically Channels and Actors. \n\nDo you want to know more? This talk will guide you through the implementation of this principle, with clear steps and a detailed explanation that will help you understand its value and spark your curiosity!"
