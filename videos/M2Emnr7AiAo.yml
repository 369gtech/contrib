description: "Aleksey Emelin, Senior Developer at Yandex, – The infrastructure of launching Appium tests under android on emulators and real devices\n\nThe principle of Mobile First has long been a part of the life of developers. But it's not enough to write an application, it needs to be tested and, preferably, not by unit tests only. For a long time conferences on mobile development and testing  have not gone without without word Appium. There are a lot of stories about how to use it, but there is almost nothing about what it's all about infrustructure for launching that. This report will fill this gap. It is a retrospective of the development of the stand for the launch of functional autotests in Yandex. You will get acquainted with the problems that we had to face over several years of infrastructure development and their solutions. You will learn what tools we used for this purpose and how scalable our solution has turned out. By the end of the report, you will have the knowledge that will allow you to deploy everything described on your servers."
