description: "The Java type system is an interesting beast; it looks very similar to that of C++ at first glance, but when you look at it more closely there are some major differences.\n\nIn this session, we'll take a quick look at some of the features of the Java type system and where they came from. Also, let's look into what may be coming to Java (in the near or distant future) when it comes to types.\n\nAlasdair Collinson:\nA professional software developer by day, a nerd... Well, all the time, really. I love programming, I also love talking and thinking about programming. I'm fascinated by the culture surrounding programming and I immerse myself in that culture. And I like sharing what I have learned. I've spoken at conferences several times before about a range of different topics - some of them very technical, some of them less so. Mixing it up, that keeps it interesting for both me and my audience. Any you can be sure that everything I talk about is something that I'm really passionate about."
