description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/tackling-unwieldy-projects-with-xp\n\nAre you taking on a large project that seems insurmountable? Perhaps a full rewrite, migrating to the cloud, or a large ETL? Extreme Programming can help! \n\nFollowing a full rewrite of our legacy application, we were tasked with transferring data from Oracle to Postgres- with an entirely different schema. This session covers basic principles of XP and how they helped get us to production in under 2 months.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeakers: Joseph Rodriguez; Engineering Manager, Pivotal. Peter Clowes; Software Developer, Savoya."
