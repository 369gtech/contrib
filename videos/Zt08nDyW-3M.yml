description: "JavaFX 8 offers a lot of excellent features to create modern and interactive user interfaces. However, in addition to a\nshiny UI there are other important issues that must be considered when creating enterprise business applications\nwith JavaFX. This talk gives an overview of the various best practices on solving problems like client-server \ncommunications (transport), asynchronous vs synchronous tasks, MVC/MVP framework patterned approaches and\ndesigning of complex dialog window flows. \nThe talk will discuss 3 important parts of a JavaFX Enterprise application:\n- Front-end: How to define views, dialogs and flows\n- Middleware: How a JavaFX Application can communicate with one or many servers (via REST, Websocket, etc.)\n- Architecture: How concurrency should be managed in JavaFX Applications, how modern technologies like CDI\n(Context and Dependency Injection) can be used\nBullet point 1: JavaFX\nBullet point 2: Enterprise\nBullet point 3: Middleware"
