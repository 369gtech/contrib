description: "The Challenges of Managing Open Source Infrastructure at Bloomberg\n\nAndrew Terng, Bloomberg\n\nBloomberg's Engineering team has deployed a Telemetry as a Service infrastructure that collects and processes over 6M metrics per second from tens of thousands of machines and applications, generating 120 TB of logs each day. In this talk, we will discuss when and how our engineers decide which open source software solutions to use. We will also look at some of the recent challenges we faced in using some of this software at scale and discuss how these hurdles were overcome.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
