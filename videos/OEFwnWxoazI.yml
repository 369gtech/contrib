description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nBy building on the Kotlin language support for scripting, some of its more advanced features enabled by the new Kotlin type inference engine and a few key metaprogramming techniques such as multi-stage programming and partial evaluation, the #Gradle Kotlin DSL is able to deliver a productive statically typed experience over the dynamic configuration model employed by the Gradle build tool.\n\nIn this implementation focused talk we will see how each essential aspect of the Gradle Kotlin DSL is made possible by the Kotlin tooling as we explore answers to the following questions:\n* How to provide a streamlined, ceremony free, script programming model over an existing and rich Java API?\n* How to enable statically typed and content assistable access to dynamic programming elements defined in an external model?\n* How to ensure great performance for repeated script executions?\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nPrincipal Software Engineer at Gradle Inc. Extreme programmer and former Gradle Kotlin DSL project lead."
