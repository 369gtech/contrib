title: 'Serverless Continuous Delivery with the Serverless Framework - Fabien Ruffin'
recordingDate: 1540198394
description: "Serverless has taken the world by storm and everyone is now deploying serverless functions to their favourite cloud... from their development machine...\nIt can very quickly become messy. Which version of the function is deployed? Who overwrote my code? Did we test this before deploying? Why is the production function using the dev database?\nIn this demo-packed session, you will learn how the Serverless framework can bring back true continuous integration and continuous delivery to serverless applications by taking care of running tests, packaging, versioning, configuration management, managing your application dependencies and much more.\n\n\nThe demos will take us through deploying a NodeJs serverless application to AWS using Visual Studio Team Services.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
