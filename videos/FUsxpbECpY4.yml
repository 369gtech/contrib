recordingDate: 1575612076
description: "CSS can be a source of deep frustration for developers, especially those more familiar with the imperative nature of JavaScript. Over time, this has resulted in a portion of the web community with a fundamental misunderstanding of CSS, not only of how to write it, but of what CSS is in the first place: a declarative, domain-specific programming language. How can those of us who know and love CSS convince this group to include CSS in their definition of programming language, and why is it so important? Can we really write algorithms in CSS?\n\nJoin us to see Lara Schenck – a Pittsburgh native who recently moved back after several years exploring lesser, larger cities – do a preview of her re-vamped, ongoing conference talk \"Algorithms in CSS\". She'll be giving versions of this talk at conferences throughout the summer including CSS Day in Amsterdam, CSS Camp Barcelona, and JSConf US. Come see the dry run, and let's discuss how CSS – as it exists in 2019 – fits into the larger context of programming and computer science.\n\nAs a side note: Lara used to organize the CodePen meetup in NYC, and is very excited to be part of the front-end community in Pittsburgh!\n\nBio:\n\nLara Schenck is fascinated by the profound, yet subtle, overlap between programming, computer science fundamentals, and CSS. She spreads her enthusiasm for this topic at her day job as a Design Ops Engineer for Penske Media Corporation, where she leads the design systems effort for big media publications powered by WordPress, and through conference speaking and community involvement. Lara writes about her work and life [on her blog](https://notlaura.com/blog/), illustrates [friendly monsters](https://notlaura.com/monsters), and inspires all of us who work with the web to seek a deeper understanding of the code we write and the tools we use.\n\nPresented at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh"
