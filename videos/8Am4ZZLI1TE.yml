description: "Game Jams are a lot of fun and are an important tool for creating new and unique game ideas. In this webcast talk Jesse Freeman author of Introducing HTML5 Game Development will cover some techniques to help you succeed in game jams with HTML5. We'll cover building project templates, reusable code libraries and strategies to help make sure you finish your game on time. While the focus of this talk will be on ImpactJS, the same principles will apply to any HTML5 game framework. Jesse will also go into reasons why HTML5 is the best platform to build on at any game jam.\n\nAbout Jesse Freeman\n\nMy name is Jesse Freeman and I am a Technology Evangelist at Microsoft focusing on Windows 8 and HTML5 Gaming. My job is to help developers build amazing apps and games for Windows 8. I have been a Web developer for over 13 years as well as a mobile app developer for the better part of the last 4 years. While living in New York have worked with some of the city's top companies such as MLB, the New York Jets, HBO, Tommy Hilfiger, Bloomberg and even internationally for clients such as VW. I have always used my passion for making games to help me learn new programming languages and this passion is one thing I hope to help share with others. \n\n@jessefreeman \n\nhttp://jessefreeman.com/\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
