title: The nightmare is finally over! HTML5 tutorial on how to build a webpage layout
language: English
recordingDate: 1502064000
description: I'll reveal to you how to build the page layout with CSS3 display grid and flexbox, a.k.a. display flex. We'll find out about properties like grid template column, grid template row, grid column, grid row as well as justify-content and align-items.\n\nOur HTML5 page will be minimal and quick. Most still wonder how it's possible to be that simplified and straight forward.\n\nThere is also a live drawing where I'll show you how to look at a layout and visualise it using coloured pens and paper. \n\nOnce you take the display grid way you'll never want to go back. No more floats, no more negative margins. The nightmare is finally over!\n
