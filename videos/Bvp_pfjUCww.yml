title: 'YOW! Data 2017 Rachel Bunder - What is the Most Common Street Name in Australia?'
recordingDate: 1508806800
description: "Finding the most common street name in Australia may sound relatively simple, but it quickly leads to other questions. What is a street name? Do The Avenue, The Grand Parade and The Serpentine all share the same name? And what is a street? Is the M5 Motorway a street? What about M5 Motorway Offramp?\nThis talk will answer these questions using Open Street Map and Python. In particular, reading in and manipulating Open Street Map data using geopandas; exploring the structure of Open Street Map and creating models for parsing street names. And finding the most common street name in Australia.\n\nRachel is a data scientist at Solar Analytics. Here her main roles are modelling solar systems and consumption as well as the web analytics. Other projects include writing statistical twitter bots and crocheting space ships.  Rachel is also an organiser for Sydney Python and Sydney PyLadies. \n\n\nFor more information on YOW!
