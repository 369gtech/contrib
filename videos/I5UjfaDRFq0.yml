description: "What would a programming language look like if it were explicitly designed for the world of serverless clouds, distributed computing, flash storage, 5G networks, and 64-bit multi-core devices? This is the world that we’re building applications for, but we’re hobbled by medieval languages designed for 32-bit, single-CPU, client/server LAN environments from the 1990s. We’ll examine the demands of autonomic manageability, portable security, CDN and 5G tower distribution, concurrent programming, and continuous deployment at a global scale, and how those factors influenced the design of a next-generation language.\n\nCameron Purdy\nxtclang.org\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
