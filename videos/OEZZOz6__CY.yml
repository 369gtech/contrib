description: "Liberator is a clojure library to implement http resource correctly. I will show that HTTP is more than GET and POST and how liberator enables a developer to unleash the full power of HTTP: content-negotation, conditional requests, etc. to enable the scalability promises of the RESTful architectural style.\n\nFreelancer. 10+ year java web developer. 4+ year clojure developer. Clojure maniac. Creator of liberator. Father of 3 girls."
