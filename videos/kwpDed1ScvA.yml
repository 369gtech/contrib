description: "One common practice to write maintainable code is to minimise repetition, often referred to as DRY or Don't Repeat Yourself.\n\nHowever, have you ever considered how much you repeat yourself when you create a new .NET application? \n\nYou've found your ideal architecture and folder structure and now every time you create a new project you have to create the file structure then add all the different project types you need.\n\nDon't forget all those NuGet dependencies too and the boilerplate code from other projects you\ncontinually copy in.\nIn this talk you'll learn the different ways you can create custom templates for .NET projects using the dotnet CLI, Visual Studio templates and Yeoman, helping to reduce repetition, write better applications, apply incremental improvements, all whilst saving you time and effort.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
