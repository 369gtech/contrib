title: ' DevTernity 2019: Jakub Nabrdalik â€“ Common Mistakes When Moving to Microservices'
language: English
recordingDate: 1576870339
description: 'Common mistakes when moving to microservices that I''ll discuss and provide solutions for: No realistic architecture process (architecture decisions too rigid, or not taken; infra vs domain; architecture guild vs no cooperation, knowledge sharing ); QA thinks testing end-to-end is possible; Management wants to control deployment; Devs, not DevOps; Not understanding event-based architecture; Not using the tools properly (Kafka); Relying on cloud provider shitty tools; Error-prone team setup; Pivots vs domain vs team composition.'
