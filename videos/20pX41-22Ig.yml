description: "In this talk we will cover a new trend in distributed enterprise architecture – microservices. How the leading technology companies like Netflix and Amazon come to use that approach. How does it help them to scale their infrastructure. And how the newest set of tools in the Spring family would help you to apply those design principles in practice.\n\nSpring has always been about patterns and Spring Cloud brings you implementation of several widespread ones for distributed apps.\n\nWe will talk about the problems we’ve encountered while trying to move our projects in cloud, what pain Spring Cloud promises to fix, how it fits the new cloud world vision. And what should come first – DevOps or Microservices."
