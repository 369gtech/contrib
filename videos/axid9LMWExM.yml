description: "Let's Encrypt has enabled rapid adoption of TLS across the long-tail of public-facing services. Unfortunately, there are still challenges in deploying TLS on home network devices, such as routers, TV tuners, and IoT hubs. These devices are commonly accessed by their non-routable, dynamically-assigned IP address, preventing traditional domain-validated certificates from being used. This talk introduces a new DNS-based service that allows home network devices to automatically request certificates that can be used with non-routable IP addresses.\n\nBIO\n Karl Koscher is a research scientist working at the University of Washington where he specializes in wireless and embedded systems security. Previously, he was a postdoctoral scholar working with Stefan Savage at UC San Diego. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 2014, where he was advised by Tadayoshi Kohno."
