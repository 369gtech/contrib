title: '[VDZ19] Lightweight Enterprise Java with MicroProfile by Roberto Cortez'

description: 'I laugh at people that tell me that Java is slow, heavyweight and cumbersome. Maybe it was true when we had EJB2. I will prove to you that we can develop Enterprise Applications with just a few lines of code that can run on a Raspberry PI. If it runs on a PI, I think we can safely say it would run anywhere! To be able to do it, Iâ€™m going to use a new platform called Microprofile. Microprofile optimizes Enterprise Java for a Microservices Architecture and delivers application portability across multiple runtimes. You can use a subset of the Java EE specifications to develop Microprofile applications, with JAX-RS, CDI, and JSON-P. Join me for this live coding session and help me spread the word that Java is actually great for the Enterprise.'
