description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune 11, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nYou read all the time about Google's engineering and product development prowess and seemingly omniscient strategies in the businesses it chooses to enter. However, those of us who know and love the real people who make Google work are aware of the the culture of controlled chaos that exists in the world's flattest multi-billion dollar company. Runaway success aside, we admire Google for its otherwise enigmatic management and organizational structures. By using the logic and tea-leaf reading we hear our clients apply and by liberally applying out own humorous hyperbole, we'll be arguing pro and con to answer the question: Does Google need managers?\n\nManagement Innovation Group is a strategy consultancy that specializes helping our clients demystify the changes that are rapidly changing their industries and understand how to compete in an a less certain future. Our clients include the Nokia, British Telecom, the New York Times, Reed Elsevier, Rodale, and many other companies who wish to remain anonymous because they don't want you to know that they are afraid of Google.\n\nSpeaker: Scott Hirsch\nA leading authority on innovation valuation and process development, Scott's passion is helping companies realize their creative potential at all levels of the organization. His management philosophy is based on empowering people — experience he acquired during six years as a social entrepreneur designing innovative youth service programs.\n\nImmediately prior to founding MIG, Scott launched the business strategy and valuation practice at Adaptive Path, the premier user experience consulting firm.

He lives in San Francisco, CA but has a vivid mental map of ancient Greece.\n\nSpeaker: John Zapolski\nPart strategist, part visionary, and part coach, John works with clients to co-create new ways of growing their businesses and executing on their strategies. Utilizing broad experience in research, design, strategy, and organizational development, John's methods help executive teams envision the future, generate possibilities, and take action on their innovation intentions.\n\nPrior to founding MIG, John held management positions at Wells Fargo and Yahoo!, where responsibilities included developing customer insights to drive growth and enterprise integration.
