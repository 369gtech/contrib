description: "While it’s relatively easy to build a new web app in React, migrating a service that’s constantly changing and used by millions of people is a much more complicated challenge. It’s like changing the engines of an airplane while mid-flight. The talk is about techniques we tried and challenges we faced while migrating to React at Pinterest.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPolyConf 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nImad Elyafi\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPolyConf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
