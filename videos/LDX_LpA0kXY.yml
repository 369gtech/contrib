description: "UREQA: Leveraging Operation-Aware Error Rates for Effective Quantum Circuit Mapping on NISQ-Era Quantum Computers\n\nTirthak Patel, Baolin Li, Rohan Basu Roy, and Devesh Tiwari, Northeastern University\n\nNoisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are enabling development and evaluation of real quantum algorithms, but due to their highly erroneous nature,careful selection of qubits to map the algorithm on to real hardware is required to minimize the error rate of the algorithm output. In this paper, we propose UREQA, a new approach that introduces quantum-operation-aware error rate prediction to minimize of output errors of quantum algorithms running on NISQ devices.\n\nView the full USENIX ATC '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/technical-sessions"
