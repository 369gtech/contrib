description: "At Twitter we're indexing hundreds of millions of tweets per day, and are serving more than 2 billion queries per day.

This talk will explain the modifications we made to Lucene, such as highly concurrent data structures, lock-free algorithms, improved garbage collection performance, etc.\n\nMore Info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/realtime-search-twitter\n\nDescription of Michael Busch https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/michael-busch"
