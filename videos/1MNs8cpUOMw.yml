description: "Using CF Route Services to Publish, Secure and Monitor APIs- Ed Anuff & Prashanth Subrahmanyam, Apigee\n\nThe new Route Services in Cloud Foundry 1.7 make it possible to for developers to do any sort of transformation or processing to requests before they reach an application. This new capability was designed with APIs in mind, and makes it easy to add security, authentication, and caching to requests. The Apigee team will walk through their experiences in building one of the first Service Brokers to leverage route services and will discuss how to build and deploy a full-featured API management platform as a route service and illustrate the use of Swagger/Open API to create a range of features such as quota enforcement, spike arrests and content caching. We'll also discuss the performance issues and provide some thoughts on how to best work around them. \n\nAbout Ed Anuff\nEd Anuff, Apigeeâ€™s SVP of Product Strategy, is a respected technologist and a proven innovator with over 20 years of experience as an entrepreneur.
