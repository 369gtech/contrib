title: 'SymbiFlow - The next generation FOSS FPGA toolchain'
recordingDate: 1548370053
description: "Tim 'mithro' Ansell\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/140/\n\n[SymbiFlow](http://symbiflow.github.io) aims to be the \"GCC of FPGAs\" - a fully open source project which supports multiple FPGAs from multiple different vendors. \r\n\r\nDue to their reconfigurable nature, FPGAs make hardware problems into software problems and enable anyone to building custom integrated circuits. This means you could create *your* ideal microcontroller, not what some manufacturer *thinks* you want. You can have the *exact* right set of peripherals including as many SPI, I2C or CAN as you want!\r\n\r\nThe FPGA innovation has been around since 1980s but has previously require getting giant closed source proprietary black boxes from the FPGA vendor (10 gigabytes or more!). Thanks to SymbiFlow this is no longer the case! \r\n\r\nSymbiFlow currently supports the Lattice iCE40, Lattice ECP5 and Xilinx 7 series FPGAs. This presentation will give you an update on the current status of the project. What currently works, the future roadmap and how you can help with the project.\r\n\r\nCome find out about how a small group of hobbyists are changing the world of FPGA development!\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
