title: 'Using Trompeloeil - a mocking framework for modern C++ - Bj√∂rn Fahller'
recordingDate: 1499244330
description: "A popular technique in unit testing is to break dependencies by replacing collaborators of the unit under test with mock objects. Mocking frameworks makes it easier to create mock objects.\n\nTrompeloeil is a new, open source, mocking framework written in C++14. It is easy to use while also allowing great expressive power.\n\nThis presentation will show how to use Trompeloeil by following the step-by-step development of an example program using TDD (test driven development.) The example will begin with the most basic usage and go on to cover increasingly more advanced topics, including:\n - testing patterns\n - techniques for controlling sequential ordering relations\n - how to represent data in violation messages\n - managing the life time of mock objects\n - writing matchers\n - disambiguating overloads\n\nThe presentation will also include call outs for participation to help further the development."
