description: "For eight years, Double Fine + iam8bit have been raising a \"child\" together. From infant to toddler to middle-age (we're talking dev years here!), DAY OF THE DEVS has matured into a well-mannered, anthropomorphized, non-gender-specific gathering of the greatest indie games, devs and players the universe has ever known. Our original dream was to nurture the thriving independent developer scene, providing a showcase that had \"chill festival vibes\". The 2020 edition of Day of the Devs at GDC is your gateway to discovering upcoming indie darlings, beamed straight onto your device of choice via the official GDC stream. We're calling it Day of the Devs: GDC Edition Direct. Tune in for lots of visual beauty, charming design, poignant voices, and just plain cool games. We promise you'll discover something rad.\n\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
