description: "BOSH & Kube - Dr. Max, IBM\n\nCreating a BOSH Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) for Kubernetes (Kube) presents a unique challenge since Kubernetes does not try to hide underlying node updates, unlike a typical IaaS like GCP where VMs are transparently migrated between hosts. While it’s relatively easy to map BOSH concepts to Kube and get a CPI that deploys BOSH releases, BOSH has to behave similarly to the Kube Deployment controller and manage Pd Disruption Budgets (PDBs) in order to automatically maintain expected workload uptime.\n\nIn this CPI we have solved these issues by taking advantage of existing Kubernetes primitives and connecting them to existing BOSH workflows. Additionally, as we tested the CPI we have also identified places where we can improve aspects of BOSH – e.g., speed and parallelism of resurrection – which as a whole will improve the BOSH toolset on any platform.\n\nIn this talk we will present our incubating project and do live demos using it to deploy / update / and use the latest CloudFoundry Application Runtime as well as other releases on Kube clusters. Secondly, we will discuss preliminary results using the CPI on public Kube offerings such as IBM Cloud, GCP, Azure. Finally, we will briefly discuss our development roadmap.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/GATe/bosh-kube-dr-max-ibm"
