description: "RustConf 2018 - The Opposite of Spaghetti Code: Building for Understanding by  Brandon W. Maister\n\nEvery moderately sized project is both a library and a consumer. Rust has an almost dizzying array of features that can be used to add structure and hide information.\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss using types, traits, modules and crates as the tools of encapsulation. To show how they work together to effectively superseed similar information-hiding tools in procedural and OO languages we'll grow a simple type into a collection of language objects. We'll discuss the thought processes that go into deciding to add a layer of abstraction, and how to use each layer to maximum effect."
