Using this family\r\nof APIs you can add a map to your site, include dynamic search\r\ncontrols, or download and mashup feeds with just a few lines of\r\nJavaScript. Chris Schalk will provide an introduction to these APIs.\r\nHis talk will explore various mashups using these APIs and as well as\r\ncovering how to integrate them with other non-Google mashable APIs."
