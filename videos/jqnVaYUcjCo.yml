description: "Two things are apparent when watching Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, creator of Ruby programming language, talk on the stage. First, that he will do anything he can to enable Ruby to survive and thrive and, second, that he’s thoroughly enjoying himself doing what he does. He’s passionate about Ruby and its community and his outlook is quite simple: Programming is fun, he’s had fun for the last 25 years making Ruby and at the age of 52 now, he hopes that he’ll get to spend the next 25 years having as much fun working on the language he dreamt up and wrote down in – a now lost – notebook, at the age of 17.\n\nEVENT:\n\nEngineering.SG Meetup 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nYukihiro Matsumoto (Matz), creator of Ruby\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTNC26BtRFc"
