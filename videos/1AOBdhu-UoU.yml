description: 'The age of monoliths is gone. Cloud is not going away, it is here to stay. Distributed computing is on the rise. The time is now to catch up with the trend. Join me in this talk and be part of a journey from monolithic system to microservices based distributed application. This won''t be an easy road. Such a fundamental change in how we do software is riddled with anti-patterns and sub-optimal choices. My team has done it! And we want to share our path so that yours will be much more simpler. All you need to do is come and listen.'
