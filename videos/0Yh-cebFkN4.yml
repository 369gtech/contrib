description: "Developing cloud-native applications presents several challenges. How do microservices discover each other? How do you configure them? How can you make them resilient to failure? How can you monitor the health of each microservice? Spring Cloud addresses all of these concerns. Even so, you still must explicitly develop your own service registry to enable discovery, configuration server, and circuit breaker dashboard for monitoring the circuit breakers in each microservice. Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry picks up where Spring Cloud leaves off, offering an out-of-the-box experience with service registry, configuration server, and circuit breaker dashboard services that can be bound to applications deployed in Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Now developers can focus on developing applications rather than microservices infrastructure. In this talk, we will introduce the capabilities provided by Spring Cloud Services and demonstrate how it makes simple work of deploying cloud-native applications to Pivotal Cloud Foundry.\n\nSpeakers:\nRoy Clarkson\nDeveloper, Pivotal\nOliver Hughes\nSenior Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
