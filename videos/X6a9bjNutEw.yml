description: "Terms like OAuth, OpenIDConnect, claims, tokens, two and three legged authentication, etc. are becoming increasingly common in discussions about software development. Most of us rely on these for authentication to services we use nearly every day! In an era where applications are highly distributed and dependent on other services to perform their function, modern identity approaches are important in allowing us to access protected resources without needing to share passwords around. This talk will help unravel some of these terms, explain modern approaches to authentication and show you how to easily get started setting some of these up yourself.\n\nDescription\n\nHow to try it out - IdentityServer 3 demo / deep dive / live coding (20 minutes)\nCurrent distributed application/services landscape (5 minutes)\nExplanation of basic authentication (passwords) (5 minutes)\nOAuth overview (10 minutes)\nTokens (5 minutes)\nClaims (5 minutes)\n2 vs 3 legged authentication (5 minutes)"
