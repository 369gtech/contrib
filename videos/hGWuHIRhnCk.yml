title: 'Michael Lochemem. Functional Programming in PHP'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620021858
description: "Functional Programming is a programming paradigm that has, since its inception, gradually pervaded through the realm of programming. After all, in theory, it holds that any entity capable of simulating a Turing Machine is Functional Programming-affable. PHP is not outside the parameters of Functional Programming and is, in fact, eligible for the paradigm despite appearing to be ill-equipped for such a purpose. Functional Programming, though currently in the zeitgeist, has a parlance whose perceived complexity poses some trouble in understanding its cornerstone principles. My talk, titled Functional Programming in PHP, is another in a long line of trials at effectively distilling Functional Programming knowledge for PHP audiences. I will, in the time afforded to me, attempt to discuss the foundations of the paradigm, its relevance and history, PHP’s aptness for FP, technical hallmarks — immutability, composition, referential transparency, and function purity — as well as applicable meta concepts like Functors and Monads for building real-world applications. \n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/Y2C8QIn2c99IfQ\n\nPHPFest: https://2020.phpfest.ru/lecture/5"
