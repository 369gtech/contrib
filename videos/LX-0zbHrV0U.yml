description: "Anomaly detection in the cloud: how to detect issues in data and images without any ML experience\n\nHow can a development team implement smart functionalities without any machine learning experience?\n\nIn this practical session, we explore how to identify defects and outliers (anomalies) in images and business datasets.\n\nWe’ll look at why it’s important to identify anomalies quickly by using managed services in the AWS cloud such as Amazon Lookout for Vision and Lookout for Metrics."
