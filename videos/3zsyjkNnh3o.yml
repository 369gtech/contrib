description: "This video of Eric Merritt was filmed at the Erlang User Conference 2012. More information and slides are available here: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2012/speakers/EricMerritt\n\nMyrmas is a new, open source, low-level complex event processing system that serves as the core for 10io`s innovative new product AutonomicI/O. AutonomicI/O identifies anomalies in infrastructure telemetry data, and takes the appropriate proactive autonomic action to circumvent the costly unplanned IT outage(s) that would have resulted. \n\nThis presentation will provide an overview of how Myrmas was architected to reduce re-execution and dramatically increase the ability to distribute computation across nodes, including how the unique term destructuring algorithm was designed to leverage a heavily-customized Rete algorithm, and how and why Standard ML was incorporated with Erlang at the core of the system.\n\nTalk objectives: Introduce people to Myrmas, a new distributed rete implementation for Erlang as well as discuss mixed language implementations in the ERTS.\n\nTarget audience: Developers."
