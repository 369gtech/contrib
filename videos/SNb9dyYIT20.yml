description: "Software is made by people. Those people have views on how the world works (and how it should work), and they encode those biases into the things they build. What does that mean as those people start to train machines to do the thinking? What perspective does technology have, and how can we learn to recognise it?\n\nSarah Gold founded IF to work on ambitious projects involving technology, data, and networks in the public domain. A NESTA New Radical awardee, Tech For Good advisor and part of the practitioner panel for the Research Institute in the Science of Cyber Security (RISCS), she sees the way we think about security and privacy not as matters of compliance but challenges for design.\n\nThis talk was given at an event hosted by Pivotal London.
