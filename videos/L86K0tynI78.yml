title: 'Scalable Automation: From Logs to Learnable Failure Classification - Sharon Kerzman'
recordingDate: 1532852885
description: 'With more breaking points and less stability, E2E tests are very hard to maintain and investigate. Sharon shows how we reduced the investigation time along the way, from trivial logs to using machine learning algorithms that classify failures. He talks about tests, machine learning, and their relationship.'
