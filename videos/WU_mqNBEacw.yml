language: English
recordingDate: 1570813032
description: 'Java 11/12 offers 2 new Garbage Collectors: ZGC and ShenandoahGC. The main goal for these two new GCs is to reduce GC pauses to only few milllisecond and possibly to less than a millisecond, therefore solving once and for all the GC pause problem. This session will present these two new GCs, how to enable them, how to configure them and will discuss their performances.'
