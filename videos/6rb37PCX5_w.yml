The goal is to observe changes in the health of your systems and user behavior before ramping up to your entire user population.\nEarly adopters of CD invented their own progressive delivery tooling and practices, freeing up their teams to move fast, limit the blast radius of issues found in production and focus engineering cycles on work that delivers more impact, not just more releases.\nWhat can we learn from the ways these pioneers of progressive delivery implemented gradual release mechanisms and automated repeatable and trustworthy reporting of [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:57 Progressive delivery and its benefits\n08:08 Feature flag\n19:54 Lessons learned\n26:32 Checklist to level up\n36:03 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/november-2020/sessions/1650/progressive-delivery-patterns-and-benefits-of-decoupling-deploy-from-release\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ProgressiveDelivery #ContinuousDelivery #CD #FeatureFlag\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
