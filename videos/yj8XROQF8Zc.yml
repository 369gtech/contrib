title: 'Fraud Detection - Time Is more important than Money by Neil Stevenson'
recordingDate: 1581886495
description: "We all think we know about fraud detection. Clever AI and ML applications will spot fraud instantly and save us time, money, and hassle. This is sometimes true, but the next problem is insufficient speed. Fraud detection applied to high-speed transaction processing is complex and time-sensitive, so how do we leverage the power of in-memory to make it run quickly? After all, if it runs faster, it can run more often—it’s as simple as that. In this talk, we'll take a look at the technical aspects of scaling. How do we *really* parallelise information in real time? How do we make the best use of the resources we have? How do we add more at peak time? How do we take it away again? In other words, how do we apply the real world of economics so that we can adjust the size of our technology infrastructure to optimise fraud detection benefits?\n\nNeil Stevenson\nHazelcast\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
