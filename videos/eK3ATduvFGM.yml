title: 'Use Machine Learning to Predict Rocket Delays | Learn with Dr G'
language: English
recordingDate: 1611100975
description: "Machine Learning is a Data Scientist's best friend. With the right data it can predict trends and provide clear solutions to complex problems. In this session, Sarah (Dr. G) will use data about the weather to predict where there will be rocket launch delays in the future. \n\nWe'll learn how to analyze and prepare weather data, collect and manipulate it so we can get clear and accurate predictions and then build and test a machine learning model to help identify when is a good time to blast off into space.\n\nTo access the module and follow along, please go here: https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/RocketDelays\n\nAdditional Links:\n@drguthals | #LearnWithDrG | https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/ML_Alg_Cheatsheet\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/RocketDelays\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/NOAA\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/NASA_Data\nhttps://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/LaunchForecastFAQ\nhttps://aka.ms/LWDG/NASA_Launch_Schedule\n\n\nThis session is for learners who are new to machine learning."
