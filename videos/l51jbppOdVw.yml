title: 'Modern Java with IntelliJ IDEA'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604368179
description: "The current release cadence of a new version of Java every 6 months can be overwhelming. The releases might even contain preview features which are \"complete\" but may change with every new release until they finally stabilize. How can a real developer keep up with this? The good news is that your IDE can help. IntelliJ IDEA not only provides support for the latest versions of Java (even the ones that aren't released yet), it can also help us to discover and use the new language features. This way we can let the IDE help us to migrate to the latest and greatest, and we don't need to go researching for the relevant features every 6 months. In this session, Trisha will show the interesting language features in recent versions of Java, and show how IntelliJ IDEA makes these really easy to find and use.\n\nAdditional Resources:\nPublish a Web App to Azure by Using Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/publish-azure-web-app-with-azure-toolkit-intellij/?WT.mc_id=events_jdconf\nCreate an Azure function with Java and IntelliJ: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-maven-intellij?WT.mc_id=events_jdconf"
