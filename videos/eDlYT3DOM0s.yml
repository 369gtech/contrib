description: "In this talk we give an overview of our Kiama language processing library (https://code.google.com/p/kiama/) for Scala. Kiama-based programs use high-level domain-specific languages to describe structured input for parsing, static analysis of programs via attribute grammars, program transformation via rewriting, and output using pretty printing. We describe how Kiama works and illustrate some typical language processing tasks by implementing a version of the lambda calculus, the prototypical functional programming language.\n\nFor more on YOW!
