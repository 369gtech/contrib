title: 'OML feature highlight: New OML Notebook templates for ML Regression'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639584439
description: "Join us on this weekly Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database, where we will introduce the latest Notebook templates for Machine Learning Regression problems. This is a follow-along Session, since the OML Notebook templates are available to any Autonomous Database tenancy, and you will be able to run it while we demonstrate it.  We will also answer any questions you might have.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.\n\nOracle Machine Learning Notebooks offers an easy-to-use, interactive, multi-user, collaborative interface based on Apache Zeppelin notebook technology, and supports SQL, PL/SQL, Python and Markdown interpreters. It is available on all Autonomous Database versions and tiers, including Always-Free.\n\nOracle Machine Learning for Python includes AutoML, which provides automated machine learning features for algorithm selection, feature selection, and model tuning for in-database algorithms. In addition, Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI provides a no-code user interface for the modeling process to enhance data scientist productivity while empowering non-experts with in-database machine learning. OML AutoML UI is exclusive to the Autonomous Database.\n\nOML Services, which is also included with Autonomous Database provides a REST interface for model deployment and management. OML Services supports in-database models as well as ONNX-format models (for classification and regression) built using third-party engines. OML Services also supports cognitive text analytics.\n\nVideo highlights:\n00:39 Topics for Today\n01:06 Upcoming Sessions\n02:50 New OML templates for Classification\n04:05 Two options to access the Template Examples\n04:35 Select one of the Examples\n06:04 Notebook listing with the new sample from Template Examples\n06:32 Live Demo of Templates for ML Classification\n09:41 Live Demo open example Notebook \n24:25 Live Demo XGBoost Example on ADB 21c\n26:09 Q&A"
