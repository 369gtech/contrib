description: "Appealing to Riders and Elephants: Applying the Happiness Hypothesis When Communicating Designs\n\nThe real designers in the room are the ones who make the decisions. How you facilitate discussions and support your solutions may be more important than the design itself. I’ll walk through cases where analytics and stories came together to offer deeper, more compelling narratives. I’ll demonstrate how our team of designers and analysts communicate the process in ways that reach intuitive and rational stakeholders alike.\n\nAbout the speaker: \nBrent Palmer http://www.brentpalmer.me – Data designer, UX leader and product thinker working in France. Currently, Design Lead on Explore, Zendesk's customer analytics product. Previously, UI/UX Director at TrendKite and part of the PayPal and Spredfast design teams\n\nAbout the conference:\nAt The UX Conference on February 20th 2018 in London we were exploring how to improve collaboration between designers and business stakeholders. The event was organised by The School of UX http://schoolofux.com and kindly supported by Balsamiq, TestingTime, Axure, Loop11, UsabilityHub, Optimal Workshop and Proto.io.
