description: "Check out the latest from The Lead Developer at theleaddeveloper.com.\n\nOften when we talk about goals, they’re from the perspective of the individual: how do you come up with goals for yourself? How do you achieve those goals? It’s often framed as activities for you to reflect and consider on your own. Goal setting is presented as something you go off and do on your own, and then present back to your manager or team.\n\nAs a manager though, I noticed that often people don’t know where to start when examining their own goals and they need help and encouragement to take the time to consider on what their goals should be. This talk will focus on how to create custom goal-setting workshops to use during your 1-on-1s, which questions to ask and how to help your reports achieve and stay on top of those goals."
