description: "There is a lot of hype around PWAs, especially from Google is who is leading its evolution. But all of the demos are small self-contained examples that don’t include the intricacies of large, real-world applications.\n\nWhere does server rendering fit in with the app shell model? What are the pitfalls of service worker caching?\n\nAs the tech-lead for Pinterest’s mobile web rewrite, Zack learned first-hand the pros and cons of current progressive web app strategies. These are lessons that all web engineers should be aware as the world embraces the progressive web."
