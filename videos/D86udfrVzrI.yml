As Pivotal's Vice President of Data Platform Product Management, Josh Klahr has the know-how to provide insights on how to build an organization that strategically manages this data in today's modern and complex enterprise environments. Integration of a data platform, BI tools, data science services and applications/app development are just some of the factors that must be considered in the design of an effective organizational framework. Josh will draw from first-hand experiences and real-work with customers of all sizes to provide insight into best practices and lessons learned along the way.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Pivotal"
