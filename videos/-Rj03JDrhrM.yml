Retraining an OCR engine with post-edited data, or even with the imperfect labels assigned by the classifier, reduces both bias and variance. Although the theoretical foundations of decision-directed adaptation are meager, it has proved successful in diverse experiments. When the operational data can be partitioned into isogenous subsets, style-constrained classification is appropriate. Patterns should be recognized in groups rather than in isolation. Shape and language context are complementary. Operator interaction should be rationalized. Only dynamic classifiers..."
