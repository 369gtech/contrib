description: "Lazy loading data and managing flash of unstyled content (FOUC) can be pretty tricky in a single page app. In today's episode I'm going to tackle both of these topics. We'll add a loading screen to our app that uses a spinner to indicate we're waiting on our text content, then we'll use a technique popularized by Medium where we base64 encode a low res version of our images (so we can display them quickly) and then transition to the higher res version once it's had time to download.\n\nDemo source:\nhttps://goo.gl/iEQs0J\n\nShop demo:\nhttps://goo.gl/oX9QEc\n\napp-route docs:\nhttps://goo.gl/6KzFYk\n\nPolymer Talks from Google I/O:\nhttps://goo.gl/T2K7XI\n\nPolymer Slack:\nhttp://goo.gl/9UI2Uu\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel at http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
