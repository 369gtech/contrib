description: "Speaker: Viktor Gal (@vikgl)\r\n\r\nShogun provides a wide range of unified and efficient Machine Learning (ML) methods. The toolbox seamlessly allows to easily combine multiple data representations, algorithm classes, and general purpose tools. This enables both rapid prototyping of data pipelines and extensibility in terms of new algorithms. Website: http://shogun-toolbox.org\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker:\r\n\r\nViktor Gal (https://twitter.com/vikgl) is currently working as a data scientist.
