description: "Building large, distributed software is not easy, especially when you must support multiple tenants that each have their own workloads to run and SLAs to meet, while compute and storage resources are limited and need to be shared. Careful thought must be given to ensure that resource isolation is obtained to help to address contention concerns. While leveraging the right tools and technology is important, it's not a \"Silver Bullet.\" Ensuring that you properly employ the right features to keep your workloads well managed is critical and something that should not be an after thought! Please join as I share my experience and best practices with using Kubernetes (K8S) features (e.g., Namespaces, Taints/Tolerations, Affinity, Autoscaling, Probes, Quotas, RBAC, etc.) in order to successfully run a well managed, multi-tenant, K8S cluster.\n\nSpeaker: Paul Sitowitz, Software Engineering Manager, Capital One\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform\nSlideshare: TBD"
