description: "Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building highly scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant reactive applications on the JVM, using actors. With the actor programming model, conventional design patterns frequently are not applicable, as is evident from questions that arise on the Akka mailing list and at conferences. That is why Typesafe has collected several common solutions and best practices for solving typical problems you will encounter when building scalable and fault-tolerant systems with Akka actors. This session shows you how to implement flow control, distributed workers, blocking resources, reliable messaging, and more with Akka and Java.\n\n\nAuthor:\nBjörn Antonsson\nBjörn Antonsson has over 10 years of experience of JVM design and development as one of the JRockit JVM founders and 15 years of Java experience. He has worked with high volume data systems and large traffic websites in both the finance and gaming industry.\n\nBjörn joined Typesafe in early 2012 and is part of the team that is developing the Akka actor toolkit.\nView more trainings by Björn Antonsson at https://www.parleys.com/author/bjorn-antonsson-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
