title: '"Managing Containers at Scale with CoreOS and Kubernetes" by Kelsey Hightower'

description: "The last decade belonged to virtual machines and the next one belongs to containers.\n\nVirtualization lead to an explosion in the number of machines in our infrastructure and we were all caught off guard. It turns out that those shell scripts did not scale after all. Lucky for us configuration management swooped in to save the day.\n\nBut a new challenge is on the horizon. We are moving away from node-based infrastructures where hostnames are chosen with care. Gone are the days of pinning one service to a specific host and wearing a pager in case that host goes down.\n\nContainers enable a service to run on any host at any time. Traditional tools are starting to show cracks because they were not designed for this level of application portability. Now is the time to look at new ways to deploy and manage applications at scale.\n\nLinux containers provide the ability to reliably deploy thousands of application instances in seconds. And we can manage it all with CoreOS and Kubernetes. This talk will help attendees wrap their minds around complex topics such as distributed configuration management, service discovery, and application scheduling at scale. It will discuss CoreOS, a Linux distribution designed specifically for application containers and running them at scale. It will examine all the major components of CoreOS including etcd, fleet, docker, and systemd; and how these components work together with Kubernetes to solve the problems of today and tomorrow.\n\nKelsey Hightower\nCOREOS\n@kelseyhightower\n\nKelsey Hightower is product manager, developer and chief advocate at CoreOS Kelsey has worn every hat possible throughout his career in tech and enjoys leadership roles focused on making things happen and shipping software. Kelsey is a strong open source advocate focused on building simple tools that make people smile. When he is not slinging Go code you can catch him giving technical workshops covering everything from Programming, System Administration, and his favorite Linux distro (CoreOS)."
