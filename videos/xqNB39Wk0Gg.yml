description: "MalmöJS is a monthly meet-up for front-end web developer passionates who are pleased to share knowledge, problems and ideas with each other. \n\nArguments drifts around the HTML5 environment with a pitch on Web App development in Javascript and rich page design with CSS. \n\nTonight's Program \n\nEven if you aren't a Star Trek fan, and you have never dreamt about talking to your house, the idea of interacting by voice has never been so real as it is now. \n\nWith the new voice assistants like Amazons Echo/Dot and Google Home, you can control your music, your lights and ask questions just by talking. Out of the box. \n\nBut the difference between you and a normal consumer is that you can create your own functionality and build things beyond what everyone else is doing. And it's super simple. \n\nIn this talk we will be looking into how to create your own actions for Google with node.js and how they differ from Amazons solution. \n\nWe'll go through a complete example from scratch and hopefully have a little sci-fi moment together. \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
