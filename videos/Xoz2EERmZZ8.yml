description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nWith the rising popularity of immersive media, we’ll need to rethink UI standards around a new modality. As communication becomes more gestural, conversational, and less typographic, we will need to ensure it does not become abstract. In a world threatened by fake news, ensuring a future of clear, nuanced, and truthful communication will be incredibly important.\n\nThis talk unpacks a condensed history of typography and justifies why said history can be used as a jumping off point for designing the future of user interfaces. We will discuss how to reconsider typographic history—and the nuances of phonetic letterforms—when inventing new user interfaces for a future of modular, invisible, and alternate reality devices.\n\nMichelle Cortese\nSenior Design Technologist, Refinery29\nhttps://www.twitter.com/ellecortese\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ellecortese\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
