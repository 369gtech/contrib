description: "Some applications require really high throughput while other applications are publishing batch jobs that can be delayed for a while. The goal when designing your system should be to maximise combinations of performance and availability that make sense for your specific application.\n\nBad architecture design decisions or bugs client side, can damage your broker or affect your throughput. Your publisher might be halted or the server might crash due to high memory usage. This webinar focuses on best practice for RabbitMQ. Dos and don'ts mixed with best practice for two different usage categories; high availability and high performance (high throughput).\n\nCarl Hörberg has been working with RabbitMQ since version 2.6. He launched CloudAMQP(RabbitMQ as a Service) 2012, which today is the industry-leading hosted service for RabbitMQ. Carl and his team know how to configure for optimal performance and how to get the most stable cluster. In this webinar, Carl shares his RabbitMQ knowledge.\n\n\nWhat will you learn?\n* RabbitMQ best practice for High Performance\n* RabbitMQ best practice for High Availability\n* Common RabbitMQ mistakes\n\n\nWEBINAR LIVE DATE: Thursday 25 January 2018 | 1700 CET / 1600 GMT / 1100 EST / 0800 PST\n\nDeck: https://www.slideshare.net/secret/ndMMIcTQnw3W6Y\n\n——————————————————————— \n\nSPEAKER CONTACT DETAILS \n\nCARL HÖRBERG - Carl Hörberg has been working with RabbitMQ since version 2.6.
