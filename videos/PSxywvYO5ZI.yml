title: 'YOW! Data 2019 - Simon Aubury - Which Plane Woke Snowy the Cat?'
recordingDate: 1565902802
description: "Our new cat, Snowy, is waking early. She is startled by the noise of jets flying over our house.\n\nThis talk describes how common radio receivers can be configured to gather aircraft transponder signals. With an opensource data streaming framework (Apache Kafka) we can build a streaming data pipeline to rapidly process aircraft movements in real-time.\n\nWith data and spatial visualisations we can really determine which plane woke Snowy the cat.\n\nData geek - from databases to streaming to ill-advised home hacking.   Huge interest in all things data, digital & IoT.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
