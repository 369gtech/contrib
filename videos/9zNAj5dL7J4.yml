Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nKeynote: The Beginner’s Guide to the CNCF TOC - Liz Rice, VP Open Source Engineering, Aqua Security \n\nWho is the Technical Oversight Committee? What do its members do? How do projects get picked for adoption into the CNCF? Let’s shine a light on this group who determine which projects are adopted by the CNCF, set the future direction of the cloud native landscape, and are even responsible for the definition of the term “cloud native.\"   This talk discusses the pros & cons of a project’s participation in the CNCF from the perspective of end users, vendors, contributors, and maintainers. It covers the lifecycle for a CNCF project, including:  - why projects want to be in the CNCF - how the project adoption process works - the requirements that the CNCF has on projects at different phases of maturity  Attendees will leave this talk with insights into how the technical arm of the CNCF works, why it’s important, what the TOC wants to do next, and how they can get involved.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZfCr"
