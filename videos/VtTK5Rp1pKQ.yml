description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\nHow to measure and visualize your organizational culture to improve your working environment\n\"Well, that's the way we do things around here.\" Organizational culture can be a source of comfort and stability in uncertain times... or it can be the stone wall that prevents fresh ideas and much needed change. Having the best agile frameworks and mechanics in place will not help much if the organizational culture is fragmented and misaligned.\n\nUnfortunately, most companies are not even aware that they have a company culture. If they are, their main tool for improving the culture tends to be motivational posters.\n\nConsidering that culture eats strategy for breakfast, we think itâ€™s high time to take a sharp look at how people do things around there. In this workshop we will look at the importance of having a well understood and coherent culture, explore various ways of visualizing it, and finally see how the impact of improvement actions can be observed and tracked"
