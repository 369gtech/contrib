description: "Get Everything: http://goo.gl/QI8dG\r\n\r\nI continue my Sabermetrics Baseball tutorial. I'm going to introduce a few new SQL functions being CONCAT, COALESCE and HAVING.\r\n\r\nWe will also calculate the top players based on RBIs, HRs, Batting Average, On Base Percentage, and Slugging Percentage. And, I'll show you how to pull in data on the players position and their salary."
