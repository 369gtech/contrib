description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/hpssM\n\nWelcome to my Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern Tutorial! Wow, that was a mouthful!\n\nThis\_pattern has a\_group of objects that are expected to between\_them be able to solve a problem.\_If the first Object can't solve it, it passes\_the data to the next Object in the chain. In this tutorial, I'll use it to make the right calculations based off of a String request. While that is pretty simple the capabilities of this pattern are endless."
