recordingDate: 1418088458
description: 'Delegates are an important feature of .NET. They allow us to pass methods as parameters to other methods (among other things). In this video (first of a series), we''ll look at the basics of delegates, including how to create a new delegate type, how to pass a delegate as a parameter to a method, and how to select what method we execute at runtime rather than compile-time. Along the way, we''ll also see how delegates can help us adhere to the S.O.L.I.D. principles. For more information and the sample code, visit http://www.jeremybytes.com/Demos.aspx#GF'
