recordingDate: 1555595894
description: "For 80 years we’ve lived in the age of mechanical reproduction, but now we are about to enter a new era: the age of artificial production. Neural networks and artificial intelligence have made their way from scientists’ labs into the hands of creatives and artists and are becoming versatile tools for creative expression and exploration. New questions arise about authorship, copyright, originality and in particular who the actual creator is: human or machine?\n\nMario Klingemann has been a pioneer in using neural techniques, GANs and other deep learning tools to create art. He will give an insight into his process, show how it is connected with traditional art making and happy accidents and try to clear up some misconceptions or false expectations around this fascinating technology.\n\nMario Klingemann\nArtist, Quasimondo\nhttps://twitter.com/quasimondo\nhttps://instagram.com/quasimondo\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
