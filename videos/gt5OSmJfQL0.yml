description: "http://oscon.com\nOver half of US workers hate their jobs, and most of this unhappiness seems to come from dysfunctional organizational structures. What if, instead of causing misery, an organization was designed to create happiness among its workers? I'll talk about the research I've been doing on this subject for the past several years, companies I've visited, how I've struggled against my own preconceptions and limitations, the surprising number of others who are pushing on the same ideas and writing books on the subject, a few things I've found that seem like answers, and the questions that continue to accumulate. You should come away with a new perspective on what could be possible with organizations of the (near) future. You can find my writings at www.reinventing-business.com."
