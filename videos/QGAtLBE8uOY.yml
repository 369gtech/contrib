description: "So often, we talk about doing the DevOps for money, fame, and high performance. But DevOps was the original hipster of changing the way we work to take care of ourselves and each other. In this talk, Nicole Forsgren will discuss how these technology transformations can not only help us ship software with speed and stability, but how they can reduce burnout, improve our culture, and communicate better. She will also share the latest research from her team about productivity, and what this means for the future of work—spoiler alert: productivity is personal. As we shift back into work patterns that look like normal (whatever normal is), we can reimagine cultures and technologies that shift to support us and our teams—just like DevOps did in its beginning.\n\nDr. Nicole Forsgren, Partner at Microsoft Research\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/why-even-devop"
