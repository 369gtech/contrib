description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Stuart Williams\nBig Data Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/williams-1m-events\nAn application designer usually has to choose where to trade flexibility for specificity (and thus usually performance); knowing when and where to do so is an art and requires experience. This talk will share over a decades worth of experience making these decisions and the learnings from developing Pivotal's successful Real Time Intelligence (RTI) product using the latest versions of Spring projects: Integration, Data, Boot, MVC/REST and XD. A walk through the RTI architecture will provide the base for an explanation about how Spring performs at hundreds (and millions) of events/operations per second and the techniques that you can use right now in your own Spring applications to minimise resource utilisation and gain performance."
