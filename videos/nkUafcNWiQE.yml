title: 'Unlocking the Magic of Monads in Java 8'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433261510
description: "This code-heavy session demystifies what monads are and outlines reasons why you would even want to introduce them into your code. It takes a look at the traditional definition of monads and offers a corresponding type definition in Java. You’ll see a sample Java 8 implementation of a  Promise  monad, which represents the result of async computation, to help answer practical questions about monads. Also, the presentation goes over the laws of monads and shows that you can have a proper monad in Java if you are brave enough to allow the underlying platform to change the rules a bit. PS: You won’t be penalized or ridiculed during this session for your (lack of) Haskell knowledge!\n\n\nAuthor:\nOLEG S?ELAJEV\nOleg is a Java developer and Evangelist at ZeroTurnaround, with a focus on Continuous Delivery and Devops.
