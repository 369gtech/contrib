description: "Speaker(s): Kathleen Azali (Between Surabaya (Indonesia) and Singapore)\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nArt, design, and cultural events and organisations have proliferated in Indonesia in various scales. Designers, artists, researchers, environmentalists, handymen, technologists, hobbyists, entrepreneurs and government use open source licenses and tools mixed with assemblages of media technologies, “pirated” softwares and hardwares. Using two case studies, i.e. (1) Design It Yourself conference in Surabaya; and (2) Senayan SLiMS, an open-source Library Management Systems, I elaborate how various individuals and organisations (de)couple, calibrate, cobble up repair and maintenance in facing social or environmental challenges and emerging technologies in Indonesia. And how in the process, they generate networks of solidarity, tension, innovation, power, breakdown and resilience, across different boundaries.\r\n\r\n(Type: Talk | Track: Design, Art, Community | Room: Planck (Floor 3))\r\n\r\nEvent Page: http://2017.fossasia.org\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/5L1a/"
