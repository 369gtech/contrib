description: 'Using cheap commodity RF hardware to act as secure or backchannel communications for security research and pen tests. Wireless communication is getting cheaper and hobby projects are integrating long range low powered communication to link devices in all sorts of unique ways. But what about in the world of information security? This talk will cover the acronym soup of current communication systems including LoRA, RFM, Satellite, ASK, and many others to identify what protocols make sense when you are trying to communicate either stealthily or in remote areas. In addition, this talk will cover how to improve reliability of wireless communication and the costs associated with making your super pen test box. Or perhaps even what evil things can be done with these and how to protect yourself. The aim for this talk is to be interactive, and allow people to share experiences.'
