title: 'Justin Crown - "WHAT IS THIS MESS?" - Writing tests for pre-existing code bases - PyCon 2018'
recordingDate: 1526150166
description: "Speaker: Justin Crown\n\nMany of us practice test driven development, and pride ourselves in our code coverage. This is relatively easy to do when you begin a new project, but what happens when you take over an existing code base with little to no tests? Where and how do you start writing tests? This task can be very intimidating and frustrating, but can be accomplished!\n\nThis talk will run through some common approaches and methodologies for adding test coverage to pre-existing code (that you might not even be familiar with at all). The next time you take over an untested monolith,  you will be able to do the right thing and start writing tests instead of hoping for the best!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
