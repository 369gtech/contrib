description: "The .NET platform has been in decline over the last four years, losing half if its available positions in server-side development. In this presentation we look at the data behind that decline and ask what happened and what can we do to reverse it.\n\nIn 201I, Bob Eel called for a Java Renaissance to capitalize on new developments on the Java platform and fight off the competition from frameworks like Ruby on Rails. The numbers show that Renaissance having an impact on server-side Java development, and many web scale companies have returned to Java for their server workloads.\n\nCan we make a similar move in .NET and create a renaissance that will see .NET taking a role server-side in web scale deployments?\n\nPart-history lesson, and part call to action, this talk tries to set out where we could go, if the community can create a .NET Renaissance around the .NET Core developments."
