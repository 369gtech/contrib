title: 'Object injection, Config files & Properties Injection, Updating config (Video 3)'
language: English

description: "In this video we explore how to use dependency injection in Helidon MP to automatically create instances of a class and inject them into out code, how to get configuratio properties into these classes, and how Helidon can automatically use the latest version of a property even when it changes during runtime. \n\nThis is part of a series of videos introducing Helidon MP, a Java based microservices framework from Oracle that implements the Eclipse MP standard.\n\nIn this set of videos we explore how Helidon can be used to modernise existing code (or of course create new code) and create microservices using Helidon MP with minimal effort. We see how to REST enable methods in the code and require authentication, to understand the importance of scope and how to utilise dependency injection and configuring using external properties, how to simply get access a database in a secure transactional manner, easily create client code to communicate between your microservices, implement features for availability in frameworks like Kubernetes and to generate self describing REST API Documentation.\n\nThe videos are based on a hands on lab, and if you wish you can follow along, details of how to get to the labs and template source code are at the end of each video.\n\nFor more information on Helidon please see http://helidon.io\n\nLink to other videos: https://bit.ly/Cloud-Native-Helidon"
