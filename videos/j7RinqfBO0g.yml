description: "Attackers always get better with new attack techniques, so our threat modelling and defense mechanisms need to level up.\n\nThe aim of the presentation is to demonstrate the kind of attacks that are possible due to\nmisconfigurations. In particular, through the use of multiple examples, I will explain scenarios\nsuch as how misconfigured cluster privileges can lead to backdooring cloud environments,\navoid detection by manipulating logging controls and access sensitive information and trade\nsecrets due to IAM, pod security policy and webhook misconfigurations. The presentation\nwill also include the demonstration of the tool, Kubestriker which is designed to perform\nautomatic checks and scans to detect various misconfigurations and mitigate such\nconsequences.\n\n\nVasant is a security enthusiast speaker and currently serves as a Security Architect, DevSecOps Practitioner/learner and working towards securing cloud and cloud native in a Continuous Deployment world at mx51.\n\nHe is Passionate about Cloud Security, Cloud Native and containerisation Technology, DevSecOps and Security automation and acts as a security advisor for small medium and large scale businesses.\n\nAlways a Learner and currently ramping up DevOps skills to bridge the gap between the security and DevOps teams."
