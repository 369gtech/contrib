description: "Many times the task of a test automation person is to check that the content displayed on a web page is the expected one. That can mean either just the text, but also image attributes (like the source or the size), link attributes (like: label, URL it points to, whether it opens in a new tab), and so on. The classic approach testers use for such a task is to get these properties from the page with Selenium, then check them by using an assertion for each property. This leads to way too many assertions, and difficult to understand tests, without a clear meaning. In this talk i will show a different approach for checking the contents of web pages, by modelling all the needed properties into Java objects. This way, comparison will be done between expected and actual objects, not each property one by one. This will lead to more meaningful and shorter tests, while also adding reusability and easy maintenance.\n\nCorina Pip \nFrom Frequentis\nCorina is a senior test automation consultant, with focus on testing by means of Java, Selenium, TestNG, Spring, Maven, and other cool frameworks and tools.
