description: "by Robert Kaiser\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.208/simple_geodata_visualization_with_a_frame.webm\n\n\nMozilla's A-Frame library makes it really easy to create WebXR experiences (XR stands for Mixed Reality, i.e. Virtual and Augmented Reality) without requiring a lot of code knowledge. VR Map builds on that and the availability of real-world data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to demonstrate how to build a model of the real world in an WebVR environment. The talk will describe what WebXR is, how building basic scenes with A-Frame works, and how those technologies were used together with live data from OpenStreetMap to create the \"VR Map\" demo that allows people to walk and \"fly\" through a model of the real world in a Virtual Reality scene rendered directly in a browser supporting the WebXR Device APIs, ideally Firefox, of course. \n\nRoom: UD2.208 (Decroly)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:10:00+01"
