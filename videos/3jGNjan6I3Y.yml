Are you designing with them in mind?  As an attacker, Ian Coldwater would like to help you understand these users and their stories. What do their mindsets, motivations and methodologies look like? What do attackers look for when they look at a Kubernetes context, what do they do when they get in there, and what can you do to protect your clusters and code against them?  Being able to understand these perspectives can help you broaden your own. Letâ€™s explore them together, and learn how to build stronger, more secure systems accordingly. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UdIL"
