language: English
recordingDate: 1555263232
description: "Interested in seeing your Camel application redeployed on Kubernetes ~1 second after you have changed your Java code?\nCamel K is a new subproject of Apache Camel that aims at simplifying and speeding up the development process of Camel applications. In this talk we will present a few tricks that helped us to achieve that: custom Kubernetes Operator, custom Kubernetes resources, reuse of build images based on the set of dependencies and use of a ConfigMap to mount the changing bits to a container. Weâ€™ll explain the underlying concepts and run a live demo."
