title: 'TeMS: 17 Lines of Code That Got Me My Dream Job - Dalya Gartzman (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1517836124
description: "Dalya Gartzman, Algorithm Researcher @ Via\n\nSolving a textual math problem is a complicated task, requiring both mathematical understanding and language proficiency. Well, what if we could train a neural network to do both? And what if we could use existing tools to do it in just a few lines of code?\nIn this talk, Dalya shares with you the \"behind the scenes\" of her project, where she constructed a neural network that reads a textual math problem and outputs the underlying equation, and how this side project helped her strengthen her skills and get to her dream job."
