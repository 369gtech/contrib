description: "The Gradle Build Tool is quite powerful and flexible, perhaps too flexible if you ask around. Every where you turn you encounter custom builds with different conventions and arrangements.\n\nIf only there was a way to follow a structure than ensures top-down constraints in a build. Well it turns out it's possible!\n\nCome learn how you and your organization can leverage the powerful features found in the Gradle Build Tool while at the same time reducing clutter and head-scratching moments.\n\nAndres is a Java/Groovy developer and a Java Champion with more than 20 years of experience in software design and development. He has been involved in web and desktop application development since the early days of Java. Andres is a true believer in open source and has participated on popular projects like Groovy, Griffon, and DbUnit, as well as starting his own projects (Json-lib, EZMorph, GraphicsBuilder, JideBuilder).
