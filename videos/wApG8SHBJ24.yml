description: "Code Here: http://goo.gl/o1UKX\n\nBest Java Book : http://goo.gl/FtKp0m\n\nToday I complete the Java Swing tutorial I started in part 22 of the Java tutorial. \n\nI implement the Swing event listeners. I then cover how to format numbers in Java so that they have commas or are displayed as currency. JOptionPane, a useful popup window in Java is introduced. And, finally I review much of what we have done in past Java Swing Tutorials."
