description: "JFuture 2019, Minsk – November 16, 2019\n\nIoT powered by Microprofile – Microservices in practice, Mads Opheim\n\nThis talk will show you how easily you can design a good production-ready, secure, modular Java full-stack system with IoT devices based on the Enterprise stack with Microprofile combined with good continuous deployment infrastructure patterns.\n\nThere will be code, demos, and (buzzword) dragons.\n\nThe idea of this talk is to show a proper use of Microprofile and it's power combined with good continuous deployment infrastructure patterns and tools on a simple and (possibly funny) example with a simple domain, that can be transferred to more complicated systems and domains in the real life."
