description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nDijkstra once said that \"complexity sells better.\" While this may be the case in the short run, long run trends appear to counter this. Over the past 5 years cloud computing has gained such traction that the idea of a startup buying servers is laughable. What had formerly been done with hardware is now done simply with software, and further what is done with software is now done easily by services. At the same time a plethora of new databases have emerged to fill a host of storage and querying niches. While in general IT operations have gotten easier, less labour intensive, and cheaper, the operations of databases have not. The level of complexity in storing and querying data has exploded. In this session we will explore we why this is the case and discuss how database software eventually will be overrun by simple services.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- To encourage developer to concentrate on building great products. To argue for a shift to simple services to enable developers to build more capable products faster. To admonish us for fetishizing complexity;\nTarget audience:\n\n- Developers. Database users. API consumers. Anyone concerned with shortening the development cycle."
