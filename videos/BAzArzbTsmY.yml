language: English
recordingDate: 1619703745
description: '"There are so many benefits to building static sites such as security and cost, for example. Although static sites sound so boring and lifeless they are in fact far from it. Thanks to amazing API and webhooks you can do so much. Need some data? That is where Hasura comes in. Hasura is an open-source engine that connects your databases and auto-generates a production-ready GraphQL backend, meaning as a frontend developer you don''t need any backend skills to create your own API. With Nuxt.js the intuitive web framework, you can easily call your graphQL endpoint and use event triggers to regenerate your static site on content change. Yes, you can do all that with static sites and more."'
