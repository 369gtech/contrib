description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nBounded Contexts are a central premise in DDD. They help us to reason about a model and its language in a context, isolated from other models.\n\nEric Evans is the author of \"Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in Software,\" Addison-Wesley 2004.\n\nSince the early 1990s, he has worked on many projects developing large business systems with objects with many different approaches and many different outcomes. The book is a synthesis of that experience. It presents a system of modelling and design techniques that successful teams have used to align complex software systems with business needs and to keep projects agile as systems grow large.\n\nEric now leads \"Domain Language\", a consulting group which coaches and trains teams applying domain-driven design, helping them to make their development work more productive and more valuable to their business."
