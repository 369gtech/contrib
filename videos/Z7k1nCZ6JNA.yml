Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nNeuro-Inclusivity: The Future of the Tech Industry - Kiran \"Rin\" Oliver, Independent & Leena Haque, BBC \n\nAccording to a 2018 report from Tech Nation, 83% of the tech community in the UK believe their biggest challenge is accessing skilled workers. Too many talented people are going unnoticed by recruiters. As a result, there’s been much focus on attracting talent of all ethnicities and genders, but there’s a growing view emerging that more needs to be done in the area of neurodiversity.  Many cloud native companies are answering this issue by creating initiatives to hire neurodivergent people. Often, an entire division of recruiting/HR is dedicated to sourcing these individuals. There’s just one problem: They don't actually know what to do next. This panel will go into those next steps, in particular, focusing on on-boarding, retaining, and creating a welcoming work environment for neurodivergent individuals in today’s Kubernetes-based, cloud-native landscape. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ZekX"
