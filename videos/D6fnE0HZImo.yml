title: 'Daniele Bonaldo - The making of an Android library: Download Manager v2'
recordingDate: 1557245359
description: "Android allows developers to add download functionality to their apps, but if you want to extend that behaviour, or customise it to your liking — that’s not easy. That’s why at Novoda we created an improved version of the Download Manager.\n\nThis is the perfect example to see how Android developers can share common code between more projects through an Android Library. In this talk we'll see how to get started creating a library, what are the difficulties we encountered and finally how to publish and share the library between multiple projects.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2019/it\nhttps://twitter.com/droidconit\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
