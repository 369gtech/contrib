language: English
recordingDate: 1477691304
description: 'Since he was tapped as IBM’s CIO in 2014, Jeff Smith has been playing a second key role: transforming IBM’s internal software development culture to one that mirrors the Agile, user-centered, data-driven, and cross-functional approach that characterizes today’s Silicon Valley startups. Except he’s doing it for a team of 20,000 people, in support of a company with over 400,000 employees. We’ll talk with Jeff about what it takes to get a hundred-year-old company to change course.'
