The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nRunning K3s, Lightweight Kubernetes, in Production for the Edge and Beyond - Darren Shepherd, Rancher \n\nWithin the short year since announcing k3s, the CNCF certified lightweight Kubernetes distribution, users have quickly put k3s into production in edge, on-premises, cloud, and pipeline use cases. In this presentation Darren Shepherd, the creator of k3s, will cover different strategies of running k3s and how they map to different use cases. Use cases range from thousands of clusters on the edge, to fast ephemeral clusters to power your pipeline, to running AI workloads, and much more.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeo7"
