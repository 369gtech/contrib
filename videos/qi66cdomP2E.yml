description: 'A year ago I was tasked to test typical Microservices-based project with modern frontend and the traditional tools just didn''t work for me. So I went into a journey of finding modern techniques that might score better and guess what: I discovered a handful of neat techniques that rocked my testing world. Let''s discuss when the traditional testing tools fall short and how modern and emerging techniques can sometimes do better: In the past 10 years, the dev world had gone through dramatic changes but the testing models were left intact leaving us wondering how to test things like Microservice, and Serverless. This session demonstrates the new wave of testing tools (e.g. property-based testing, consumer-driven contract, fuzz, and others) and how they can better fit modern applications. This session aims to inspire with modern testing ideas, but it also packs practical and down-to-earth code demos. About me - Yoni Goldberg: I''m an independent consultant who works with 500 fortune corporates and garage startups on polishing their JS & Node.js applications. I''m also the author of Node''s largest best practices collection: https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices'
