description: "Here is the link to the presentation: https://goo.gl/5v0kE5\n\nBecause of bad experiences with Cordova and similar tools many of us ignored Xamarin for years as yet another cross­platform tool. A tool that promises miracles but sadly that's only a promise. With Xamarin is so not true. Let's talk about Xamarin and see that all shine and new technologies that Android and iOS developers are excited about also available with Xamarin. Many long before Google or Apple introduced them. Hashtags data binding, reactive programming, modern UI, good IDE, cross­platform, not­expensive­anymore ;)"
