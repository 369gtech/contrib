description: "Here is the link to the presentation: https://goo.gl/B5NzVr\n\nThe aim of this talk is to promote Kotlin among Android developers. There are a lot of things to talk about in this topic, I've chosen the highly popular library Anko to showcase some features of the language and also introduce an alternative way to define UI on Android. We'll go through the features of the library also we will check how we can extend the functionality with custom elements.  While Anko provides a tool to define your layout it does not stop there. I'll present some features added to the library that makes Android development faster and more fun."
