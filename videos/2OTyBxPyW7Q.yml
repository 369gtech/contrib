description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCloud Native Apps with Server-Side WebAssembly - Liam Randall, Cosmonic\n\nServer-side WebAssembly has the potential to increase security, extend application portability, and simplify cloud-native applications when operated in the Kubernetes ecosystem. This talk explores the pros and cons of different deployment models - embedded in a container, native execution, or embedded into other components. We will demonstrate the power that WebAssembly brings to even those projects hosted in traditional containers. This talk features a live build, compilation, deployment, and operation of reference applications. Featuring wasmCloud, Krustlet, and Envoy."
