title: 'R Geoffrey Avery (‎rGeoffrey‎) - ‎Dancer: Getting to Hello World‎'
language: English
recordingDate: 1403712688
description: "When attempting to learn Dancer I ran into the problem that all the documentation started from \"Here is a 'Hello World' script\". But that was assuming many things were set up and configured and that just was not true, at least not on my server.\n\nThis is a collection of what I learned.\n\nPlus a few comments of what would be different if you wanted to use Mojolicious rather than Dancer."
