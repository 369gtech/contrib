description: "Speaker: Han Lim and Alan Menant\n\nTesting is often neglected by developers. We are always trying to find a pretext not to test our apps - “it is too difficult”, “there is nothing to test”, “no time for that”, “can’t test with external dependencies” etc... . We will show you how to introduce testing to different aspects of your code so that you can instill confidence in yourself and others on the correctness of your programs.\n\nThis session will be an introduction about applying TDD in your unit tests, writing good integration tests, incorporating front-end JS test and good / bad testing practices.\n\nAfter the presentation you’ll have no excuse for not testing your code like a pro.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/231984965/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/R4Ah/"
