description: "When the FBI is having a hissy fit because Apple can’t help them unlock the data on a phone you know it is pretty secure. On the other hand, there are products shipping with without signed updates and people still manage to make their S3 bucket world readable. The knowledge to build and operate secure systems is out there. Why don’t we implement it? This talk will take a look at how to distribute security more evenly across all technology.\n\n=== \n\nChris Wysopal, Veracode’s CTO and Co-Founder, is responsible for the company’s software security analysis capabilities. He has served on the Black Hat review board for ten years. He was named one of InfoWorld’s Top 25 CTO’s and one of the 100 most influential people in IT by eWeek.
