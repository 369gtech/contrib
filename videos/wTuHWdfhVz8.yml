description: "Note: Apologies for the choppy audio.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Mandy Michael\r\n\r\nAs of right now there are many great Sensor & Browser APIs that you can take advantage of including Light Sensors, Orientation and Speech Recognition. Our forever friend and VVIP of SingaporeCSS, Mandy has agreed to give her amazing sensors and browsers API talk all the way from Perth. So far but same timezone, omg so blessed.\r\nWhether it’s a practical implementation of the Light Sensor API or abducting a cat with a combination of sensors - we’ll look at some simple code demos, explore the possibilities, tools and resources needed to get started creating engaging and creative effects, visualisations and experiences.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/SingaporeCSS/events/267764592/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/C0ICg/"
