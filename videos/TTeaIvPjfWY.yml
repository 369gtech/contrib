description: "Distributed Sys Teams\n\nSri Ray, Fastly\n\nSingle Points of Failure is a term we all dread in the SRE world. We go through the pain of making sure services are resilient and distributed and yet, more often than not, we fail to give the same treatment to the most critical part of any systemâ€”the Humans.\n\nThis talk will focus on the importance of hiring remote and hiring across the world. We will also touch on little changes you can make to foster such an environment.\n\nDistributed teams not only add value to the core systems but also help us bring each other closer to one another.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
