description: "Most Java applications require parts of the UI to be implemented in JavaScript. But hardly anybody really wants to use it, in particular Java developers would rather avoid it by all means.\n\nLuckily a whole range of alternatives exists from which one can choose. In this talk we compare the most successful ones, TypeScript and CoffeeScript, with the most promising one: EcmaScript 2015, which is the new JavaScript standard that was just released."
