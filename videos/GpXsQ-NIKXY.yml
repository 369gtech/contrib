description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nJessica Kerr - Scala Developer\n\nABSTRACT\nHow is an expert OO developer to improve on their craft? By learning from other paradigms! These six principles of the functional style also apply to OO. Some are part of good practice already; some express patterns both old and new; all give us different ways of thinking about problems. For developers without expertise in functional programming, examples in Java and C# provide new techniques for writing clear, quality code. \n\nPlease see slides here:\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/jessitron/functional-principles-for-oo-developers\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
