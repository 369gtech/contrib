In this video, you will be working on image processing with Python and also will learn about the convolutional neural network. Finally, we will build an end-to-end model to process and identify the Covid X-Ray images with CNN. \n\n🔹Check our complete Deep Learning With TensorFlow playlist here: https://goo.gl/cck4hE \n🔹Check our complete Deep Learning With TensorFlow Blog Series: http://bit.ly/2sqmP4s \n🔴Please do subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future: https://goo.gl/6ohpTV\n\n📌𝐓𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦: https://t.me/edurekaupdates\n📌𝐓𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫: https://twitter.com/edurekain\n📌𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐞𝐝𝐈𝐧: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka\n📌𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦: https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning/\n📌𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\n📌𝐒𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐞: https://www.slideshare.net/EdurekaIN\n📌𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐛𝐨𝐱: https://castbox.fm/networks/505?country=IN\n📌𝐌𝐞𝐞𝐭𝐮𝐩: https://www.meetup.com/edureka/\n📌𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲: https://www.edureka.co/community/\n\n#Edureka  #EdurekaDeepLearning #COVID19Detection #PneumoniaPrediction  #DeepLearningTutorial  #EdurekaTraining #Python\n\n---------𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐤𝐚 𝐎𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐂𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧---------\n\n🔵 DevOps Online Training: http://bit.ly/3qqcotZ\n🌕 Python Online Training: http://bit.ly/3i7DiDD\n🔵 AWS Online Training: http://bit.ly/39EOIv9\n🌕 RPA Online Training: http://bit.ly/39t6MrE\n🔵 Data Science Online Training: http://bit.ly/3bywuOu\n🌕 Big Data Online Training: http://bit.ly/35ADG8L\n🔵 Java Online Training: http://bit.ly/35Avwxb\n🌕 Selenium Online Training: http://bit.ly/2Ltn4ZE\n🔵 PMP Online Training: http://bit.ly/2LMP3mT\n🌕 Tableau Online Training: http://bit.ly/38z4oR9\n🔵 Microsoft Azure Online Training: https://bit.ly/3wsAhV4\n🌕 Power BI Online Training: https://bit.ly/3zq1WHX\n\n---------𝐄𝐝𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐤𝐚 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐬---------\n\n🔵 DevOps Engineer Masters Program: http://bit.ly/2MY1OMc\n🌕 Cloud Architect Masters Program: http://bit.ly/2MY1OMc\n🔵 Data Scientist Masters Program: http://bit.ly/3qaVZJA\n🌕 Big Data Architect Masters Program: http://bit.ly/3qaVZJA\n🔵 Machine Learning Engineer Masters Program: http://bit.ly/3bxAhLG\n🌕 Business Intelligence Masters Program: http://bit.ly/3byBhiS\n🔵 Python Developer Masters Program: http://bit.ly/3nw4Rb2\n🌕 RPA Developer Masters Program: http://bit.ly/3nw4Rb2\n\n-----------------------------------------Edureka Post Graduate Courses-------------------------------------------\n\n🔵  Artificial and Machine Learning PGD: https://bit.ly/3AylL0q\n\n----------------------------\nHow it Works?\n1. This is a 5 Week Instructor led Online Course,40 hours of assignment and 20 hours of project work\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n3. At the end of the training you will be working on a real time project for which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n\n----------------------------\nAbout the Course :\nEdureka's Deep learning with Tensorflow course will help you to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple “Hello Word” example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will evaluate the common, and not so common, deep neural networks and see how these can be exploited in the real world with complex raw data using TensorFlow. In addition, you will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained. Finally, the course covers different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders.  Delve into neural networks, implement Deep Learning algorithms, and explore layers of data abstraction with the help of this Deep Learning with TensorFlow course.  \n\n----------------------------\nGot a question on the topic?
