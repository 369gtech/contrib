language: English
recordingDate: 1630250653
description: "Natural language conversations are, by their very nature, free flowing. But they may not always be the best way for your skill to collect information from its users. To help with these kinds of tasks, your skill can call a webview application. \n\nThe video demonstrates how we can configure VBCS as an externally hosted webview to collect user information from Oracle Digital Assistant and leverage Oracle Integration Cloud to transform the payload between VBCS and ODA."
