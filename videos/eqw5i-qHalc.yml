In the talk I''ll briefly present the history behind the plugin, the vision for the future and current status.

I will end with short guide for open source enthusiast that would like to contribute to the plugin. The target audience for this talk are Jenkins daily users or administrators but also Java Developers - beginner level is enough - that would like to start to contribute to open source projects.'
