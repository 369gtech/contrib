In this talk we will see how the online advertising ecosystem works, what different ads products exist and how to implement ads on your app in a very easy way. We will start from an overview of the needs of users, advertisers and publishers and how the three things can be put together in a healthy environment. We will see how AdMob works and browse quickly through the SDK with working examples to see how to implement and apply it in your own creation :)!'
