title: 'GTAC 2013: Espresso: Fresh Start to Android UI Testing'
recordingDate: 1367254742
description: "http://g.co/gtac2013\nSlides: http://goo.gl/ieunS\n\nValera Zakharov , Google\n\nDeveloping a reliable Android test should be as quick and easy as pulling a shot of espresso. Unfortunately, with existing tools, it may feel more like making a double-shot-caramel-sauce-upside-down-single-whip-half-decaf-latte - confusing and rarely consistent. Espresso is a new Android test framework that lets you write concise, beautiful, and reliable UI tests quickly. The core API is small, predictable, and easy to learn - yet it is also open for customization. Espresso tests state their expectations, interactions, and assertions clearly without distracting boilerplate, custom infrastructure, or messy implementation details getting in the way. Tests run optimally fast - leave your waits, syncs, sleeps, and polls behind and let the framework gracefully manipulate and assert on your UI when it is at rest. Start enjoying writing and executing UI tests - try a shot of Espresso.\n\nUpdate [October 2013]: Espresso is now open source: https://code.google.com/p/android-test-kit/."
