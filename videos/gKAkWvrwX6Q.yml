description: "\"The exciting field of programming is one part engineering and one part art. We, as humans, have been programming for a few decades. Every few years we see a significant change in how we develop applications.\n\nSome changes are small, while others are significant. They're disruptive and change the way we think, design, and develop. In this presentation, we will take a look at some changes that are currently happening and some that are just around the corner. We will take a look at why these changes are important and how they will change the way we create and deliver applications.\""
