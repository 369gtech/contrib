description: "Prioritization: 10 different techniques for choosing what to start next\n\nTroy Magennis, Consultant, Focused Objective LLC \n\nWhen we choose to do one piece of work, we most often defer something else. What is the impact of that deferred work? Is it costlier than finding the funding for both? The goal of prioritization and ordering is to maximize the return on people, time and cash at hand. This session looks at ten different techniques and discussed how, why and when to use which method.\n\nDepending on circumstances, even the crudest ordering method may be the right one (“my opinion”). For other circumstances, rigorous understanding of the impact of work order on product lifetime profits might be needed. We will discuss how to decide.\n\nSome question answered are –\n\n- How good is just randomly picking?\n- What if we just focus on a value estimate alone?\n- How does duration and effort change the optimal order?\n- How optimal is the SAFe ordering technique and where it might mislead?\n- If we wanted to be “certain” what is involved?\n- How do dependencies impact our ordering choices?\n\nThis session stresses there is no one optimal technique. There are a variety of techniques that balance the effort required for analysis versus the chance of not finding the absolute optimal result. By attending this session, you will have a better idea of how to choose.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
