title: 'How to Make Smart Blinds using Facial Detection'
language: English
recordingDate: 1491791660
description: "Etan and I are going to show you how to make smart blinds using the Raspberry Pi and some components! The blinds will detect if a person is near it using facial detection and open. When a person moves away, it will close. We attached a servo motor to the blind to get it to do this automatically. I met Etan when I was attending Columbia in NYC and now he's a software engineer at Square. I've known him as a hardware hacker, so I thought it'd be fun to collab! We started off soldering in a board, but in the end we decided to use a breadboard instead (so no need to solder) This was a 2 day project.\n\nCode and instructions for this project:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/hardware_demo\n\nPlease subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going.\n\nEtan's Twitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/etanz?lang=en\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-picamera/worksheet/\nhttps://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-8-using-a-servo-motor/hardware\nhttps://learn.adafruit.com/category/raspberry-pi\nhttp://docs.opencv.org/2.4.13/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
