description: 'The trigger of the gold rush in the late 1890s is the same trigger of the Blockchain hype today. Eager interest around Blockchain took root a couple of years ago and never stopped growing exponentially. The use of Blockchain today is advocated in nearly any business domains, including finance, education, identity management, goods and intellectual property, supply chain and energy.  But is there any real substance behind the hype? As the World Economic Forum claims, is there really hope for a new perfect world devoid of fraud, poverty and even jealousy? It’s all about software so the answer is “It depends”. And it depends on the use-cases one considers and in which way the Blockchain paradigm helps (if it helps) achieving the specific goals. And, more importantly, it depends on a Blockchain-based solution being the only way to reach the goal. We’ll discuss Blockchain in the context of Bitcoin and outside of it and compare public chains to private and permissioned chains and how the problem of trust and governance applies in both cases. As an concrete case-study, we’ll discuss Blockchain in the energy industry.'
