description: "“Circuit Breakers, Stranglers, Metrics, Stressors, Simian Armies, small (but not too small) services, integration styles, composite UIs, API design, API documentation, API evolution, Reactive Streams, Events, Event Sourcing, Logging, Automated deployment, blue/green switchover, flexible infrastructure, bulkheads, PaaS, Cloud, DevOps Culture, Antifragility …” the list really does go on!\n\nWhoever said adopting microservices was easy never saw the sheer list of things to be considered! But the benefits are worth it…\n\nMicroservices offer an architectural style that is flexible enough to become the de-facto approach for future enterprise software systems, but the individual journeys and pitfalls vary dramatically from context to context.\n\nRuss will share several real-world technical journeys, the tradeoffs that have been made, the tools that had to be invented and, finally, how to adopt your own effective “Microservices UX”, the best and most effective user experience for those having to plan, architect, develop, deploy and maintain microservices within their own systems.\n\n\nAbout Russ Miles\n\nRuss Miles, when he’s not trying to achieve the wealth and, more importantly, the stable of motorbikes and cars of Tony Stark, is Chief Scientist and a founder of Simplicity Itself.\n\nHis job is to help Simplicity’s enterprise clients adopt and get the benefits of microservices, period.\n\nHe travels the world on this mission and, frankly, loves his job for it."
