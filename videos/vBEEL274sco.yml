title: 'Matthew Seal - Programmatic Notebooks with papermill - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557110999
description: "\"Speaker: Matthew Seal\n\nNotebooks have traditionally been a tool for drafting code and avoiding repeated expensive computations while exploring solutions. However, with new tools like nteract's papermill and scrapbook libraries, this technology has been expanded to make a reusable and parameterizable template for execution.\n\nWe'll walk though how Jupyter notebooks are being programmatically used at Netflix and how this helps with our batch processing world. We'll also explore how these use cases connect back with users and why we've adopted these tools for Python and non-Python execution.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
