title: 'Dependency Injection with JavaScript and Node - Ludwig Magnusson'
recordingDate: 1415365794
description: "Node is known for making it simple to build small usable tools and libraries that can easily be imported elsewhere. But if you want to go bigger and create a full application does this model still hold? Is it easy to construct all your internal modules if they have complex dependencies within your own application? And is it possible to test them all in isolation?\n\nThe answer is yes, and a very good way to solve this problem is to use dependency injection (DI). There are actually very many DI libraries in node and we will look at good and bad aspects of them. We will get an introduction to what DI actually is, the difference between module loading and DI will be explained."
