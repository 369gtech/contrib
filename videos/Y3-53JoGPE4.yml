title: 'Learning Clojure through Logo - Elango Cheran, Timothy Pratley'
language: English
recordingDate: 1507997869
description: "“A Lisp by any other name would be as fun and simple,” Shakespeare once said.* People who first learn programming through Logo, or its graphical spinoffs Blockly and Scratch, often reminisce of fun and simplicity. Logo and Clojure are also both a Lisp, so what’s easy in one language should inspire or carry over to the other. We introduce clojure-turtle and Power Turtle as ways to soften the Clojure learning curve, with Power Turtle itself being vivid proof of the power and flexibility of Clojure.\n\n(* Or maybe not)"
