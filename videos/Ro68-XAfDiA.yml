description: "Trust the Hamster! - Peter Goetz & Norman Sutorius, IBM\n\nOver the past two years the Bits-Service, a Cloud Foundry Blobstore API, has been developed and is ready for action! Bits-Service started as an extraction of existing functionality in the Cloud Controller today by externalising all bits related operations (application bits, droplets, packages, buildpacks, â€¦). So it's time for an update on Bits-Service. We would like to lay out the drivers behind Bits-Service, give updates on \"What's new?\", \"What's different?\", \"What to expect from Bits-Service?\", and why we rewrote it in Go.\nFinally, there will be an outlook on resource-matching in the CF V3 API as well as future development plans. And what exactly does all this have to do with a hamster?\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyP/trust-the-hamster-peter-goetz-norman-sutorius-ibm"
