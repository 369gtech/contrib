description: "Shipping, Learning & Making Trade-offs:\n\nWhen solving problems, designers are good at imagining how solutions ought to be. But realities can be hard and constraints can be plentiful. The final product can be different from what you hoped it would be. It's almost never a question IF concessions should be made, but WHICH concessions should be made. Know which trade-offs you can make, and which ones you can't by knowing your user's goals and understanding the perspectives of the people in your team.\n\nAbout the speaker: \nJoost van der Ree http://www.joost.co â€“ Product Designer at Uber I like to solve real world problems with digital products. In my spare time I care about cities and urban design.\n\nAbout the conference:\nAt The UX Conference on February 20th 2018 in London we were exploring how to improve collaboration between designers and business stakeholders. The event was organised by The School of UX http://schoolofux.com and kindly supported by Balsamiq, TestingTime, Axure, Loop11, UsabilityHub, Optimal Workshop and Proto.io.
