description: "What is the best programming language to learn for machine learning? There are a lot options, and a lot of opinions on this. I'm going to describe the top 3, using code, animations, and data to validate my point. We'll learn about tensorflow.js, several python libraries, and why C++ compiles code so fast. All of that in just 8 minutes, enjoy! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Best-Programming-Languages-for-Machine-Learning\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
