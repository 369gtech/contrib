description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nThe Bootiful Application\n\nAlright, so maybe \"bootiful\" won't ever work, but I tried, and it was worth it too because you're reading this. Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot aims to make address the common functional and non-functional requirements that gate quickly moving to production. Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it's turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST, micro services, web, batch, big data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started.\n\nJosh Long, Pivotal\n\nJosh (@starbuxman) is the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal. Josh is a Java Champion, author of 5 books (including O'Reilly's upcoming \"Cloud Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry\") and 3 best-selling video trainings (including \"Building Microservices with Spring Boot Livelessons\" w/ Phil Webb), and an open-source contributor (Spring Boot, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud, Activiti and Vaadin)"
