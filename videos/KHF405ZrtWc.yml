description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nCloud Native Machine Learning Systems at Day Two and Beyond - Sophie Watson & William Benton, Red Hat \n\nYou’re probably already convinced that Kubernetes is the right infrastructure for your next machine learning initiative, but you may not be ready for some of the speedbumps that await you on the way. This talk will introduce some of the challenges unique to machine learning systems, prepare you for the tradeoffs you’ll face supporting practitioners and putting systems in production, and present some of the additional tools you’ll need in your DevOps toolbox as your cloud-native machine learning systems mature. You’ll learn how to negotiate pitfalls related to interactive development, reproducibility, and monitoring machine learning systems in production with concrete solutions inspired by our experience with end-users in various industries. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekC2"
