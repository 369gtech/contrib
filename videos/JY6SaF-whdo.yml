However, we've mostly neglected sharpening our primary tool - our IDE!

And that's where Boris Litvinsky believes, we, the community should step in!\n\nIn this talk, Boris shows how and covers the endless possibilities. We’ll learn how to build an extension for your IDE using the knowledge you already possess - Javascript!\nFor demonstration, we’ll examine an extension that Boris recently built for VSCode called Glean.
