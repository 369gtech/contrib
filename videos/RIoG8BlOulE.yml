title: 'GopherCon 2021: Varun Gandhi - Understand Compiler Errors Better by Reading the Spec!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1640049036
description: 'Newcomers to the Go language may find the presence (or absence) of compiler errors confusing. In this talk, Varun gives two examples of situations where he has recently understood the details better by directly consulting the Go spec, one around struct fields and one around implicit conversions. His goal is to encourage beginner and intermediate programmers to consult the spec as needed, instead of being intimidated by it.'
