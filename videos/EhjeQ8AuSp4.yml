description: "http://strataconf.com/strataeu/public/schedule/detail/26320\nMark spent the past two decades working on analysis and decision support projects in many industries. He is the founder of Third Nature, a research and consulting firm focused on emerging technology and practices in analytics, BI and information management. Mark is also an award-winning former CTO and consultant who frequently speaks at US and European conferences.\n\nI focus on two types of work: using data to make decisions and manage organizations, and building data technology infrastructure. I've spent the past two decades working on analysis, performance management and decision support projects. A big part of making decisions and using data in a corporate setting is ensuring that the right data capture and data delivery infrastructure is in place to manage the business. As a result, I do as much information strategy and IT architecture work as I do performance management and decision support."
