title: 'LISA15 - Instrumenting a Data Center with InfluxDB'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639009075
description: "Instrumenting a Data Center with InfluxDB\n\nDavid Norton, InfluxDB Core Engineer\n\nMaintaining a healthy data center and high availability of the services running within requires constant monitoring. It also requires monitoring that can scale and adapt quickly as a data center grows or new services are added. Collecting, storing, and analyzing metrics data at data center-scale poses significant challenges. This talk will discuss InfluxDB, an open source scalable time series database, which simplifies this task. We'll look at several options for collection, including Telegraf, InfluxDB plugins, and the InfluxDB API. We'll discuss the InfluxDB data model, built-in functions (derivative, mean, etc.), continuous queries, data retention policies, and clustering. And, we'll discuss options for data visualization.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
