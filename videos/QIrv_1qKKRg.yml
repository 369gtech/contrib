recordingDate: 1381879729
description: "This is an exclusive presentation by Kim Reese recorded live at Strata + Hadoop World 2012\n\nDo you work with data regularly but struggle to show it in meaningful ways? Do you wish to energize your others with compelling visual information? Do you feel the communication of your data sometimes falls flat?\n\nThe way we deal with data is so far removed from its actual meaning, that it can be difficult to get back to the richness of it. This session will cover practical methods for conveying data visually, such as:\n\n    \"Unthinking\" data\n    Sketching data ideas\n    Metaphors\n    Rapid prototyping\n    Emotion of data\n\nYou will walk away better equipped to communicate the nature of your data.\n\nAbout Kim Reese\n\nKim Rees is a founding partner of Periscopic, an award-winning information visualization firm.
