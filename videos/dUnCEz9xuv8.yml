description: "In this contest, languages that run on the JVM, represented by their respective language nerds, battle for bragging rights as the most popular language by showing off their shiny new features. Adding a twist to the format in which the audience members will pick this year’s winner(s): they will also vote on a language that should not return in 2015. Returning from 2013 are language gurus representing Clojure, Groovy, JRuby, and Scala. Attend this fun-filled and technically invigorating session to judge which scripting language best meets your needs. You’ll also be able to compare the respective languages and spark some thought-provoking discussions with the panelists that will be beneficial to the entire Java community.\n\n\nAuthors:\nGuillaume Laforge\nGuillaume Laforge is the Groovy Project Manager, and Spec Lead of JSR-241, the Java Specification Request standardizing the Groovy dynamic language in the Java Community Process.
