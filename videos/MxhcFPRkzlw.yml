description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Berlin 2018. #gotocon #gotober\nhttp://gotober.com\n\nDejan Mitrovic - Lead Software Engineer at Free2Move\n\nABSTRACT\nRefactoring complex legacy monoliths into microservices is on the agenda of many tech companies of today. Once the migration is over, however, one quickly learns that the complexity simply spills over from the \"dev\" to the \"ops\" side. Many new infrastructural questions arise. For example, how do we maintain stability in a dynamic ecosystem of microservices? How do we recover from communication failures or identify performance bottlenecks in call graphs?\nDuring the refactoring, it's important for legacy clients that the APIs behave in exactly the same way as before, even exhibiting the same quirks and \"features\". Later, and especially with continuous deployment practices in place, developers have to be confident that changes in a microservice do not break its consumers.\nIn the first part of the talk we will discuss the concept of a service mesh, a dedicated infrastructure layer for tackling the inter-service communication. We will analyze existing solutions, such as linkerd and Istio, and cover practical aspects of installing a service mesh on both AWS ECS (with the help of Consul) and Kubernetes.\nIn the second part we will discuss consumer-driven contract testing. We will [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotober.com/2018/sessions/674\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotober\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#EventDrivenArchitecture #microservices #k8s #ServiceMesh #API"
