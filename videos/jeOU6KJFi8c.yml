title: 'Let''s Build a Compiler! LIVE'
recordingDate: 1602266391
description: "In this 1st educational game show,  my task is to build a simple compiler in under 250 lines of python code (comments not included), given a list of existing compilers on Github in other programming languages like Javascript. Your task is to correctly answer 3 relevant computer science questions via a link I'll provide when the show starts. At the end, if I'm successful, then I'll select one winner from the list  who answered each question correctly and will perform a live musical performance to a topic of their choice.\n\nCompilers translate one programming language to another, they're truly amazing and the reason why all software works. I've been dying for an excuse to build one myself. Get hype!\n\nCode for this video: https://github.com/llSourcell/Lets_Build_a_Compiler_LIVE \n\nAnswer questions here: itempool.com/llSourcell/live\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, then please Subscribe!
