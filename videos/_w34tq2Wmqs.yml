title: 'OpenTelemetry for Developers - How to Have Full Visibility in your Applications'
language: English
recordingDate: 1622558490
description: "The OpenTelemetry project has a goal of helping both developers and system operators get insights into the behavior and performance of their applications. This is achieved by collaborating with other cloud-native projects to \"make portable telemetry a built-in feature of cloud-native software\". As it were, OpenTelemetry is an important step in observability, as it provides high quality and vendor-neutral data with which observability teams can establish Service Level Objectives. No wonder the project features collaboration from the biggest cloud-native companies.\n\nCurrently, the OpenTelemetry project has very few contributions from developers within Africa. This talk aims to inspire developers from our continent to get involved, as the project supports implementation with every programming language and has issues suitable for developers at all levels."
