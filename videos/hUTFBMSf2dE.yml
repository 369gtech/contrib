description: "Upcoming .NET Conference:\n.NET Fest 2020 - 23-24th of October, Kyiv, Ukraine\nDetails and tickets: https://bit.ly/2Voq9wr\n\nThe talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/34fvZlq\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\nYou've used OpenID Connect. You know a thing or two about OAuth. But have you ever wondered how to achieve Single Sign-On between Angular & ASP.NET Core MVC apps, and automated Single Sign-Out? How, and why, to work with reference tokens? How to create a custom grant, and for what use case that might be a good idea?\nIn this in-depth session we'll cover all of these topics, extensively using IdentityServer4 in the process. Note that some previous knowledge on securing ASP.NET Core applications with OpenID Connect is a must."
