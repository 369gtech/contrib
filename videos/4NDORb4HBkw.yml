title: 'Customer Segmentation in Python - PyConSG 2016'
recordingDate: 1467777864
description: "Speaker: Mao Ting\n\nDescription\nBy segmenting customers into groups with distinct patterns, businesses can target them more effectively with customized marketing and product features. I'll dive into a few machine learning and statistical techniques to extract insights from customer data, and demonstrate how to execute them on real data using Python and open-source libraries.\n\nAbstract\nI will go through clustering and decision tree analysis using sciki-learn and two-sample t test using scipy. We will learn the intuition for each technique, the math behind them, and how to implement them and evaluate the results using Python. I will be using open-source data for the demonstration, and show what insights you can extract from actual data using these techniques.\n\nEvent Page: https://pycon.sg\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/P6SD/"
