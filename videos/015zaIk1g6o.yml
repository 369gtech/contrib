These tasks are handled by the serverless platform. To support portability of serverless applications across different serverless platforms, CNCF Serverless Work Group is working on a generic Application Workflow Specification. In this session, Cathy and Rachel will give an overview on the Application Workflow specification. They will show how the user can use the workflow primitives to describe different types of serverless application logic. The goal of this presentation is to share our work in the Serverless WG and bring people together in the CNCF community to discuss and develop a comprehensive and generic serverless workflow descriptive model that can be used across all types of serverless applications and platforms.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKX"
