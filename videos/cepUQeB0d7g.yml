description: "Building Learning into Team Life \nby Rachel Davies\n@rachelcdavies\n\n When we make time and space for learning within teams, the products and services we build benefit from new ideas and innovative solutions. Team members also tend to find work more satisfying and enjoyable, which helps company recruitment and staff retention. Many managers and coaches/scrum masters struggle when it comes to practical ways to encourage people to keep learning at work. It can help to build in time for learning, exploration and discovery into team/organization process but how can you get started? Perhaps more challenging, how can you keep learning initiatives going without taking on the admin yourself?\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/nordevcon2015/\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RachelDavies-BuildingLearningIntoTeamLife.pdf\n\nWe are aware that the sound quality is less than great but still see the value in sharing it with you and hope that Rachel joins us again soon."
