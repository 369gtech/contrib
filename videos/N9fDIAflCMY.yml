description: "Good features are informative, independent, and simple. In this episode, we'll introduce these concepts by using a histogram to visualize a feature from a toy dataset. Updates: many thanks for the supportive feedback! I’d love to release these episodes faster, but I’m writing them as we go. That way, I can see what works and (more importantly) where I can improve. \n\nWe've covered a lot of ground already, so next episode I'll review and reinforce concepts, introduce clearer syntax, spend more time on testing, and continue building intuition for supervised learning. \n\nI also realize some folks had dependency bugs with Graphviz (my fault!). Moving forward, I won't use any libraries not already installed by Anaconda or Tensorflow. \n\nLast: my code in this cast is similar to these great examples. You can use them to produce a more polished chart, if you like: \n\nhttp://matplotlib.org/examples/statistics/histogram_demo_multihist.html\n\nFollow https://twitter.com/random_forests for updates on new episodes!\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L - \nSubscribe to the brand new Firebase Channel: https://goo.gl/9giPHG\nAnd here's our playlist: https://goo.gl/KewA03"
