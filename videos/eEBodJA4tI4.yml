description: "Building a Testing Framework in NodeJS and ReactJS for Cloud Foundry Evergreen Testing [A] - Rajesh Jain & Brian Byers, Pivotal    \n\nSmolder is testing framework written in NodeJS and ReactJS for checking the health endpoint of all the apps running on Cloud Foundry. The health tests are executed by Concourse pipelines. Apps can implement their own health endpoint and the Radiator Dashboard pulls the health data using Websockets to show the current status. Concourse pipelines are driven either on a CF Event, like buildpack update or stemcell or service update or periodically every few minutes. Everyone needs to know the health of apps running on CF when something changes underneath, and this testing framework provides the answers. We are using this in Ford and other CF customers.\n\nBrian Byers\nPivotal\nPlatform Architect\nMinnesota\nI am a Platform Architect with Pivotal helping enterprises in their Cloud Native journey.
