description: "f(by) 2020\nClosing Keynote\n\nDependent types - Vitaly Bragilevsky @VBragilevsky\n\nDependent typing has been buzzing around in the functional programming community for a couple of decades.\nWhile it provides much more control over our programs and extends the expressivity of type systems to much higher levels, it makes programming much more brain consuming. In most cases, it is quite difficult to persuade the compiler that we are doing the right thing and get our program compiled.\nIn this talk, Vitaly will give many examples of dependent typing in several languages and explain why he's not as excited as a bunch of dependent typing advocates.\n\nGeneral Partner - Evolution Gaming https://eng.evolutiongaming.com/"
