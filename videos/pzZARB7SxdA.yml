description: 'Have you heard the expression "to start with a clean slate?" In terms of programming, that''s the last thing I want to do. Perhaps I''ve been spoiled by Grails'' create-app command, which gives you a fully working application out of the box.Lazybones is a simple tool that gives you the same sort of behaviour for any type of project, not just Grails. Want to get started with Ratpack? Simple, create a new project based on one of the Ratpack template projects. As long as there is a published template, you can use it. In this talk, you''ll see how to use Lazybones to create new projects and also how to develop and publish project templates for you, your team, and the whole world to use.'
