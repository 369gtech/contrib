title: 'How to Properly Blame Things for Causing Latency by Adrian Cole'
recordingDate: 1519313108
description: "This presentation reviews concepts, data model and architecture. It also talks about the difference between logging, metrics and tracing. The demo will have code in javascript and java (maybe also a surprise language!), but code expertise isn't required. When you leave, you'll at least know something about distributed tracing, and hopefully be on your way to blaming things for causing latency!\n\nAdrian Cole, Pivotal\nAdrian works at Pivotal, on the Spring Cloud team. He spends most on Zipkin, usually in Java. He also runs a distributed tracing working group for implementors.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
