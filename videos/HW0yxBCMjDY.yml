Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nDeep Dive: Cortex: 1.0 and Beyond! - Goutham Veeramachaneni, Grafana Labs \n\nCortex is a CNCF project that provides horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant, long term storage for Prometheus metrics, and a horizontally scalable, Prometheus-compatible query API. In this talk, we will talk about everything that led to the recent 1.0 release of Cortex, what it means to the project, users and community. We will then build upon that, and talk about all the new and exciting features the Cortex team is working on, including the next generation storage engine based on top of Prometheus TSDB and Thanos. We will cover why we're building the new engine the scaling challenges we faced and how we fixed them. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpB2"
