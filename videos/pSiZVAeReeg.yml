description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nDespite being quite “new”, Spring Boot has seen a spectacular start as an amazing kickstarter for Spring-based application. You can now start your project in a matter of minutes, not days!\n\nOn the other hand, you’re still using Java, with all its ceremony regarding code… Wouldn’t it be great if we could pair Spring Boot with a powerful yet simple language?\n\nIn this talk, I live code a Spring Boot application using Kotlin. Come discover how you can now cut through all the red tape and finally focus only the important stuff.\n\nAbout Nicolas Frankel:\nSoftware Architect with 15 years experience consulting for many different customers, in a wide range of contexts (such as telecoms, banking, insurances, large retail and public sector).
