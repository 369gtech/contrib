description: "Design system and Systemic Design are not the same stuff. At all.\n\nA design library is a comprehensive catalogue of reusable elements (modules, atoms, chunks etc). A design system is the operationalization of the library (processes, procedures, governance, integration with development and marketing. Design systems allow you to manage design at scale. \n\nSystemic design is the design of systems. It's a huge difference, because a system is a complex whole with parts and interdependencies. Products and services of a company can be seen as experience holograms (user perspective) or a combination of touch points (company perspective).\n\nThe webinar wants to discuss this field, presenting temporary laws of systemic design."
