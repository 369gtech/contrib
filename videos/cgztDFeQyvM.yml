description: "Communicating risks, particularly to our non-technical colleagues, is a challenge and by not doing it well we suffer pushback from the business. The risks are varied and at all different levels, but can include technical debt, skill gaps, team burnout, and more.\n\nIn this talk we will look at how to clearly, concisely, and consistently communicate and prioritize risks, and how to use this to negotiate plans with the wider business. Weâ€™ll look at examples from the team, the department, and the business level, and how to rollup risks through these levels.\nBecause of the difficulty in communicating risks, there is a risk that you will get pushback on making the changes you know are important, resulting in damage to your team and the business. Mitigation strategy: come along to this talk and get the knowledge you need to start giving risks the priority they deserve.\n\nAbout Dr Jonathan Graham\nDr. Jonathan Graham is the CTO of Transaction Assurance Group, a company driving transparency and efficiency within the supply chains of wholesalers, buying groups, and retail chains. Some key clients are in the pharmaceutical space, where Jonathan draws on his experience working in drug development for GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nJonathan continues to support the mission of Mined Minds Foundation, the non-profit he co-founded to bring software development opportunities to communities suffering from economic depression, and has co-founded and run a software development consultancy. He has spoken at international conferences on a range of subjects, including in-depth technical topics, scalability, control of quality, and developing agile teams. You might also have seen him live-coding music on stage, or performing a stand-up set. For the fun of his two giant Newfies, Jonathan is regularly taken for walks along the lakefront and through the beautiful city of Chicago."
