title: 'Armagan Amcalar - MIDI A New Dimension in Controlling Your Browser'

recordingDate: 1559561908
description: "Gone are the days of knobs and buttons, or tactile controls. But are you really limited to a keyboard and a trackpad or a mouse, or could physical controls enable better control of your software? This talk builds up on Web MIDI API, demonstrating how physical interaction with browser software enables greater control. An online image editor, a software instrument, and a Snake game are demonstrated on stage as examples of applications that can benefit from extended physical control. And the best part is, everything happens in JavaScript and in your browser.\n\nSlides: https://slides.com/armaganamcalar/midi-a-new-dimension-yglf#/"
