description: "Whether you checked the weather app or not on the day before 22 Jan 2016, a huge snow storm covered the Eastern United States that weekend. If you lived in New York or DC, you had to dig out from under a large load of snow the next morning.\n\nIn the face of such storms, the good news is that people have almost perfected the art of weather prediction over the past few decades. A snow storm or hurricane will no longer catch anyone by surprise. If we act on these predictions in time, we can easily prevent the bad disasters of the days gone by.\n\nMy keynote will expand on this theme. Bring an umbrella."
