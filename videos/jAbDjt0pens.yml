description: "JavaScript is the lifeblood of the modern web application. You need it to do anything remotely complex on the web.\n\nBut, for many Python developers, the modern JavaScript ecosystem is intimidating. The tools feel complex. There are often several ways to achieve the same goals. It's hard to choose a frameworkâ€”and then once you do, it's hard to know exactly how to integrate it into a Flask or Django project.\n\nThis talk aims to demystify modern JavaScript for Python-minded developers. It will cover major advances that have been made to JavaScript in recent years and how you can use the JavaScript ecosystem - including tools like npm, webpack and babel - to write Python applications for the modern web.\n\nEVENT / SPEAKER:\nPyConZA 2020 / Cory Zue\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS / ATTRIBUTIONS:\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
