description: "From #Vilnius to #Mallorca! BUILD STUFF is going to celebrate summer! An amazing weekend on APRIL 29-30, 2017 â€“ MALLORCA, SPAIN will take you out of the office into a seaside event full of professional lectures, technical sessions, beach games, umbrella drinks, and wonderful sunset. #buildstuffes #beachconference #code www.buildstuff.es\n\nCasey Bisson has done time as a systems engineer, software engineer, writer, librarian, open source founder, information architect, and director of engineering prior to joining Joyent, where he is the director of product and leads the development of Triton. He may be color blind, but he compensates with a wardrobe of clashing patterns."
