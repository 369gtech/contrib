recordingDate: 1558046505
description: 'In this session, we’ll discuss the challenges for creating a seamless model of the world in 3D that can be used for mixed-reality scenarios and how you can leverage Bing Maps data to address some of those challenges. We’ll also show how the Unity platform is being used for Mixed Reality development and how maps of the world can be an integral part of many scenarios. And finally, we’ll talk about how the Unity Map control was developed from existing Bing Maps resources to address these scenarios and how it integrates seamlessly with other Unity content.'
