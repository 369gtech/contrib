description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune, 13 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nResearch Scientist - Assaf schuster\n\n\nTitle: \"A Geometric Approach to Detecting Global Properties over Distributed Data\"\n\nAbstract:\n\nA basic construct in many distributed systems is the detection of global properties over distributed data.\nExamples include a wireless sensor network where we would like to be alerted whenever the average\nof the temperature readings taken by the sensors exceeds a given threshold, or a distributed search engine\nwhere the set of search terms whose frequency of use is above a given threshold must be determined.\n\nUntil recently, research has focused on detecting global properties that are defined by simple aggregates\n(e.g., sum, average, or minimum) over the distributed data. In many cases, however, global properties\nof interest are expressed by more complex functions. This is the case, for instance, when the goal is to\ndetect when the variance in sensor-network readings is in excess of a threshold, or when the set of pairs\nof search terms whose correlation exceeds a threshold is to be determined. Such tasks typically require\nthat all the data be collected to a central location, incurring very high communication costs.\n\nIn this talk I present a novel geometric approach for efficiently detecting a wide family of global properties\nthat are defined by the value of an arbitrary function on the distributed data vis-a-vis a given threshold.\nThe global property is split into a set of constraints applied locally at each node. As long as the local\nconstraints at all the nodes are satisfied, the global property is guaranteed to be satisfied as well,\nand no communication is required.\n\nI begin by presenting the geometric detection method and show how it is applied for efficient detection\nof complex events in a distributed streaming setting. Time permitting, I will also show how it can be\nused for determining top-k queries over distributed databases.\n\nSpeaker: Research Scientist - Assaf Schuster"
