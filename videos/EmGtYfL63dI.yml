description: "The Odd Couple - Cross-platform Services with Examples in Blacksmith and Tweed - Kevin Rutten, Stark & Wayne\n\n(Theme music from the Odd Couple starts playing) “One was an Open Service Broker for Cloud Foundry, one was a Kubernetes friendly service wrapping Dockerhub images. Both as different as could be but trying to live together” Kevin want to show you two different projects to manage services. Blacksmith boots VM running services via BOSH and Tweed starts services via containers. Cloud Foundry can use both. Kubernetes can use both. The developers can use both. Mix and match the best parts of Cloud Foundry and Containers. This talk includes project updates on two projects to provide services (and service frameworks) for Cloud-Native architectures while showing how to use and migrate the services as needed. Examples shown should be portable to other service brokers helping operators and developers as they enter a hybrid-plsatform world.\n\nTo learn more about Cloud Foundry, The Proven Developer Experience For Kubernetes click here: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
