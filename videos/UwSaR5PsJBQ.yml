recordingDate: 1358620044
description: 'Francisco Tolmasky, co-founder of 280 North, presented on a wide range of topics relating to their awe-inspiring Objective-J and Cappuccino frameworks. During this presentation you will get a (no longer) sneak peek at the cib2nib functionality released as part of Cappuccino 0.7 (which is now available), a view into Objective-J Debugging, and an incredibly deep look into why they decided to create Objective-J, for any JavaScript developer, regardless of your thoughts on Objective-J, it is an absolutely great perspective on the "Good Grief" of JavaScript development, and how it can be driven forward based on great ideas.'
