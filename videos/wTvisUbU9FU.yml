recordingDate: 1558510677
description: "In January 2017, Microsoft open-sourced the C# language on GitHub. This included the proposals and prototyping, specifications and meetings... C# is constantly evolving and as a .NET developer it's important to know what new features are being added to the language.\n\nWe will cover all the new C# 8 features:\n\nAsync streams\nNullable reference types\nAdvances in pattern matching\nStatic locals\nUsing declarations\nRanges and Indices\nDefault Interface Methods\nTarget Type New Expressions\nWhile some of these features are truly innovative and could be hugely beneficial, this talk is not without bias! I empathize with the developer community and not only understand, but can relate to limitations of development efforts imposed by business restrictions. This talk is opininated and doesn't simply boast all the features as being something that should be adopted.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
