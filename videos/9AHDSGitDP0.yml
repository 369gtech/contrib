description: "Get started with the Firebase Realtime Database documentation: https://goo.gl/hgWLRL\n\nPicking up from where we left off in the last episode, today on Polycasts we'll look at how to connect our app to the Firebase realtime database. The Firebase database is extremely easy to setup and since it's event based, you never have to poll it for changes. Best of all, we can use the new Polymerfire elements to remove extra code and make setup a total breeze!\n\nPolycasts playlist: https://goo.gl/r5fsMq \nPolymer Slack: http://bit.ly/polymerslack\n \n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel: https://goo.gl/OUF4e2"
