description: "RubyConfBY 2019 - https://rubyconference.by\n\nVideo Partner â€“ iTechArt  https://www.itechart.by \n\nAbout the talk: \nThis talk is a story of my journey in the programming world - a journey which started in the Smalltalk world, switched to Java, but then was dominated by Ruby/Rails. \n\nMy focus on implementing the business logic was always crucial in my apps. During the talk, I will show how my thinking has been changing, how it was challenged and where I ended for now. I will show many code examples and discuss their pros and cons, including the ways of testing them. Object-oriented and Function-driven techniques will be shown. \n\nI strongly believe that the ability of implementing business logic, separated from the framework, separated from the persistence mechanism, separated from any library - is crucial to the success of many business projects. \n\nDuring the talk I want to take you for this journey with me and leave you with new knowledge that you can apply in your codebase immediately."
