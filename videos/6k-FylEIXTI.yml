description: "\"Around the serverless in 180 days\" by Wojciech Gawronski\nHistory of the ongoing (more than six months in progress) and already successful (two projects already delivered in production, and one in 3 weeks) cloud transformation. The case mentioned above talks about an established company that used AWS like hosting - and now embraces Serverless Architecture more and more - for both new projects and by rearchitecting step by step the existing ones."
