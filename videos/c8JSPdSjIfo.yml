They already exist and are being trialled in many parts of the world with significant investment from the automotive industry and large technology companies such as Google, Apple and Uber.

We will be able to sleep, read books, play games or work while journeying from A to B – the impact on personal time and work-life balance will be huge.\nThis keynote will provide delegates with a realistic view of how far advanced autonomous vehicles actually are and how they will very soon impact the way in which we travel and live. Of course there are some challenges which will be discussed, however these will be overcome and it won’t be too long before we own our own driver-less cars; our own piece of the future parked on our driveways.\n\nRead more: http://oredev.org/2015/sessions/self-driving-cars--the-future-is-now-- \n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
