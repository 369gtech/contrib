I'll summarize some style points and policies that affect Abseil and its users, and demo hands-on many of the debugging features of the library. \n— \nTitus Winters: Google, C++ Codebase Cultivator\n\nTitus Winters has spent the past 6 years working on Google's core C++ libraries. He's particularly interested in issues of large scale software engineer and codebase maintenance: how do we keep a codebase of over 100M lines of code consistent and flexible for the next decade? Along the way he has helped Google teams pioneer techniques to perform automated code transformations on a massive scale, and helps maintain the Google C++ Style Guide.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
