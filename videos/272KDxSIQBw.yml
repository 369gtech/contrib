title: 'Crash Course: Angular and ngRx | Aspen Payton'

description: "This is a hands-on workshop that teaches participants how to structure an Angular application to use NgRx for state management. When I set out to learn NgRx a year ago, I found a lot of high level discussion of the Redux pattern and a variety of very specific code examples, but struggled to find education that laid out the pattern from beginning to end with fully functional examples. That is what I intend to provide with this workshop.\n\nWe will being with a starter project and existing HTML. We will set up state for the application, walk through creating a basic action and reducer, wire up the action and reducer in our app, and dispatch the action from a component so we can see it working in the app. From here, we can walk through the pattern again introducing additional complexity by passing a payload into an action and creating an action with an effect. Participants will end the workshop with a simple, but fully functional, application using NgRx.\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
