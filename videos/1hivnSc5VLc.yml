title: 'Refactoring for Conceptual Integrity - Aslam Khan'
recordingDate: 1396970411
description: 'Abstract: We refactor smelly code so that it becomes clean. That is what I call pathological refactoring - getting rid of the disease in our code. I found aiming for clean code alone left me in an unbalanced state, and I really don''t like living life on extreme edges. The question then is what can I use to balance this focus on refactoring for clean code? I''ve found that refactoring for conceptual integrity gives me that balance. And life is so much nicer closer to the centre.'
