description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Daniele Bottillo, Deliveroo.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=170959\n\nNight mode is live! Android 10 is out and users can turn on this option on their phone, so it's time to adopt it. Yet many perceive its adoption as hard and complicated for an existing application.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show the journey of the Rider app at Deliveroo to support night mode: starting from the adoption of the new material components library, to tackling an existing design system to support multiple apps. It will show to how to design a new day and night theme and how to approach this migration within a team, with the constraint of a two weeks release cycle.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk you'll have a good idea of how to support dark mode on an Android application."
