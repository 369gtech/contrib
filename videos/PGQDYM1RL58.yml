description: "...  unless you are a bot developer (for now...).\nBots, Chatbots, Voice Assistants using AI are going to replace many of the repetitive, monotonous and absurd jobs that humans have been doing for a long time. The bots are prepared to be much more efficient in these types of inhuman jobs. Nobody wants to answer the same mail hundreds of times a day or be necessarily friendly with angry customers. We bot developers have been called to save the world and free up that time that humans waste to be more creative and collaborative."
