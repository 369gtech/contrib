description: "Video with transcript included: https://bit.ly/2Xd6JvC\n\nAlex Blewitt presents the microarchitecture of modern CPUs, showing how misaligned data can cause cache line false sharing, how branch prediction works and when it fails, and how to read CPU specific performance monitoring counters and use that in conjunction with tools like perf and toplev to discover where bottlenecks in CPU heavy code live.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon London 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq \n\nThe next QCon is QCon New York 2020 – June 15-17, 2020: http://bit.ly/2Uyj39C \n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQ’s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#CPU #Performance #Hardware"
