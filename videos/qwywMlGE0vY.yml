title: 'Edge Conf 2: Offline'
recordingDate: 1380149029
description: 'Web applications that work offline are still clearly in demand, but the standards lack support for even fairly basic use cases, and encourage developers to break fundamental navigation models of the web. There are two competing (or perhaps complementary), proposals to improve the situation, but it''ll be a long slog. In the meantime, workarounds remain some of the most hackish in the web world. Are there any workable solutions to ''adding'' offline to an existing site? What patterns allow offline to be used today while remaining open to replacement solutions in the future?'
