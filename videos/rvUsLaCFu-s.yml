In fact, empathy can be modeled out in a more analytical way, making it approachable and accessible for people who naturally think with logic. \n\nIn this talk, Andrea Goulet will present empathy as a technical concept: modeling out six different types of empathy and diving deep into the details of what makes it an important part of developing software. If you’ve ever found yourself saying “I’m good with machines, but not with people” this is one talk you won’t want to miss.\n\nBiography\n\nAndrea Goulet is the CEO of Corgibytes, a software development shop dedicated to maintaining and modernizing software applications and has been named by LinkedIn as one of the Top 10 Professionals in Software Under 35.
