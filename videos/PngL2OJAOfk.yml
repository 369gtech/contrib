description: "Speaker: Josh Long, Pivotal and Vaadin\nIt's been a long day, but you've done it: you've got a Spring Boot powered backend and now you need to build the UI that'll power the workforce and deliver next week. Vaadin, a UI framework that marries the ease of use of server-side Java and the rich, dynamic nature of client-side JavaScript, integrates well with Spring Boot and offers UI polish that would be hard to secure any other way. Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long and Vaadin evangelists for a look at how Vaadin and Spring Boot can get you to production quicker, and easier."
