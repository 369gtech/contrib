description: "http://jdk.io/\n\nFor most software development teams it is a major challange keeping up with the rapidly changing requirements, while meeting the required quality, budget and deadlines. Most companies are implementing Agile or lean methods, but these are not silver bullets solving all problems. This seminar will give an introduction to Continuous Delivery, argue why it is an important part of the solution, and demonstrate a typical Continuous Delivery pipeline implementation for Java based on open source tools like Jenkins, Git, Artifactory, Maven, JUnit, Copertura, FindBugs, PMD, etc."
