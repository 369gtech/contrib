description: "Containers is a very interesting field of research as far as security is concerned. Millions and millions of Linux containers are spun-up a day, some of them are privileged.  Privileged containers are a breed of their own, and using the –privileged flag is only one of many ways to spin up a privileged container. Privileged containers may spin up as a result of necessity (e.g. some of Kubernetes containers are privileged) or as a result of a misconfiguration. In this session we introduce the idea that privileged containers are an opening into an organization’s network and demonstrate some of the methods we found to exploit them, using the Play-with-Docker (https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) container website. Attendees will see how we use a number of different methods, such as loading a Linux kernel module into the Play-with-Docker kernel, exploiting devices present in the container to read and write host’s files, and more.\n\n=== \n\nNimrod Stoler is a cyber security researcher at CyberArk Labs where he focuses on researching the latest attack techniques and applying lessons learned to improve cyber defenses. Nimrod’s primary research areas are network defense, DevOps analysis and security and Linux containers. Prior to CyberArk, Nimrod served in several high-technology roles doing research and development of software and hardware. Nimrod holds an LLB in law and BA in economics."
