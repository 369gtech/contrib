recordingDate: 1403178397
description: "During this session you will learn how to develop remote control apps for a number of Sony cameras, including Sony Action cams, Sony Alpha cameras and Lens Style cameras - such as the Lens Style Camera QX10.\nWe will go through the required steps and show you how to connect your\nsmartphone or tablet to the Sony cameras over Wi-Fi to establish a one-to-one connection. Your app will then start working as a client and you will be able to call the APIs.\n\nThis session will also address some new features that will be introduced in an upcoming update of the Camera Remote API beta SDK with even more APIs - like shutter speed functionality, white balance and ISO settings.\n"
