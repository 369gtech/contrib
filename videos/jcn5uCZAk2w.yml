description: "An access modifier in C# specifies who can see and use a resource. You probably are familiar with public and private. We use those a lot but did you know that there are others? In this video, I am going to cover six different access modifiers and when you would use each. We are also going to discuss why we have various modifiers and it isn't just about security.\n\nFull courses: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=AccessModifiersDemo\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nNewsletter signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
