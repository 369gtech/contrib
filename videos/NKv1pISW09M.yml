description: "Deep Dive: Moving is Hard – Migrations without Impact (or back pain) - Stacy Kirkland, Liberty Mutual Insurance & Tom Mitchell, Stark & Wayne\n\nThe thought of moving from one place to another is daunting. Whether you’re moving to a new city or next door, how and when do you make a snap decision? While working remotely across multiple time zones, Liberty Mutual migrated thousands of applications between Cloud Foundries across twelve foundations and five regions in the public cloud and on-premise. In this session, we will discuss how we approached the effort to migrate a Cloud Foundry platform. We'll share with you the successes and some of the challenges we overcame at a technical, organizational, and personal level and how important it was to have a partner like Stark & Wayne there to support us. Please join us if you’d like to learn how we migrated Cloud Foundry with zero developer effort and minimal impact to the business.\n\nTo learn more about Cloud Foundry, The Proven Developer Experience For Kubernetes click here: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
