recordingDate: 1525708862
description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - “WebXR” is the API formerly known as WebVR, upgraded to embrace the web’s potential not just for Virtual Reality, but for immersive Mixed Reality experiences. We can start exploring the possibilities now, using libraries like Mozilla’s WebXR Polyfill and Google’s three.ar.js, plus special development browsers that incorporate ARCore (Android) or ARKit (iOS). This talk will share how you can begin to blend the real world and the digital world as a Mixed Reality web developer - and a glimpse into the exciting future of the Immersive Web.'
