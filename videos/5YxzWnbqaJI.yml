description: "Let's talk Brain Computer Interfaces. BCI's are the next step in human evolution, they are the inevitable upgrade we'll need after the age of smartphones. If done right, they can help us fulfill our wildest fantasies. We'll be able to learn anything, experience anything, and be anywhere in seconds. I'll discuss the philosophical, theoretical, and technical aspects behind the idea.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Brain_Computer_Interface\n\nTinkula's Winning code:\nhttps://github.com/tterava/Mandelbrot\n\n이정환 runner-up code:\nhttps://github.com/jhGitHub009/cuda_c-\n\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology\n\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Introduction_To_Modern_Brain-Computer_Interface_Design\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv1ckJVrRqo\nhttp://videolectures.net/mlss06au_muller_bci/\nhttps://www.mepits.com/tutorial/173/Biomedical/BCI---Brain-Computer-Interface\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html\nhttps://gizmodo.com/scientists-just-invented-the-neural-lace-1711540938\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
