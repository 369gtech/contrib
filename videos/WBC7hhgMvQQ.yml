recordingDate: 1630539868
description: "Container escape is a hot topic in cloud security. Methods of container escaping has been covered by several parties however the traditional container (runc) uses the same kernel with the host so there are always new escape methods being discovered. In this talk, I will show three new methods to escape the runc container. These are not new vulnerabilities per se but are new exploits to escape from privileged runc containers.\n\n=== \n\nLi Qiang is a senior security engineer in Ant Group. He focus virtualization/container/kernel/cloud-native security in Ant Group. Before joining Ant Group, he is a vulnerability researcher and found a lot of vulnerabilities in QEMU/Virtualbox/Linux kernel. He has spoke in a lot of security conference such as CanSecWest, Syscon, Ruxcon, HITB and so on."
