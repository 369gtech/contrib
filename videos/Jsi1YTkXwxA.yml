description: "A talk from Barcelona Ruby Conference 2013 (http://baruco.org)\n\nTime and time again, skilled developers with good intentions set out into the green field of their new Rails app. Alas, as days turn to weeks, weeks to months and months to years, they find themselves with an ever increasing maintenance burden. Adding new features in a well-designed way starts to feel like an exercise in futility, so they resort to liberal use of conditionals to avoid breaking existing code. This leads to more complexity, and on the cycle goes. It doesn't need to be like this. There's no silver bullet that will save your project from this fate, but by practicing a holistic approach to code quality you can stave off the maintenance monsters and keep your app's code feeling fresh and clean. This talk will look at low ceremony, common sense approaches to taking control of the quality of your codebase. You'll leave with an expanded toolbox of techniques to build a culture of quality within your organization.\n\nhttp://www.baruco.org/talks/building-a-culture-of-quality\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)"
