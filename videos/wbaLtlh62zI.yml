description: "From the 2014 Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City, Paul Zikopoulos's keynote \"A Word Too Much Repeated Falls Out of Being - So Why is Big Data Being Talked About so Much?\"\n\n“A word too much repeated falls out of being” once wrote the poet A.R. Ammons. Well, credit to the term “Big Data” because it’s hanging in there – but surely too much repeated. Learn how this overused term is a confluence of technologies – some that have been around for a while, some that are relatively new, while others are coming down the pipe or not even invented yet. In this session you’ll see an actual application that builds on in-place existing technologies such as Hadoop to deliver understandable results. You’ll hear about a story where analytics at rest was applied to forms of unstructured data using a simple SQL-like development environment, and findings were promoted to the frontier of the business to score, in real time, monetizable intent, assess reputations, predict health outbreaks, and more. You’ll hear why Cognitive is the game changer and learn about attribute extraction for 360 degree master data around an entity. As a added bonus, the speaker is going to try to deliver this session without once mentioning ‘that word’.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by IBM.\n\nAbout Paul Zikopoulos:\nCompetitive Database and Big Data teams. Paul is an award winning writer and speaker with more than 20 years of experience in Information Management and is seen as a global expert in Big Data and Analytic technologies. Independent groups often recognize Paul as a thought leader with nominations to SAP’s “Top 50 Big Data Twitter Influencers”, Big Data Republic’s “Most Influential”, Onalytica’s “Top 100”, and AnalyticsWeek “Thought Leader in Big Data and Analytics” lists. Technopedia listed him a “Big Data Expert to Follow” and he was consulted on the topic of Big Data by the popular TV show “60 Minutes”. Paul has written more than 350 magazine articles and 18 books, some of which include “Hadoop for Dummies”, “Harness the Power of Big Data”, “Understanding Big Data: Analytics for Enterprise Class Hadoop and Streaming Data”, “New Dynamic In-Memory Analytics for the Era of Big Data: DB2 10.5”, “DB2 pureScale: Risk Free Agile Scaling”, “DB2 Certification for Dummies”, “DB2 for Dummies”, and more. In his spare time, he enjoys all sorts of sporting activities, including running with his dog Chachi, swimming, and overall fitness training (he no longer worries about avoiding punches in his MMA training as an eventual understanding that he became too slow for full contact forced him into retirement). Ultimately, Paul is trying to figure out the world according to Chloë—his daughter.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop World 2014: http://goo.gl/UUfrR7\nFind out more about the conference: http://strataconf.com/stratany2014\n\nDon't miss an upload!
