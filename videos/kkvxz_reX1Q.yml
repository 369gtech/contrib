title: 'YOW! 2014 Erwin Van der Koogh - Docker, Slayer of Chefs & Puppets'
recordingDate: 1514388181
description: "Imagine having all the power of virtual machines with none of the downsides. That is pretty much what Docker is and it is no surprise it is taking the IT industry by storm. Chef, Puppet and many related tools have been instrumental in getting DevOps & Continuous Delivery off the ground by changing the way we think about infrastructure configuration. Docker is taking it to the next level by changing the way we think about what an application is.\n\nIn this talk Erwin will start with the basics of Docker and then show you how it not only takes a lot of complexity out of automating Continuous Delivery, but can also help you with the cultural aspects of DevOps.\n\nErwin is Principal Consultant and Head of Academy at Elabor8 in Melbourne. It is unclear whether Erwin is a technologist who is interested in organisational change or a change agent with a deep love for technology. He is a regular speaker at (inter)national conferences on the intersection of Technology, Business & Complexity.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
