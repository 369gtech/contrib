description: "Experience Report: Cloud Foundry Open Source Operations - Lucas Pinto and Steffen Zuber, anynines\n\nCloud Foundry and OpenStack are the biggest Open Source projects in their domain. As IaaS and PaaS walk hand in hand the idea of combining both worlds is close. anynines is running their public Cloud Foundry offering on top of OpenStack for more than three years with two years running on a self-hosted OpenStack setup. As head of public Paas operations Julian Weber has gained a lot of knowledge to share about setting up and operating Cloud Foundry installations. This presentation leads the audience through the journey of adopting the Cloud Foundry Open Source version and breeding it to a highly available and production ready Cloud Foundry setup. The listener is guided through the analysis of potential single points of failure in standard CF Open Source setups up to required changes in the Cloud Foundry OS release to reach our goal. As this talk is about Cloud Foundry operations we also need to talk about experiences with BOSH as a general purpose tool for software lifecycle management of big distributed systems and possible improvements to the BOSH tool set and workflows. The talk will enable advanced DevOps to dive deeper into the technical details of setting up production ready Cloud Foundry installations based on Cloud Foundry Open Source.\n\nLucas Pinto, anynines\n\nSteffen Zuber\nDeveloper, anynines"
