description: "Erlang User Conference 2012\n\nerlang-solutions.com\nerlang-factory.com\n\n\"This talk will describe the architecture, design decisions, and the current implementation and performance of ErLLVM. ErLLVM is an extension of the HiPE native code compiler of Erlang/OTP that uses the Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) compiler infrastructure as a back-end. As such, it benefits from the set of existing components and low-level optimizations that LLVM provides. More importantly, it is in principle readily \navailable on all platforms that LLVM supports.\n\nErLLVM is a full system currently available as open-source and has been tested on x86 and x86_64 based machines running Linux. It supports the complete Erlang language and to the best of our knowledge is robust enough for others to try. We welcome user feedback and extensions!\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
