title: 'React components, atomic design and storybook - Einar Afiouni'
recordingDate: 1499244158
description: "We've had success with using atomic design principles when developing our react components. We did this using a tool called storybook which displays those components in isolation, meaning you can both use it to develop in it and also as a design showcase of your components. The whole thing is packaged as a npm package we can then import into any project we want.\n\nIn this lightning talk I will go through how we broke our components into atoms and molecules, and how storybook made it easier for the developers to make the components based on the spec while automatically gaining a design showcase we can use a reference or show to others."
