description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: HAProxy Technologies - Benchmarking 5 Popular Ingress Controllers\n\nSpeakers: Daniel Corbett\n\nPerformance has never been more important than in a cloud-native world. Cloud-hosted resources cost money and a slow-loading application can cause a suboptimal ROI. Have you taken the time to tune your Kubernetes ingress controller and proxy? Many organizations don't until it's absolutely necessary, and most users will typically run a default, out-of-the-box configuration.\n\nIn this demo, we benchmark five popular ingress controllers and put them head-to-head against each other with their default configurations:\n\n• Envoy\n• HAProxy\n• NGINX\n• NGINX Inc.\n• Traefik\n\nWe measure their average requests per second, latency percentiles, and user-level CPU usage; We monitor for any errors that are produced in order to go beyond performance and test reliability. You can verify the results yourself by downloading the GitHub repository and reproducing our tests. Who will come out on top? Watch the demo to find out!\n\nIn this demo, we benchmark five popular ingress controllers and put them head-to-head against each other with their default configurations: Envoy, HAProxy, NGINX, NGINX Inc., and Traefik."
