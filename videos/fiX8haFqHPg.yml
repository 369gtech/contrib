CLICK TO FIND OUT\nby Vanessa Lee\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nAutomated Browser Testing\nABSTRACT\nWriting end-user tests helps us think critically about how our application functions in the real world, but browser testing is time intensive. We will analyze two specific to Elixir: Wallaby & Hound by covering their history, identifying pitfalls, and anticipating their future. We'll look at similarities and differences and compare performance, concurrency, & asynchronicity. We will devise a strategy for choosing the best framework for you and how to use the time you save by giving back to the toolset.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/vanessa-lee/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - VANESSA LEE\nCoder, mother of three boys, YA literature interviewer, and student of forensic genealogy\n\nVanessa is a software engineer at Interfolio.
