recordingDate: 1433505174
description: "In this panel session, different platforms are represented by their gurus, who show off their wares via demonstrations and try to convince Java developers that their respective platform is superior. Come learn how to evaluate the different platform as a service (PaaS) platforms and how each one stands out in terms of different criteria such as ease of development, scalability, deployment, and security. You will be able to participate in discussions pertaining to cloud development in general and PaaS in particular. After attending this session, you will walk away with a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each of these platforms and which platform might be best suited for your own solution.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJoshua Long\nJosh Long is the Spring developer advocate.
