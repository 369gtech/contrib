description: 'Meet Johnny – a full-stack Java developer with 5+ years of experience under the belt, M.Sc degree and ‘get sh%t done fast’ mentality. Although Johnny possesses exceptional technical skills, Milton – his manager, doesn’t promote him, no matter how hard Johnny tried and how many late nights he has spent polishing his coding skills. Unfortunately, there is something important that Johnny doesn’t understand. Something that stops him from becoming successful. Together with Johnny, you will walk the thorny road to his remarkable career as a Chief Software Architect. The road full of struggles, discoveries and actions that may or will influence your professional life.'
