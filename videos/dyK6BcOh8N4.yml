description: "Back in June Payara joined Red Hat, IBM, Tomitribe and the LJC to announce the MicroProfile - a new collaboration aimed at making a lightweight runtime to power microservice architectures with existing enterprise Java APIs: JAX-RS, CDI and JSON-P.\n\nThe release date for the first version is targeted to September, so we should have several implementations of the new profile ready for consumption by Devoxx 2016!\n\nThis talk will focus on the Payara implementation, but also talk more generically about the microprofile and have an opportunity for questions about the future of the effort from one of the vendors involved.\n\nMike Croft is a support and services engineer for Payara. Mike has spent the last few years specialising in the non-functional aspects of middleware and likes to keep up-to-date with the latest products and solutions for production Java EE.\n\nMike now works for Payara supporting the community's use of Payara Server on GitHub, and supporting customers both remotely and on-site.\n\nMike blogs regularly on the Payara website and would like to stop talking about himself in the third person. http://blog.payara.fish/\n\n[OXS-1955]"
