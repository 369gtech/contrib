description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nMeet faasd. Look Ma’ No Kubernetes! - Alex Ellis, OpenFaaS Ltd \n\nAs excellent as Kubernetes is, the traction of tools like k3s has shown us that scaling down is just as important as scaling up. Meet faasd - a FaaS framework that uses battle-tested CNCF projects (containerd & CNI) and the OpenFaaS ecosystem to provide an alternative to FaaS on Kubernetes  With faasd, a function can cold-start in as little as 0.14s without resorting to stateful optimizations such as stateful containers that are injected with code. You can build, ship, and run containers built for both OpenFaaS and Knative. faasd was designed with portability in mind and runs on both Intel and ARM architecture  The use-case being explored for faasd is for a bundled VM appliances and for edge devices. Imagine a computer with direct access to cryptographic hardware, fast flash storage for CDN, or a TPU for machine-learning inference.  Through a live demo you’ll see an on-ramp into the CNCF ecosystem for teams who want to avoid lock-in, and aren’t quite ready for “full Kubernetes” \n\nhttps://sched.co/ZWeT"
