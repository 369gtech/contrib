title: 'React Native EU 2020: Kudo Chien - Extending React Native To The Next Platform'
recordingDate: 1603278399
description: "Abstract:\nReact Native proves the success of running React other than browsers. The official supported frameworks from Facebook are only iOS and Android. There were some other platforms maintained by third-party developers, but these forks sometimes run with older React Native versions. The main reason is the difficulty to follow rapidly changed upstream code. From the upcoming React Native new architecture, there will be more platform-independent shared implementations and more abstraction layers. Let's see if we could extend React Native to some new platforms benefiting from the new architecture."
