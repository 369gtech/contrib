Mark Scardina was joined by Macharapu Prasanth, Principal Member of Technical Staff from the Cluster Health Monitor (CHM) development team for an in-depth Q&A session on CHM's functionality, architecture and use in monitoring Oracle Cluster deployments.\n\n\n02:55 - What is Oracle’s goal in developing Cluster Health Monitor?\n05:37 - What types of metrics does CHM retrieve?\n07:05 - How often are the CHM metrics collected? \n07:40 - What is the cost of these metric collections?\n08:20 - What is the architecture of CHM?\n10:35 - Are the osysmond and ologgerd daemons managed by CRS?\n11:23 - Can I manage or modify the ora.crf resource?\n12:04 - You showed that there was only one ologgerd daemon for the cluster. What happens if the node where its running goes away?\n13:20 - Does CHM lose data during the time of the switchover?\n14:05 - How do I enable Cluster Health Monitor?\n14:45 - Should I disable Cluster Health Monitor, for example during patching and upgrades? \n15:35 - How do I know if Cluster Health Monitor is enabled and working? \n16:10 - From the diagram I see that CHM uses the GIMR. Is it a requirement? \n17:28 - What is the CHM metrics data used for?\n19:25 - How do I access this CHM data? \n26:44 - What is the retention time for this historical data?\n27:03 - Can I configure the retention time with more or less time?\n29:06 - Can I configure or customize the metrics CHM collects?\n33:08 - Does CHM send out notifications should metrics exceed certain levels? \n34:41 - If i already have infra monitoring tools such as New Relic / AppDynamics in my environment. Can i use them in conjunction to CHM ? \n35:28 - If so, can i pick and choose which metrics get monitored ?\n36:08 - Given that CHM data is available in EM, can I set thresholds there for notifications? \n37:22 - How is CHM data in EM different from what I already see from the EM agent?\n40:18 - Which versions of Oracle Grid Infrastructure support CHM?\n41:27 - Does CHM functionality change depending on the versions of the Oracle database are running in my cluster?\n42:00 - How has the CHM functionality changed since it was introduced in 11.2?\n45:25 - You mentioned that it now listens to CSS and GIPC events. What does it use those events for?\n48:00 - How is CHM different from OSWatcher?\n51:28 - Should I run CHM and OSWatcher together? \n52:18 - Does this CHM data get uploaded to Oracle Support Services?\n53:12 - Are there 3rd-party APIs to access this data for my own tools?\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
