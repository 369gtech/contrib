title: 'Multiplatform Apps with Spring, Kotlin, and RSocket'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632325412
description: "In this session, we’ll build a simple, collaborative, multiplatform to-do list powered by Kotlin, backed with Spring Boot-based server and RSocket as a messaging protocol for real-time communication. We’ll code the whole app from scratch, and explain the usage of Kotlin, Spring, and Rocket. We’ll also focus on the multiplatform aspect and running the client on different devices.\n\n Anton Arhipov, Developer Advocate at JetBrains\n Oleh Dokuka, Senior Software Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/multiplatform-apps-with-spring-kotlin-and-rsocket"
