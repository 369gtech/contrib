Flink applications can be either deployed as jobs (batch or streaming) or written and run directly from Apache Zeppelin on YARN. Flink applications are run within a project on a YARN cluster with the novel property that Flink applications are metered and charged to projects. Projects are also securely isolated from each other and include support for project-specific Kafka topics that are protected from access by users that are not members of the project. Hopsworks is entirely UI-driven, is open-source, and Flink applications that include Kafka topics can be created in a few mouse clicks. In this talk we will discuss the challenges in building a metered version of Flink-as-a-Service for YARN, experiences with Flink-on-YARN, and some of the possibilities that Hopsworks opens up for building secure, multi-ten"
