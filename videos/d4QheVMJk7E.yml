description: "This talk was recorded at Scala Days New York, 2016. Follow along on Twitter @scaladays and on the website for more information http://scaladays.org/.\n\nAbstract:\nImagine a world where writing and maintaining build scripts is fun and not black magic. A world without axis-scoped-multi-config-multi-project builds. With fast dependency resolution. Intuitive and statically checked build configuration. Where large builds use few and simple building blocks to compose small, self-contained and easy to understand builds. Where you only need to learn a small Scala library nothing more. Welcome to CBT - fun, fast, intuitive, composable, statically checked builds written in Scala. This is not a prototype. It's ready for prime time. This talk gets you started writing your own CBT builds. We'll do live coding and explain the philosophy behind CBT. If time permits, we'll dive into CBT's actually small and easy to understand code base."
