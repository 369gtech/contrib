description: "Ever find yourself in the tedious \"tweak, save, reload\" development cycle while building a map or visualization, and thinking that there must be a better, more efficient way to work? There is, using the Chrome Developer Tools. In this episode of the Google Maps Garage, Brendan Kenny and Paul Saxman share their techniques for using the DevTools to save time and sanity.\n\nDue to some production issues, 4:3 360p is the best quality that we have for this video."
