description: "Deep Dive: CNCF CI - Lucina Stricko & Denver Williams, Vulk Coop & CNCF \n\nThe CNCF CI status dashboard -- cncf.ci  -- provides a third party validation of builds, deployments and end-to-end testing for CNCFâ€™s Graduated and Incubating projects. CNCF welcomed Arm as Gold member in February 2019. The cncf.ci  dashboard helps ensure that Kubernetes and other CNCF-hosted projects run well on Arm-based platforms. Attendees will leave this deep dive with an understanding of how the cncf.ci  dashboard builds and tests projects on Arm and x86 architectures. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPj8"
