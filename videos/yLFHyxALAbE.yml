title: 'James E Keenan - "How Do We Assess and Maintain the Health of the Perl 5 Codebase?"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498595871
description: "The publicly visible part of the Perl 5 codebase consists of the Perl 5 core distribution and the totality of all the libraries on CPAN. We assess the health of the codebase via testing: smoke-testing of Perl 5 blead and CPANtesters testing of new CPAN releases on a wide variety of versions of Perl and of operating systems.\n\nBut what happens when the code is not so healthy or when we need to provide preventative care? How well are our tools suited for that purpose?\n\nIn this presentation we'll discuss the current state of Perl 5 smoke testing, testing of CPAN libraries and the mysterious land between them known as \"Blead Breaks CPAN.\" We'll see some of the challenges which the Perl 5 Porters face in moving the core language forward without causing major problems for CPAN libraries and other users. And we'll introduce some ideas for improvements in the ways we maintain the health of the ecosystem.\n\nNew York City-based Perl programmer and community organizer. Author of more than a dozen CPAN libraries. Presenter at YAPC::NA, YAPC::EU, YAPC::CA, DC-Baltimore Perl Workshop, Pittsburgh Perl Workshop and local Perlmonger meetings in New York, Toronto, Philadelphia and New Orleans. Member of Perl 5 Porters."
