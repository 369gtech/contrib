description: "This talk attempts to answer a pair of frequently asked questions, the first one of which is: how do I combine dependency injection with async and await in C# without leaky abstractions?\nIt turns out that the answer to that question can be found by answering another frequently asked question: how do I get the value out of my monad?\n\nDuring the talk, youâ€™ll get a quick and easy-to-understand explanation of monads.\n\nAll code examples will be in C#.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndccopenhagen.com"
