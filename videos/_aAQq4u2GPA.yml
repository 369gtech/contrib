recordingDate: 1532330770
description: 'There is more to blockchain than Bitcoin, Ethereum and all the mining! Let''s see how do these technologies can affect us, developers. This session starts with facts, establishing what blockchain, smart contracts and other concepts are. Armed with theory, we will showcase a ''smart contract'' application, built in Java, with open source, then discuss applications, problems and consider implications of a contract being put ''out there'' (and what is ''there'') You will walk out understanding what a ''distributed ledger'' is, knowing what to get from Github. And maybe an idea of an application, who knows? Let''s now build those revolutions everybody is speaking about!'
