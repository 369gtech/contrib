description: "Fuse - Let it Crash & Handle with Grace!\n\nFuse is an Erlang implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern. It is a small tool which can sit between your Erlang system and dependent systems which exhibit cascading failures. The purpose of fuse is to improve your systems handling of failures with more grace than normal.\n\nWe present an overview of why and how to use the tool, and we present the internal workings and design considerations. Furthermore we touch on how Erlang Quickcheck was used as a driving vehicle for development."
