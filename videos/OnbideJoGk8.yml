recordingDate: 1433505906
description: "Now that JSF 2.2 is complete, this session demonstrates the most important features in the context of a self-contained sample application. The features covered include\n \n&bull; HTML5-friendly markup\n \n&bull; Faces Flow \n\n&bull; Resource library contracts \n\n\n\nYou will learn how JSF is still relevant in today's enterprise software stack. Specifically, you will learn why you would want to upgrade to JSF 2.2 rather than opting for a different architecture entirely.\n\n\nAuthors:\nRoger Kitain\nRoger Kitain is the JavaServer Faces specification lead at Sun Microsystems.
