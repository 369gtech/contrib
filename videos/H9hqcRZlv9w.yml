title: 'Escape the Serverless Cage and embrace IT Automation by Laurent Doguin'

description: "Serverless is trendy. It's also a vapid term. There are always servers. It just means you don't see them, don't manage them(which is good), don't know how they work and what it runs(which is not so good) and can't use technologies unsupported by your Serverless vendor. Serverless locks you in because you can't do what you want and sometimes have to rewrite code specifically for that serverless platform. IT Automation differs in the sense that you see those servers, you know how they work, what it runs and can support any technologies. In this quick talk we will explain the differences between those two paradigms.\n\nLaurent Doguin is Head of Developer relations at Clever Cloud. He's also a nerdy metal head based in Paris and Devoxx Champion. He mostly wrotes code in Java and structured text in AsciiDoc, and often talks about data, reactive programming and other buzzwordy stuff. Laurent is also a former Developer Advocate for Couchbase and Nuxeo where he devoted his time and expertise in helping both communities grow bigger and stronger."
