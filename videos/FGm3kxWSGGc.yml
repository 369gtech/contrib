description: 'Today our world is full of things that are “as a service” - infrastructure, containers, platforms, software…and of course functions. With developers just now wrapping their heads around application platforms and containers, what are they to make of functions as a service? How does a busy developer cut through the hype and make sense of the world of serverless, Kubernetes, Spring Cloud Function and all the rest? This talk will clear up the confusion! We examine riff, a FaaS built atop Kubernetes. We will discuss where functions and serverless fits in your world, and how you can get started with some simple demos. Though functions aren’t a silver bullet, they are an important part of the development toolbox; this talk saves you from the buzzword bingo to give you a solid foundation of the FaaS landscape.'
