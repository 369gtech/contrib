description: "These days it's relatively easy to find accounts of what it's like to adopt agile for the first time: things to consider, suggestions of what might go wrong, and promises of what will be better. Less so for Extreme Programming (XP), whose star has waned (but perhaps may be waxing again). However, it's much more difficult to find accounts of what it's like to have applied agile practices, particularly XP, for protracted periods in growing organisations. As usual, while there is enlightenment in the journey, nirvana is elusive. \n\nSteve will talk about XP as it's practiced at Unruly, a video marketplace founded on XP principles more than a decade ago, and which continues to build on those principles - across the organisation, but particularly in the software development teams. Pairing or mobbing is the norm, continous delivery and test-driven development are simply givens, and decision-making is distributed, combining both top-down and bottom-up elements, but there are still plenty of challenges. Steve will be reflecting on how Unruly compares to other organisations and teams that he's encountered in his 30 years of software development, both agile and not, and the aspects of the process that are still evolving at Unruly. \n\nHopefully you'll be inspired to change, regardless of your starting point, and you may also learn a few things you'd like to avoid in your journey. Steve's XP journey officially began when he was asked to be a reviewer of the first edition of Extreme Programming Explained in 1999. After many years of encouraging teams to be more agile (with varying degrees of success), the journey has taken him to Unruly, where he has been CTO since September 2017. Steve was also a co-founder of Cogent, an Australian company founded on the principles of transparency, collaboration and software craftsmanship values. In between, he's worked in investment banking, a Silicon Valley startup, and a variety of small companies and consulting commitments.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2018, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
