description: "Building a PaaS for Robotics with Kubernetes - Dhananajay Sathe, Rapyuta Robotics\_\n\nBuilding a real-world robot enabled solution is challenging. Access to limitless compute and storage facilitates smarter, cheaper, and agile robots. Cloud robotics has different considerations than a typical web application.The session aims to dive into architecting a PaaS for robotics atop Kubernetes. More specifically - Lessons learned and benefits accrued migrating from the pre-docker era. Discuss abstractions necessary to appeal to a roboticist and challenges running ROS[1] middleware in the cloud-native world. Our extensions to sig-catalog and the OSB Spec. Ideas unifying declarative runtimes across the cloud and remote heterogeneous devices. Describe adaptations to Helm, Fluent, and other cloud-based infrastructure tools to manage and debug distributed robotic applications. In conclusion, the session will touch upon future directions and discuss community participation.\n\nAbout Dhananajay Sathe\nDhananjay Sathe was one of the primary authors of the RoboEarth Cloud Engine at the IDSC, ETH Zurich during his university thesis. Today he heads the engineering efforts on the Cloud Robotics Platform at Rapyuta Robotics."
