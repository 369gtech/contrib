recordingDate: 1204709255
description: "In this talk, developer John Coryat (of maps.huge.info and usnaviguide.com) will discuss the various techniques for creating custom maps in the Maps API, and the advantages and disadvantages of each. Demonstrations will include examples using a custom extension he wrote for overlaying images, and several examples of custom tile layers. This talk will be very useful for developers debating how to display large amounts of information on a map (especially polygonal data), or developers interested in creating custom maps from existing images.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PDF of the slides with a link to download them is here:\r\nhttp://www.usnaviguide.com/ws-2008-02/presentation.pdf"
