description: "Have you ever worked with a person who is always late for work/daily scrum, but later apologizes and everyone seems to forgive him? This loop of apologies and forgiveness can last for a very long time with no hope of ever getting out of it, perhaps even without noticing that something is not right. On a psychological level this might be a so-called game and is usually not a sign of healthy communication. During the session, you will learn more about such games I’ve observed among development teams as well as the psychological theory behind them. This should allow you to spot them more easily and react to them more appropriately improving the overall communication quality in your team and/or company.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nStretch Leadership and Management Conference\nstretchcon.com"
