title: 'Joep Piscaer - Reducing inertia with Public Cloud and Open Source software'
recordingDate: 1539700493
description: "\"I have a strategy to solve the DevOps transitional challenge. It is called reducing inertia that can be seen on daily basis in finances, team behavior and tech stacks. Reducing the friction in these areas is key to successfully move to the DevOps way of work. For me, ‘inertia’ is a good way of making value flow visible and I’ve been using it as the principle underlying my work. This approach can be applied especially successfully in more complex environments, such as enterprises.\"\n\nJoep Piscaer is a technologist with team building skills. He likes all things infrastructure (cloud, storage, virtualization), but really shines when it comes to DevOps and Infra-as-Code. Currently, Joep is building the Jumbo Tech Campus. It is the second biggest supermarket in the Netherlands and the fastest growing online supermarket there."
