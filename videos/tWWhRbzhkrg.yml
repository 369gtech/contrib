description: "As the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) products such as OpenAI's GPT-3 API places advanced synthetic media generation capabilities in the hands of a global audience at a fraction of the cost, what does the future hold for AI-assisted social engineering attacks? In our talk, we will present the nuts and bolts of an AIaaS phishing pipeline that was successfully deployed in multiple authorized phishing campaigns. Using both paid and free services, we emulated the techniques that even low-skilled, limited resource actors could adopt to execute effective AI-assisted phishing campaigns at scale. By repurposing easily-accessible personality analysis AIaaS products, we generated persuasive phishing emails that were automatically personalized based on a target's public social media information and created by state-of-the-art natural language generators. We will also discuss how an AI-assisted phishing workflow would impact traditional social engineering teams and operations. Finally, we look at how AIaaS suppliers can mitigate the misuse of their products.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. T. Karras, S. Laine, and T.
