If and when it does are we ready to make the most of it? \n\nIn this introductory talk Joseph will concentrate on how Property-Based Testing expresses intent, how to conceive of properties, and how this discipline helps to write correct software.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2OVPg4k\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JOSEPH YIASEMIDES\nSoftware engineer & trainer, RabbitMQ Trust Store contributor at Erlang Solutions\n\nJoseph is a software engineer and trainer at Erlang Solutions. He builds and tests servers in Elixir and Erlang on projects involving JSON/HTTP APIs, TURN/STUN, AMQP, and XMPP.\n\nBefore moving to Elixir Joseph discovered OTP through his time working with Erlang. He wrote the initial Trust Store plugin, a TLS certificate whitelist, for Pivotal’s enterprise message broker RabbitMQ. In early 2017, along with a colleague, he initiated ​work on ​Erlang Solutions’ TURN/STUN server (written from scratch entirely in Elixir). \n\nMore on Joseph Yiasemides: http://bit.ly/2OVPg4k\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 18\nWebsite: www.codesync.global\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\nMail: info at codesync.global"
