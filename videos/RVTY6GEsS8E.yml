description: "IT systems in organizations have grown to become more & more heterogenous and complex. Business on the other hand is also looking for information to make decisions at real-time. This is only adding to the complexity of technology and operating environment. Take for example a financial network generating a tens of thousands of transactions per second with an expected throughput of sub-second response times. Add to this complexity of scaling up to 1000’s of concurrent users. In this session, we will discuss our approach towards architecting and designing of high performance, throughput & data processing in transactional systems and real-time access to large data set via API’s to deliver superior experience to end users while handling:\n• Terabytes of data\n• 1000’s of IO per second\n• Reliability and autonomous failover of systems\nSpeakers:  Kiran Minnasandram\nCTO & Vice President, Wipro\nRaju Myadam\nDistinguished Member & Chief Architect, Wipro\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
