description: "Google recently released a research framework for fast prototyping of reinforcement learning algorithms called \"Dopamine\". They say that it aims to fill the need for a small, easily grokked codebase in which users can freely experiment with wild ideas (speculative research). In this live stream i'll test it out, try out a few basic reinforcement learning algorithms and compare it to similar frameworks. You can code along with me using CoLab.
