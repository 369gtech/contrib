description: "Arthur Hsu introduces Lovefield. Lovefield is an open-source relational database written in JavaScript and can run within browsers. It is fast, safe, easy to use, and supports Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer (version 10 and later), and Safari (version 5.1 and later).\n\nLovefield provides SQL-like APIs that are easy to learn and use, without the risk of SQL injection. The APIs cover queries (insert, update, delete, select), transaction management, parameter binding, and query observation. Lovefield also offers integrity check, data persistence, advanced indexing, and many other great features."
