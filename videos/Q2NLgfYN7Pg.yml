recordingDate: 1554489891
description: "This talk will cover implementing a custom UICollectionViewLayout using a real example from the BBC Sounds app. In Sounds we used a custom UICollectionViewLayout to implement an infinitely scrolling dial of radio stations.\n\nI'll address the details of when you should write your own layout versus using the default flow layout, some of the potential pitfalls and cover what you should consider when building it to ensure the layout is fully accessible to a VoiceOver user."
