description: "Client/server communication is central to web applications, but up until fairly recently persistent two-way connections required dark magic. But the WebSocket API makes it easy, and Socket.IO makes it even easier. We'll build a minimal chat application, look at a few alternatives (Comet, SSE, WebRTC), dig into the WebSockets API, examine some practical techniques for integrating a full-duplex channel into your application infrastructure, and explore some possible directions for the future.\n\nDann Toliver\nMaker of Things, Bento Box\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
