The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nDeep Dive: CNI - Bryan Boreham, Weaveworks & Bruce Ma, Ant Financial \n\nCNI, the Container Network Interface, is a small but critical piece of infrastructure linking runtimes such as Kubernetes and CloudFoundry to dozens of different container network implementations. This session is aimed at implementers of network plugins and runtimes using CNI, as well as anyone interested in contributing to the project or becoming a maintainer. In this session we will take a close look at the Tuning and Firewall plugins from the containernetworking/plugins repo. We will also have plenty of time for discussion and Q&A.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZexP"
