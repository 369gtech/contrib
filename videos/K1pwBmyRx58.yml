title: 'Rethinking API Design with Groovy Traits'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433259981
description: "Groovy 2.3 introduces the concept of traits in the language. Traits look like interfaces but enable the developer to add both implementation and state. They introduce multiple inheritance in the language while avoiding the diamond problem. Traits will let you rethink the way you design APIs in Groovy, by favoring composition of behaviors. This session explains what traits are, how they were implemented in Groovy, and what they have to offer to make your code more readable and maintainable.\n\n\nAuthor:\nCe?dric Champeau\nCédric Champeau is a Groovy core committer. He joined Pivotal Inc., in order to help developing the language. \n\nPrior to that, he spent several years at a software editor, where he used Groovy in multiple industrial contexts including DSLs for natural language processing, scripting or even workflows.\n\nHe implemented static type checking and static compilation in Groovy 2 and is specialized in compile time metaprogramming.\nView more trainings by Ce?dric Champeau at https://www.parleys.com/author/ce?dric-champeau-3\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
