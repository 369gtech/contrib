title: '(not= DSL macros) - Christophe Grand'
recordingDate: 1355703262
description: 'Too often, one writes a DSL by starting with macros. However, this is often a case of premature optimization. An approach centered around "DSV" (domain specific values) and an interpreter leads to greater dynamicity. Macros can be added afterwards for optimization purposes or as syntactic sugar.'
