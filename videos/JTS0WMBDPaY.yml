description: "Intro: CNCF Storage WG - Alex Chircop, StorageOS & Quinton Hoole, Huawei \n\nThe CNCF Storage Working Group collaborates to explore and understand how different storage technologies are used in cloud-native environments. Topics include block stores, file systems, object stores, key-value stores and databases, amongst others. Different architectural approaches (centralized, distributed, sharded etc) are compared in terms of key attributes like availability, scalability, performance, data consistency, durability, fault tolerance, ease of development and operational complexity. We seek to align the community on common understanding, terminology, classifications and use cases.  In this intro session we'll provide an overview of the work currently underway and on the roadmap. You'll get the meet the people leading these efforts, and find out how best to get involved and contribute. We also welcome any other input you might have related to cloud-native storage. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrcZ"
