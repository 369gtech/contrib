language: English
recordingDate: 1600363065
description: "Team Topologies is a clear, easy-to-follow approach to modern software delivery with an emphasis on optimizing team interactions for flow.\n\nFour fundamental types of team - team topologies - and three core team interaction modes combine with an awareness of Conwayâ€™s Law, team cognitive load, and responsive organization evolution to define a no-nonsense, team-friendly, humanistic approach to building and running software systems.\n\nSuzan Bond is joined by guest author Manuel Pais to explore team patterns and structures to build effective software engineering teams that can sustainably deliver value."
