description: "Slides: https://slides.com/smalluban/future-with-web-components\n\nDo we really need classes? What about complex lifecycles? Add to this hard to maintain stateful architecture and here you have almost all available JavaScript UI libraries today. I think there is a much easier way to create building blocks of the Internet, which are web components.\n\nIn this talk, I would like to present a functional way of creating web component with possibly the easiest API. It is the result of my research, architecture design and library implementation for the last two years.\n\nThe presentation will cover unique component structure and functional patterns as well as cache mechanism built-in the library.\n\n---\n\nConFrontJS 2018 - #Frontend #Conference in #Warsaw, Poland\nDate: 29 October 2018\nVenue: Campus Warsaw, Poland\n\n??
