description: "We've enjoyed CSS transitions and animations for several years, with their broad support and ability to get key performance gains. Now the Web Animations API is here and growing, so what does this let us do through JavaScript? Through several examples, we will take a look at how this new JavaScript API came to be and how it compares to the alternate ways to animate on the web. We will dig into new ways to make UIs, games, and storytelling experiences with some of its features like: - Playback rates and controls - Modifying CSS animations - Events - Animation timelines (even ones not based on time... gasp!) - Bending active animations on the fly\n\nEVENT:\n\nThunderPlains 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDaniel Wilson\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miMcnXT1_Rc"
