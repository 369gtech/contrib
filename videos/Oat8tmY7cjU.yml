description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nRecently neural networks have become superior in many machine learning tasks. However, they are more difficult to interpret than simpler models such as decision trees. Such a condition is not acceptable in industries like healthcare or law. In this talk, I will talk on unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model, especially neural networks.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
