description: "Erlang programmers have boasted about high concurrency, fault tolerance, and high scalability. However, using the language alone for this isn't enough to guarantee any of these properties: you have to use it right and play to the platform's strengths.\n\nIn this presentation, we will explore some common application design patterns, tools, libraries, and optimizations used by Erlang developers for production systems.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nDevelopers with basic Erlang knowledge, but who want more information for production cases\nonlookers curious about Erlang code that could be in production\n\nAbout Fred Hébert\n\nFred Hébert is a self-taught programmer who taught Erlang. He spent time working on a real-time bidding platform and was named Erlang User of the Year 2012, and has since joined the routing team at Heroku, building large scale production systems with Erlang. His online tutorial, Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!, is widely regarded as the best way to learn Erlang. \n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
