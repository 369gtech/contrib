The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects - Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nUnleashing the Power of Serverless Using Knative - Savita Ashture, Red Hat\n\nContainerization has brought the urge to decompose monolithic applications into smaller microservices. Kubernetes is the preferred orchestration engine to manage these microservices & deploy stateless & stateful applications. However, to effectively manage the available resources serverless solutions are the need of the hour. There are many serverless solutions available today, but selecting the efficient one is a big challenge. Knative is one of the serverless frameworks that natively supports container orchestrators like Kubernetes and that serves as a battle-tested ecosystem for teams that want to run serverless applications on premises or on any cloud platform. Knative makes it easier for developers to build applications that can scale by abstracting away the complex details of the platform. Talk covers Demonstration of migrating k8s deployment to Knative service with funtionality \n\nhttps://sched.co/YWJZ"
