description: "Prometheus: A Next-Generation Monitoring System (Talk)\n\nJulius Volz and Bj√∂rn Rabenstein, SoundCloud Ltd.\n\nPrometheus is a popular open-source monitoring system and time series database written in Go. It features a multi-dimensional data model, a flexible query language, and integrates aspects all the way from client-side instrumentation to alerting.\n\nIn an introductory talk, we will explain the architecture of Prometheus and the motivation behind it. Taking the instrumentation and monitoring of services at SoundCloud as an example, we will demonstrate how Prometheus helps us stay on top of a growing microservice architecture and detect and investigate outages.\n\nIn a follow-up workshop, participants will set up all critical components of the Prometheus ecosystem to monitor some toy services.\n\nView the full SREcon15 Europe Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon15europe/program"
