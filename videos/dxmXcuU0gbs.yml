description: "Speaker: Fernando Agüero, Technical Product Manager\nYou are probably already tired of the Agile, Scrum and Lean jargon. Maybe you think that all of this theory is a waste of time, or at least that is not having a big impact on your company or team. As a developer that moved to a Technical Product Manager role, I’ve been working hard to declutter all the jargon and try simple ways to improve how teams work and deliver software. We will discuss around questions like what makes a strong product team, how story mapping can help you deliver software faster, why talking is more important than writing user stories or why your team is not delivering as fast as you would like."
