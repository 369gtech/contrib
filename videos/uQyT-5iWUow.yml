description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nOne of the main defining features of C++ is that of well defined object lifetime. We know that when a scope exits any local variables will be properly cleaned up. This is something that we rely upon and use regularly for the management of resources (ie RAII). \n\nHowever, there are some corners of the language that challenge our understanding of object lifetime. I have been teaching classes on understanding object lifetime for over a year now and some of these places continue to surprise my students and have even surprised me. \n\nWe will explore these corners of C++ and ask if they cause enough concern that the language features should not be used, or if they are still worth the price? We will also ponder if these can be considered mistakes in the language or just side effects of a useful feature. We will also explore when and how the compiler and analyzers can warn on these issues.\n— \nJason Turner\nDeveloper, Trainer, Speaker\n\nHost of C++Weekly https://www.youtube.com/c/JasonTurner-lefticus, Co-host of CppCast http://cppcast.com, Co-creator and maintainer of the embedded scripting language for C++, ChaiScript http://chaiscript.com, and author and curator of the forkable coding standards document http://cppbestpractices.com. \n\nI'm available for contracting and onsite training.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
