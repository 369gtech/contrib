description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://bit.ly/2JpfJEY\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\nCreating a navigation app is a lot of work. You will have to maintain different code bases for essentially the same code, learn different languages and create a powerful enough backend to support all of your users. At least it used to be that way. In this session, we are going to see how Xamarin allows us to maintain a single code base, written solely in .Net, while Azure Maps will provide us with all of our backend needs for navigation. By combining these two powerful tools, we are going to (try) build a decent competitor for the well-known Waze app."
