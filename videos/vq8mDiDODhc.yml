description: "A practical guide towards algorithmic bias and explainability in machine learning.\n\nSlides and code - https://github.com/EthicalML/explainability-and-bias/\n\nUndesired bias in machine learning has become a worrying topic due to the numerous high profile incidents. In this talk we demystify machine learning bias through a hands-on example. We'll be tasked to automate the loan approval process for a company, and introduce key tools and techniques from latest research that allow us to assess and mitigate undesired bias in our machine learning models.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
