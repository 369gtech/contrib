description: "When diving into the topic of DevOps, it’s easy for technologists to find themselves skipping to the “toolchain” section. For many, that’s where the fun, shiny new toys are. It’s also understandable to feel mired in the sections about culture and process and philosophy. After all, how do I download and install trust?\n\nBut adopting the DevOps toolchain alone isn’t enough. It is a means to an end. Understanding what your goals are with DevOps is critical for success. And they don’t really change from company to company or industry to industry. Every organization faces challenges with mounting tech debt, and DevOps is a way to manage that technical debt. \n\nWith Kubernetes becoming embedded in vSphere, the world of DevOps and infrastructure-as-code is increasingly at the fingertips of every vSphere pro out there. But firing up Kubernetes isn't enough. In this talk, Dormain Drewitz will make a case for why and how vSphere pros should change how they measure progress. She will make many of the abstract concepts associated with DevOps more concrete and applicable. Finally, she will share some specific examples from vSphere pros who’ve gone on the journey to DevOps already."
