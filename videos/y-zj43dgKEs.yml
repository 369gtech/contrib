title: 'Laurynas Lubys - Graal: Using JVM libraries in Node.js'
language: English
recordingDate: 1578830409
description: 'GraalVM promises seamless interoperability between multiple languages, all running on the JVM. It makes it trivial to call code implemented in JVM languages from Node.js. However, given Node’s event loop model, blocking it is not a viable option. In this talk we’ll look into how we can use blocking JVM libraries in Node.js as well as call back from JVM libraries into Node.js'
