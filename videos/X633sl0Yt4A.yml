For datastores there is also the FAB theory and just like with the CAP theorem you can only pick two â€” will it be fast, accurate, or big and where are the tradeoffs?\n\nWhat are the tradeoffs in the FAB theory?\n\n- Fast: Results are fast enough so that people can have a seamless interaction.\n- Accurate: Answers are accurate and donâ€™t have a margin of error.\n- Big: Dozens or hundreds of systems are involved in calculating the result.\n\nMost SQL databases are in the FA space whereas Hadoop and related systems are generally AB systems. A system optimized for FB is Elasticsearch for example.\nWhile Fast and Big are relatively easy to understand, Accurate is a bit harder to picture. This talk shows some concrete examples of accuracy tradeoffs Elasticsearch can take for terms aggregations, cardinality aggregations with HyperLogLog++, and the IDF part of full-text search.
