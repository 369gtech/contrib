description: "http://www.cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nBoost date_time is a widely used C++ library originally released in 2001 -- including being the basis for elements of the chrono library in c++11. While the library interface has stayed stable for more than a decade, the world around it has changed with the standard library and language changing. It is time for the library tobe rewritten to account for c++11.\n\nThe lecture describes in detail the design decisions and changes to the library for C++11. More generally it describes elements of design for a small valuetype library. Many of these considerations involve new features of C++11 and how they should be used. This includes noexcept, move construction/assignment (R-values), constexpr, enum classes, and user defined literals.\n\nAttendees will learn about the design considerations and tradeoffs of using the new language features in their own work while getting a glimpse of boost date-time version 2.\n--\nJeff Garland has worked on many large-scale, distributed software projects over the past 20+ years. The systems span many different domains including telephone switching, industrial process control, satellite ground control, ip-based communications, and financial systems. He has written C++ networked code for several large systems including the development high performance network servers and data distribution frameworks.Mr. Garland’s interest in Boost started in 2000 as a user. Since then he has developed Boost.date_time, become a moderator, served as a review manager for several libraries (including asio and serialization), administered the Boost wiki, and served as a mentor for Google Summer of Code. Mr. Garland holds a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University and a Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering from the University of Arizona. He is co-author of Large Scale Software Architecture: A Practical Guide Using UML. He is currently Principal Consultant for his own company: CrystalClear Software, Inc.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
