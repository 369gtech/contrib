recordingDate: 1515819836
description: "VS Code is a cross platform editor from Microsoft that combines the speed and simplicity of a code editor with the great code editing and debugging experiences normally only found in heavy IDEs. VS Code downloads and installs in under a minute complete with deep JavaScript, Node, CSS/LESS/SASS support and more, everything you need for full stack web development. Along with lightweight git support, VS Code integrates seamlessly into your toolchain and with more than 1000 extensions and themes, you can customize VS Code to work the way you do. In this talk you’ll find out why we think VS Code is last editor you’ll ever need as we build an application from scratch to the cloud in under 30min.\n\nEVENT:\n\nUtahJS 2016\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nWade Anderson\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nWade and UtahJS provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
