title: 'Kawandeep Virdee: Open Web Art: JS for Interactive, Collaborative, and Hackable Art [JSConf2014]'
recordingDate: 1403793975
description: "Interactive art can be a powerful means to inspire conversations, creativity, and wonder among groups of people. It is now easier to build interactive and collaborative apps with JavaScript, and these features can be used for expressive works. I'll describe using JS to make web art, as well as installation and projection art. Because of web standards as well as browser performance improvements, you can make JS art that is accessible on a variety of platforms. The openness of the JavaScript community inspires the openness of creative coding in JavaScript, producing works that invite exploration, learning, and hacking.\n\nhttp://2014.jsconf.us/"
