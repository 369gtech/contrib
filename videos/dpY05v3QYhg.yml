description: "by Stephane Carrez\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.125/ada_secureweb.webm\n\n\nWeb application security is often underestimated, and using a secure framework can help reduce application vulnerabilities. Ada Web Application (AWA) is a web framework that leverages Ada's safety features to provide a secure environment on top of which safe applications are built. AWA is based on several Java-like technologies such as Java Beans, Java Servlet, Java Server Faces, other standards such as OAuth2, REST and OpenAPI, all implemented in Ada. This presentation briefly describes the AWA architecture and how applications are built with it. The presentation highlights some of the Ada functionalities that contribute to the safety and make applications secure and reliable. \n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:00:00+01"
