The site was renewed on January 4, 2018\n\nPortal Site of Official Statistics of Japan\_\nhttps://www.e-stat.go.jp/en\nhttps://www.e-stat.go.jp/\n\n\ne-Stat is a resource with huge amounts of data.\n\_It is one of the world's leading statistical portals boasting terabytes of data.\_\n\nThere was challenge as to how to make the huge preexisting back-end system built with Javaï¼‹Oracle compatible with the front end system which can be updated by the administrator. Drupal was used to solve this issue.\_\nDrupal uses the new Decoupled as a front end controller. We used its architecture, developing a user friendly interface and augmentability, effectively applying Drupal's merits to the fullest to create a seamless integration.\_\n\nThese case studies demonstrate that Drupal will have huge impacts with its role in integrating large systems and web systems. We hope to convey this to the Drupal Community around the world."
