title: 'YOW! West 2015 Sam Ritchie - A Swift Introduction to Swift'
recordingDate: 1514472990
description: "Last year Apple announced a brand new programming language as a modern replacement for the venerable Objective-C. Swift makes a very interesting study in language design – influenced by modern statically-typed languages with an emphasis on safety and speed, but (almost) seamlessly compatible with the unsafe, dynamic, weakly-typed OO language it needs to co-exist with.\n\nSam will run through a brief introduction to the language, highlighting some of the design choices and tradeoffs made, and show how to use the language features to write better code.\n\nSam has a background in .NET enterprise development, but now works mainly on mobile apps & cloud services. He’s been an Apple fanboy since the 80s, and was coding Objective-C before it was cool. He mainly develops in Swift & F# these days, and actively tries to avoid writing any JavaScript.\n\nSam runs the Perth-based software consulting company codesplice, and organises the Perth iOS developers meetup group.\n\nFor more on YOW!
