recordingDate: 1577302217
description: 'We have entered the Era of Serverless. Do you want to spend time on growing the complex infrastructure and its administration or you focus on validating your hypothesis and delivering what’s needed right here and right now? This is a question you should ask yourself in 2019. Effectiveness is the answer. In this talk, we will see how easily you can build a low-latency processing layer for the Lambda Functions using the Hazelcast Cloud – a fully managed Hazelcast IMDG service.'
