description: "Check out the latest from The Lead Developer at theleaddeveloper.com.\n\nReasonML is a new syntax for OCaml, developed by Facebook with a heavy influence from JavaScript. This talk provides a brief overview of Reason, explaining its origins and why it’s so useful. We’ll take a look at some simple code snippets and demonstrate how Reason can be compiled to JavaScript to integrate with existing codebases, including React. Finally, we’ll look at some interesting open source projects and libraries in the community."
