description: "Ah, the promises of Microservices. Small manageable services. Independent lifecycles. More features, faster, and with fewer regressions. Unlimited scale. Asynchronous messages. Event sourcing. Full visibility and audit logs. Eventual consistency bliss. Containers everywhere. It sounds fantastic right? And, it can be, for some. Will you be one of them?\n\nThis session will contemplate how to survive this seductive approach toward solution architecture - with the many pitfalls in mind - and with the reasons why it's worth the effort."
