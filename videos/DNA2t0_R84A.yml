title: 'Taking Models to the Next Level with Azure Machine Learning - Henk Boelman - NDC Sydney 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630507219
description: "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can be used in many ways to increase productivity of business processes and gather meaningful insights, by analyzing images, texts and trends within unstructured flows of data. While many tasks can be solved using existing models, in some cases it is also required to train your own model for more specific tasks, or for increased accuracy.\n\nIn this session, we will explore the complete path of integrating text analysis intelligent services into the business processes of Tailwind Traders, starting from pre-build models available as cognitive services, up to training a third-party neural custom model for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis available as part of Intel NLP Architect using Azure Machine Learning Service. We will talk about cases when one needs a custom model, and demonstrate quick ways to create such a model from scratch using AutoML, and show how to fine-tune model hyperparameters using HyperDrive"
