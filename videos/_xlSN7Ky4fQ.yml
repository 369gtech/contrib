description: "An Ignite OSCON talk doesn't have to be about the programming or technology. The best Ignite talks happen when you bring a geek's perspective to a non-technical subject. With that in mind, I present to you the magical, mysterious science of EGGS!\n\nThe average American (yes, you) eats about 250 eggs a year. But have you stopped to think about what happens when that egg is cooked?\n\nThe simplest way to cook an egg is to poach it: crack the shell and drop the egg into a pot of boiling water. And yet, an amazingly complex physical reaction has now been kicked off. The tightly wound proteins are coming unraveled, and solidifying into long chains. If the temperature of the egg is too low (143 degress Farenheit), the proteins don't have time to fully bond, and the egg is runny and slimy. And yet cook the egg too high (165 degrees Farenheit), and it becomes too firm and rubbery.\n\nWhat's really going on here? How do you get the time and temperature just perfect? What can we tweak to make this process easier? Simpler?\n\nHow do you hack an egg?\n\nJustin Martenstein\n\nRevolution Analytics\n\nJustin Martenstein is the Linux Build Engineer for Revolution Analytics, the leading commercial supporter of the R language.
