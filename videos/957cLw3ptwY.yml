There are a lot of companies that can scan you movie and put it on a hard disk or dvd. But how hard can it be to do it yourself? After this talk you will know what it takes to digitize your own films code wise and how to build a rig to facilitate this.\n\n* Some topics that will be touched upon:\n\n* Using a scanner with a PI\n\n* Image processing (on a PI)\n\n* Lessons learned\n\n# Jago de Vreede\nJago is a software engineer at Quintor, as a software engineer he has seen a broad-spectrum of projects and he has been working on multiple large scale educational software and banking projects for the last years.
