description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/Kt95u\n\nI wanted to make the 50th part of my Java Video Tutorial special! In this tutorial, I answer numerous questions.\n\nI begin showing you how to design a game like Asteroids. I start teaching OOP design principles using UML. You learn how to draw polygons on the screen and how to animate them. And, to top it all off I show you how collision detection works.\n\nYes, there is a lot in this 14 minute video :)"
