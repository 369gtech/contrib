description: "Before we start using technologies like CRISPR on a large scale both for germline and somatic genetic engineering, we need to consider questions such as who is able to access these technologies, who gets to make those decisions, and how they will be implemented. It is vital to discuss how we go forward into a world where humans regularly use these formidable technologies, whether we need to differentiate between therapeutic use and enhancement, and — most importantly — how to make them accessible to anyone who wants to use them.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
