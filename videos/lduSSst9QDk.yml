title: 'Alex Theedom. Java EE revisits design patterns'
recordingDate: 1472730595
description: 'Design patterns are not only cool but represent the collective wisdom of many developers. Since the publication of Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by GoF many new concepts have extended the coverage of these design patterns, and now Java EE provides out-of-the box implementations of many of the most well known patterns. This talk will show how, by taking advantage of Java EE features such as CDI and the smart use of annotations, traditional design patterns can be implemented in a much cleaner and quicker way. Among the design patterns discuss there will be Singleton, Fa√ßade, Observer, Factory, Dependency Injection, Decorator and more.'
