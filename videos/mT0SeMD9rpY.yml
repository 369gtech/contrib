description: "by Alexander Todorov\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.120/python_write_pylint_plugins.webm\n\n\nPylint is the most popular Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors, helps enforce a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells. It is possible to write plugins to add your own checks, for example enforce all documentation strings to be enclosed with 3 double quotes! \n\nThis presentation will focus on how the pylint plugin system works, how to examine AST tree of a piece of code and create a minimalistic plugin from scratch. It will also examine couple of plugins that are used in the Kiwi TCMS project. \n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:00:00+01"
