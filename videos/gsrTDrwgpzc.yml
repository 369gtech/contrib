description: "by Alex Hajjar\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/opengreffe.webm\n\n\nA company register is a centrepiece of the legal existence of firms in a given country. Usually, these registers are state-controlled. \n\nCan we conceive a register that is decentralised? \n\nWe will present OpenGreffe, an Ethereum-based register based on simple legal foundations of the French Code Civil. What is OpenGreffe?\n\nIt's a public blockchain-based registry of firms, in the sense of \"société de fait\" of the Art. 1832 of the French Code Civil. \n\nThis registry open but is maintained by selected agents, based on reputation. To kickstart reputation: we can base it on existing real-world business reputation. \n\nEach entry in the registry is consisting of: \n\n\na company identification (name, associates, capital)\nan Ethereum address owned by the associates\na stamp of approval by a registry maintainer\na date.\n\n\n\nThe goal: make it possible for anyone to register a company and build reputation for it in the Ethereum world, so as to raise funding, loans, use insurance, etc. \n\nLifecycle of a registration\n\n\nSome founders agree on starting the business.\nThey share an Ethereum address on a multi-sig wallet.\nThey go see some 2+ existing registry maintainers (like Legalstart plus another lawyer company), and ask them to perform KYC/KYB to verify that capital is well shared and that they indeed aim to work together on some projects.\nThe registry maintainers commit the change to the OpenGreffe database.\nThe founders can start building their Ethereum-based business, using the Ethereum address that has been written in the registry.\nAfter some months/years, for example some external auditors (like Euler-Hermes, an insurance company) can start scoring the new company for their credit defaults and account payables. Good news: they give an AAA rating, because the founders did well!\nAfter some more time, when the founders want to raise a loan, they can claim being proper on their credit payments thanks to external auditors!\n\n\n\nAll of this, without the use of any state institution! \n\nNotes: \n\n\nstep 6 is possible thanks to OpenGreffe only. Indeed, without the registry, good account payables behavior on a given Ethereum address couldn't be linked to a company identification.\n\n\n\nQuestion TBD: why do we need anything other than an Ethereum address? Why identify associates and a company name...? \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 12:10:00+01"
