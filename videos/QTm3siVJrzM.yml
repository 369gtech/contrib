description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nChaos Engineering is a methodology that experiments on a distributed system in order to build confidence that the system will work well in production. Essentially, we experiment by trying to break our system to uncover system weakness. In this talk, Paul will cover the basics of Chaos Engineer, give some case studies of companies that currently do this in production and give an introduction to some of the open source toolings that currently exists so that you can maybe try this at your company. Paul will also show that, by following good infrastructure management practices, that you can recover and scale the system when necessary, easily!"
