title: 'Denis Vorotyntsev - Explaining ML models in 2020 | PyData Helsinki'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605554947
description: "Interpreting a machine learning model is a crucial, yet often ignored part of a development cycle. Nowadays we have a bunch of tools that may serve this purpose, but when to use which? In this talk, I will present several questions that should be asked during the ad-hoc model interpretation. I will show how to answer them using ad-hoc interpretations tools: SHAP, LIME, PDP plots, additive models, and anchors.\n\nDenis Vorotyntsev is a Senior Data Scientist at Oura. He builds models for improving well being and health tracking. In his free time, he writes about ML and DS in his blog.  \n\n-------\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
