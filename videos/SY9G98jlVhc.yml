description: 'Machine Learning helps to automate analysis and surface insights that are important for the day-to-day operation of certain business functions. In this talk, Elvis Saravia, Education Architect at Elastic,  focuses on introducing a series of machine learning jobs, via the Machine Learning UI, that are easy to compose and can help classify new information (in the form of document classification) and help reveal an abnormal behaviour in the data (in the form of anomaly detection).'
