language: English
recordingDate: 1631397890
description: 'Certificates and public key infrastructure (PKI) are hard. No shit, right? I know a lot of smart people whoâ€™ve avoided this particular rabbit hole. Personally, I avoided it for a long time and felt some shame for not knowing more. The obvious result was a vicious cycle: I was too embarrassed to ask questions so I never learned. Well, now everything needs a certificate so let''s be embarrassed together and learn why.'
