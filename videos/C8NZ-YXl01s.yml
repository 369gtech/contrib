description: "In ScalaTest 3.0's new async testing styles, tests have a result type of Future[Assertion]. Instead of blocking until a future completes, then performing assertions on the result, you map assertions onto the future and return the resulting Future[Assertion] to ScalaTest. The test will complete asynchronously when the Future[Assertion] completes. This way of testing requires a different mindset. \n\nIn this talk I'll walk you through the design, show you how to use it, and suggest best practices for async testing on both the JVM and Scala.js.\n\nTalk by Bill Venners\nMarch 4th, 2016\n\nhttp://www.nescala.org/\n\nProduced by NewCircle - Training & Resources for Developers:\nhttps://newcircle.com/"
