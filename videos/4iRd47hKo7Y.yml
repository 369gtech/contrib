title: 'A short trip into Reactive Forms Validation | Armela Gjoka | Lightning Talks 2021Â #ngconf'

description: "Most applications require some user input and since we can not guarantee that the user enters valid input, we have to set in place some rules before sending  data to the backend. \n\nShe has been working for some time with forms, both template-driven and reactive, and one of the challenges is to decide whether validation should be handled in the frontend or the backend. She believes that a mix of both is the right combination.\n\nFrontend should handle these types of validations: \nRequired or optional.\nFormat: minLength, maxLength, pattern match.\nOther validations that are easily understandable to any UI user, such as: password and confirm password should have the same value.\nOn the other hand, any  validation that is specific to the business logic should be handled in the backend. \nShe discussed  Reactive Forms since they are more scalable and a large form will probably have many rules. There are three main categories of validators that we can apply to a form control. \nBuilt-in Validators\nCustom Validators\nAsync Validators\nShe applied these validators in a form control and showed how they are implemented and their behaviour.\n\nLearn the best ways to build reliable web applications, write quality code, choose scalable architectures, and create effective automated tests at the Reliable Web Summit this August 26-27, 2021.
