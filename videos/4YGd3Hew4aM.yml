Come listen to Jonathan Alferness talk about how AdMob brings the power, scale and innovation to app developers who want to monetize effectively through tools like ad mediation for higher fill rates, new formats like native ads, and Audience builder with Google Analytics for list building and targeting. In this talk, we will also be unveiling some new features that will help make things simpler for developers.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
