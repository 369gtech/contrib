description: "Welcome to our Tech Community of Practice series. This a weekly internal series devoted to discussing different areas of technology that we wanted to share with the wider Software Craftsmanship community. \n\nIn this episode, we hear from Simon Maple, VP, Developer Relations and Community at Snyk, who shows us live hacking to find security vulnerabilities using real-world package. In the demo, Simon shows you how to exploit those vulnerabilities and how you can be defensive in the libraries you chose. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
