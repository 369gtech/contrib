description: "DevOps: Who Does What?\n\nCornelia Davis, Sr. Director of Technology, Pivotal\n\nWithin the IT organizational structures that have dominated the last several decades roles and responsibilities are fairly standardized. But with the dramatic changes that DevOps practices and supporting toolsets bring, many are left feeling a bit off balance - it’s no longer clear who is responsible for even things as “straight-forward” as development or operations.\n\nIn this talk I will take traditional roles that are distributed across fairly standard IT structures and sort them into a new organizational context. What is the role of the Enterprise Architect? Who does capacity planning and how? How can change management step out of the way all while still satisfying the requirements of safe deployments? How do agile teams interface with personnel responsible for maintaining legacy systems? I’ll leave the audience with a blueprint for a new organizational structure.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
