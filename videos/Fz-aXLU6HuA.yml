title: 'React Native EU 2021: Paweł Trysła - Code Splitting in React Native'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634117087
description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nWhile developing mobile applications we usually have a mental model of a single runnable piece of software that includes all features and there’s a good reason for that - it’s difficult to split functionality in native mobile applications. However, with React Native most of our logic lives as a JavaScript, which can be splitted. The web development community has been doing that for years. So what if we could split our React Native code using the power of Webpack?\n\nPaweł Trysła aka. Zamotany is a software engineer at Callstack and the lead engineer at Re.Pack. Paweł calls himself “the tooling guy” with extensive knowledge of Webpack and Babel. He is also a huge fan of Electron, functional programming and RxJS.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_zamotany \n\nGithub: https://github.com/zamotany"
