Paul will also take a look at the future, and explore how ecosystems can be built with like minded suppliers.\n\nPaul Wilkinson currently looks after Technology Research and Open Innovation at Tesco Labs with the aim of making customers’ and colleagues’ lives easier by finding the best new technology to help them. Working with partners ranging from the biggest corporates to the smallest start-ups from around the world to test and develop the latest technology.
