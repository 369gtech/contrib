description: "Explore how to build reliable remote communication devices that must stay online, connected, and transmitting field data without interruptions. Using Java ME, a solid foundation was built that can be used to deploy many kinds of applications in the field, with fast, reliable development. In this session, see what the difficulties, ideas, and insights were that led to this foundation, which is currently in use in more than 50,000 devices in Brazil and Latin America to connect more than 800,000 field devices.\n\n\nAuthor:\nLeonardo Lima\nSoftware Development Manager at V2COM, leading the development of both embedded software for edge/field devices and server-side software that receives field data and enables fast communication with remote devices. \n\nBroad development and architectural experience on mobile, embedded and server platforms to enable management and operation of highly scalable and fast telemetry and network control systems.\n\nV2COM's representative in the Java Community Process' Executive Committee.\nView more trainings by Leonardo Lima at https://www.parleys.com/author/leonardo-lima\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
