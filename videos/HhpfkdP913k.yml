title: 'The 5 Pillars of Collaborative Product Ownership - John Le Drew - NDC Oslo 2020'
recordingDate: 1596622841
description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\nWhile business knowledge and domain expertise is useful and essential, is this only achievable with a 'single wringable neck'? Can a team be aligned without having a ‘one throat to choke’? What would happen if the whole team could be encouraged to take ownership of product direction? Chaos? The Apocalypse? Or maybe (just possibly) success?\n\nIn this session we face up to some uncomfortable realities about many present approaches and attitudes to product ownership. Then, journey into the past to discover the top secret superpower that all teams working towards agility have, but often forget.\n\nDuring the session we will question assumptions and slay some sacred cows*. Prepare to have your attitude to product ownership transformed, this job might never be the same again.\n\n*No actual cows were/will be harmed in the production/presentation of this session."
