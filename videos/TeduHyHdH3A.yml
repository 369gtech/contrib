title: 'C++ 20: Reaching for the Aims of C++'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639692832
description: "Out of necessity C++ has been an evolving language. I outline some early ideals for C++, some techniques for keeping the evolution directed, and show how C++20 comes close to many of those ideals. Specific topics includes type-and-resource safe code, generic programming, modularity, and the elimination of the preprocessor. Naturally, over the years, C++ has acquired many “barnacles” that can become obstacles to developing elegant and efficient code. That has been a recognized problem since the early days of C – Dennis Ritchie and I talked about it – so we must distinguish between what can be done and what should be done. The C++ Core Guidelines is the current best effort in that direction.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nThe CppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish CppCon tech talks.\n\nCREDITS:\nCppCon YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg"
