title: 'Developing the Bloomberg Terminal -- Local performance & measurement techniques - Paul Williams'
recordingDate: 1568812789
description: "At its essence, the Bloomberg Terminal is a near-real-time multi-window browser that must run efficiently and reliably on the desks of the most influential people in the global capital markets or trading floors operated by the worldâ€™s leading investment banks and hedge funds.\n\nIt combines a highly-scalable, proprietary data processing technology written in C++ with an embedded Chromium browser core and its V8 JavaScript engine. The result is a challenging, distributed run-time environment that must perform well and be measurable. The talk will cover some of the techniques used to develop and instrument this system.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
