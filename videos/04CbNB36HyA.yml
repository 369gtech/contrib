recordingDate: 1484901193
description: "In this session you will learn about the exciting new generation of Power BI delivering access to data and insights with Software as a Service (SaaS), and specifically what can be achieved by the software developer. You will learn that the new generation of Power BI enables developers to configure real-time dashboard scenarios, create custom visualizations and also integrate rich analytics in application experiences by embedding Power BI dashboards, tiles and reports.\n\nSeveral demonstrations will illustrate how to configure real-time dashboards that programmatically push data to the Power BI service by using the Power BI REST API, and also how to integrate Power BI experiences with applications.\n\nThis session will be of interest to architects and software developers looking to understand and evaluate the developer capabilities of Power BI."
