title: 'Keynote | Flink Ahead: What Comes After Unified Batch & Streaming? - Stephan Ewen'
recordingDate: 1604430356
description: "In the last year, Flink evolved from a powerful stream processing system to a unified batch/streaming system. On top of being a powerful stream processor, Flink now handles heavy batch processing workloads as well. Flink's SQL engine runs large-scale batch data warehousing workloads and crunches petabytes per day with incremental streaming queries.\n\nBeing on the finishing line with the batch/streaming unification efforts, the question is, what comes after that? In this talk, we are looking at two major efforts in the Flink community we believe are an important part of shaping the direction and capabilities: The first effort centres around Flink's unique approach of an integrated batch/streaming runtime, and how it allows us to do more than executing the same program in a batch or streaming way: It opens up possibilities to combine the strengths of both execution styles to improve both performance and operations for applications that deal with both historic and real-time data.\n\nThe second effort looks at Flink in the cloud-native stack and at scaling Flink applications. We discuss the various efforts in the community towards making a system that feels like a natural citizen on modern platforms and offers simpler elasticity."
