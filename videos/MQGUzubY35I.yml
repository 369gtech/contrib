recordingDate: 1506608787
description: "Have you seen and heard of Render API (with its\_render caching,\_lazy\_builders and render pipeline), Cache API (and its cache tags & contexts), Dynamic Page Cache, Page Cache and\_BigPipe? Have you cursed them, wondered about them, been confused by them?\n\nI will show you three typical use cases:\n\nAn uncacheable block\nA personalized block\nA cacheable block that you can see if you have a certain permission and that should update whenever some entity is updated\n… and for each, will take you on the journey through the various layers: from rendering to render caching, on to Dynamic Page Cache and eventually Page Cache … or BigPipe.\n\nComing out of this session, you should have a concrete understanding of how these various layers cooperate, how you as a Drupal developer can use them to your advantage, and how you can test that it's behaving correctly.\n\nI'm a maintainer of Dynamic Page Cache and BigPipe, and an effective co-maintainer of Render API, Cache API and Page Cache."
