description: "Learning More from Complex Systems\n\nAndrew Hatch, LinkedIn\n\nComplex systems are everywhere. From simple organisms like slime molds, the neural processing power of human brains, navigating rush-hour traffic, or the vast resources of people and technology, interacting with each other in modern organizations. They can be both organic and man-made, they evolve and adapt to their environments and possess a number of common traits, notably emergent behaviors, innate levels of resiliency, a history responsible for their current state, and most importantly are becoming more complex.\n\nBut how we do learn about complex systems? Is the pursuit of knowledge through linear analysis enough? Can we cope with complexity by root-cause analyzing our way out of failure? Or is there other approaches to learning we need to do?\n\nThis talk will distill a bit of history, science, and philosophy into takeaways that will encourage the audience to think differently about how we can learn from incidents in complex systems.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
