title: '"Simple Made Easy" - Rich Hickey (2011)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630615720
description: "Rich Hickey, the author of Clojure and designer of Datomic, is a software developer with over 30 years of experience in various domains. Rich has worked on scheduling systems, broadcast automation, audio analysis and fingerprinting, database design, yield management, exit poll systems, and machine listening, in a variety of languages.\n\nThis keynote was given at Strange Loop 2011, and is perhaps the best known and most highly regarded of Rich's many excellent talks, ushering in a new way to think about the problems of software design and the constant fight against complexity. \n\nThe video was recorded at Strange Loop in partnership with InfoQ, who have hosted it on their site since 2011. This version (released 10 years later) is a new edit made from the original HD video and slides, restoring the slide transitions and animations as it was given in 2011."
