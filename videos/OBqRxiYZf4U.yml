language: English
recordingDate: 1631616819
description: "All data science projects are composed of the algorithm (model) and the data. While data scientists are natively focused on math and models, experience is showing them that for a data science project to succeed in real life, much more than a deep understanding of math is needed.\nGilad and Noa will take us through the journey their team went on in transforming from working with a model-centric to a data-centric approach.\n\nIn this episode of the Wix Engineering Podcast: how a data science team upgraded their AI by refocusing, changing their priorities, and creating a new workflow focusing on data."
