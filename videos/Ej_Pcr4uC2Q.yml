description: "Learn the Dart programming language in this full tutorial for beginners. Dart is a strictly typed programming language that is used in the Flutter framework to develop cross platform mobile apps.\n\nSince Dart supports both AOT (Ahead of time) and JIT (Just In Time) compilation, it delivers extremely fast development cycles and fast execution and startup times. It is a compiled programming language and can also transpile the code into JavaScript.\n\n💻 Course from Mahmud Ahsan. \n🔗 Mahmud's Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHlgyUw0wLE5Ous9swfFlg\n🔗 Mahmud's Github: https://github.com/mahmudahsan/\n🔗 Mahmud's Blog: https://thinkdiff.net/\n\n🔗 Dart language: https://dart.dev/\n🔗 Flutter Framework: https://flutter.dev/\n\n⭐️ Course Contents ⭐️\n⌨️ (0:00:32) Setup\n⌨️ (0:03:50) Fundamentals\n⌨️ (0:11:04) Data Types\n⌨️ (0:15:44) String, Type Conversion, Constant, null\n⌨️ (0:23:50) Operators\n⌨️ (0:39:13) Loop\n⌨️ (0:48:03) Collections [ List, Set, Map ]\n⌨️ (1:01:07) Function\n⌨️ (1:13:49) Class\n⌨️ (1:37:41) Exception Handling\n⌨️ (1:41:26) Conclusion\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
