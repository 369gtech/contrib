title: 'Creating Games, Animations and Interactions with the Wick Editor: A UX Talk | Luca Damasco'
recordingDate: 1572485843
description: 'Always test your project with users, even if theyâ€™re 4 years old. We built the Wick Editor, a free, open-source, Mozilla supported tool for creating games, animations and interactive projects, using React.js. Over three years, we transformed our student project into a tool used by over 10,000 beginner animators and game designers a month. Getting to this point took dozens of workshops, after school sessions, game jams, and professional development sessions. Learn how we refined our design and development approach, and stayed motivated, by working with students and teachers of all ages.'
