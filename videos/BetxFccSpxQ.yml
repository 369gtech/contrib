description: "Speakers: Amit Bose, June Liu, Xiang Li, Harry Zhang, Corin Dwyer\nCompanies like Alibaba, Uber, and Pinterest are managing a huge fleet of machines with demanding and complicated workload. To evolve our infrastructure and adopt Kubernetes, we faced many challenges around scalability, reliability, flexibility and operationality. And today, after overcame those difficulties, we are running some of the largest Kubernetes clusters in the world.\n\nIn this panel, we would like to share our real world experience on improving and managing Kubernetes with harsh requirements. We believe the stories are interesting themselves, and many of the lessons we learned also apply to small-mid size cluster operators and users."
