How can lambdas be used to improve your enterprise application? Should you use Concurrency Utilities or parallel streams? Is it possible to use java.time with JPA, JSF, JAX-RS, and other Java EE technologies right now? What are the practical applications of parameter retention and multiple annotations with the current CDI specification? What are the best practices for using extension and static methods in business applications’ interfaces? These and other questions are answered in this session.\n\nSpeaker:\nMichael Santos, Head of Development & Operations, TecSinapse\nMichael Nascimento Santos is a seasoned developer with more than 16 years of experience with the Java platform, from Java ME to Java EE, and over 22 years of practical programming experience.
