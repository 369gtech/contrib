description: "\"What Does It Mean to Be a Media Company Today?\"\r\n\r\nAlexa von Tobel is the founder and CEO of LearnVest.com, one of the leading independent personal finance websites for women. Alexa came up with the idea for LearnVest in 2006, during her senior year at Harvard when she realized she, and most of her peers, had never had any formal education about how to effectively manage their finances. Alexa searched for reliable financial guidance and consistently came up overwhelmed or disappointed. Thus, the LearnVest mission was born -- to make trusted personal financial information accessible to millions of women. Originally from Florida, Alexa received an A.B. in Psychology at Harvard College. Upon graduation, she worked as a trader at Morgan Stanley on their Proprietary Trading Desk before leaving to be the Head of Business Development at Drop.io, a venture backed start-up in NYC."
