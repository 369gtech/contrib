title: 'Python in Serverless Architectures'

description: "You're familiar with backend web development in the Python ecosystem, Flask, Django, Pyramid, all of it. Things are going smoothly in the world of backend. Great! \n\nOne day you're cruising through HackerNews and all of a sudden see the words \"Serverless Architectures\" pop up. Oh dear. \"Servers? That's where backend code lives!\", you protest, \"what is the racket all about?\" \n\nLucky for us, we know Python. A first-class citizen in the world of serverless architectures. \n\nServerless architectures are on the rise, so lets take a look at all the moving pieces that go into making one. We begin our journey in the familiar land of Flask with a small, but useful, backend application. We will demystify serverless architectures using a very-confusingly-named utility called...ahem...Serverless. Piece by piece we will come to understand ways of doing user authentication, database interaction, deployment, and testing for our new fangled serverless application. We'll explore the pros and the cons of our choices as we make them.\n\nBy the end of our time together serverless architectures will transform from meaningless buzzword to a valid architecture decision you have all the tools to evaluate.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyOhio 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDaniel Lindeman\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mijpESCucRQ&t=28s"
