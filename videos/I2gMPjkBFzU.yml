description: "The most important part of well-designed Java code is a nice API. A good API helps developers be more productive and write high-quality code quickly. API design matters for any developer, especially in building larger systems with a team. Modern coding tools such as Eclipse and FindBugs contain advanced tooling to help with designing an API and checking for bad usage. This session demonstrates the latest innovations, including new capabilities in Java 8, by presenting realistic examples based on real experiences in large codebases. They show that just a few Java tricks and simple annotations can make all the difference for building a great API.\n\n\nAuthor:\nPeter Hendriks\nundefined\nView more trainings by Peter Hendriks at https://www.parleys.com/author/peter-hendriks\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
