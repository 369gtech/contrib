How do you deploy the new images without breaking things? In this talk, youâ€™ll learn how to push and audit cascading security updates to hundreds of docker images. All of the tooling we will use is open source so you can easily take advantage of it.You will also learn how to integrate the cascading updates into your CI/CD system which enables performing a verified cascade in the correct order.\n\n \nAndrey Falko \nFrom Lyft\nAndrey Falko was a Principal Software Engineer at Salesforce for 9 years, where he built and scaled CI systems for three different groups.
