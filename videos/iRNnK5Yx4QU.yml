description: "We're looking for someone more senior. This candidate was a bit too junior. How can we find more senior candidates? At some point in our career, we've all heard or said statements like these. But what really makes a senior engineer anyway? What traits and skills do they possess and what's the best way to determine when a candidate fits that mold? What steps can one take to get from junior to senior engineer?\n\nAs someone who's seen this issue from both sides, I'll share my thoughts on how we can improve. What simple changes can we make to avoid passing on great hires? What should we be focusing on to find the best candidates? How can we highlight our true strengths as candidates to stand out and show we're the best fit? This talk will provide takeaways to advance your career and build better teams.\n\nDalton Mitchell"
