title: 'Down to the Metal: How does the text we type turn into the computer actually doing things'
recordingDate: 1634285981
description: "As programmers, we express ourselves in code. Our code's structure and\nmeaning allows us to describe what we want our programs to do, but the\nprocess by which our code becomes actual behaviour can be rather opaque.\nThis is perhaps even more true today than in the past - we often find\nourselves writing code in one language which gets translated into\nanother, only for it to be transformed into yet another language, which\nin turn becomes behaviour on some other computer in some other runtime\nenvironment.\n\nStarting with a small toy language, we'll follow the journey that take\nus from a text file to actual computer behaviour. We'll look at the\nvarious steps that take us from a bunch of bytes to executing code in an\ninterpreter. We'll follow that up with examining how we might enhance\nthe toolchain with optimisations, obfuscation, and linting, (hopefully!)\nfinishing up by moving from interpretation to compilation.\n\n## About Jez\n\nJez Higgins is a freelance software grandad. He mucks in with\nprogramming, lends a hand with build & deployment processes, provides a\nleg up with TDD practices, and keeps an eye on the young 'uns so they\ndon't get trapped down the old mine shaft.\n\n## Agenda\n\n19:15: ~~Doors~~ Zoom Call Open\n19:30: nor(DEV): Introduction - Begin streaming to YouTube.\n19:35: Speaker Slot\n20:20: Q&A\n20:30 Close...
