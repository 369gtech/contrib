description: "To gain validated learning and reduce risk and uncertainty while developing new products, you have to bring each increment into production. Only information gathered from the behavior of real users with each increment ensures that you値l build the right thing in the end. In this session, you値l learn how you can stop building monolithic systems and start designing software based on microservices容ach having its own lifecycle and being an independent deployment unit. You値l get a pretty good idea of how to manage such distributed applications in production successfully as well. The presentation uses an online shop application based on microservices for a discussion of topics such as deployment and operational aspects such as monitoring and logging.\n\nSpeaker:\nBernd Zuther, IT Consultant Big Data, codecentric AG\nBernd Zuther has a degree in computer science and has been working as programmer and consultant since 2008. He is working at codecentric AG. Bernd has well-grounded knowledge in areas like Big Data, Continuous Delivery and agile software architectures. Furthermore he has solid experience in implementing highly available online shops."
