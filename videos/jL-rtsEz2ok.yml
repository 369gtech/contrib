description: "We all know Watson’s Machine Learning capabilities are quite powerful. It can be used to analyze and gain cognitive insights into all of your data including unstructured text, images and speech.\n\nWe will demonstrate a state-of –the-art Enterprise Java application running in production, using Watson’s Deep Learning services. Specifically, we will investigate how enterprise developers can leverage Alchemy’s Natural Language Processing to extract entities, concepts, relations and extend that to include custom type entities based on domain specific dictionaries, using Watson’s Knowledge Studio, for unstructured text analysis.\n\nIn this session, you will design Conversation workspaces using easy to use tooling, enriching your Enterprise Java application to handle intricate human conversations! And add Document Conversion service to ingest documents in various formats. All these capabilities will enable you to create powerful business applications.\n\nAnd along the way, we’ll give you some best practices on testing cognitive applications.\n\nSandhya Kapoor \nIBM has been my home since 1990. Over the years I have been a part of some incredible technology application projects that led to my start with Watson in 2010. Since Watson’s commercial success, I have been around the world talking to an entire global developer community and some of the largest companies on the planet about developing cutting edge technology and how to duplicate our efforts for specific uses in their industries.\n\nI’ve dedicated the last seven years to building the artificial intelligence and deep learning circuitry, and have recently been involved with the development of a similar platform to serve the healthcare industry.\n\nMehjabin Kapasi started with IBM 14 years ago as a software engineer and has been fortunate to try on many different hats within engineering to business development to her recent experience working with IBM Design group evangelizing IBM Design Thinking and recruiting talent at external events. She is currently a product manager building an innovative cognitive application using Watson APIs to help improve a candidate's job search experience."
