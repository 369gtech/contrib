description: "Bring your existing mobile game to the big screen, with Android TV! Android TV is Android on a new form factor. With a few modifications, your game can support both TV and mobile in the same APK. In this video, Josh Gordon shows the key steps to make your game compatible with both form factors. These include updating your application manifest, handing hardware differences between TV and mobile, working with remotes and gamepads, and Overscan. Android TV also opens up new gaming opportunities, like local multiplayer gaming. This is made possible by the Nearby Connections API, which enables players to use their mobile devices as second screens and game controllers. Watch for a primer on all these topics, with links to developer training for much more info.\n\nGet more information:\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/tv/\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/tv/start/hardware.html\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/tv/games/index.html#control\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/game-controllers/\nhttp://developers.google.com/games/services/android/nearby\nhttp://udacity.com/course/android-ubiquitous-computing--ud875\n\nFor more information about making games with Google, visit: http://developers.google.com/games/\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
