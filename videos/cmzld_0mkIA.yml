description: "More and more applications are using JavaScript to create rich user interfaces and RESTful architectures to expose business services to end customers. Quite often developers get so buried in adding business functionality that they forget about securing the interfaces for use in the external world. They miss some of the basic rules at the programming stage and realize it after the information has been stolen or the servers compromised. This presentation focuses on the security threats to and countermeasures for JavaScript/REST APIâ€“based applications and discusses some best practices for designing and implementing security in such applications.\n\n\nAuthors:\nSumit Daryani\nSoftware Engineer\nView more trainings by Sumit Daryani at https://www.parleys.com/author/sumit-daryani-1\n\nVikas Charak\nArchitect\nView more trainings by Vikas Charak at https://www.parleys.com/author/vikas-charak\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
