description: "The Chief Architect of EdgeCast Networks sits down to discuss how the company works to make the web faster, and changes since their acquisition by Verizon, at the 2014 Velocity Conference in Santa Clara, CA.\n\nAbout Rob Peters (EdgeCast):\nRob Peters is Chief Architect at EdgeCast Networks, where he was one of the early members of the engineering group. Peters currently leads core teams that work with EdgeCast's core http cache/proxy engine and its surrounding infrastructure ecosystem of software and hardware. He enjoys thinking about deployment methodologies and looking at graphs and grids full of colorful numbers, and is often mistaken for a subversion and perl fanboy.\n\nPrior to joining EdgeCast in 2008, Rob completed a Ph.D. in Computation & Neural Systems from the California Institute of Technology and spent several years in post-doctoral work at the University of Southern California building biologically-inspired computer vision software. He will be happy to show you a live demo of these algorithms that still manage to run on his laptop.
