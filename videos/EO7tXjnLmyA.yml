description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMartin Brynskov - Associate Professor & Coordinator of AU Smart Cities, Aarhus University\n\nABSTRACT\n\"If you provide it, they'll build\" has not really worked as a principle for establishing open data as a cornerstone of digital societies. There are so many concerns for providers, value-adders and users of open data that complicate what would otherwise seem like a simple way forward: Just open it up! With examples from different cities around the world, in very different contexts, Martin Brynskov outlines emerging trends on digital cities and urban interaction design, focusing on the role of open data. Concrete platforms and ways to organize the efforts are discussed using Smart Aarhus (www.smartaarhus.dk) and the Open Data Aarhus platform (www.odaa.dk) as a case.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
