description: "Join Jason Hair, the General Manager of Digital Transformation & Agile Practice at Woolworths Group, tells the story of WooliesX (Australia’s largest ever startup).\nThis is a story of the largest company in Australia, which upon realising that their size was potentially hindering their ‘Food Digital Group’s speed to market and agility, chose to create a new Line of Business, which puts the customer, innovation practice, agile ways of working and business agility at the top of their priority list.\nAided by the Enterprise Business Agility Model, a reinvigorated focus on people & culture, and a purpose built environment, WooliesX has become one of the most talked about ‘new’ tech brands in Australia.\n\nJason is the lead for the new Agile ways-of-working at Woolworths.  Jason and his team are responsible for introducing Agile Organisation across the group and helping to enable and activate their transformation initiatives.  He also leads the Agile practice for the group and the Transformation Office for WooliesX, the digital and data arm of the Woolworths Group.  \n\nPrevious to joining Woolworths in 2015, Jason was the Chief Operating Officer and Deputy CEO for Virgin Mobile.  Jason credits much of the inspiration for his entrepreneurial spirit, business agility and growth mindset from his time spent at the Virgin Group.   \n\nFor more on YOW!
