description: "Horizon is a realtime open-source backend for JavaScript apps, built by the RethinkDB team and a community of hundreds of developers from around the world. Horizon includes APIs and tools that make it easy to quickly prototype web and mobile apps, and then scale them to millions of users.  Slava Akhmechet, the CEO of RethinkDB, will demo Horizon and show how you can build, secure, deploy, and scale engaging apps in a matter of minutes. He'll also describe the architecture of Horizon and show how Horizon can scale from simple demo apps to complex enterprise-grade applications.\n\nPresented at The SF JavaScript Meetup:\nhttp://www.meetup.com/jsmeetup\n\nVideo by NewCircle - Training & Resources for Web Developers:\nhttps://newcircle.com"
