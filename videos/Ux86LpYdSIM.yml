title: '"Poetry (almost) From Scratch - Teaching versification to a neural network" by Yann Schwartz'

description: "Poetry can take many forms but could be defined as a delicate balance between constraints and expression. Computers are pretty good at constraints, less so at expression.\n\nThe general problem of cracking the structure and meaning of a text has been one of the goals of linguistics, and Natural Language Processing. This had first been addressed in a reductionist way, by decomposing a sentence, counting, matching then, later, by learning from evidence and statistics. Or, as it has been shown, lately to be more and more effective, by training neural networks with a minimal set of assumptions - as was shown by the seminal paper “Natural Language Processing (almost) from Scratch”.\n\nIn this talk we'll see how to follow these techniques to spot poetry in unlikely textual places, or generate it (almost) from scratch, using a minimal set of assumptions, hoping for the meter and rhyme rules to emerge. Along the way we'll touch on topics such as the impossible definition of poetry and the tension between simple, classical rules, and deep learning models that can defy interpretation."
