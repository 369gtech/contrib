title: '"Velociraptor - Dig Deeper" - Mike Cohen (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579158119
description: "Mike Cohen\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/80/\n\nThis hands-on lab introduces delegates to Velociraptor: a new open-source (AGPL) platform to perform surgical forensic evidence collection and incident response across a distributed computer network. It’s fast, precise, powerful … and free.  It also supports Linux, Windows and MacOS. Velociraptor is a unique tool since it offers a query language so that users may query their end point flexibly in response to new threat information.\r\n\r\nParticipants will download the latest Velociraptor executable, then configure and deploy a Velociraptor server and agent before collecting and examining evidence from across their personal test network. This workshop will focus on Linux. \r\n\r\nThe instructors will walk through several real-life investigation scenarios, including collecting evidence of program execution, searching for evidence of lateral movement, hunting for back doors and hunting for attacker IOCs. We also explore how Velociraptor can be used to perform continuous security monitoring on the endpoints. Participants will become familiar with the main deployment options, elements of the Velociraptor interface and the procedure for configuring and executing basic hunts, before moving to the powerful Velociraptor Query Language (VQL) which opens the doors to developing custom hunts to meet specific investigation needs. We’ll also be covering management and monitoring features which ensure that Velociraptor can be used at scale, with minimal impact on network performance.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
