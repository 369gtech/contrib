description: "In this guided demo, we are going to look at 3 different techniques that are remarkably powerful in combination to cut through legacy code without having to go through the bother of reading or understanding it.\r\n\r\nThe techniques are:\r\n\r\nCombination Testing: to get 100% test coverage quickly\r\n\r\nCode Coverage as guidance: to help us make decisions about inputs and deletion\r\n\r\nProvable Refactorings: to help us change code without having to worry about it.\r\n\r\nIn combination, these 3 techniques can quickly make impossible tasks trivial. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWill will be doing this on the Gilded Rose Kata, https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata\r\n\r\nIt is extra beneficial if you try it out yourself first so you can see how your implementation would differ. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/5NYvjSCMHMD"
