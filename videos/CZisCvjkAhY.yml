description: "GoWayFest 4.0, Online – July 11-12, 2020\n\nProbabilistic Data Structures, Dylan Meeus\n\nWhat do you do when you need to solve a problem, but the data does not fit in memory? Or perhaps it fits, but takes hours to run?\nOne option is giving up, and the other is looking at probabilistic structures. Because a talk on the former would be boring, this talk will focus on the structures.\n\nSlides – https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q_8-_vyCblr0KHA45hTJISSepZVWapL2/view?usp=sharing"
