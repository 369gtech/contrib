description: 'When one uses Test-Driven Development, has more then 90% test coverage
  and the best Sonar metrics ever seen, and still finds regular bugs in his application,
  it is time for something more. Unit Testing is like testing a car''s every nuts
  and bolts while Integration Testing is like leading it on a test drive: one cannot
  achieve high internal quality without the other. However, Integration Testing might
  seem very complex when put in place for the first several times; I have made many
  mistakes and have lost much time. In this presentation, I will present tools that
  helped me tremendously in Integration Testing, as well as proven tactics to get
  the best out of your tests.'
