description: "DevOpsDays Baltimore 2019 - Failure is not an option: What Apollo 11 can teach us about DevSecOps by Brendan O'Leary\n\nMany software development professionals think of themselves as cutting edge innovators who explore new and exciting frontiers. Contrarily, concepts that may be considered contemporary innovations are actually ideas that were conceived decades ago when humans strived to explore the REAL final frontier: space.\n\nFifty years ago this June, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the surface of the moon. But behind this amazing human accomplishment was the work of countless individuals who collaborated to make the impossible happen. In this talk, weâ€™ll re-examine what we can learn from the Apollo program and how that knowledge can help avoid pitfalls today. While shipping code directly into production might be scary for you, imagine if that code was shipped into the vacuum of space and could only use 24K of storage and 1L of memory.\n\nDon't throw the past away You might need it some rainy day Dreams can come true again When everything old is new again\n\n#confreaks #devopsdaysbmore"
