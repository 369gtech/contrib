description: "By Jurgen Holler\r\nSpring Framework 3.1 continues Spring's mission with a focus on flexible Java-based configuration. This webinar introduces foundational 3.1 M1 facilities such as environment profiles for application contexts, feature specifications within configuration classes, and Spring's new caching abstraction. Finally, we'll cover Spring's ongoing support for enterprise Java specifications: in particular our Servlet 3.0 support, as scheduled for 3.1 M2."
