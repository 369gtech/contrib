Learn more at https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v-america-2021/\n\nWriting specialized Elixir programs starts always with writing great Elixir whether you are building a web application, moving data, or going back to Erlang's roots to work with hardware. In this session, Bruce Tate talks about how to build a binary clock, and how very little of that problem is related to Nerves. \n\nAlong the way, he demonstrates how to think about abstractions including the constructor-reducer-converter strategy, and the software layers introduced in Designing Elixir Systems with OTP. \n\n——————————————————————— \n\nSPEAKER CONTACT DETAILS \n\nBruce Tate - Bruce Tate is a kayaker, climber, programmer and father of two from Chattanooga, Tennessee.
