title: 'Security Testing for Developers Using OWASP ZAP'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433233624
description: "Any application exposed to the internet will be attacked, and the earlier in the development cycle you find vulnerabilities, the better. This session introduces the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), a free, open source, Java-based integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. Although ZAP is widely used by security professionals, it is also ideal for anyone new to web application security and includes features specifically aimed at developers. The session shows how ZAP can be used to find vulnerabilities, both manually and as part of an automated build. It also provides an overview of some of the more advanced features and explains how they can be used for more-complex security testing.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSimon Bennetts\nSimon Bennetts is the ZAP Project Lead, having forked the venerable Paros Proxy in 2010.\n\nHe works for the Mozilla Security Team as an automation engineer, and spends much of his time there working on ZAP.\n\nHis background is in development, and he is strongly believes that you cannot build secure web applications without knowing how to attack them.\n\nSimon won the 2013 OWASP WASPY Award in the Best Project Leader category\nView more trainings by Simon Bennetts at https://www.parleys.com/author/simon-bennetts\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
