description: "Commenting code is a more nuanced thing than we give it credit for.\n\nThere are a couple of schools of thought on this. One states that if you feel a comment is necessary, you should rewrite it to be more legible. This is true. But it's also not true. In the process of writing a comment, you can often find things that could be written better, but it's not an either/or, for the following reason: Code can describe how, but it cannot explain why.\n\nThere is just not one right way or one reason to write a comment.In this session, we'll dig into some of the many beneficial types of comments that might all serve a different purpose, followed by patterns we might want to avoid. In the process we'll talk about being good teammates, collaborating, and writing the most legible code we can.\n\nJSConf Hawaii will return soon\nhttps://www.jsconfhi.com/"
