recordingDate: 1510959600
description: "With a building bursting at the seams and a move to a new location some years away one of our Hackathon teams came up with an idea to improve the “facilities” for the building staff. Initially what started as a bit of a joke soon grew into a fully-fledged idea of building a comprehensive IoT solution that can constantly keep check of the usage state of the showers and toilets at Seek. Not just for morbid curiosity, but to help maintain better cleaning and hygiene of the facilities and also help people use them more effectively. The solution was met with great success and is in the process of becoming a permanent solution in the building.\n\nWe will cover:\n\n   1.What IoT devices we found effective\n    2.How you can leverage the capabilities of AWS to rapidly stand up complex solutions without investments in Infrastructure\n    3.Which “areas” of Seek are more popular than others!\n\n\nHailing from a background predominantly based in IT consultancy roles working on small through to large scale IT solutions in roles spanning across Architecture, Development, Testing, IM and DevOps in Australia and India, Andrew has based himself at Seek since 2014.
