description: "Slowly, websites have been peeking outside the browser sandbox, though we remain some way off an interoperable solution for the holy grail of a website-as-desktop-app without any runtime other than the browser. How do we get there more quickly, and in the meantime navigate problems like conflicting and confusing user permission prompts, testing and updating, and do we get the access we actually need?\n\nPanelists: Brian Leroux, Diana Cheng, Paul Kinlan, Petro Soininen\nModerator: Chris Heilmann"
