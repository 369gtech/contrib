description: "Create an easy-to-use experience that delights your user and reinforces the value of your business? Got it. Make all your designs adaptive to prepare for any and all devices that may be thrown your way? Check! Get leaner, get personalized, get localized, and oh, don’t forget to account for seniors, and low-literacy users. Well, okay. Also, have you considered people with disabilities? Wait… what?\n\nWhen we think about all that goes into mastering good design principles, it’s no wonder that tackling accessibility can appear like a daunting, unrealistic burden. How can we consider all of these highly technical, specific user needs when we don’t even know how people with disabilities use the web? How do we incorporate accessibility into a rapidly evolving design process that’s literally sprinting towards releases? And what about the Internet of Things? Is it time to give up?!\n\nIn this session, we'll embark on a tremulous journey through the wilderness of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and deep into the mire of assistive technologies. But, stay the course! Before you know it, you’ll feel the warm comforting rays of a heat map once again. After this experience, you’ll be equipped with five simple but powerful techniques you can integrate into your daily work. Calling all usability testers, all content strategists, and all visual and interaction designers. Ready? Grab your wires, and let’s go!\n\n\nNote: Due to technical issues there is no picture until 0:30."
