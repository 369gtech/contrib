See http://fitc.ca for details.\n\nOverview\nNo one is paid just to deal with technical debt in an organization, and few people like doing it. Tech debt comes from a variety of places, and can pile up quickly if a developer is not careful. Tech debt often makes seemingly simple or small tasks take much longer, cost more money, and generally complicate projects and tech stacks needlessly. But if a dev knows what to watch out for, the entire team can spend less time addressing it.\n\nGood documentation, thorough planning ahead of time, clear ownership, relentless testing, and open source solutions are all ways of reducing technical debt. If you want to get ahead of tech debt, these should be a part of your orgâ€™s daily routine.\n\nKacey Coughlin\nWeb Developer, LinkedIn\nhttps://twitter.com/kaceykaso\nhttps://instagram.com/kaceykaso/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Kaceykaso\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=92946322\nhttps://github.com/Kaceykaso\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
