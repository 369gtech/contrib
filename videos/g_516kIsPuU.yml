description: "Quantum supremacy has been (very likely) achieved by Google, that is, a computation done at a 53-qubit quantum computer can not be reproduced on any supercomputer. We shall analyze this claim and its consequences for science, economy and politics. \n\n=== \n\nJos√© Ignacio LATORRE is a full professor on Theoretical Physics at the Universitat de Barcelona and a long term visinting professor at the Center for Quantum Technologies in Singapore. He is the head of the Quantic research group at the Barcelona Supercomuting Center. He got his PhD in High Energy Physics at the Universitat de Barcelona. He then became a MIT Fulbright Fellow in USA, followed by a postdoc at the Niels Bohr Institutet in Denmark. He has worked on short visits in a large number of universities. He has written over 120 research papers in international journals on Quantum Physics, and on applications of neural networks to high energy data. He founded the Centro de Ciencias de Benasque Pedro Pascual, that he directs. He has produced two documentaries, one of them with the last voice of the Manhattan Project by Roy Glauber. He founded Qilimanjaro Quantum Tech SL and is a partner of Entanglement Partners SL. He produces wine for fun."
