description: "This is a video of Jakob Sievers' talk at London Erlang factory Lite \n\nMeshUp is our functional workflow engine. We like our business logic pure and our effects managed - this talk describes how we do it. While MeshUp was designed with Riak in mind, the approach should be of interest to anyone who wants to maintain some discipline in large, database-driven Erlang applications.\n\nTalk objectives: Describe how we realize the two main goals of our application platform: 1) maintaining the benefits of functional programming in the presence of a shared database 2) making Dynamo-style databases easier to use."
