description: "Good applications are a mix of powerful technologies and a productive approach to development. This tutorial walks you through the combination of Java EE 7 and a variety of technologies that can help you develop your applications. You will learn about the pros and cons of different Java EE 7 tooling options such as Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ, and Forge. An application is then locally deployed on WildFly and GlassFish and to Red Hat’s free PaaS in the cloud, OpenShift. The tutorial also shows container-independent testing with Arquillian and demonstrates continuous integration using Jenkins in different development environments. You’ll also learn about rapid application development with JRebel and integration with multiple app servers.\n\n\nAuthor:\nArun Gupta\nArun Gupta is Director of Developer Advocacy at Red Hat and focuses on JBoss Middleware.
