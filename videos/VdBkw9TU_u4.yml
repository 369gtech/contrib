description: "Java does not permit multiple implementation inheritance, but the problem is not gone. We solve the issue by using a bunch of interfaces and classes. Thankfully, there are some alternatives in Java, Scala, and Groovy. In this session, you will learn about the problem, the solution in old Java, and then some possible solutions in Java 8. The presentation also explores the options available in Scala and Groovy.\n\nSpeaker:\nVenkat Subramaniam, President, Agile Developer, Inc.\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., and an instructional professor at the University of Houston.
