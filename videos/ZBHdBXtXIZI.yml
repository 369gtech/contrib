description: "I run a Twitter bot that's aimed to be amusing. It generates tweets based off a mixture of other Twitter feeds, Facebook posts and some other sources. One of the challenges in making this work has been getting decently amusing output.\n\nThis presentation will go through some of the options available, ranging from simple Markov systems using markovify, through more complicated Markov approaches and will then look at systems based on torch-rnn and other neural network systems.\n\nYou'll leave this presentation with a decent overview of the ways you can transform content into new content and the strengths and weaknesses of each.\n\nEVENT: North Bay Python 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Benno Rice\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on North Bay Python YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oJyU2iFhA\nEvent organizer's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLc1vUexbRTlRBJcUG9U6ug"
