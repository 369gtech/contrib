description: 'In this talk, Dylan explores functional programming, what the benefits are, and how we can get these benefits in Go. You will see how concepts like closures, currying, tail-recursion, and more, can be applied to solve real world problems and how they compare to a more traditional approach. In addition, he will take a look at some handy libraries which make writing functional Go code faster and easier.'
