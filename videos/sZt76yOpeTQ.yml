title: 'Crafting Kubernetes Custom Controllers With Angela Chin'
language: English
recordingDate: 1594838397
description: "Custom controllers and custom resource definitions are all the rage in Kubernetes today! In conjunction, they allow users to extend the Kubernetes API and introduce additional features. In this session, weâ€™ll explore both custom resource definitions and custom controllers by trying out popular projects that allow us to craft a new controller from scratch!\n\n---\n\nAngela Chin is a Senior Engineer at VMware, working on Tanzu Application Service (for both VMs and Kubernetes!).\n\nShe has worked on the project in one form or another for the past 4 years and is an active contributor to the Cloud Foundry Foundation. Since COVID-19 has given her ample free time, she has taken up baking and long runs to balance each other out."
