description: "by Sean A. Parker and Paul Schroeder\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UB4.136/test_software_on_emulated_hardware_in_containers_in_the_cloud.webm\n\nModernizing the traveler information systems of an international railway and transportation company, including the modernization and renewal of traveler facing devices at the train stations. For a variety of devices ranging from 20-year-old x86 PC104 based embedded systems up to modern 64bit multi-core systems, a Buildroot based Linux system, and a custom application stack is being developed.\nIn this talk, we will show how we use a fully automated CI pipeline to build our custom application components resulting in deployable Linux disk images. These images are then containerized and deployed on our Kubernetes cluster. Using Qemu in our containers allows us to simulate external hardware normally connected through serial interfaces and is the basis for automated tests.\n\n\n❮ul❯\n❮li❯presentation of our technology stack.❮/li❯\n❮li❯multi-stage Linux disk image creation in the CI.❮/li❯\n❮li❯running embedded device images in a Kubernetes cluster.❮/li❯\n❮li❯automated testing of simulated embedded systems.❮/li❯\n❮/ul❯\n\n\nRoom: UB4.136\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 10:15:00"
