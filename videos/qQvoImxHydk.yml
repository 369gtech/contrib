description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nGoing Beyond CI/CD with Prow - Leonardo Di Donato, Sysdig \n\nOne of the most untold secrets is how hard and important is to automate the whole set of workflows around the code, not only the testing phase. We were able to use the native Kubernetes CI/CD system - Prow - to solve CI/CD for Falco. Furthermore we discovered that Prow does much more than CI/CD! Join us to find out what! You will walk away with a deep technical knowledge of Prow and how we were able to implement internally so you can too.  We’ll see how to correctly setup and deploy Prow on a Kubernetes instance. How to link it to a bot account. How to hook Prow to GitHub organizations and repositories, how to establish an automated governance process for the Open Source by configuring multiple Prow plugins.  Finally the audience will learn how to create its own custom plugins in order to lint commit messages and code.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZenU"
