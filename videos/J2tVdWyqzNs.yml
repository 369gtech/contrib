title: 'Making Life Better with Software - Joelle Maslak'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623191076
description: "Software improves my life. I'll talk about how I designed software for my own needs and how this can be generalized to designing software for users who have needs outside the mainstream. I'll talk about how I designed software to meet my needs in this talk, showing the iterative process I used.\n\nImagine writing software that helps people participate in the world! How do you avoid building systems for people as you think they are, rather than people as they actually are? I'll examine assistive and accessible technology I use, and how the software (most of which was created by myself) was designed. Throughout the presentation, while some Raku will be demonstrated, the presentation will be accessible to people who code in any language, with a focus on the process used to define requirements and design the various tools I use. Throughout, I'll also examine mistakes commonly made by technologists when designing accessible or assistive technology, and how you can avoid those mistakes in your own work."
