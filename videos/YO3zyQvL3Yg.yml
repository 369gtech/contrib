description: "In this talk, Sam will discuss the state of blockchain and cryptocurrency development, as well as present a new blockchain-derived data structure: the Blockweave.\n\nSam will discuss the details of this new approach to blockchain sharding, as well as its scalability properties and associated novel 'Proof of Work' algorithms.\n\nHe will also discuss how they are using the Blockweave at Archain to build a permanent, de-centralised internet archive, amongst other uses, to 'store human history on a blockchain.'\n\nFurther, we will detail how Erlang has enabled us to test this system at extremely large scales (many thousands of nodes), exposing many complex and emergent bugs before the network has even launched.\n\nThe talk will conclude with a demonstration of such a simulated network, inside a single machine.\n\nMore details here: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2017/sam-williams"
