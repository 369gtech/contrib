description: "by Radovan Sroka\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UA2.114/security_application_whitelisting_in_linux_environment.webm\n\nAre you a sysadmin and feeling paranoid? Let's promote security hardening to another level.\nPerhaps, with the concept of Application Whitelisting you will be able to sleep again.\nIn this session we are going to explain the Application Whitelisting idea and its implementation, what benefits are there from a security point of view and how it differs from competitors.\nWe are going to show how to create a new set of rules based on distribution default for given examples.\nAs a result, an attendee should be able to setup the Application Whitelisting framework on his server or workstation.\n\n\nThis presentation is based on Red Hat/Fedora Linux environment.\n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 14:30:00"
