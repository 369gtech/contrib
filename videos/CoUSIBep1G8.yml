description: "Google Tech Talk\nJanuary 5, 2011\n\nPresented by Nikolas Coukouma.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nHTML5 includes a specification for application caches. This unique feature allows a page to store needed static resources and start even when offline. This talk will cover both the basics and some more advanced uses. Hopefully it will answer most of your questions about what's possible and provide some hints about how to do it."
