description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nProvider vSphere: All Things vSphere Working Group - David vonThenen, VMware \n\nCloud Providers and CSI drivers have reached the mainstream Kubernetes community. Members within the community are deploying persistent stateful applications on Kubernetes clusters both in the cloud and on-premises in production environments. A lot of the design and planning effort architecting these deployments has been through a significant amount of trial and error and painful iteration. The discussion in this session will address various deployment strategies on VMware infrastructure to make your clusters run smoothly, efficiently and more importantly... stress-free. Some topics that will be discussed: - Brief vSphere subproject updates and housekeeping - Cloud Provider (CPI) and CSI driver basics - Discuss multi-tenancy and role-based access introduced in CPI v1.1.0 - Deployment recommendations/strategies for large and multi-tenant environments These topics will be facilitated via a demonstration to help encourage and support discussion with attendees.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZevZ"
