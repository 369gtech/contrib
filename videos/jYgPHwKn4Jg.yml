description: "Using kAFS on Linux for Network Home Directories\n\nJonathan Billings, University of Michigan, College of Engineering, CAEN\n\nThe AFS filesystem has been widely in use at educational and research institutions since the mid-80s, and continues to be a service that many universities, including the University of Michigan, provides to students, staff and faculty. The Linux kernel has recently improved support for the AFS filesystem, and now some Linux distributions provide support for AFS out of the box. I will discuss the history of AFS, the in-kernel AFS client, and its performance compared to the out-of-kernel OpenAFS client. I will demonstrate some of the benefits and limitations when using AFS as a home directory in a modern Linux distribution such as Fedora, including working with systemd and GNOME.\n\nView the full Vault '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/vault20/program"
