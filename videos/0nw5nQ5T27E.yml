title: 'YOW! 2017 Lynn Langit / Denis Bauer - Cloud Data Pipelines'
language: English
recordingDate: 1517180401
description: "Dr.Bauer and her team have been working to build genome-scale data pipelines that address the computational challenges and limits present in today’s cancer genomic (bioinformatics) data workflows.\n\nDr. Bauer and her team have built solutions which use modern architectures, such as serverless (AWS Lambda) and also customised machine learning on Apache Spark. AWS Community Hero and cloud architect Lynn Langit is also collaborating with the CSIRO team to push solutions at the cutting edge of bioinformatic research which best utilise advances in cloud technologies..\n\nIn this demo-filled session Lynn and Denis will discuss and demonstrate some of the latest cloud data pipeline work that they’ve been working together to build out for the bioinformatics community.\n\nLYNN:\nLynn Langit is an independent software architect and educator. She is an AWS Community Hero, Google Cloud Developer Expert, Microsoft MVP and technical author for LinkedIn Learning. She has most recently worked as a lead architect on AWS IoT Enterprise project where she applied Mob Programming.\n\nLynn is also Director & Lead Courseware Author for “Teaching Kids Programming”. She has 8 years experience authoring technical courseware for middle school kids and has been a key contributor to TKPJava courseware library with 70+ open source kids coding lessons.\n\nDENIS:\nDr. Denis Bauer leads the Transformational Bioinformatics team at Australia’s national science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)—the research institution behind fast WiFi, the Hendra virus vaccine, and polymer banknotes. She is also involved in initiatives to bring genomics into medical practice. Denis holds a PhD in bioinformatics with expertise in machine learning and genomics.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
