description: "\"Using Functional Programming Patterns to build a clean and simple HTTP routing API\"\n\nhttp://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nWeb services are flourishing, and C++ has some great libraries (such as Boost/Asio + Beast or CppRestSdk) which we can use as the basis to build such services. Yet it is still relatively inconvenient to define HTTP routes in C++. Most approaches available in online tutorials are based on manual manipulation of regex or HTTP concepts. \n\nIn this talk, we will present the result of our work toward creating a clean HTTP routing library, usable on top of any HTTP transport layer library, which offers a terse and declarative syntax, composable routes, type-safety and a rich set of additional features such as generating sample routes or documentation. \n\nWe will discuss our initial investigations, and explain why we chose a functional-programming-based approach over reflection-based designs such as are common in the object-oriented world. You will learn about some design choices which allowed us to come closer to the “Don't Repeat Yourself” ideal: maximizing the services offered for the information provided by the client of the API.\n— \nJeremy Demeule: Murex, Principal Software Engineer\n\nJeremy Demeule is a Principal Software Engineer from Murex in Paris, France. He is working on data access subject (database, ORM, IMDG…) in Java and C++ and he is an active member of the C++ community at Murex. He was also present with a coworker the CDBC poster during the CppCon 2016.\n\nQuentin Duval: Murex, Senior Software Developer\n\nQuentin Duval is a Senior Software Engineer from Murex, working at the Paris office in France. He is the leader of a team responsible for the life cycle management of trades inside the MX3 plattform. \n\nHe is also a member of the C++ community of Practice of Murex, animates daily courses of Clojure and Haskell in Murex, is author of the blog https://deque.blog, and speaks in meetups and conferences.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
