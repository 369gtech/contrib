description: "In this talk, Emily will explore and use Git’s plumbing commands to dissect what is going on behind the scenes at a low level when we use Git. Along the way, we’ll solidify our conceptual understanding of Git, exploring questions such as: How does Git store our information? What is at the heart of a branch? What is actually happening when you do a Git checkout? Or a reset?\n\nEmily Xie is a software engineer on the Devtools team at Wayfair. Outside of work, she teaches women how to code and helps organize the Boston branch of Girl Develop It. Emily currently lives in Cambridge, MA, and enjoys photography, cooking, yoga, and razing villages in Age of Empires II.\n\nAbout Git Merge:\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content, user case studies and training workshops for Git users of all levels.\n\nVisit: http://git-merge.com/"
