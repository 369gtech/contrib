language: English
recordingDate: 1618915202
description: "In this Tech Community of Practice episode, Lars Rosenquist, Partner Solution Architect Cloud at Redis Labs, will tell us a bit more about the problems that Redis can help our clients to solve. \n\n\"The modern world is moving faster than ever and as a consequence of that, software needs help to keep up with the demands of the modern user. More often than not, Redis plays a major part in developing web applications that deliver the instant or real time user experiences that customers demand, all with minimal resources and overhead\".\n\nIn this session weâ€™ll go over some of the practical scenarios; including, but not limited to, legacy application migration, geographically distributed systems and offloading traditional RDBM systems. Last, but not least: actual code (Java/Spring Boot/Redis) of working applications.\n\nThank you for this interesting talk, Lars!\n\nTo catch all our events, please visit: https://codurance.com/events/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tcp_webinar&utm_content=modern_software_redis"
