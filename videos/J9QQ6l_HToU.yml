description: "Full title: Thomas J Fan: Deep Dive into scikit-learn's HistGradientBoosting Classifier and Regressor | PyData New York 2019\n\nGradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) is a powerful machine-learning technique known for its high predictive power with heterogeneous data. In this talk, we will explore scikit-learn's implementation of histogram-based GBDT called HistGradientBoostingClassifier/Regressor and how it compares to other GBDT libraries such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
