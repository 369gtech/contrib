description: "Serverless Operations: From Dev to Production - Erwin van Eyk, Platform9 \n\nFaaS functions on Kubernetes are increasingly popular. We often talk about the developer productivity advantages, such as the time to create a useful application from scratch without learning a lot about Kubernetes. In this talk we will focus on the operational aspects of serverless applications on Kubernetes.  What does it take to use serverless functions in Production, with safety, and at scale?  This talk covers 6 specific approaches, patterns and best practices that you can use with any FaaS/Serverless framework. These practices are geared towards improving quality, reducing risk, optimizing costs, and generally moving you closer towards production-readiness with serverless systems. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPej"
