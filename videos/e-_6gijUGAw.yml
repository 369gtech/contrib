description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nMartijn Visser, Product Owner, & Bas Geerdink, IT Chapter Lead (ING)\n\nFast Data at ING â€“ building a streaming data platform with Flink and Kafka\n\nING is using Apache Flink for creating streaming analytics ('fast data') solutions. We created a platform with Flink and Kafka that offers high-throughput and low-latency, ideally suited for complex and demanding use cases in the international bank such as customer notifications and fraud detection. These use cases require fast data processing and a business rules engine and/or machine learning evaluation system. Integrating these components together in a always-on, distributed architecture can be challenging. In this talk, we'll start with a brief overview of the use cases. You'll learn why ING chose Flink for these use cases, and see the architecture of the streaming data platform in depth. Finally, we'll share some lessons learned and useful insights for organizations who embark on a similar journey.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-berlin-2017-bas-geerdink-martijn-visser-fast-data-at-ing-buidling-a-streaming-data-platform-with-flink-and-kafka\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
