title: 'Catching anomalies in Power Monitoring'
recordingDate: 1634793671
description: "At Softhouse we had a long summer and two students, Olof Bengtsson and Oskar Pott, under the guidance of our AI expert Kerstin Johnsson. The students worked hard to analyze data from one of our customers, SenseNode. The company has a solution for monitoring power used by the industry, and the goal was to find anomalies using AI/ML in real-time data. \n\nJoin us to hear how they solved this and what kind of outcome they achieved. And more importantly, AI/ML is so close it only takes a summer and some code to try it out. Whatever you work with, the time to start understanding this technology is now.\n\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
