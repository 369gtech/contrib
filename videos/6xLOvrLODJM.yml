description: "SOUPS 2021 - Keynote Address: Mitigating Technology Abuse in Intimate Partner Violence\n\nThomas Ristenpart, Cornell Tech\n\nOur research group studies the role technology plays in intimate partner violence (IPV). Via interviews with survivors and support professionals, online measurement studies, and investigation of malicious software tools purpose-built for abuse, we have documented how abusers exploit technology to control, harass, stalk, and otherwise harm their current or former partner. To help survivors, we work with technology companies and lawmakers to affect positive changes and, more directly, we have put into practice a new interventional approach that we call clinical computer security. Our Clinic to End Tech Abuse works in partnership with the New York City Mayor's Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence to help survivors navigate technology abuse and, ultimately, empower their use of technology.\n\nIn this talk I will provide a brief overview of our work on IPV technology abuse, and use it as a case study for \"advocate-scientist\" models that blend basic research with direct advocacy work in close collaboration with a community.\n\nThis talk will cover joint work with a large number of collaborators and clinic volunteers. See https://ipvtechresearch.org and https://ceta.tech.cornell.edu for more information.\n\nView the full SOUPS 2021 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2021/technical-sessions"
