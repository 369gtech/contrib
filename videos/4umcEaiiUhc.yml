Do you want to learn something new, expand your knowledge, develop yourself and be the best you can be?\n\nIn this session, Elli is going to share her story on how she started coding, how she makes time to work on side projects and how you can grow and advance in your career. After this talk, she hopes that you‘ll be inspired to work smarter, make new habits and continue pushing yourself even when things fall apart.\n\nShe will present some helpful tips about self-motivation, time-management, setting priorities and goals, staying organized, believing in yourself and keeping a balance between your career and personal life. To do so, she’s going to use her personal story as an example of how she got into the tech world, the struggles, the rejections, what she has learned and how you can succeed by being consistent and determined. Additionally, in this session, she is going to talk about building the habit of coding and the benefits of it. You are going to explore ways of finding mentors in your job and outside of it and also expanding your social network.\n\nThis talk is not only about getting better at your 9 to 5 job but also about developing yourself."
