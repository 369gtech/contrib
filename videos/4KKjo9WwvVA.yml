description: "\"Building Data-Driven Client Relationship Management in Banking with Python\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Singapore [PyData track]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Paul Hughes\n\nThis is a case study that documents how a small data science team in a big bank took on the challenge to transform a fragmented sales process into a data-driven one using Python and machine learning. \n\nThis talk outlines the various ways Python has been instrumental in delivering a production solution that serves advisers and relationship manager on a continuous basis.\n\nThe Challenge\n- A bank has many clients with diverse needs and cost pressures mean fewer advisers resulting in reduced client coverage.\n- Multiple sales channels and mixed service levels meant sales processes were uncoordinated and driven by heuristics and often very subjective.\n- And... Excel sheets everywhere!\n\nSolution\n- Go data-driven!\n- Learn from clients and understand product usage\n- Empower and inform advisers and call centre agents\n- Build a front-to-back sales process (no more Excels!)\n- How? With Python!\n\nThe Python Bits\n- Scikit learn machine learning pipelines that implement two distinct approaches to product affinity in banking and wealth management\n- SQL Alchemy based API for data engineering and rapid prototyping of analytics\n- Pandas and Jupyter for development and collaboration\n- Luigi pipeline for daily processing of millions of transactions and engineering features\n- Extracting features from text with NLP (Spacy)\n- Delivering machine learning interpretability in production, e.g. with Random Forests and treeinterpreter\n- A Python module that we built with all the reusable bits: building training and prediction datasets, developing pipelines, generating monitoring data and enabling explainability\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement"
