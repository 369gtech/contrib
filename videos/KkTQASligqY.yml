title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 - Isaac Elliott - Snake Wrangling - The journey of designing `hpython`'
language: English
recordingDate: 1532653201
description: "`hpython` is a Haskell library implementing a parser, printer, and\nsyntax tree for Python, written to allow easy validation and refactoring of complete Python programs.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au\n\nAs examples, we will look at functions which:\n\n* Replace tabs with spaces\n* Fix mutable default arguments, and\n* Turn tail recursion into loops\n\nThese functions can also be composed, so a user can mix and match refactor-functions,\nor write their own.\n\nThe library wasn't always like this, though. We've had ups and downs, and actually ended\nup throwing out the entire previous design, which was months old at that point. I'm going to share this journey: how the project goals evolved, failures and successes, and the lessons\nI learned along the way. Key points include:\n\n* The real-world value of property testing\n* The shortcomings of advanced type-level techniques and compiler-enforced correctness\n* The difference between \"making it difficult to do the wrong thing\" vs. \"making it easy to do the right thing\"\n\nIsaac has been learning Haskell for about three years. He is particularly interested in programming languages and formal verification. When he is not writing code, he is either playing drums or drinking coffee."
