description: "Supercharging PayPal’s application development to help democratize financial services\n\nRama Kolli, Product Manager, Middleware Platform, Paypal \n\nTo give PayPal’s 210 million active account holders the confidence to connect and transact in new and powerful ways, new applications must be built quickly while meeting the highest levels of quality, security and compliance requirements mandated for global financial services. To empower PayPal developers with a multitude of technology preferences, including Java, Scala and Node.js, GO lang etc. and evolving infrastructure that includes containers, cluster managers and a hybrid cloud deployment, a platform was required that abstracted this complexity for all stakeholders. Hear how PayPal has enabled developers, release managers and operations to work with familiar tooling without having to re-invent the wheel as each new change came along, while baking in support for dynamic environment provisioning, automated testing and fully automated CI/CD for the entire application.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
