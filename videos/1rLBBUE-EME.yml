description: "Serverless London Meetup goes virtual with Nicole Yip and Yan Cui!\n\n\nTalks:\n\n\n\nNicole Yip (LEGO Group) - Serverless Deployments with Canary – Creating DevOps Engineers at LEGO.com\n\nWith the launch of AWS lambda functions in 2014/2015(GA), serverless computing and resources have become the go-to architecture strategy for new projects, startups and all the tech teams who can get away with it. With this rapid adoption, numerous tools and frameworks have been created to support the teams of developers figuring out this new tech and getting it production ready. This talk focuses on the tools we use in the Shopper Engagement Team at The LEGO Group to get our serverless services from stories to production. From CircleCI to serverless and AWS Code Deploy for Canary releases, I’ll show you how we are building a safer release pipeline and levelling up our Developers into DevOps engineers.\n\nNicola Yip is a Senior Infrastructure Engineer at The LEGO Group.\n\nYan Cui - How to refactor a monolith to serverless in 8 steps\n\nRefactoring a monolith to serverless can be intimidating, but there are discrete steps that you can take to simplify the process. In this talk, AWS Serverless Hero Yan Cui outlines 8 steps to successfully refactor your monolith and highlight key decision points such as language and tooling choices.\n\nYan Cui is a Developer Advocate at Lumigo and an AWS Serverless Hero.\n\nAs always, our sponsors are Theodo (https://www.theodo.co.uk/) and Senzo (https://senzo.io)"
