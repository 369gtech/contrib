title: 'GeeCON 2019: Krzysztof Dębski - When your boss decides to have an architecture team…'
recordingDate: 1563984050
description: 'If you work in a large company there is at least one architecture team in your organisation. Sometimes there are even multiple of them and they compete with each other. Probably you’ve never seen any of the team members in real life. Thankfully we all know that the time of the Ivory Towers has passed. But we still make the same mistakes. As the company grows, the complexity becomes unmanageable so CTO decides to copy the well known pattern and creates the architecture team. But nobody knows what exactly should they do. This talk is a survival guide if: * You are a developer and you must cope with a newly designated architect. * You’ve just been informed that your role will be transformed to be an architect.'
