description: "Functional programming has a rich history of drawing from mathematical theory, yet in this talk, Twitter data scientist Oscar Boykin make the case that programming is distinct from mathematics. This distinction is healthy and does not mean we can't leverage many results and concepts from mathematics.\n\nAs examples, Oscar will discuss some recent work — github.com/twitter/{algebird,bijection,scalding} — and show cases where mathematical purity were both helpful and harmful to developing products at Twitter.\n\n** Hey dudes and dudettes...there's a lot more Scala where this came from! Check out http://bit.ly/nescala13 for enough functional programming to cloak a warship with."
