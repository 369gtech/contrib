language: English
recordingDate: 1478765797
description: "Java 9 is arriving in a few months with a bunch of new features. One of the most interesting ones is JShell, a Read-Eval-Print-Loop for Java. While Java is far from the first language to adopt this feature, it is completely new to a lot of Java developers leading to new development patterns. In this session we will demo JShell, followed by a deep dive into more advanced features. We will also provide some tips and tricks.\n\nPavel Rozenblioum has been a Java developer for over 10 years. He still loves Java.\n\n[XSW-7518]"
