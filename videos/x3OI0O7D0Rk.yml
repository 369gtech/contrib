recordingDate: 1506434043
description: "In this session you will get an update on the out of the box experience initiative, and will be able to participate in discussion about the relevant questions at the time.\n\nThe out of the box experience initiative team is working on improving the first-time user experience of Drupal. The team is creating a new installation profile to demonstrate how powerful Drupal is for creating beautiful websites for real life use cases. The new installation profile will provide a demo user experience that will address the problem of new users being welcomed with the \"No front page content has been created yet.\" message in a design that is 6 years old."
