description: "Emily Jiang, Liberty Architect for MicroProfile and CDI, IBM\n\nConfiguring applications is not a new concept, having been around for a decade. There are many different third-party libraries, such as Apache DeltaSpike and Apache Tamaya, to address configuration issues. Only last year, a new JSR, JSR 382, was submitted to standardize the configuration of applications. The prototype of this JSR was based on MicroProfile Eclipse. Since then the expert group added a few more capabilities. In this session, the co-spec lead discusses the technical details of this JSR and its release plan."
