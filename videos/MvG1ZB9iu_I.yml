description: "David Bell\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/71/\nBusinesses and households are becoming inextricably attached to their technology, but what happens when the technology isn't available? How do you keep your business churning out widgets and enable your clients to receive their services?\r\n\r\nBut what about at home? IoT is only growing more and more ingrained into our lives, what happens when your lights don't work due to a firmware bug/internet outage? What do you do when your IoT front door lock doesn't let you in? Or potentially worse, out?\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, in both cases, how do you handle death? We all store countless passwords and access details in our brains, how do our colleagues and family gain access to them when we aren't around to tell them?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll discuss BCP, DRP, Digital Legacy, as well as all these issues, how to begin planning, how to \"Break the Glass\", how to securely enable your employer and family access to your systems, and how to prepare your digital legacy.\r\n\r\n*[BCP]: Business Continutiy Plan: a systematic approach to prevention, increased resiliency, and recovery to threats to a company (or, in this case, an individual)\r\n*[DRP]: Disaster Recovery Plan: a plan for recovery of IT systems following a disaster\r\n*[Digital Legacy]: Digital Legacy refers to a person's digital assets left behind after their death. For example, online accounts."
