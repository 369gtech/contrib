description: "TestCon Moscow 2017 Conference, April 27. www.testconf.ru\n\nThere are tons of talks on how to build automation properly, however, there is no silver bullet for every problem and here’s where people get in trouble. They can’t apply the “perfect” approaches and practices so they try to implement their own and often make common mistakes. It’s those “mistakes” aka “what NOT to do” aka “antipatterns” that we’re going to talk about. I’d like to mention both coding antipatterns and antipatterns in the whole approach to automated testing that I’ve come across too often and that often prevent a growth of the project. Hopefully, together we will be able to avoid those common misconceptions."
