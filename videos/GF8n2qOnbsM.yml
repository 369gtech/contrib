description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/design-tradeoffs-in-distributed-systems-how-southwest-airlines-uses-geode\n\nDistributed systems and fast data require new software patterns and implementation skills. Learn how Southwest Airlines uses Apache Geode, organizes team responsibilities, and approaches design tradeoffs. Drawing inspiration from real whiteboard conversations, we’ll explore: \n\n-Common development pitfalls \n-Environment capacity planning \n-Streaming data patterns, like consumer checkpointing \n-Support roles \n-Production lessons learned \nEvery day, Apache Geode improves how Southwest Airlines schedules nearly 4,000 flights and serves over 500,000 passengers. It’s an essential component of Southwest’s ability to reduce flight delays and support future growth.\n\nSpeaker: Brian Dunlap; Tech Lead, Southwest Airlines."
