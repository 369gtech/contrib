title: 'JDK IO 2017 - Gunnar Morling - Keeping your data sane with Bean Validation 2'
recordingDate: 1510512576
description: "Rich UIs, schemaless datastores, microservices communicating with each other - the need for powerful and easy-to-use data validation services has never been bigger.\n\nThe Bean Validation standard is here to help, providing Java developers with a rich validation API based on annotations. Bean Validation 2.0 (JSR 380) makes validation even more powerful and expressive by leveraging Java 8 features such as additional annotation locations, repeatable annotations and default methods. This opens up exciting opportunities for Bean Validation - e.g. List @Email String. There is also support for java.util.Optional, the new java.time API, JavaFX and more.\n\nIn this code-centric talk we’ll explore many Bean Validation features right in the IDE. You’ll learn how constraint validation is triggered via JAX-RS, JPA and even on the client side via AngularJS. You’ll find out how to adjust the validation system to your own requirements, ensuring your data is sane at all times."
