description: "Scalable systems with modern CSS techniques.\n\nNewer developments in CSS make it easier than ever to create robust, scalable, elegant typographic systems on the web and in apps. But the fun really starts when you add variable fonts. The design, technical, and performance benefits are really exciting—but when you combine them with other CSS capabilities like custom properties, calculations, and grid—it’s a whole new way to think about design and development. Jason will show how they work together by using some variable fonts in layouts that work across screen dimensions, accessibility needs, design requirements, and even network speeds—better than you thought possible.\n\nJason Pamental\nDesigner/Strategist/Tinkerer/Typographer, RWT.io\nhttps://twitter.com/jpamental\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jpamental/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jpamental\nhttps://github.com/jpamental\nhttp://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034063.do\n\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
