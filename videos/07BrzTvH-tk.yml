description: "How do you create unconventional interfaces and experiences that are simple for various audiences to engage with? Video games, improv comedy, VR, art parties, escape rooms, classic arcade machines â€“ learn how to draw from various examples of interaction design in order to put together compelling events, installations, and physical games or alt-controllers.
