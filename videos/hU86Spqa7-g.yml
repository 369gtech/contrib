Now we choose Kubernetes instead of Mesos. There are some tips to help the others like us to use Kubernetes.  Nine topics for this speech: Background, Container Network, ELB, Login & Audit, Security, Monitor, Log, Stateful Service Package and The Future.   All of our architectures and solutions are designed as decoupling systems, so we can use the same way to adapt every orchestration system.   We solve the problem of network performance in our own way. We support kinds of packages, tools, plugins to help user to deploy jobs, and at the same time we support monitor and log collection.  So, how the parts of system work together? To help better the ecosystem, we will share what we meet and how we slove these problems. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuKm"
