description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nDesign Choices Behind Making gRPC Available on Web Platforms - Wenbo Zhu, Google \n\nIn this talk, we will go through the challenges faced by making gRPC available on Web platforms and discuss the design choices we made in order to strike the balance between reachability and complexity of the solution. Since its GA (Oct 2018), grpc-web has been widely adopted by OSS users (https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web), and we have also seen a rapidly growing ecosystem support for gRPC-Web, such as Dart, Angular, Swift, Reactive-Native etc. Web technologies will continue evolving and we will present the road-maps of gRPC-Web and how we plan to deliver a seamless development experience for designing highly-responsive Web applications against gRPC based microservices or APIs.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeoJ"
