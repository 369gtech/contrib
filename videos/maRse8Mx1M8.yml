description: "Have you always wanted to add predictive capabilities or voice recognition to your application, but havenâ€™t been able to find the time or the right technology to get started? Everybody wants to build smart apps, but only a few are Data Scientists. We had the same issue inside Amazon, so we created a Machine Learning engine that Developers can easily use. The same approach is now available in the AWS cloud. And we introduced Amazon Alexa to build engaging voice experiences for your services and devices: if you are a device maker, and your connected product has a microphone and a speaker, the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) enables you to add voice-powered experiences to your connected devices. And you can also use the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) to teach new skills to Alexa!\n\nDanilo Poccia\nI am Technical Evangelist at Amazon Web Services and I work with startups and companies of any size to support their innovation. In my role, I help customers bringing their ideas to life using the AWS platform, focusing on technical and business impact of mobile and data analytics. I work with customers throughout Europe and I am a frequent speaker at public events and technical workshops.\n\nSebastien Stormacq\nSebastien worked for the last 20+ years with large enterprises and startups alike to help them to transform their business requirements into technical solutions, to unlock the value of software, mobile applications and scale systems to meet customer demand.
