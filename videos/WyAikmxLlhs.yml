recordingDate: 1622135487
description: "How can technology help us create art and make us look at things differently?  With the power of Python and Azure, Dmitry has developed an artistic approach to using technology that takes images of items and composites them to create one representative image. Join him as he uses pictures of different galaxies and applies his algorithm to meld them together. After that, students will learn how to write the code to create your own unique artistic expression of whatever is most meaningful to you!\n\nStudent Zone Learn Collection -- https://docs.microsoft.com/users/drguthals/collections/r34ob45k8ye525?wt.mc_id=build21_resources_webpage_wwl\nStudent Zone GitHub Repo -- https://github.com/microsoft/StudentsAtBuild\nDmitry's Python Course on GitHub -- http://github.com/shwars/pycourse\nDetect and analyze faces with the Face service Learn Path -- https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/detect-analyze-faces/?wt.mc_id=build21_resources_webpage_wwl&wt.mc_id=stud-26641-dmitryso\nDmitry's 'Making an Interactive Cognitive Portrait Exhibit' webpage -- https://soshnikov.com/scienceart/making-interactive-cognitive-portrait-exhibit/\nLearn Python in a fun way -- https://github.com/shwars/pycourse\nLearn how to use Face API -- https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/detect-analyze-faces/?wt.mc_id=build21_szresources_webpage_wwl&wt.mc_id=stud-26641-dmitryso\nCreating Cognitive Portrait Exhibit -- https://soshnikov.com/scienceart/making-interactive-cognitive-portrait-exhibit/\n\n\nMicrosoft Build 2021"
