Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKeynote: Creating the Enterprise App Store - Alexis Richardson, Weaveworks\n\nEnterprises have missed the “app store moment” largely because each organization has been running their own infrastructure for the past decades. With the adoption of Containers which provides the next level of abstraction to encapsulate applications, we are closer to the app store ideal, but it's really Kubernetes that adds the security and management that will finally turn enterprise software into an asset. Companies want to use the same core platform everywhere so they can focus on \"the same skillset, the same tools, the same way of thinking, but not the same data centers.\" GitOps delivers certain standardization for that core platform – so the most important asset, people, can now focus on the delivery of applications."
