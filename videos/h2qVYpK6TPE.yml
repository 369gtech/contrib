description: "In this video, we'll make a bot using a technique called 'Neuroevolution' to defeat the popular game of asteroids! This will be in Javascript. I talk about the architecture (neurons, layers, networks, genomes, generations) and the interesting actions we'll take to improve our bot (like breeding and mutation). \n\nThe code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/asteroids_game_bot_LIVE\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31708478/how-to-evolve-weights-of-a-neural-network-in-neuroevolution\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?neuroevolution\n\nShoutout to Daniel Shiffman!
