description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nAslam Khan - African Software Developer by Birth, by Choice, for Life\n\nABSTRACT\nSocial activists respond by organising and technical activists react by inventing. Imagine the possibilities when social and digital activists connect fluidly. Open Data may well be the pallette upon which they blend their worlds. Yet, in itself , Open Data is not enough. We need to transform Open Data into common knowledge. This talk explores the connection between activism and Open Data. I propose the need for Open Analytics to change Open Data into common knowledge - knowledge that can be used by social activists.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
