title: 'YOW! CTO Summit 2016 Victor Kovalev - Tech Teams that Scale: How to Grow your People'
recordingDate: 1489324818
description: "This talk focuses on the people side of technology. The goal is to share practical advice on setting up and scaling technical teams for success: culture creation and guardianship, team equivalents of “code smells” to watch out for and do’s and don’ts. Rooted in real-life stories and lessons learned, this talk is based on experience of growing technical teams at Redbubble, Indiegogo, Yelp and VMware.\n\nThis talk is pertinent to anyone who wants to build a successful technology startup beyond the “garage” phase – because (a) all technology is built by people, who are the true source of success of any venture and (b) everything breaks at every order of magnitude of scaling your team.\n\nVictor joined Redbubble as CTO to lead the amazing technical team creating a home for thousands of artists to make a living! Being an avid musician himself, Victor’s passion is in using tech to help independent artists scale – and building driven cultures that foster radical innovation.\n\nPreviously, he was Indiegogo’s VP of Engineering and held leadership roles at Yelp & VMware. He has a MS CS degree from Georgia Tech and volunteers his time as a Partner at Zoo Labs, a music incubator non-profit.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
