description: "Identity: From Legacy to Microservices - Tian Wang, Pivotal\n\nYour applications are moving to Cloud Foundry, so why shouldn't your identities? As part of the application re-platforming journey, enterprises often realize the need to build robust and scalable identity infrastructure to underpin their changing application ecosystem. Old legacy architectures no longer suffice in the distributed and federated world of microservices, and customers look towards Cloud Foundry to guide them through their transition.\n\nIn this talk, we explore cloud-native security built on top of open standards (SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect), UAA, and the Spring Boot framework. Tian and Sree from the Pivotal identity team will discuss several customer case studies, and highlight how they leveraged Cloud Foundry's identity capabilities to accelerate their journey towards agile and cloud-native.\n\nAbout Tian Wang\nTian Wang is the Product Manager for the SSO (Single Sign-On) Service tile at Pivotal. He recently joined and works closely with the identity team for UAA (User Account and Authentication Service) on Open Source Cloud Foundry. Prior to joining Pivotal, he worked as a security consultant for identity and access management, assisting Global and Fortune 500 companies with their identity strategies, roadmaps, and implementations. He holds a Bachelors of Business Administration and Bachelors of Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley."
