description: "Health Care Modernization at Scale - David Cherryhomes & Heather Mickman\n\n\nDavid Cherryhomes, VP, IT, Optum\nHeather Mickman, VP Platform Engineering & Practices, Optum\n\nDavid Cherryhomes loves success so much he embraces failure on a daily basis. He has held multiple roles in technology where he learned the hard way to craft flexible designs, write clean code, reduce risk through automated testing, monitor and automate everything. He dislikes Marketecture, armchair architects, and seagull managers. David is presently enjoying failures and successes as a Vice President of Software Engineering at Optum, a UnitedHealth Group company. David has a BA in Philosophy from the University of Southern California (failed to launch that career) and a MS in Software Engineering from University of Minnesota (yay for success!). \n\nHeather Mickman is VP Platform Engineering + Practices at Optum. Throughout her career, she has built APIs to unlock enterprise data, created awesome platforms, led Ops organizations, and built supply chain software for Fortune 50 companies. Heather has a passion for technology, building high performing teams, driving a culture of innovation, and having fun along the way. \n\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
