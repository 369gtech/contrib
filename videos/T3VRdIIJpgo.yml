description: "Learn Live: Foundations of Data Science for Machine Learning - Select and customize architectures and hyperparameters using random forest: October 26 – Episode 07\n\nJoin the chat and ask questions live at https://aka.ms/LearnLiveTV\n\nStarting Tuesday, September 14, 2021 (PST), join Jason DeBoever and Glenn Stephens live on Learn TV and explore this nine-part “Foundations of data science for machine learning” series. Each week, we will be walking through Learn modules and answering your questions live. From basic classical machine learning models to exploratory data analysis and customizing architectures, you’ll be guided by easy to digest conceptual content and interactive Jupyter notebooks and will learn about the underlying concepts as well as how to get into building models with the most common machine learning tools.\n\nOctober 26 - Episode 7:\nFollow along and complete the free, hands-on Microsoft Learn modules at https://aka.ms/LearnML-Architectures\n\nMore complex models often can be manually customized to improve how effective they are. Through exercises and explanatory content, we explore how altering the architecture of more complex models can bring about more effective results. In this episode, you will:\n\n- Discover new model types– decision trees and random forests.\n- Learn how model architecture can affect performance.\n- Practice working with hyperparameters to improve training effectiveness.\n\nMiss an episode?
