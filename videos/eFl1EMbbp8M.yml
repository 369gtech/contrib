title: 'Become an SVG Architect, not a PowerPoint Architect! - Filip van Laenen'

recordingDate: 1499244159
description: "So you finally made it into being an architect, but you find yourself becoming one of those dreaded PowerPoint architects. What can you do to avoid that? Simple: become an SVG architect!\n\nSVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an open format and part of HTML5. Therefore, nobody has an excuse to tell you they can't view your diagrams. But working with SVG is fun, not in the least because it's still a little bit technical. If you want to, you can actually dive into the XML source file and fix things there.\n\nBut SVG offers you also a lot more possibilities than a traditional drawing tool will give you. There are e.g. open libraries on the Internet where you can find all sorts of shapes, icons and maps. But maybe most important: it's easy to create your own color palette and add your own style to a drawing, so that it doesn't look so “PowerPointy”."
