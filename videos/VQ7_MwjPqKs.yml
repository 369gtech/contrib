language: English
recordingDate: 1421673887
description: "SVG is weird. It looks somehow familiar and can be handled similarly but it has its distinct differences and purpose from the technologies you know, like HTML and CSS. In this talk I want to share my experiences getting started, embedding and using SVG in modern web applications.\n\nSeb is a frontend fanatic hailing from Belgium. He now lives in Singapore where he helps startups build browser-whipping web apps at Cofounders.sg and hosts the Front End Developers Singapore (FEDS) meetup.\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Bridging Design and Implementation. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 19 November 2014.\n\nSource: http://2014.cssconf.asia/#speakers\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/sebdeckers/svg-reality\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
