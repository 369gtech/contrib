description: "Emily Cole, Agari Data, Inc.\n\nAbstract: \nOperations teams and Security teams don't always get along, and Security teams have a reputation for being grumpy and saying \"no\" a lot. However, there are a few simple things you can do (or may already be doing) that will make your job easier, and make your Security team less grumpy. In this session, you will get examples of security best practices as well as tips from someone who has worked in both Ops and Security.\n\n\nEmily is currently a Senior Security Engineer for Agari Data, Inc., and spends a lot of time thinking about the ways that DevOps and Security intersect. Emily has performed critical organizational roles of security research, incident response, product security, devops engineer, system administrator, tech support, security expert, operations specialist, and project lead. Emily specializes in Unix security and is a co-author of a book on Solaris Security for the SANS Institute, and serves as a Mentor for SANS' CyberTalent Immersion Academy for Women. She currently holds GSEC, GCED, GPPA, GCIH, and ITIL certifications, and is a Certified Scrum Master.\n\nFollow: \n@unixgeekem"
