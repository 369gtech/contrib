OSGI can still help us, developers?\n\nIn my presentation I will detail when and why microkernel architecture is useful, how Java 9 and OSGI satisfy those scenarios by comparing their impact on: incremental change, testing, appropriate coupling.\n\nAna-maria Mihalceanu\nAna-Maria MihÄƒlceanu is a custom application development enthusiast, Trailhead Ranger and a constant adopter of challenging technical scenarios. Some of her older experiments are available on Dzone. In 2016, as tech passionate for cloud application development she achieved IBM Certified Application Developer - Cloud Platform v1. Since then, she has enriched her cloud expertise by learning and certifying as a Salesforce Developer and attained a better understanding on how to integrate different types of cloud offerings. As a result, she would like to share with the audience one of her recent experiments. Other passions? The knowledge hunt through reading and growing fashion skills through shopping."
