recordingDate: 1612094522
description: "Lana Brindley (she/her)\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/43/\n\nOne thing the pandemic has forced many of us to do is to take a step back. To just stop for a moment and think about where we are. And while you are taking stock of your personal life, let me talk you through taking stock of your professional life, or at least the bits of it you have managed to document. In the hustle of the beforetimes, documentation was often a forgotten or sidelined thing that you could do roughly now, fix later, or just never quite get around to. Take a deep breath, look around your home office, give the dog a pat, and let's work out what you have, what you need, and how you can open a can of Marie Kondo on all of it.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 25 16:40:00 2021 at Pia Andrews Conservatory"
