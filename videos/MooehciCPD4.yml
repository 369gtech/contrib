description: "Creating a Distributed Round Robin Scheduler with Etcd\n\nEric Chlebek, Sensu, Inc.\n\nJoin me on a journey through creating a distributed round-robin scheduler, using etcd as the persistency and consensus mechanism! As a software developer, this turned out to be one of the more challenging projects I've worked on. I'm excited to share the trials and tribulations of this work with you, as well as what I learned along the way.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
