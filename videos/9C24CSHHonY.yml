description: "KEPs: Evolving Kubernetes at the Speed of Trust - Caleb Miles, Google \n\nWhat is Kubernetes? Every now and again we try to enumerate the scope of the Kubernetes Project; but this only represents a snapshot of our best understanding of the value that Kubernetes provides to our community. With the Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) Process we have been working on a mechanism to evolve Kubernetes at the Speed of Trust™. Learn what the KEP process is, how to use it, how it connects to the API Review Process and Enhancement Tracking processes; and how we are employing KEPs to solve our own ship of Theseus problem. ¡Todos a bordo! \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZJ"
