description: "Speaker: Niko Köbler (@dasniko)\r\n\r\nToday, containers are a common thing and something like an \"industry standard\". Serverless is the direct competitor and everybody talks about \"Cloud Native“. Is Serverless the next step in evolution of containers and will it replace them in the (near) future? And how does Cloud Native fit into the Serverless context?\r\nThere is also wide range of container-based frameworks which call themselves „Serverless\". Are they really server-less, or don't I have to run an entire server farm for it?\r\nLet’s have a controversial discussion - perhaps we will find some similarities, perhaps not. It's not really about which technology is \"better\". Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, and you have to know them in order to be able to use them effectively!\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/256557840/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/mbIR/"
