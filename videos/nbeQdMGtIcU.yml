Smaller bundles, faster compilations, better debugging, dynamic loading of module and components and the ability to change components through Higher order components.\n\nAfter a long time of waiting, it’s finally coming for real — Ivy is HERE!\n\nIn this talk, Eliran will demonstrate why Angular Ivy is truly a game changer, what's the benefits of it, how it makes Angular much more dynamic and breaks the concept of NgModules. We will understand how we can leverage the Ivy renderer to create higher order components (HOC), what is incremental DOM and how to import non-routable components dynamically to make our application much faster and much flexible."
