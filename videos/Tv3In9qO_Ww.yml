description: 'Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, empathetic computing, affective computing are all the rage now. These are just the latest computing dynamics born from cybernetics, fuzzy logic, expert systems, evolutionary computation, and dynamic programming. While there have been some theoretical advances recently what''s really leading to substantial adoption is that Node.Js, flask/Jupyter, GPU, cloud computing, and things like TensorFlow have made dynamic, complex computation available to all types and experiences of developers. It turns out, like with most of nature, the more efficient and available a resource is the more it can be adopted and integrated into the ecosystems. In the case of AI, the fact that advanced modeling and model serving can happen directly in JavaScript is a leading rapid growth. JavaScript is often decried as the language that just doesn''t have the right stuff for the job... whether that was in the early days of the web or the initial confusions of Web 2.0/ajax days or with the smartphone app take over. The thing is... JavaScript not only never really gave into that reputation it continues to be the one language and the one community and the one ecosystem that has survived and thrived through every technical change over in the last 25 years. JavaScript does this because like widespread natural languages it can absorb any style or concept you throw at it... JavaScript isn''t just the thing we have to do because it''s everywhere JavaScript is the reason things get everywhere. (see history of ThreeJS, HTML5 apps, WPAs, responsive web, etc etc) And so... this is now true of AI. For AI to really go big, everywhere, on every computing surface it required JavaScript. A language and community capable of the flexibility and speed to figure out where and how and why things work the way they work. JavaScript''s expressiveness and interactivity with the programmer + all devices ensures that AI ideas can be fully integrated. A big claim comes next... General AI will only come about and be generally available to all computers and humans BECAUSE of JavaScript. That JavaScript is so widely deployed, is 100% inspectable, has trillions of running systems on the open web, and is understandable by humans and devices is the only possible fabric of General AI. JavaScript is truly the way humans computer murmurate into collective intelligent behavior. But like everything... don''t take an abstract''s word for the truth... let''s compute our way to this truth.'
