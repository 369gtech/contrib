description: 'Since AWS launched Lambda in 2014, the term “serverless” has been used (and misused) to describe compute models, technologies, architectural patterns, operational constructs, and even rebranded cgi-bins. The term is now used so broadly that it’s turning into a buzzword with no discernible meaning.'
