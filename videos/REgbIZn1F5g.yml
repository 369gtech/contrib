description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeaker: Jeffery Sologov\nRelying on network reliability and topology are just a few mistakes most engineers make. Common fallacies of distributed computing are one of the most important factors that engineers need to keep in mind when building enterprise software. We will cover each fallacy while showing mistakes most engineers make.\n\nWe will then cover what coupling truly means and how to tell whether your current project is heading the wrong way.\n\nFinally, we will apply aspects of object orientation that held up to this day and learn how to apply them to the new age architectures.\n\nDon't learn from your mistakes, learn from others and come away with techniques that you can apply to your current project right away.\n\nThis is the session that I wish I attended when I was a young lad."
