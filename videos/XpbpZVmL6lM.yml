description: "Byte-sized talks from CERN engineers\nThe CERN IT infrastructure consists of more than 40000 Puppet-managed virtual and physical machines located in two data centres. All the Puppet catalogs are served by a shared pool of almost 200 Puppet Servers regardless of the organisational unit from which the requests come. This deployment might lead to security risks as the number of nodes and personnel writing Puppet code increases.\n\nThe Configuration Team, as part of the IT department at CERN, is exploring ways to configure a multi-tenancy enabled Puppet Server deployment minimising the performance impact for users and the resource usage.\n\nThis talk will go over the different alternatives the team has considered and the results obtained so far."
