description: "From the 2014 Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City, Ron Kasabian's keynote, \"Accelerating Parkinson’s Research with Big Data Technologies.\"\n\nNew drug development can take anywhere from 15-30 years and cost over $1B from the start of basic research through the end of clinical trials. With an annual expenditure of $100B per year on research and an average success rate of only 1 out of 12 new treatments reaching end patients, substantial opportunities exist for improving the efficiency of this process and overall patient care.\n\nThis talk introduces how Intel is working with scientists and physicians to help improve research, treatment, and drug development for Parkinson’s Disease using data science and enabling the Parkinson’s research community to build upon an open platform for big data analytics\n\nThis talk is sponsored by Intel.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop World 2014: http://goo.gl/UUfrR7\nFind out more about the conference: http://strataconf.com/stratany2014\n\nDon't miss an upload!
