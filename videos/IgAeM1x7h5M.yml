title: 'Deconstructing and Evolving REST Security'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540515483
description: "David Blevins, Founder & CEO, Tomitribe\n\nThe learning curve for REST API security is severe and unforgiving. Specifications promise infinite flexibility, habitually give old concepts new names, and almost seem designed to deliberately confuse. With an aggressive distaste for fancy terminology, this session delves into OAuth 2.0 with and without JWT for user identity; AWS-style security for B2B with API keys; and OAuth 2.0 Proof of Possession, which merges both into two-factor bliss. Using a baseline microservice architecture, the presentation compares them, with a heavy focus on the wire, showing actual HTTP messages and analyzing their impact on load and security. Starting with basic authentication and a brief intro to hashing and signing, this is the perfect session to align the whole team."
