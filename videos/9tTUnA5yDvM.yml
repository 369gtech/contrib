title: 'Service Interaction Patterns and Anti patterns by Dmitry Lebedev'
recordingDate: 1492266113
description: "Somehow, there are some important things in service-to-service interactions, which are often missed, when we are building our services in a hurry, but later those aspects may play a significant role in your application performance and stability. How to organize service-to-service calls, how to optimize them, what to do in order to make them fail safe, what to do when a request has failed and etc.\nThis talk is rather a general discussion of available approaches, than a prescription of which library or framework to use, but some Java-related recipes will be given. And as a cherry on top of it all - some real-life war stories."
