description: "Full title of the presentation: \"How to startup in healthcare, do something useful and not to crash down\"\n\nThis talk is about success factors in healthcare for a business: not primarily in terms of financial success but on healthcare impact. Given the high rate of startups failures, traditional thinking on setting up a business in healthcare is clearly not working. Despite widely proliferating fashionable incubator programmes. While healthcare is not rocket science.....no it is more complex. I will explain why healthcare is different than any other economic sector, why business models are mostly multi-sided and that business success is not the same as creating value for healthcare and patients. This talk will provide the context and some directions to navigate successfully as a startup in healthcare.\n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on Inspire Stage during Infoshare 2019."
