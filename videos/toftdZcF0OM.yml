description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nIstio Beyond Kubernetes - Zack Butcher, Tetrate, Sven Mawson, Google & Pratima Nambiar, Salesforce\n\nIstio can be used to build a service mesh spanning heterogeneous infrastructure. This presentation will describe three use cases that use Istio to power a mesh spanning a variety of infrastructures. We will start by covering two similar examples of Istio spanning kubernetes and VM infra (EKS-EC2 as well as EKS-on-prem), followed by the Salesforce Service Mesh that supports services running on bare metal, VMs and Kubernetes. We'll cover what those deployments achieve, and spend a lot of time describing how they work and the tradeoffs made to enable them."
