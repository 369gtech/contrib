description: "Wouldn't you love to be able to walk into a room and use your phone or voice to turn on your lights. When you are relaxing on the couch listening to music wouldn't it be nice to just talk to your speaker to turn up the volume or change the song. Can you imagine being able to turn on the fan by just saying you are hot. In this talk Java Champion and JavaOne Rockstar Kevin Nilson and his 12 year old son Andy will do a live coding demo of creating a connected home.\n\nKevin works at Google as the lead of the Chromecast Technical Solutions Engineer team.
