title: 'The one with Whitney Lee'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631812796
description: 'Please join Nate Schutta and guest Whitney Lee! Whitney traveled the scenic route but is absolutely chuffed to have found her way to Kubernetes and cloud technologies. She began her professional career as a fine artist before owning her own photography business for over a decade. Then, after a year-long tour playing keys and singing harmonies in the band Mutual Benefit, Whitney went back to school to learn full-stack web development. Shortly after graduation Whitney was employed by IBM as a cloud developer, using none of the skills she had just learned at school. However Whitney quickly developed an insatiable appetite for all things cloud, and a passion for teaching others as she acquired knowledge herself. She has made many light board videos for IBM Cloud, from topics ranging from creating a Pod in Kubernetes, to event-driven architecture, to cloud-native API solutions. At VMware Whitneyâ€™s contagious excitement drives her to continue to explore, collaborate, teach, and play!'
