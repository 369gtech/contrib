description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotjs.io on December 1st in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nWe build web applications and sites for the world, often without realizing how many users we're leaving behind. It's mission critical that we develop with accessibility in mind, to help users with permanent and temporary disabilities lead more independent, productive lives. The good news is that accessibility and JavaScript go hand-in-hand.\n\nMarcy shows you how to diagnose accessibility issues in your app and implement tooling to help you and your users succeed."
