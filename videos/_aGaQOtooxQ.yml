description: "Enabling Innovation in Government with Cloud Foundry - Peter Burkholder, General Services Administration & Bret Mogilevsky, 18F\n\nTwo years ago at this summit the 18F team introduced you to cloud.gov: built for the compliance regime of the U.S. federal government. In this presentation, Peter Burkholder will update you on what we’ve learned while running a shared-service PaaS for government. Back then we had just launched our platform. Since then we’ve cleared the FedRAMP accreditation hurdles, taken on customers, and learned how to convince folks that PaaS is the path for government innovation.\n\nThis talk will show how we customized Cloud Foundry for government, how we added or tailored features to support users’ compliance needs, how our government partners in the UK (https://cloud.service.gov.uk) and Australia (https://cloud.gov.au) have joined the OSS and CF movement, and how cloud.gov has worked with agencies to enable agile development, better security, and greater innovation. Our lessons learned for hacking bureaucracy and advocating change will apply to most large or highly-regulated organizations."
