recordingDate: 1433259644
description: "With NoSQL, NewSQL, and plain old SQL, there are so many tools around that it’s not always clear which to use when. This presentation looks at a series of NoSQL technologies and compares them with traditional SQL technology. It compares real use cases, shows how they are solved with NoSQL options as well as traditional SQL servers, and sees which one wins. It looks at some code and architecture examples that fit a variety of NoSQL techniques and some in which SQL is a better answer. You’ll see some big data problems, little data problems, and a bunch of new and old database technologies to find whatever it takes to solve the problem. By the end of the session, you’ll know more NoSQL, maybe have a few new tricks with SQL, and know how to choose the right tool for the job.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSimon Elliston Ball\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Simon Elliston Ball at https://www.parleys.com/author/simon-elliston-ball-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
