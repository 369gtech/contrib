description: "by Tyler Neely\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.3.401/rust_techniques_sled.webm\n\nsled is an embedded database that takes advantage of modern lock-free indexing and flash-friendly storage. rio is a pure-rust io_uring library unlocking the linux kernel's new asynchronous IO interface. This short talk will cover techniques that have been used to take advantage of modern hardware and kernels while optimizing for long term developer happiness in a complex, correctness-critical Rust codebase.\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 11:30:00"
