description: "Speakers: Matt Ingenthron and Subhashni Balakrishnan, Couchbase\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/full-stack-reactive-nosql-spring-data-and-couchbase\nAbstract: While Spring Framework 4.0 includes limited support for reactive programming, Spring Framework 5.0 emphasizes reactive architecturesâ€”it's time to learn how to take this full stack! From inception, Couchbase has been designed for event oriented programming. Currently Spring Data Couchbase builds on its reactive programming using RxJava 1.x while project Reactor is coming to Spring Framework 5.0\n\nAs a developer you can powerfully build Spring Framework apps and microservices with Spring Data Couchbase since the implementation behind the API is scalable and efficient. Spring Data Couchbase also allows you to dive down to the native reactive interfaces when you want to optimize the last mile. Being reactive-ready, Couchbase fully embraces reactive support in Spring Framework 5.0, providing a repository with reactor types.\n\nIn this session, Matt Ingenthron of Couchbase will first review the capabilities of Spring Data Couchbase showing how the implementation makes it easy to leverage a reactive core for your apps. Then Matt will demonstrate how you can directly work with Couchbase's reactive interface in apps built on Spring Framework 4.0 and give you a sense of how Couchbase plans to go even further with Spring Framework 5.0's reactive interfaces."
