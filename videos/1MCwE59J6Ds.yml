description: "DevOps Will Fail.. Unless! How the Simulations will help!\n\nJan Schilt, Founder, GamingWorks\n\nThis presentation will explore how the business simulation game “The Phoenix Project” based on the book of the same name can greatly improve the success of your DevOps investment. As case studies reveal there are enormous benefits to be realized by adopting DevOps, however industry trends reveal that many will fail as a result of ‘Cultural and behavioral’ issues and failing to adequately address organizational change. We have seen with ITIL how many organizations failed to gain the promised benefits because they could not translate the theory into practice and the belief that a tool would solve all their issues. Let us not make the same mistakes with DevOps. In this presentation we will show you how a business simulation can increase the velocity of your adoption, create buy-in, improve communication and collaboration skills between Dev and Ops, and capture concrete, shared, improvement actions aimed at creating success.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
