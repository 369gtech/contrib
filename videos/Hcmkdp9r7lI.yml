title: 'GeeCON 2019: Lieven Doclo - Automating your development experience with Atomist'
recordingDate: 1563984049
description: 'Developers don’t get paid to write code. Instead, we''re expected to deliver working software in production. How does your team turn source code into running software? And how do you make sure it stays working in all environments, including production? Atomist expands the range of development automation past what most of us have currently seen. How quickly can we get from an idea to deployment? Well, give me ten minutes and a few button clicks. ''But my deployment process is unique!'' No problem, we can solve this, in code, in TypeScript! How about having production or deploys through a single click? Build failed? Here’s a message in Slack with a detail on what wet wrong. Or how about autoformatting your code so that you''ll never forget. Atomist like adding a team member who to do the stuff we wanted to automate ages ago. Let’s scale up ourselves, with Atomist.'
