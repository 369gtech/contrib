Even when working with a new codebase insights on how the application is built, which asynchronous calls are being used or how often. In this talk I want to introduce \"instrument\", a tool I've created for this which is also Open Source.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nAWS Amplify → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nRetool → https://retool.com/\nEpsagon → https://epsagon.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nG2i → https://www.g2i.co/ \n\nSilver Sponsors\nAppSignal → https://appsignal.com/\nSailscasts → https://sailscasts.com/\n\nDiversity Sponsor\nPrisma → https://www.prisma.io/"
