description: "Presenter: Davis W. Frank\nSlides: https://github.com/infews/2013.09.05.GettingAgileWithPivotalTracker\n\"Agile Software Development\" is an ambiguous term. It's an umbrella term. It's a controversial term. But what does it really mean? The first principle of agile development is to keep feedback loops small to allow a team to make frequent, small corrections on the way to delivery. \n\nPivotal Labs practices this every day, coaching our clients on how to re-view their problems and approach from first principles. We wrote Pivotal Tracker - the Agile project management app - to work the way we think. \n\nCome learn about tight feedback loops, how to use them in software, and how Pivotal Tracker can keep your backlog sane."
