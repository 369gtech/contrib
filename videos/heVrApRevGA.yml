description: "Diverse teams perform better - fact!\n\nBut how can you attract more diverse talent to your tech team?\n\nOne element of the 'diversity thing’ is gender, and it’s something we’ve been working hard at for many years at Code First: Girls. In that time, we’ve run free coding courses for young women interested in tech, fintech mentoring programmes with senior female executives, and even run tailor-made, all-female, 3-months’ boot camps turning non-tech women into junior developers.\n\nThrough these activities we’ve learned a lot and in this short session we’ll share our experiences. Hopefully you’ll take something from our learnings that will help make your workplace a more diverse and better performing space."
