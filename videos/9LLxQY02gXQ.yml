description: "You should spend your time using the powerful Apache Flink ecosystem to get value from your data, not on your data processing infrastructure. Cloud environments can help you with this problem by providing managed services and infrastructure. Since Google Cloud Dataproc, Google's managed service to power the Apache big data ecosystem, runs Flink, you can easily combine the benefits of cloud with your Flink data pipelines. With new support for Flink and long-running streaming jobs, we will show you how you can set up a cluster and a streaming job in less than three minutes.\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://BashFilms.com"
