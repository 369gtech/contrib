description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nIn the past 6 years ChaiScript's performance has been improved by nearly 100x. This was not accomplished by adding a virtual machine or performing dynamic recompilation. Instead, these increases have been accomplished by moving to more simple, cleaner, idiomatic C++ and by following some simple rules. We will outline these concepts with examples for how they both simplified code while improving performance. \n— \nJason Turner\nDeveloper, Trainer, Speaker\nHost of C++Weekly https://www.youtube.com/c/JasonTurner-lefticus, Co-host of CppCast http://cppcast.com, Co-creator and maintainer of the embedded scripting language for C++, ChaiScript http://chaiscript.com, and author and curator of the forkable coding standards document http://cppbestpractices.com.
