description: "Lambdas. All the cool kid languages have them. But does 'lambda' mean what C#, Java, Python, C++, etc. mean by 'lambda'? Where did lambdas come from? What were they originally for? What is their relationship to data abstraction?\n\nIn this session we will into the history, the syntax and the uses of lambdas and the way in which lambda constructs in various languages do (or do not) match the original construct introduced in lambda calculus.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
