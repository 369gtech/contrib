description: "A Google TechTalk, 2019/10/10, presented by Aboubakar Mountapmbeme.\nABSTRACT: Block coding is an effective way to expose students to CS concepts, but the visual nature of blocks also creates hurdles in making them accessible to all students. Aboubakar talks through some of the challenges in adding keyboard based accessibility to Blockly and work on solving those challenges.\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PcFbrhdoXozbfCADUAttg7tp63ok5H8f/view\n\nMore about the Summit: https://sites.google.com/corp/view/blockly-user-summit-2019/agenda\n\nAbout the speaker: Aboubakar Mountapmbeme is currently pursuing his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of North Texas, where he is being supervised by Dr. Stephanie Ludi.
