Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSIG Multicluster Intro - Paul Morie, Red Hat & Jeremy Olmsted-Thompson, Google\n\nSIG-Multicluster is focused on solving common challenges related to the management of many Kubernetes clusters, across multiple cloud providers (so-called hybrid cloud) and applications deployed across many clusters. In the introduction, we'll give attendees an overview of the current status of the multi-cluster problem space in Kubernetes and of the SIG. We’ll discuss current thinking around best practices for multi-cluster deployments and what it means to be part of a ClusterSet. Then we’ll highlight current SIG projects, focused use cases, and ideas for what’s next. Most importantly, we’ll provide information on how you can get involved either as a contributor or as a user who wants to provide feedback about the SIG's current efforts and future direction. Bring your questions, problems, and ideas - help us expand the multi-cluster Kubernetes landscape."
