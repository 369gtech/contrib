title: 'From Zero to A11Y: Building an Accessibility Culture'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601026558
description: "It can be a daunting task to begin building a culture of accessibility. But considering that one in four U.S. adults has a disability that impacts major life activities, organizations must prioritize accessibility to reach more customers and retain talent. As more elements of daily life move online—from shopping, to working, to socializing—ensuring equal access for everyone is even more crucial. The question is: What to do first? \n\nIn this talk, we’ll cover the incremental changes we’re making to ensure accessibility and inclusive design are an integral part of our processes, from product planning to QA, and everything in between. How can a group of Accessibility Champions help disseminate knowledge throughout your engineering org? How do you revamp an existing application to become accessible? Attendees will leave with insight on navigating roadblocks along with a framework and concrete examples to bring to their organizations to shape their own accessibility culture.\n\nAyesha Mazumdar, Senior UX Engineer at Optimizely\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/from-zero-to-a11y-building-an-accessibility-culture"
