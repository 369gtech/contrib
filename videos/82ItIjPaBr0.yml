description: "Transparency is one of the three core pillars of Scrum. It's meant to underpin every implementation of this process but what does this actually mean in day-to-day practice? In this lightning talk, Stephen looks at the value of being transparent within any methodology but also cites practical examples where a commitment to transparency has dramatically changed the projects he's managed. In particular he'll be focusing on:\n\nTransparency with your client\nTransparency with your team\nBeing Transparent with yourself\nExpect a high-energy, concise talk with practical take-aways that you'll be able to immediately implement in your own projects.\n\nAbout Stephen Thomas\nStephen is a Senior Digital Project Manager and Certified Scrum Professional at Valtech Copenhagen. He's managed a wide variety digital projects since 2004: from e-learning projects, to mobile and web apps, to large-scale CMS implementations. He's used both Agile and Waterfall methodologies but having played contract PM for a number of years, he also knows the challenge of getting projects completed in chaotic and atypical situations.\n\nHe’s previously spoken at DPM:UK 15, DPM Summit 2016 and the DPL Forum in Stockholm. He's also been a driving force behind organising local community meet-ups and conferences."
