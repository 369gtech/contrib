All these automatically generated REST controllers, simple user interface with entity lists and create/edit forms... However, sometimes it's too hard to describe the project's logic with only 4 verbs. Create/edit forms might be too complex. Actions described with natural non-CRUD verbs can dramatically decrease the complexity of code and UI for some projects."
