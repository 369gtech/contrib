description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nFeb. 13, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Dr. James Grossnickle\r\n\r\nNuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun, can also be harnessed for power on Earth. Present research in magnetic confinement fusion is promising and advancing. ITER (international thermonuclear experimental reactor), based on the tokamak configuration, has been sited and will begin construction soon. An alternate approach to a tokamak is being studied at the University of Washington, based on the Field Reversed Configuration (FRC). The FRC has a much simpler, linear geometry, as opposed to the toroidal structure of the tokamak, and extremely high b (the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure) which gives it tremendous advantages in size and cost, and also allows the potential to burn advanced fuels, and to be used in space applications.\r\n \r\nSpeaker: Dr. James Grossnickle, Research Scientist, Dept. Aeronautics & Astronautics, University of Washington."
