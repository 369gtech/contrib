description: "Cascading failures are all too common when your software is running alongside other software in your production environment. Wouldn’t it be great if you could isolate your software from other software’s issues? Wouldn’t it be great if you could keep your own problems local and not cause problems for other software running in the same environment? Wouldn’t it be great if your app stayed up while others are down?\n\nIn this session, you'll learn how to do just that. We’ll write a Spring Boot app and use modern patterns like bulkheads, rate limiters, circuit breakers, response caching, and timeout handling using the Resilience4j library. The end result will be a robust and resilient app that can handle unexpected situations and loads, as well as degrade gracefully and return to normal operation automatically.\n\nSpeaker: David Caron, Platform Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/building-robust-and-resilient-apps-using-spring-boot-and-resilience4j"
