recordingDate: 1627025395
description: "## From a cumbersome necessity to an optimised tool that gives your company the edge\n\nYou’re receiving great CV’s, how do you maximise the positive impact on your business?\n\n- Reduce time cost of candidate review and interview\n- Reduce candidate dropouts\n- Reduce time to hire\n- Improve offer acceptance rates\n- Reduce the risk of counteroffers\n- Turn the best candidates in to employees!\n\nGetting good candidates to apply is hard enough, and when those candidates don’t accept your offers you end up worse off than if they never applied in the first place.\n\nThis talk will help you improve your own processes to ensure that your hiring process puts you one step ahead of the competition.\n\nWhat this talk is NOT! - This is NOT a talk on how to candidate attraction, or existing employee retention. They are talks for another day!"
