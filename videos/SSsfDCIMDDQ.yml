description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nStone Bank: how a team of initially 5 developers created one of the first open banks in Brasil\nby \nVictor Nascimento\n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk is a recollection of challenges we had while bringing up an Open Bank API from zero with Elixir at Stone. Although the ecosystem is quite mature, integrating with very old systems that have non-standard practices brought us some common problems. Also, for a team new to the BEAM at first, there were other challenges like deployment practices, architectural choices, BEAM culture in general, human resources and so on. It all pays off in the end for us and we hope this sharing of experience might help others decide to participate in the ecosystem.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Victor Nascimento\n\nVictor is currently a technical leader of the Stone OpenBanking solution and a BEAM admirer since OTP 13 (before Elixir). Author of some widely used Elixir libraries like Joken, Joken JWKS and JUnit Formatter he is also passionate about Emacs and is one of the maintainers of elixir-mode. With a Philosophy major he usually attracts political and ethical discussions which is a curse and a pleasure at the same time. Other than family, music, skating, dogs, philosophy, programming and beer hunting he does nothing at all.\n---\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: https://www.elixirconf.eu/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU"
