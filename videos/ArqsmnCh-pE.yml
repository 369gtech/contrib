We call them actionable errors!\n\nIn this talk, we'll take a deep dive into what actionable errors are, and how they are dispatched through the Rails application errors handling mechanism.\n\nWe'll also write a small Rails plugin and use actionable errors to guide our users with better errors, and actions to resolve them. We'll learn how to define custom actionable errors and strategies around when and how to raise them to help our users to set up the plugin from the comfort of the error pages."
