description: "C++ for (Java) Programmers\nBjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, once said : “C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.” He has also said : “Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out.” Both are true. C++ provides powerful capabilities that should be used with extreme caution. However, when starting to code C++ it’s often non-obvious which constructs are safe and which are dangerous.\nThis talk is for programmers wishing to feel more comfortable navigating the C++ landscape. We will explore the programming culture that has developed around the C++ language. Specifically, we will look at programming patterns that navigate around or through some of the dangerous parts of the C++ language. The goal is to build a set of programming practices based in the “smaller and cleaner language” inside C++. And by doing so, we will also build an awareness around code constructs that can potentially “blows your whole leg off”.\n\nSpeaker: Patricia Aas"
