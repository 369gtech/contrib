title: '(Don’t) Blame it on React Native - Ofir Dagan'
recordingDate: 1546502402
description: "When writing large scale react native app it’s always fun to blame RN for everything that is wrong in our lives. However, what we keep finding, again and again, is that in most cases, writing better performant react code, can fix our performance issues. In the last couple of years our team built a huge production app in react native. In this talk, Ofir goes over some of the lessons him and his team learned, in regards of react native performance and how to improve your app’s performance subsequently.\n\nOfir is an R&D manager at Wix Engineering. In the last few years he has worked a lot with react and angular, and developed Wix's dashboard from scratch. Over the last two years, Ofir has been leading the Wix CRM Mobile team, writing Wix’s mobile app in react native and is now leading the Wix Chat group. He is also a mentor at Wix Academy and loves speaking about software in all of its forms.\n\nThis talk is part of a series of meetups, for more info:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/React-Native-TLV/"
