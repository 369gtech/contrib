description: "In this tutorial we will be building a responsive mobile first contact form using HTML and CSS. We will use CSS3 styling along with a bit of Grid CSS layout. Well also throw in some icons from font awesome and a simple entry animation using animate.css. This will be the front-end UI. We will implement the back end to capture the data in a later video.\n\nPART 2 - IMPLEMENTING FIREBASE!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP4Tr0l08NE\n\nCODE: Code for this project\nhttp://www.traversymedia.com/downloads/responsiveform.zip\n\nBECOME A PATRON: Show support & get perks!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/traversymedia\n\nONE TIME DONATIONS:\nhttp://www.paypal.me/traversymedia\n\nFOLLOW TRAVERSY MEDIA:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/traversymedia\nhttp://www.twitter.com/traversymedia\nhttp://www.instagram.com/traversymedia"
