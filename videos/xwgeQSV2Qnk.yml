description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nCNCF's Serverless WG - Tell Me Where it Hurts - Doug Davis, IBM, Mark Peek, VMware, & Ruben Romero Montes, Red Hat  \n\nIn this session the CNCF Serverless Working Group will provide an update to the community on the state of Serverless since we produced our whitepaper and landscape document over a year ago. We'll overview what's changed in the community and what the new, and exciting, developments are - such as new open source projects and trends. Then we'll turn this into a BoF session where we'd like to hear from the community about where they would like the CNCF, and our WG, to go: e.g. what are the pain points people are seeing with respect to interoperability and portability of their Serverless workloads. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uak7"
