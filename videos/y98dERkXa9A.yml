description: "Speaker: Jason Chionh\n\nIn this short talk, we'll go through the command \"git rebase -i\". This is git rebasing in interactive mode. You can use it to organize local commit history. Specifically, we'll look at squashing many commits into one commit and re-ordering commits.\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCiZ/"
