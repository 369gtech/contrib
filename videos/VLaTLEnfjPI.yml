description: "Most off-the shelf home automation systems rely on cloud services, and are limited to simple rules like \"turn on this light when there is motion\". It's extremely limiting, and usually results in failures in more complicated settings like when multiple people live at a house, or if you don't have a regular 9-5 schedule. These cloud-enabled devices also fail when your internet connection is down. In this talk we'll look at how to set up a home automation system that runs entirely locally, and takes into account additional context-aware inputs so that you don't accidentally turn on the lights in the middle of the night.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
