description: 'Test-Driven Development (TDD) lets our code develop out of our tests.  But this doesn''t mean that we turn off our brain. We still need to make decisions on our design as we write our tests. In this video, we''ll take some "bigger steps" with TDD to implement the rules for Conway''s Game of Life. Along the way, we''ll see the types of design decisions we need to keep in mind. For code downloads and additional articles, visit http://www.jeremybytes.com/Downloads.aspx#ConwayTDD'
