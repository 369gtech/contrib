title: 'CON3234   High Performance Java EE with JCache and CDI'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450301991
description: "Do you need more performance from your Java EE applications? Is latency causing you stress? If so, take a look at JCache, the Java caching API. This code-driven session demonstrates how to integrate JCache into your Java EE applications, using CDI. JCache (JSR 107), the new standard API for cache access, comes with a full set of CDI annotations. Adding a single annotation to a method can achieve an orders-of-magnitude speed improvement in applications with high latency. The session gives you an introduction to how to use these standard annotations in your Java EE applications, when to use which annotations, and what is automagically happening under the covers. You will leave inspired to add 12 characters to your code.\n\nSpeakers:\nJaromir Hamala, Developer, Hazelcast\nI'm a developer at Hazelcast. I wrote my first line of code when I was 7 years old. Since than I was always interested in \"How this system works under the hood?\" I like pushing systems towards limits, brushing my skills by exploring HotSpot source code, contributing to open source projects and arguing about development over a pint of beer.\n\nSteve Millidge, Founder Payara, C2B2 CONSULTING LIMITED\nSteve is the Founder and Director of Payara and C2B2 Consulting.
