description: "MongoDB is popular choise for data persistence which had no support for ACID transactions up until v4. Even having such support, transactions incurs higher performance cost and can lead to deadlocks.\n\nIn this talk I will explain challenges of achieving data consistency in systems that does not support AÐ¡ID transactions, how to communicate state changes in a reliable manner and the approach to ensure eventual consistency of data with examples in C#."
