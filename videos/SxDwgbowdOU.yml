description: "by: Glenn Vanderburg\n\nSoftware engineering as itâ€™s taught in universities simply doesnâ€™t work. It doesnâ€™t produce software systems of high quality, and it doesnâ€™t produce them for low cost. Sometimes, even when practiced rigorously, it doesnâ€™t produce systems at all.\n\nThatâ€™s odd, because in every other field, the term â€œengineeringâ€? is reserved for methods that work.\n\nWhat then, does real software engineering look like? How can we consistently deliver high-quality systems to our customers and employers in a timely fashion and for a reasonable cost? In this session, weâ€™ll discuss where software engineering went wrong, and build the case that disciplined Agile methods, far from being â€œanti-engineeringâ€? (as they are often described), actually represent the best of engineering principles applied to the task of software development."
