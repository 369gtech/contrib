description: 'Story of how a small company in Azerbaijan used ClojureScript + React Native to launch iOS/Android apps to its one million website users. I will go through how we were able to quickly develop and iterate both iOS and Android versions at the same time, how we connected existing Rails app to provide a Transit API, and how we use CodePush to provide over-the-air updates without going through app stores.'
