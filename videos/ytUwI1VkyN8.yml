Without a proper functioning community, the project is bound to have a heart attack, which could be the end: Think of unsatisfied users, project forks, maintainer burnouts, or very annoying arguments.\n\nBuilding a community can be a daunting task but it doesn't have to be. All it takes is a critical mass of people who have a long-term interest in growing the community. Be it companies or individuals.\n\nAs it turns out, this group can systematically foster the community by building a framework for community interaction: writing down guidelines, helping users, onboarding new contributors, etc. The next step is to break out of the daily business through organizing conferences, meetups, or regular face-to-face meetings. Ultimately, the community is held together by relationships which are best strengthened via face time.\n\nIn the past years, I've seen two different communities grow: Apache Flink and Apache Beam. Both have found a way to grow their community. I'd like to present and analyze the paths they chose to build the strong communities they have today.\n\n\n###\n\nFollow us on Social Media and join the Community!\nTwitter: twitter.com/fossbckstg\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/plainschw...\nSlack: https://20.foss-backstage.de/network-...\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8653059/\n\nFOSS Backstage is an event by Plain Schwarz â€“ https://plainschwarz.com"
