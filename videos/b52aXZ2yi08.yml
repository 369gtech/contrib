description: "Pre Google Test Automation Conference 2010\nOctober 27th, 2010\n\nTools for Continuous Integration at Google Scale\nPresented by Nathan York.\n\nAbstract:\nSoftware engineers rarely invoke compilers and lower-level tools directly. Instead they interact with a build system which analyzes dependency information and then orchestrates the overall build process. Yet build systems are often overlooked by industry and academia. This presents a challenge for large organizations as their code base grows and engineering processes struggle to keep up. This talk covers the key insights and technical design elements that enable us to scale the word's largest continuously integrated code base to thousands of engineers worldwide.\n\nSpeaker Bio: \nNathan refers to himself as \"a tools guy\". He worked on IDEs and developer tools at Borland before joining Google 6 years ago. During this time he has been involved in transforming Google's tools and development process to scale with Google's rapid growth. He strongly believes that great engineering tools and process are one of the key elements required for successful software engineering."
