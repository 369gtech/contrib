description: "How to Scale Single-Node Service Brokers with Subway - Justin Carter & Xiujiao Gao, Stark & Wayne\n\nUsing cf-containers broker (packaged in docker-boshrelease) is the fastest and easiest way to get as a service working with Cloud Foundry by leveraging the existing ecosystem of docker based services. It allows you to easliy start and stop docker containers via the Cloud Foundry services api. But bringing up multiple service instances on a single node can quickly lead to a shortage of resource (memory, cpu, disk).\n\nIn this presentation, Justin Carter and Xiujiao Gao will talk about Subway, which is a multiplexing service broker that allows you to scale out single-node brokers. They will demonstrate how to deploy Subway as a proxy to balance incoming requests to multiple backend brokers. This allows horizontal scaling of brokers such as cf-containers-broker that were previously confined to a single node. Subway is OSS project and has been deployed in GE Predix.\n\nAbout Justin Carter\nAs a professional artist Justin Carter has performed as a musician and dancer in many prestigious festivals and venues.
