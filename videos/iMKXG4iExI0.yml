description: '#Codemotion Rome 2017 - There has been a surge in the development of virtual reality applications with the production of easily accessible and sophisticated VR devices such as Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Samsung Gear. Frameworks like A-Frame developed by the MozVR team combined with cheap alternatives such as Google Cardboard allows the developers to leverage the power of the web. The attendees of this talk would learn about the WebVR API, using A-Frame to build virtual worlds, creating virtual worlds for modern content display (such as reddit posts, news feeds, Instagram photos) as well as game development.'
