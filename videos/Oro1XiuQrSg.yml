description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nAnatomy of a Kubernetes Release: Success Through Team and Tools - Sascha Grunert, SUSE & Daniel Mangum, Upbound \n\nAs Kubernetes is one of the biggest open-source projects worldwide, the creation of a new release can be an overwhelming topic. The major burden is not only to release a new version every three months, but also to provide stability and security fixes over the whole support period of a release. In this talk, we will cover the details behind the lifecycle of a Kubernetes release. The presentation will contain everything from assembling the Release Team before the actual cycle begins up to maintaining the release branches, which provide continuous patch releases to the community. The talk will outline the technical process of branch management by covering all of the necessary stages during the release cycle. We will also demonstrate our Release Engineering tooling and dive into the design decisions we’ve made as a group that shape the overall process.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeyQ"
