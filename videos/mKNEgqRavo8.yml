description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nJavaScript Immutability - \"Don't Go Changing\"\n\nMany functional programming languages emphasize the use of immutable data. This makes it easier to reason about the code. Immutability is a builtin feature of some languages, including Clojure, Haskell, and Scala. However, this is not the case for JavaScript. While it is possible to manually achieve immutability in JavaScript without resorting to a library, there are good ones that make this easier and more efficient. This talk discusses several JavaScript libraries for immutability. The primary focus is on the Immutable library from Facebook which provides persistent data structures. These enable efficient creation of new data structures that share memory with others. This library is commonly used in conjuction with the React web framework, but it can be used in any JS application.\n\nMark Volkmann, Object Computing, Inc.\n\nMark Volkmann is a partner at Object Computing, Inc.
