description: "http://www.oscon.com\nNumenta is working on machine intelligence. Our approach is to first understand, in detail, how the neocortex works and then build systems that work on those principles. In the past few years we made good progress on both the theory and implementing the theory in software. The resulting technology is a type of memory system based on sparse representations and distributed sequence memory. Like the brain, systems built on this technology need to be trained on streaming sensory data. The system learns the spatial and temporal structure in sensory data.\n\nWe have applied this technology to a commercial product called Grok. Grok is fed data from sensors, it discovers the structure in the data and uses this to make predictions and detect anomalies. Grok is being applied in diverse industries such as energy pricing, product forecasting, predictive maintenance, and finance.\n\nThe technology we have created represents a new approach to machine learning and we believe it will be the fundamental component of all machine intelligence. We published the details of the theory in a white paper in 2009. There is substantial interest in working with this technology from both academics and technologists. In my talk I will describe our vision for machine intelligence. I will give a brief introduction to the technology. And I will describe why we are creating an open source project.\n\nhttp://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/30583"
