description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nWhat's your attitude towards code review? What is an attitude towards code review in your team or company? \nIs it just an unpleasant duty, that you do because this is so called \"good practice\" and everybody does it? \nOr you feel under your skin that it's valuable, but still this is not what you really like to do and always procrastinate it as much as you can?\nOr maybe you do it on everyday basis, you see how beneficial it is, but you also see some problems like it takes too long, people argue sometimes and you would like to know, what you can do to do code reviews more effectively?\n\nIf you answered “yes” on at least one of the above questions, then I would like to invite you to my talk, where I will show you what the main purpose of a code review really is, how to do it effectively and with more pleasure and how to overcome obstacles you probably encounter during this process."
