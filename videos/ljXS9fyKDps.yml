recordingDate: 1583930247
description: "Edelman's Global Trust Barometer found that 76% of people say that CEOs should take the lead on change. People trust you more than in many other social actors. They expect business leaders to work against discrimination, against the gender pay gap, against climate change, just to name a few.\n\nI invite you to look at one of the greatest assets: trust. Discover what trust means then let’s challenge ourselves about a company’s role considering that these days the global leaders of the most powerful companies try to work with the same topic in the US: moving from looking at shareholders to looking at stakeholders. How can you live up to the colleagues’, and people’s expectations in the age of the coming new phase of capitalism? Come, walk the talk together.\n\nStretch is a non-profit leadership and management conference that brings 500 attendees and 16 speakers from all around the world who want to build effective organizations since 2013. An international platform and community for leaders and managers to share stories, hands-on solutions and explore new trends and ideas to lead, fail, learn and stretch.
