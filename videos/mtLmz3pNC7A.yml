description: "Since the dawn of the Internet and the Web, a broad series of hacking attack vectors have descended. Malicious hackers, researchers, and governments have demonstrated and deployed these attacks onto computers, mobile devices, and nuclear power plants. While we continue to build sophisticated technology to defend against many of these attacks, a new field of exciting research is taking place that uses side channels, physics, and low cost tools to employ powerful attacks against modern technology. We'll explore some of these fascinating, and often secretive, methods and how you can use them or secure against them.\n\nEVENT: AppSecUSA 2016\n\nSPEAKER: Sammy Kamkar\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on OWASP YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYMGAoIx8yk"
