description: "From Hexagonal to Micro Services, from 3 Tier applications to BlockChain, as design patterns and technologies advance, so too must the security recommendations we apply to these systems. What was critical to keep in mind previously may no longer be an issue simply because the constraint that gave rise to it is no longer around. But as we see time and again in software development, sometimes that which is old becomes new again, and so it's equally important that we look over the security patterns we've successfully used in the past and how they are still relevant even though the buzzwords have changed!\n\nSiren Hofvander, Min Doktor\nHave you seen a fire breathing dragon dual wield my little pony figurines? How about an IT Security employee with a burning passion for keeping users say, security fun and accessible? Siren Hofvander delivers on the latter and strives for the former in her daily job as CSO for Min Doktor. She specialises in building security into the SLDC and firmly believes that security is a task for everyone, not just the hacker elite. She also heads up the Malmö based IT Security group SecuriTea and is an avid forum contributor.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
