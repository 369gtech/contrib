Using multiple exposure techniques (or advanced sensors), it is in fact possible to turn this around and capture ten times the range of film, equalling or surpassing the capacity of human vision. Greg will introduce some of the concepts and present a few details of HDR imaging in the context of digital photography, and demonstrate interactive software he has developed to assist in the..."
