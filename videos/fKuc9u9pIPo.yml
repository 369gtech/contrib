description: "Have you ever had an application behave in an unexpected way and wondered what tools there are for diagnosing it? This session covers all the tools that ship with the JDK that can be used to diagnose a wide range of application problems. Among other things, the presentation demonstrates monitoring heap usage, checking for deadlocks, analyzing thread dumps, and looking at heap contents. The session focuses on demos of the tools, offers practical tips, and covers the background and details of the tools’ implementation. The session’s goal is to present an overview of the available tools and what you can use them for.\n\n\nAuthor:\nStaffan Larsen\nStaffan Larsen is currently the technical lead for the Java Serviceability team.
