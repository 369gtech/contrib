language: English
recordingDate: 1532709000
description: "TensorFlow has a component named TensorFlow Object Detection, whose purpose is to train a system capable of recognizing objects in a frame. Usually, this technology is used to detect real-life objects, until I took on the challenge of building a detection system to detect everybody's favorite Pokemon, Pikachu. What is object detection, and how I built my model? That's what this talk is about.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJuan De Dios Sanos Rivera"
