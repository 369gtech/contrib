The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nHow We Migrated Our Monolith to K8s and Became a High Performing Team - Mauricio Salatino, Camunda/LearnK8s & Tracy Miranda, CloudBees \n\nMigrating your existing architecture from a monolith to microservices is a challenging task. Not only the technology landscape is different and overwhelming, but you also need a solid plan to bring the rest of the team along in the journey.  This talk shares our real-life journey and the lessons learned from migrating a monoliths open-source project to microservices while adding in CI/CD best practices. We looked at specific best practices from the Accelerate book and show how those became reality within our team. The focus of this is: - Best practices for refactoring monoliths into microservices - Understanding how you can leverage tools such as Kubernetes, Helm, Jenkins X, and Zeebe to develop cloud-native applications - Pitfalls you should avoid and how you can learn from our mistakes\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zen3"
