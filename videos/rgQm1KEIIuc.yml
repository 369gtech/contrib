description: "Michael Handler,  Alan Green\r\n\r\nApp Engine runs your application at scale, so you can focus on features and not sysadminning. But SOMEONE has to run those computers for you! Come meet them, find out what keeps them up at night, and hear hair-raising Tales of the Unexpected. Plus, a demo of new monitoring options for your application, and a dash of HRD advocacy."
