description: "Write code that withstands the test of time\nApply the benefits of true maintainability to your software\n\nDo you want to write code that stands the test of time? Or do you want to perpetuate the nightmare of difficult-to-change code that many software developers face today? Building Maintainable Software offers a pathway to craftsmanship for those who want to do the right thing. In this video, software virtuoso Željko Obrenović introduces a set of guidelines for creating software that meets the gold standard of true maintainability. Each guideline is reviewed in detail, using real-world examples of code that follow—or don’t follow—these important rules.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the practical benefits of creating maintainable code, see the full-length video training course, Building Maintainable Software, from O'Reilly:\n\nhttp://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048008.do"
