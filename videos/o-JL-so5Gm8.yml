description: "RubyConf 2018 - The Dangers of Tribal Knowledge by Annie Sexton\n\nAre you constantly tapped on the shoulder for answers? Tired of being the Google for your team? Or perhaps you’re the new kid, having to ask a dozen different people to find answers to all your questions? These are the consequences of tribal knowledge. In this talk we’ll discuss how to have a team that self-serves, finds answers on their own, without forcing them to wade through a colossal employee handbook."
