The engines on Project Ara are revved. We're on the road to Puerto Rico. Creating the hardware equivalent of the software app ecosystem sometimes feels a little Dakar Rally, sometimes a little Le Mans. Fast. Difficult. Worth it. Speaking of fast… We'll debut our newest Spotlight Story ‘Fast-and-Furious’ style. Justin Lin’s live action short goes live at I/O. In full 360 with 3D soundsphere. Whaaaat? Exactly. And wearables that we hope will blow your socks off. (We mean this more literally than you might think…) Our goal: break the tension between the ever-shrinking screen sizes necessary to make electronics wearable and our ability to have rich interactions with them. Why can’t you have both? We like to build new things. Sometimes seemingly impossible things. We can build them faster together.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
