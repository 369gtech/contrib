description: "In this session, Sufyaan Kazi and David Pinto will walk attendees through the basics of a Spring Boot application and how Spring Cloud allows you to deploy this app to Cloud Foundry. You will get to run and execute a Spring Boot app on your machine and then push this app to Cloud Foundry to connect to other Microservices.\n\nPre-Requisites:\n-- To view/amend the Spring Boot code you will need an IDE\n-- To push applications to PCF you will need the Cloud Foundry CLI: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli\n-- However, if you prefer just to watch, then there is no need for pre-reqs\n\nSpeakers: Sufyaan Kazi & David Pinto, Pivotal"
