Elixir has excellent support for GraphQL in the form of Absinthe library. Hubert presents how to build and consume GraphQL from Elixir, but also how to think about GraphQL resources in a functional manner.\n\n-- Read the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2NzkRqT\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - HUBERT ŁĘPICKI\nChairman of the Board at AmberBit Sp. z o. o.\n\nHubert has a decade of Ruby experience and has worked with Elixir for the past two years. He is a co-owner of AmberBit, a software development company established in 2008, but he never stopped being primarily a programmer. \n\nHis interest outside of trying out new technologies includes playing retro video games and building LEGO with his daughters, reading sci-fi books and watching cheesy TV series.\n\n-- More on Hubert Łępicki: http://bit.ly/2NzkRqT\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 18\nCode BEAM Lite Berlin 18 was co-organised by Bitcrowd and Code Sync.\n\nBITCROWD\n-- Website: https://bitcrowd.net/\n-- Twitter: https://twitter.com/bitcrowd\n-- Mail: info at bitcrowd.net\n\nCODE SYNC \n-- Website: www.codesync.global\n-- Twitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\n-- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\n-- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\n-- Mail: info at codesync.global\"Code BEAM Lite Berlin 18 was co-organised by Bitcrowd and Code Sync.\n\nBITCROWD\n-- Website: https://bitcrowd.net/\n-- Twitter: https://twitter.com/bitcrowd\n-- Mail: info at bitcrowd.net\n\nCODE SYNC \n-- Website: www.codesync.global\n-- Twitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\n-- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\n-- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\n-- Mail: info at codesync.global\"\n\n#CBLBerlin #Elixir #CodeSync #GraphQL"
