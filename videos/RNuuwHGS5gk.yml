title: 'What To Say When They Tell You Perl Sucks!! (Debunking Perl myths) - Pritesh Ugrankar'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623270568
description: "This talk will be based upon the article I had published on LinkedIn where I had debunked Perl myths with facts. Yes, I will be preaching to choir here, but, I want to take this opportunity as a way to thank the Perl Community  and core Perl developers for all their fantastic work.\n\nAs someone who frequently dabbles with Perl (albeit intermittently), I was totally aghast by the articles and videos on the internet picturing Perl to be\n1) A horrendous language designed to make the life of it's users miserable.\n2) A \"better alternative to shell scripting\"\n3) A dying language that no one should touch with a barge pole.\n4) A weird mix of the 3 options given above.\n\nIn my personal experience, none of the above are true. Perl is a fantastic general purpose language, is far far more powerful than bash/zsh/ etc and is certainly NOT a dying language.\n\nThis is my attempt, as a generic Perl User to debunk these myths."
