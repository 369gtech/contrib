Symptoms included sweaty palms and recurring nightmares with blood-thirsty ASCII symbols. But don't worry, this condition doesn't have to be chronic. A cure is right around the corner.\n\nAs with many developers, you're familiar with the power of regular expressions, but anything beyond the basics scares the crap out of you.
