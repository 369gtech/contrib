description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/going-reactive-building-better-microservices-rob-harrop\n\nReactive provides developers with an elegant model for constructing applications out of communicating components that improves code readability, eases concurrent programming and supports fine-grained unit testing.\n\nIn this talk, we'll see how this model is a natural fit for building resilient microservices. Specifically, we'll see how to:\n\nAbstract the outside world behind Reactive interfaces\nSplit a microserivce into Reactive subsystems\nEase unit testing with Reactive components\nIntroduce concurrency to improve service performance\nUse back-pressure to manage service load and increase resilience\n\nAttendees should be familiar with basic Reactive concepts such as publishers and subscriber but need not have any real-world experience building Reactive systems."
