description: "Electric Imp provides an innovative and powerful service platform that makes it simple to connect devices to the Internet.About a year ago, we migrated a large part of our back-end systems from node.js to Erlang.\n\nThis presentation will give a brief introduction to the Electric Imp architecture, explain why Erlang is such a good fit for the Internet of Things and talk about how using Erlang helps the devops and back-end teams sleep (mostly) soundly at night.\n\nWe might also touch on some of the challenges we've faced in adopting Erlang, which features of Erlang we're yet to adopt, and our thoughts about migrating more of our back-end to Erlang.\n\n\nWho's talking?\n\nRoger Lipscombe was a professional Windows developer for over 18 years. In mid-2013, he decided he was bored with that and started looking around for something else.\n\nThis led him to join Electric Imp, where he is a software developer on the back-end team, almost exclusively using Erlang. He hasn't touched Visual Studio in over a year, and doesn't particularly miss it."
