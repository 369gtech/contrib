description: "How Cloud Foundry Container Runtime (CFCR) tackles Day 1 and Day 2 Operations for Production Kubernetes\n\nCloud Foundry Container Runtime (CFCR), formerly known as Project KUBO is an open source project that delivers the functionality of both Day 1 (deployment) and Day 2 (operations) tasks for Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes on its own does a great job maintaining healthy running workloads. Kubernetes itself is a distributed application, what technologies manages the Kubernetes components then?\n\nIn this Lightning talk, Merlin will provide an overview how how CFCR can provide self-care of Kubernetes' control plane components in concert with BOSH. You will understand cluster scaling, patching and upgrading can be vastly simplified with BOSH. You will see how simple it is to monitor and repair a node or rebuild the entire cluster.\n\nSpeaker:  Merlin Glynn, VMWare\nRecorded At SpringOne Platform 2017."
