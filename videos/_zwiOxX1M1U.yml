description: "You've probably all heard of CSS 3D transforms and seen the basic cube example. However, we can do much better. We can create more complex shapes like Archimedean, Catalan or Johnson solids, add shading to their faces with CSS gradients, move them around with keyframe animations, make them turn into others through various methods like expansion, vertex truncation or simply exploding them into parts which then recombine into something else.\n\nSlides: http://codepen.io/thebabydino/live/08634ee35593c97bd8cfb2ddd9324c24\nMore experiments: http://codepen.io/thebabydino/\nAbout Ana: http://about.me/thebabydino\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
