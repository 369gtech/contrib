language: English
recordingDate: 1478765796
description: "In a lot of developer conferences, there are talks about the technical aspects of the blockchains, how to develop smart contracts on top of Ethereum and things like that. But before looking at those, it is crucial to take a step back and understand what is the blockchain, what it brings to the table and what it will enable in the near future. In this talk, we will come back to the source of this technology and explain why it is likely to change everybody's lives and create a whole new range of opportunities for developers, way beyond the traditional crypto-currency universe, from education to democracy, going through identity and the very notion of work.\n\nSebastien Arbogast started his career as a Java software consultant, with a strong focus on productivity. He was a strong advocate of Model-Driven Architecture before discovering Groovy and Grails. Then he also started developing iOS applications, and in 2011, he created his first startup, Kodesk. After learning a lot as an entrepreneur, he co-created the NEST'up startup accelerator program and coached several startups on the Lean Startup tools and techniques. He is now a Lean Startup coach for NEST'up and also coaches big companies and other organizations to help them innovate like startups.\n\nSaid Eloudrhiri\nI'm a Team Leader and agile coach. I have some side projects to stay in touch with technologies such as the Android Wear part of \"My Devoxx\". With the Devoxx4Kids, I'm also involved as a trainer for the following labs: Sphero, Mindstorms, CodeCombat.\n\n[DWW-9249]"
