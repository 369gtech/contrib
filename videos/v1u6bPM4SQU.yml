description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nPerformance Optimization – Rook on Kubernetes - Mark Darnell & Ryan Tidwell, SUSE \n\nStorage systems like Ceph require maximum performance from their underlying platforms, historically relying on custom silicon or bare metal access. Rook, a containerization of Ceph, will potentially require optimization of the network stack in order to match Ceph’s bare-metal performance capabilities.  Join us as we walk the audience through the measurement, discover, and optimization processes, leveraging different architectures and CNI plugins to optimize Rook/Ceph on K8s.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZekO"
