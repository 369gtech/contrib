description: "Beauty in Code 2020 was a single-track full day IT-conference organized by Living IT, featuring five amazing speakers from three continents. It was hosted at the Malmö Live conference center on March 7, 2020.\n\nhttps://beautyincode.se\nhttps://livingit.se\n\nSession 2 of 6 by Nyari Samushonga (https://twitter.com/nyarisam)\n\"Misguided Loyalties\"\nWe all want to predictably deliver quality software solutions. Many technical and process methodologies have been created to make this possible. Yet time and again we repeat the age old patterns of late delivery and poor quality, ensuring we continue to face the backlash of unmet expectations. Could it be that while we profess to want to do better, our overt and hidden attachments to unproductive ways mean we self sabotage and follow patterns that ensure repeated failure? In this talk I’d like us to peel away the layers and take a close look at some of the ways that what we do ensures we do not get what we want. We have the tools to win we just need to choose to use them."
