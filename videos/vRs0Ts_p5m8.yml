He has taught programming at The Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, one of the leading technical universities in Sweden.Thomas Sundberg has developed an obsession for technical excellence. This translates to Software Craftsmanship, Clean Code and Test Automation.\n\nA Walking Skeleton has been described by Alistair Cockburn as “… a tiny implementation of the system that performs a small end-to-end function. It need not use the final architecture, but it should link together the main architectural components. The architecture and the functionality can then evolve in parallel.” It is also the theme of the popular book “Growing Object Orientated Software Guided by Tests” by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
