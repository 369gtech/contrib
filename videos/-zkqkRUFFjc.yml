description: "Sven Bernhardt, Solution Architect, OPITZ CONSULTING GmbH\n\nDanilo Schmiedel, Solution Architect, OPITZ CONSULTING GmbH\n\nAPIs are key for managing the challenges of digital transformation projects and for building future-proof, modern software solutions. In addition, APIs are essential for building up new digital economies and for evolving new business models. But very often, consistent implementation guidelines and design best practices are missing. The variety of different tools—such as API Gateway, Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS), and Node.js—is also a huge challenge for getting started. This session demystifies this, showing different classes of APIs, how they can be implemented, and the challenges and benefits of using a specific implementation technique."
