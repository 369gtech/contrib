description: "Improvements to the .NET Developer Experience on Cloud Foundry - Matthew Horan & Sam Peinado, Pivotal \n\nThe old news: Cloud Foundry supports running applications in true Windows containers. This was a significant step for .NET developers, who can now use more platform features (compared to 2012 R2) and leverage improved isolation and resource management for their apps.  The Pivotal .NET / Windows Product Area has been working to ensure an improved .NET experience with Cloud Foundry. While Windows support for Cloud Foundry still best supports 12-factor apps, new developments from the .NET Developer Experience team have helped improve the situation for many other apps that may not have been a great fit for the platform in the past.  In this talk, we’ll share some of the new features (and new opinions!) we’ve come to in the past year. This includes support for SMB volume connections, multi-buildpack support and a new “stack” for Windows. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
