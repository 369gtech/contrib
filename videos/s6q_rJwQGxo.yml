title: 'Functional Programming for the Object Oriented - Øystein Kolsrud'
recordingDate: 1447316630
description: "This presentation gives an introduction to Haskell and compares it to the features provided in C# that have been influenced by concepts from the functional world. In particular, it aims to illustrate how a functional approach to solving problems differs from an object oriented approach.\n\nThis presentation assumes no previous experience of functional programming. In fact, its intended target audience is software developers who have been working with imperative or object oriented programming, but never had the opportunity to investigate what functional programming is all about.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
