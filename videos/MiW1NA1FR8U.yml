description: "RubyConfBY 2019 - https://rubyconference.by\n\nVideo Partner â€“ iTechArt  https://www.itechart.by \n\nAbout the talk: \nWeb applications typically have bottlenecks at the database layer. This is one reason Active Record gets so much attention by application developers, Rails core developers, and conference speakers. \n\nIn this talk we will be focusing on something a little bit different. Instead of the database layer, we will be looking at the view layer of the application. We will be looking at how view \nrendering is handled in Rails. This will include the process by which views are compiled, cached, and rendered. We'll learn how much memory they are found, how much memory they use, and more importantly how we can speed them up.\n\nAudience members should expect to leave with more information about Rails internals along with development techniques that they can use in their applications today!"
