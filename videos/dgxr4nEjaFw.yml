description: "From OSCON 2015 in Amsterdam: Evolutionary architecture—also known as just-in-time architecture—is not as horrifying to mainstream developers and software architects as it once was. The techniques have evolved, as has our ability to maintain various capabilities using an evolutionary approach. If you’ve shunned evolutionary architecture in the past, it could be worth another look.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll look at common evolutionary architecture practices and how our use of them has evolved. We’ll also examine some of the enabling techniques and technologies that have aided both the growth and acceptance of this practice. Finally, we’ll explore possible new techniques and areas where you might want to apply evolutionary architecture.\n\nAbout Rebecca Parsons (ThoughtWorks):\nDr. Rebecca Parsons is ThoughtWorks’ CTO. She has more than 30 years’ experience in leading the creation of large-scale distributed, services-based applications, and the integration of disparate systems.\n\nBefore ThoughtWorks she worked as an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Central Florida, after completing a Director’s Post Doctoral Fellowship at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Her interests include parallel and distributed computation, programming languages, domain specific languages, evolutionary architecture, genetic algorithms, and computational science.\n\nRebecca received a BS in Computer Science and Economics from Bradley University, and both an MS and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice University.\n\nWatch more from OSCON Amsterdam 2015: https://goo.gl/VeF8tq\nVisit the OSCON website: http://oscon.com\nDon't miss an upload!
