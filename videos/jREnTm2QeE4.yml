description: 'From the start of the pandemic, through the election and the insurrection on the Capitol and on into the vaccine roll-out, the nationwide health privacy law, HIPAA, has gotten more famous and more misunderstood than ever. Out of this morass of politicization and polemic emerged “Bad HIPPA Takes” (@BadHIPPA), shining a light on the absurd, funny, sad and even accurate in a must-follow for anyone interested in privacy. In this session, we’ll ask Bad HIPPA Takes some questions, check out their views based on the past year, and even see if they have any inkling about the future of privacy law in the U. S.'
