title: 'DEF CON 27 Conference - Jmaxxz - Your Car is My Car'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573862460
description: "For many of us, our cars are one of the largest purchases we will ever make. In an always connected world it is natural that we would want to have the convenience of being able to remotely monitor our vehicles: to do everything from remind ourselves exactly where exactly we parked, verify we locked our vehicle, or even remote start it so it will be warmed up (or cooled down) when we get in. There are a variety of vendors offering aftermarket alarm systems that provide these conveniences and offer a peace of mind. But how much can we trust the vendors of these systems are protecting access to our cars in the digital domain? In this talk, Jmaxxz will tell the story of what he found when he looked into one such system.\n\nJmaxxz\nJmaxxz works as a software engineer, but is a hacker by passion. He is best known for his work on the August Smart Lock (DEF CON 24 “Backdooring the Frontdoor”). In recent years IoT devices have been the focus of his work. He participated in the IoT village zero day track at DEF CON 24 and DEF CON 25. After enduring several polar vortexes, he decided it was probably time to investigate an IoT remote car starter.\n\ntwitter: @jmaxxz Website: jmaxxz.com"
