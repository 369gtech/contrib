description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\nSeptember 13, 2011\n\nPresented by Patrick McKenzie\n\nABSTRACT\n\nGoogle is in the business of having some of the world's best engineers build systems which connect businesses to customers.  Unfortunately, we engineers often don't understand our systems from the customer's point of view.  This talk will address challenges businesses face in their online marketing, from the necessity of non-technical owners/staff implementing it to the disparity in needs between small and large businesses.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nPatrick McKenzie was previously a systems engineer at a multinational Japanese company.  He has since started his own business selling software and SaaS applications online, primarily to non-technical customers.  He has been using AdWords since 2006."
