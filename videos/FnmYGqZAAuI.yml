Prioritizing technical debt is a hard problem as modern systems might have millions of lines of code and multiple development teams — no-one has a holistic overview.\nIn addition, there's always a trade-off between improving existing code versus adding new features so we need to use our time wisely. So what if we could mine the collective intelligence of all contributing programmers and start to make decisions based on information from how the organization actually works with the code?\nIn this presentation you'll see how easily obtained version-control data let you uncover the behavior and patterns of the development organization. This language-neutral approach lets you prioritize the parts of your system that benefit the most from improvements, so that you can balance short- and long-term goals guided by data. The specific examples are from real-world codebases like Android, the Linux Kernel, .Net Core Runtime and [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:36 Lehman's \"laws\" of software evolution\n02:04 Technical dept\n06:35 Case study: prioritizing technical dept\n14:28 Why hotspots work\n18:35 Resources\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1263/prioritizing-technical-debt-as-if-time-and-money-matters\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Legacy #DeveloperProductivity #Teams #TechnicalDebt\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
