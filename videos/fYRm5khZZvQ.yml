description: "Jacob is a senior software architect at Cardlay A/S (www.cardlay.com). He has been working full time with Groovy based technologies the last many years, including positions at Gennemtænkt IT and the LEGO Group. \nAs a hobby, he regularly teach a course at the University of Southern Denmark, including the hands on: \"Web development with Groovy and Grails\". He's been on the crew arranging GR8conf Europe for several years, and regularly, blogging the Grails Diary with news from the community.\n\nKevin is a Java developer and JVM fanboy since being introduced to the language back in school 12 years ago. Found his own company during his university years, developing mobile apps and client-server applications, which lead to his discovery of Grails and the Groovy ecosystem. Fell in love with TDD because of Spock. Nowadays Kevin is working at the cyber security company GDATA and focuses on topics such as software craftsmanship, infrastructure as code and continuous integration pipelines, trying to make the world a better place one container at a time.\n\nPaul has been contributing to open source projects for nearly 30 years and is an active committer on numerous projects including Groovy, GPars and Gradle. Paul speaks at international conferences, publishes in software magazines and journals, and is a co-author of Manning’s best-seller: Groovy in Action, 2nd Edition."
