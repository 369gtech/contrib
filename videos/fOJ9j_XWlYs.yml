description: "From #Vilnius to #Mallorca! BUILD STUFF is going to celebrate summer! An amazing weekend on APRIL 29-30, 2017 – MALLORCA, SPAIN will take you out of the office into a seaside event full of professional lectures, technical sessions, beach games, umbrella drinks, and wonderful sunset. #buildstuffes #beachconference #code www.buildstuff.es\n\nRoy Veshovda calls himself a developer. He is an independent consultant and serial entrepreneur. He has spent most of his professional life moving from the web world to hardware and back. Along the way he has picked up a lot of languages and technologies, including Erlang and Elixir, which he believes is a very good fit for IoT problems. \nRoy has way too much hardware (Raspberry Pis) and too little time. His home is littered with unfinished (and some finished) hardware projects.One of Roy’s main phrases are \"How hard can it be?”, tightly followed by “I have no idea what I am doing”"
