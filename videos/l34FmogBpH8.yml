Although many schemes for object localization using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags have been proposed, they mostly focus on absolute object localization and are not suitable for relative object localization because of large error margins and the special hardware that they require. In this paper, we propose an approach called Spatial-Temporal Phase Profiling (STPP) to RFID based relative object localization. The basic idea of STPP is that by moving a reader over a set of tags during which the reader continuously interrogating the tags, for each tag, the reader obtains a sequence of RF phase values, which we call a phase profile, from the tagâ€™s responses over time. By analyzing the spatial-temporal dynamics in the phase profiles, STPP can calculate the spatial ordering among the tags. In comparison with prior absolute object localization schemes, STPP requires neither dedicated infrastructure nor special hardware. We implemented STPP and evaluated its performance in two real-world applications: locating misplaced books in a library and determining baggage order in an airport. The experimental results show that STPP achieves about 84% ordering accuracy for misplaced books and 95% ordering accuracy for baggage handling.\n\nView the full NSDI '15 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi15/technical-sessions"
