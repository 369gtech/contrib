description: 'This talk is based on a series of experiences I had working with my interns, sharing their experiences on other internships and improving my methods so we could take most of our 12 weeks together. The biggest highlights are related to fast and focused technical bootstrap, connecting with a trusted network of experts inside the company and building up confidence on public speaking and presentation skills.'
