description: "The one question I'm asked more than any other when talking about working at GitLab is: wait, you don't have any offices? That is often followed by a confused look or the direct question: How?\n\nWriting down decisions, asynchronous communication, measuring results, not hours. Companies often aspire to these goals...however in an all-remote company, they aren't aspirational - they are requirements. GitLab has grown from 9 people in 2014 to over 900 people in 55 different countries with a valuation of almost $3 billion.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discover some of the not-so-secret sauce that GitLab has leveraged to achieve this growth. On this journey, our values have remained the same. We value collaboration, results, efficiency, diversity & inclusion, iteration, and transparency. And we've done all that without having any office, headquarters, or anything that looks like one.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11XLfdSAnWDla9gQEZIrv5E2Fh4qeZXwThlZ2I7VQgok/edit#slide=id.g73fbef8bdb_0_0\n\nJSConf Hawaii will return soon\nhttps://www.jsconfhi.com/"
