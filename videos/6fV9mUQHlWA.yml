language: English
recordingDate: 1502178134
description: "Reactive design can help ensure better response time and make your applications more flexible.  Learn why you don’t need to rewrite your Java EE applications from scratch to achieve that. Attendees learn five ways to reuse the knowledge of Java EE and Java 8 to improve your existing applications with a reactive design, and then apply those techniques to a big production-like application, walking through the code and in a live demo. In the end, see how much the performance and user experience can be improved—without learning a new framework or library, and limiting the changes in the application source code to a bare minimum.\n\nDownload his presentation slides https://developer.oracle.com/code/prague"
