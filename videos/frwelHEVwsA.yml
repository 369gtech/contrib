description: "LISA16 - Intelligent Anomaly Detection in Heterogeneous Internet Services\n\nDong Wang, Baidu Inc.\n\nWhen talking about anomaly detection in Internet services, most of us usually imagine a scenario in which lots of curves monitor the various metrics and some fixed thresholds tell something wrong. However such simple ways are far from effective nowadays. In the talk I am going to address many machine learning based intelligent approaches to do anomaly detection in lots of heterogeneous Internet services. All of the services mentioned here are from one of the top IT companies in the world, Baidu, whose business includes search engine, location based service (LBS), finance and payment, etc. The total users they cover are more than one billion. The approaches mentioned in this talk are already actively used in Baiduâ€™s real products.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
