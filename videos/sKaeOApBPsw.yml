description: "Building Cloud Native GDPR Friendly Systems for Data Collection - Zsolt Homorodi, VTT \n\nFor organizations collecting EU usersâ€™ data, the General Data Protection Regulation presents considerable challenges. Data must be anonymized and only essential data can be collected. Users must be able to see, download, and delete their data. Setting up the infrastructure to meet GDPR compliance is complicated and time consuming, particularly for resource constrained teams. In this talk, Zsolt Homorodi from VTT (Technical Research Centre of Finland) will explain how he created a reproducible GDPR compliant lightweight data collection and processing infrastructure that is based on Kubernetes and other Cloud Native technologies. Zsolt will show how he combines Linkerd 2.0, Pulumi, Contour, Prometheus, Grafana, Argo, gRPC and other tools to architect reliable, predictable, observable and reproducible environments for data collection and processing that comply with GDPR. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYC"
