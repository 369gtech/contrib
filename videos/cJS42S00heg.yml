description: "Even more than being faster, stronger, and better, decision makers and technical teams rely on predictability to succeed. Kanban delivers greater predictability to existing development methods for new project development as well as maintenance and support work. Organizations are using kanban to successfully match their capabilities to their expectations and needs for reliable configuration management, code quality, effective deployment and delivery cadence. How do they maintain the flexibility to navigate the ever-changing business environment and still predictably deliver critical work?\n\nBy using measurement, formulas and a scientific approach to change management, we can balance the factors of observed capability, staffing, and delivery targets to achieve predictable outcomes. By analyzing and understanding the nature of the work we do, we can allocate our efforts appropriately. By being methodical in our approach to continuous improvement, we can minimize disruption and achieve lasting benefit.\n\nAbout David\n\nDavid J.
