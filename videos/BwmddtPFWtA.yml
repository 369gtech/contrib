description: "Recurrent neural networks let us learn from sequential data (time series, music, audio, video frames, etc ). We're going to build one from scratch in numpy (including backpropagation) to generate a sequence of words in the style of Franz Kafka. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/recurrent_neural_network\n\nPlease Subscribe!
