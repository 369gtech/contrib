description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Europe 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nKasun Indrasiri - Author of \"Microservices for the Enterprise\"\n\nABSTRACT\nReal-World microservices implementations often use a variety of communication protocols and standards to build different services. Although RESTful services were quite popular during the early stages of microservices, it is quite inefficient for most inter-microservice communication scenarios. gRPC has emerged as an efficient, reliable, and robust way to build inter-microservice communication owing to its rich service definition capabilities with protocol buffers, a variety of language support, and performance of being built on top of HTTP2.\nIn this session, we cover how different cloud native communication patterns can be implemented with gRPC. You can learn when and how to use gRPC Interceptors, Deadlines, Cancellation, Error Handling, Multiplexing, and Metadata [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:10 What is gRPC?\n04:48 Fundamentals of gRPC - service definition\n05:45 Fundamentals of gRPC - gRPC service\n07:11 Fundamentals of gRPC - gRPC client\n07:40 Why gRPC?\n10:00 gRPC vs. OpenAPI/REST vs. GraphQL\n11:51 gRPC in the microservices landscape\n14:18 Unary/simple RPC\n15:33 Server streaming RPC\n17:04 Client streaming RPC\n18:04 Bidirectional-streaming RPC\n19:59 gRPC interceptors\n21:18 Deadlines\n22:02 Metadata\n22:54 Multiplexing\n23:31 Cancellation\n24:27 API specification with gRPC\n25:45 API versioning with gRPC\n27:18 Extending service definition\n27:59 Securing gRPC services with OAuth2\n28:38 REST/Open API - gRPC Bridge\n29:47 Resources\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/2020/sessions/1470/cloud-native-communication-patterns-with-grpc\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#CloudNative #gRPC #Microservices #HTTP2 #OAuth #OAuth2 #RPC #OpenAPI #GraphQL #REST #API #APIs\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
