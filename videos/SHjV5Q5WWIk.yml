description: "Subscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwo years ago we helped to introduce Apache Flink in one of the biggest mobile operators in Poland - at first to help with real time marketing. The data used included information from billing and signalling systems. We wanted to enable analysts and semi-technical people to create and monitor processes and that’s how Nussknacker - our open source GUI for Flink was born.\n\nToday we’re processing billions of events daily from more than dozen of sources with more than 40 processes running in production. Most of those jobs are created by analysts, without the need of developers assistance. We use our cluster not only for marketing but also fraud detection.\n\nI'll show how we achieved that - I'll briefly describe our use case and architecture, and then show short demo of Nussknacker.\n#ApacheFlink\n\nPresented by Maciej Próchniak\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
