description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeaker: Oliver Gierke\nThe repository abstraction layer is one of the core pieces of the Spring Data projects. It provides a consistent, interface-based programming model to allow implementing data access layers easily. The talk will start with a brief introduction and dive into best practices and implementation patterns later one.\n\nWe will conclude the session with an overview over what can actually be built on top of this generic repository abstraction and discuss integration hooks into Spring MVC and REST webservices."
