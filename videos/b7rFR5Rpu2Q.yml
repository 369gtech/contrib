title: 'Marisa Brandt - Designing an Effective Hiring Process (Abstractions II Raw Cuts)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1575916066
description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\n\nTechnical folx often don't negotiate, and when we do, we often undersell ourselves. Over the course of our careers, missed opportunities to ask for more financially can add up to a substantial loss. In this talk, I'll go over best practices for negotiating; highlight some key issues for women and under-represented minorities specifically; and address how to prepare for different types of negotiations.\n\nThere will be some exercises to help audience members identify specific areas to practice or research in preparation for a possible upcoming negotiation.\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#Negotiate%20Like%20a%20Badass-Marisa%20Brandt"
