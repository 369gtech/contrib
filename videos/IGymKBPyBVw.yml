title: 'Webinar: The evolution of Ingress through the Gateway API'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601058701
description: "Ingress is an interface for L7 load balancing in Kubernetes that has led to many successful ecosystem implementations over the years. Gateway is an open-source Kubernetes API that is designed to evolve the capabilities of Ingress. Gateway focuses on being more expressive, more extensible, and role oriented for Service owners, all while retaining the same portability that made Ingress successful in the first place. Bowei is one of the contributors to the OSS Gateway API and he'll summarize the areas where Gateway improves upon Ingress and provides a modern load balancing API for Kubernetes.\n\nPresenters:\nKaslin Fields, Developer Advocate @Google\nBowei Du, Staff Software Engineer @Google"
