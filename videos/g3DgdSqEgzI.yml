description: "Speaker: Gary Russell\nThe Spring Integration team has been hard at work on the latest release of the popular integration framework. Before version 4.0, it was impractical to define a complete Spring Integration flow without using XML. With this major release, the existing basic annotation support has received an overhaul and those who prefer to use java @Configuration classes can now define their applications without needing to use any XML (of course, XML is still supported as well).\n\nIn this session we will cover these major changes to the framework, explaining how and when to use them. It will be mainly demonstration and code walk through, and we will build a useful Spring Boot / Integration application from scratch."
