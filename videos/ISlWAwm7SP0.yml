description: "Harrison Shoff is a front end engineer at Airbnb who works with data collection and data visualization. His talk at HTML5DevConf argues that the way you communicate data matters.\n\nShoff alludes to statistical innovations from the past (like Florence Nightingale's Coxcomb Plot and John Snow's Dot Map) to prove that organizing information in an easy-to-understand format is just as important as collecting accurate data.\_\n\nThrough a series of examples, Shoff touches on benefical ways that data records can assist a growing business. He also demonstrates Newton; an interactive application he hopes to publish that will make data more accessible and facilitate a more open source data sharing community.\n\n** We've got tons and tons more presentations from HTML5DevConf!
