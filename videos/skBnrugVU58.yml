title: 'Geode Performance Architecture for the Agile Enterprise using Cloud-Native API''s'

description: "While traditional waterfall enterprises developing monolithic applications suffer from slow release processes and prolonged ROI, they benefit from having the time to plan and test for capacity, scalability, and adoption. Moving to agile and cloud native API's, enterprises benefit from rapid deployment of feature dedicated and easily shared services with much faster time to market. As a result, two challenges emerge as part of this model with inadequate API testing at the micro level and inadequate enterprise testing at the macro level which severely impacts the business. Auto-scaling micro services helps address and minimize some of these issues but do not account for a common caching layer such as GEODE. At Citi, we continue to develop methodologies and tools that add maturity and rigor to API testing in alignment with meeting aggressive timelines but also testing at the enterprise level to ensure that our GEODE layer scales and remains highly performant as services are consumed.\n\nSpeakers:\nJoshua Haggerty\nGlobal Consumer Technology CTO, Citi\n\nAmit Madan\nSVP â€“ Architecture Group Manager, Citi\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
