description: "We've all heard of functional programming, but how can you apply it to your existing code? \n\nIn this talk by Eric Normand, author of 📖  Grokking Simplicity |  http://mng.bz/oGXN  📖  DISCOUNT CODE ⭐  WATCHNORMAND40 ⭐  you will learn to identify the hardest code to test, make it more testable, and improve its reusability by applying a few simple functional refactorings. You can apply these refactorings in any language, be it procedural, object-oriented, or functional.\n\n📚📚📚\nGrokking Simplicity |  http://mng.bz/oGXN\nTo save 40% off this book use discount code: WATCHNORMAND40 \n📚📚📚\n\nAbout the book:\nDistributed across servers, difficult to test, and resistant to modification—modern software is complex. Grokking Simplicity is a friendly, practical guide that will change the way you approach software design and development. It introduces a unique approach to functional programming that explains why certain features of software are prone to complexity, and teaches you the functional techniques you can use to simplify these systems so that they’re easier to test and debug."
