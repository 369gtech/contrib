description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nHierarchical probabilistic models are an expressive and flexible way to build models that allow us to incorporate feature-dependent uncertainty and produce a range of credible values. We will walk through the process of applying one of these models to predict a customerâ€™s budget from realized spend data using PyMC3.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
