Today, and in the coming weeks I am going to release an interview and discussion series with four amazing developers and speakers that I had the great pleasure to interview at nordic.js, one of the best JavaScript conferences in Europe. Every year, nordic.js tickets sells out in hours, and the bar for speaking there is very high, and of that group I selected four that I interviewed for you. \n\nFirst out is Isa Silveira, got into programming when she was 13 years old, is backend and frontend engineer *and* a data scientist. Isa Silveira has built software for world class organizations like Stanford University, Planned Parenthood and Banco Votorantim, which is huge bank in Brazil. Isa Silveira worked with scientific research at COPPE, one of Brazilâ€™s most prestigious research organizations.\n\nIsa Silveira talks to me about how to give feedback at work, how to be fearless as a developer and as a team by not getting married to your ideas, the difference between heuristic and an hypothesis, and developing an experimental mindset. I had such a fucking blast doing this first developer discussion episode of Fun Fun Function, and I could not have hoped for a better first guest. \n\nThis is an developer discussion with Isa Silveira."
