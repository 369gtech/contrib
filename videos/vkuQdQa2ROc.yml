recordingDate: 1311911902
description: "If you're running Linux or a similar FL/OSS OS then you're already following Mahatma Ghandi's maxim: \"Be the change you want to see in the world\". But often it's not enough to simply take part, you have to take action for real change to occur. In 2009, I led a campaign to make the British Government apologize for the mistreatment of computer scientist, code breaker and mathematician Alan Turing. The campaign succeeded through a mixture of old media and new, Perl scripts and Wikipedia, and by not following Emperor Palpatine's plea to \"give in to your anger\", but to channel it.\n\nThis talk tells the behind-the-scenes story of the apology campaign complete with source code, tips on dealing with the old-school media, how Twitter helped and didn't, and a call for people who want to change the world to be \"reasonably unreasonable\" because nothing ever gets done by the reasonable.\n\nJohn Graham-Cumming\n\nCloudFlare\n\nJohn Graham-Cumming is computer programmer and author. He studied mathematics and computation at Oxford and stayed for a doctorate in computer security. As a programmer he has worked in Silicon Valley and New York, the UK, Germany and France. His open source POPFile program won a Jolt Productivity Award in 2004.\n\nHe is the author of a travel book for scientists published in 2009 called The Geek Atlas and has written articles for The Times, The Guardian, The Sunday Times, The San Francisco Chronicle, New Scientist and other publications.\n\nHe can be found on the web at jgc.org and on Twitter as @jgrahamc.\n\nIf you've heard of him at all, it's likely because in 2009 he successfully petitioned the British Government to apologize for the mistreatment of British mathematician Alan Turing."
