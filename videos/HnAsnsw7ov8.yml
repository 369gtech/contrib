description: "Imagine a culture where the input of the whole organization turns an individual idea into a user story in just a couple of hours, where everybody's goal is to make the customer’s job easier and more effective, and where you work on projects you love instead of projects you loathe.\nCulture comes from allowing people to let their creativity thrive and bringing employees together to have fun. It comes from prioritizing a shared value system that causes everyone to work with purpose and opening up the lines of communication as far as they go. It’s about emphasizing transparency and honesty, respecting autonomy, and encouraging collaboration. It’s about maintaining all these things no matter how large an organization grows and protecting that culture by hiring people who will maintain it.\nI'll talk about all these aspects and give lots of practical examples from our experience at Atlassian. Culture is the foundation from which everything else will grow – so, make sure it’s a strong one."
