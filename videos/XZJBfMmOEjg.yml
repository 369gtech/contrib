description: "The technology industry has a bad rap. Sexism and misogyny run rampant. Marginalized groups get railroaded. Out-of-touch companies look to make as much money as ruthlessly as possible,\nall while exploiting others and passing it off as disruption. Our industry is losing sight of what it could be. In the sixties, NASA inspired a generation to become scientists and engineers. Today? There is a noticeable and palpable vacuum. This talk will discuss what can bring us back from the brink: empathy. Empathy for the people that use the things we make, for our non-technical team- mates, and for our fellow engineers.\n\nForward 4 kicks off in Feb 2015!
