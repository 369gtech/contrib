This feature enables one to write code that is more concise and more readable. However, it's also possible for this feature to be misused, obfuscating code instead of making it more readable. The Java Team has published a set of style guidelines that help direct programmers toward uses of 'var' that improve code quality and that help them avoid uses that detract from code quality. This session gives an overview of the new 'var' feature and describes these style rules. The presentation is liberally supplemented with code examples of both good uses and misuses of 'var'.\n\nStuart Marks \nFrom Oracle\nStuart Marks is a Consulting Member of Technical Staff in the Java Platform Group at Oracle.
