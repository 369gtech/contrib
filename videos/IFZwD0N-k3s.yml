title: 'Differential Privacy in the Real World'
recordingDate: 1543956969
description: "Yevgeniy Vahlis, Head of Applied Machine Learning, Borealis AI\nPresented at MLconf 2018\nAbtract: Differential privacy is making headlines thanks to the pioneering work of companies like Apple and Google, and it is now being used by companies of all sizes to provide data privacy guarantees. It is no secret that machine learning models can memorize (overfit) training data and that through carefully crafted adversarial inputs machine learning models can be subverted by an attacker. Combine these facts with a model that aggregates data from a multitude of customers and you have an AI-driven disaster waiting to happen. In this talk we will cover a defensive measure called “differential privacy” that is a potential solution to such threats. In this talk Yevgeniy will explain the core concepts of differential privacy and share a behind the scenes look at companies are successfully implementing differential privacy in their products.\n\nSee Yevgeniy's presentation slides on our slideshare page here: https://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/differential-privacy-in-the-real-world"
