description: "New paradigms such as microservices architecture, cloud-native development, serverless computing, ... suggest enhancements to Java EE going forward.\n\nThe goal of this session is to describe proposals to better position Java EE for use in the cloud, with the goal of supporting users who need to more efficiently build and configure distributed applications based on cloud-native and microservices-style architectures.\n\nDuring this session, we will discuss some investigation works planned for Java EE 8 but also Java EE 9 • Configuration externalization • Service resiliency and improved health check • Services grouping and versioning • A new lightweight eventing approach • Security improvements • HTTP/2 ...\n\nThe goals of the session are to present potential improvements for Java EE Next but also to gather feedback!\n\nDavid Delabassee is a Software Evangelist working in the GlassFish and Java EE Team at Oracle. Prior to that, he spent more than 10 years at Sun Microsystems focusing on Java end-to-end (from the smart card to the high end server) and the developer tools. He has been involved in Java projects since the early days of this technology. In his spare time, he enjoy tinkering and playing with technologies such as Java, Arduino, Home Automation, Linux, Pinball, etc.\n\n[OCA-5415]"
