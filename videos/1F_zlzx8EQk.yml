description: "Building Technical and Organizational Confidence Through Automated Deployments\n\nMieke Deenen, Project Manager Deployment Automation, UWV, Netherlands\n\nUWV is a Dutch government agency responsible for the collection and payment of social security for all employees and for helping unemployed people (back) to work. As it is spending taxpayer money on critical social benefits, UWV is subject to intense public scrutiny. \n\nUWV needs to comply with emerging regulations and customers' demands within a complex IT landscape that has evolved over decades and has a traditional Prince2 â€“ waterfall based development culture. Delivering mission-critical software without failure is one of the core themes, especially since every unavailability of their applications generates lots of negative publicity. \n\nOur core challenge was to build trust to change faster and more often in a change aversive culture. This presentation is about our journey and how we pave the way for DevOps in a government agency.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
