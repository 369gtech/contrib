description: "Aneesh Kumar K.V\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/28/\nMemory management is a core subsystem of Linux kernel which provides generic interfaces built on top of architectural implementations. Adding new memory model requires large changes to kernel code. This becomes more challenging when the architecture supports multiple memory models. In this talk, we will look at the challenges involved in adding Linux kernel support for the new POWER ISA 3.0 memory model. We will also summarize kernel specific abstractions we added to efficiently support multiple memory models in a single kernel."
