description: "Ge the Code Here: http://goo.gl/R6R1F\n\nTo finish off my Java Algorithm tutorial, I thought it would be interesting to cover solving programming problems in general. So, in this tutorial I'll answer the question I've been getting, which is how to print a tree data structure.\n\nOn our journey to better understand how to solve problems I will first solve the basic problem. Then in the next part of the tutorial I will perfect printing any type of tree. The code above will better explain the process of solving this problem."
