description: "Speaker: Shubham Goyal (@shubham_goyal)\n\nLet’s admit it. We all wanna be billionaires, or marry one, or be adopted by one ;) But we are lazy. Rather than going through the list of billionaires manually, we will use Python to crawl the list of billionaires and find the most suitable one.\n\nHaven’t you been amazed by Facebook’s face detection algorithm? But did you know how easy it actually is to detect faces? There is only one way to find out. And, did we tell you that you can also merge faces? Imagine a cross of Barack Obama and David Cameron! Or Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman - now wouldn’t the latter be the most beautiful creature ever?!\n\nPython is one of the easiest programming languages to pick up and has a thriving community around it. Rather than focussing on learning the syntax and semantics of the language, we will focus on showing how easy it is to do things using Python. Once you start having fun with the tool, you will pick the language up automatically.\n\nWhat we hope you will take away at the end of the lesson:\n1. Programming is easy - It looks intimidating, but it is actually the easiest job thet exists\n2. You should be lazy - lazy human + smart machine = blissful existence\n3. Stand on the shoulders of giants - Use the libraries and code written by others to make your application cool\n4. Curiosity - Our hope is that you are motivated enough at the end of the lesson to explore more\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Ht8w/"
