title: 'AQA: You Are Soaking In It by Shelley Lambert'
recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "With the proliferation of OpenJDK binaries for a business to choose from, one factor in determining the selection is quality. How do you know you have made a good choice? AdoptOpenJDK Quality Assurance (AQA) is an open and transparent verification story for OpenJDK binaries. AQA is a robust and adaptable test kit that can be utilized by any OpenJDK implementor, Java or JVM developer, and represents the quality bar required by large-scale customers in enterprise environments. We test multiple freely available JDK implementations at AdoptOpenJDK and continue to refine this suite of tests to give the community access to high-quality binaries.\n\nShelley Lambert, Red Hat\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
