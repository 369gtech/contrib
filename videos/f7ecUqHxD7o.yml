title: 'Scaling at GitHub, Patrick Reynolds - Git Merge 2016'
language: English
recordingDate: 1479323955
description: "The GitHub Systems team provides Git as a fast and reliable service, both as the backend for GitHub.com the website, and directly to users. To do that, we first make Git itself fast and reliable. But we also must consider Git as a distributed application, at the scale of billions of operations per day. Hear about the challenges that presents, and learn about the bespoke tools GitHub has built to monitor, shape, cache, and replicate transactions in our Git service.\n\nNote: In this talk, Patrick refers to DGit, which was an internal codename for the project to distribute the storage of git repositories more efficiently within GitHub's infrastructure. In order to reduce redundancy and potential confusion, GitHub has subsequently renamed the project Spokes.\n\nPatrick Reynolds leads the team at GitHub that runs Git as a service. He has been building tools to monitor and troubleshoot distributed applications for more than ten years: first as an academic research project, then as a product at BlueStripe Software, and most recently for internal use at GitHub."
