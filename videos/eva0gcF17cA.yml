title: 'PL/SQL Q&A: Reset Package, Get Advance Count + More'
language: English
recordingDate: 1569950978
description: "This time around, we'll do a detailed deep dive into a couple of questions from developers. One has to do with resetting the values of variables in a package when an error occurs. Another wants to know the best way to get the total count of rows returned by a query before fetching all those rows. We'll explore different approaches - with new ones offered up by our attendees, we are sure. Then we'll move on to any questions you have and finish up with a reportback on Oracle Open World 2019 (ALWAYS FREE AUTONOMOUS DATABASE!) from Chris Saxon.\n\n1:48 - Highlights from OOW19: Always Free Oracle Cloud!\n13:42 - Reset state of single package\n26:20 - Get count of rows for query\n37:45 - SYS_REFCURSOR vs Pipelined Table Function to return data\n41:26 - REGEXP_SUBSTR and also SQL LATERAL"
