description: "The job of a project manager has never been both easier and more challenging than in this digital era when technology is enabling everyone to know faster, think faster and move faster.\n\nMaking stuff happen in a digital world requires that project managers not only get stuff done, but nurture creative potential in order for people to achieve new levels of professional excellence since modern day project management began in the 1950s.\n\nJoin Portia Tung, Playmaker 001 and founder of The School of Play, in this interactive keynote to discover why play is one of the most effective and efficient ways of bringing people together to do their best work and how play increases creativity, collaboration, communication and resilience so that you and your teams can go from good to great.\n\nAbout Portia Tung\nPortia is an Executive and Business Agile coach, storyteller and wishmaker. Her pursuit to help people realise more of their potential has led to the pleasant yet all together unexpected discovery that play is essential for the lifelong development of adults and not only children. Portia's research on play has led her to live a more playful life, so much so that she has managed to dream The School of Play into existence."
