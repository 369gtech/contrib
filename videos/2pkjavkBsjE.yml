title: 'Better performance with HTTP/2 by Julien Viet'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492679024
description: "The HTTP/2 protocol is the latest evolution of the HTTP protocol addressing the issue of HTTP/TCP impedance mismatch. Web applications have been working around this problem for years employing techniques like concatenation or css spriting to reduce page load time and improve user experience. HTTP/2 is also a game changer on the server enabling increased concurrency. This talk will focus on the impact HTTP/2 will have on the server and examine how particularly well adapted the Vert.x concurrency model is to serve HTTP/2 applications.\n\nJulien Viet \nVert.x project lead, I work at Red Hat and I have been developing open source software since 2002."
