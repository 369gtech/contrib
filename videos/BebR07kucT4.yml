description: "This is the 24th tutorial in the Drupal 7 tutorial series. This tutorial shows you how to create a block view using the Views module.\n\nfrom Drupal.org...\n\nWhat is Views\n\nThe Views module provides a flexible method for Drupal site designers to control how lists and tables of content, users, taxonomy terms and other data are presented.\n\nThis tool is essentially a smart query builder that, given enough information, can build the proper query, execute it, and display the results. It has four modes, plus a special mode, and provides an impressive amount of functionality from these modes.\n\nAmong other things, Views can be used to generate reports, create summaries, and display collections of images and other content.\ndrupal.org/project/views\n\nSubscribe to Level Up Pro for extra features!\nhttps://www.leveluptutorials.com/store/products/pro\n\nSubscribe to the Level Up Newsletter\nhttp://eepurl.com/AWjGz\n\nFor questions post in the comments or visit:\nhttp://leveluptuts.com/forum\n\nTo Support Level Up Tuts:\nhttp://leveluptuts.com/donations"
