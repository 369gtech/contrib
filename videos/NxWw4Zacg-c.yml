description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Baruch Sadogursky, JFrog\nSlides: No slides, all demo!\nG&G Special Topics\nMaintaining Grails plugins can be a real challenge given the high expectations and demands. Apart from supporting many users, you're tasked with making sure that the plugin is compatible with a range of Grails versions - both old and new. Your plugin must also be compatible with multiple development environments (OSs, SDKs, etc,) and play nice with the wealth of other plugins that exist in the ecosystem. How can we make sure that all these high standards are met? Testing, and lot's of it!"
