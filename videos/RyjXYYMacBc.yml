description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWhy Use Managed Kubernetes?: It's Dangerous to Go Alone! - Seth McCombs, Workday\n\nSeth will cover common misconceptions and dispel myths around the usage of managed Kubernetes services. Without focus on specific services in particular, more of a push towards acceptance of managed services, especially if you're an engineer or leader that is considering Kubernetes but don't know how to get started. When discussing a managed Kubernetes service, responses have range from “why?” or “managed services aren’t as powerful” or the all too common reference to \"vendor lock in\" - often leaving those on the receiving end with a feeling of being lesser. Viewers will walk away from this session with more acceptance of managed services, and realize that using a managed service doesn't make one a bad engineer. There are many benefits to be had adoption of Kubernetes, and it's not a contest to prove how much you can build. If you have a small team and want to use Kubernetes, then a managed service can be the first step or only step towards Kubernetes usage."
