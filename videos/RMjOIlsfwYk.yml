title: 'Scalable JavaScript Applications with Project Nashorn'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433235185
description: "In the age of cloud computing and highly demanding systems, some new approaches for application architectures such as the event-driven model have been proposed and successfully implemented with Node.js. With the Nashorn JavaScript engine, it is possible to run JavaScript applications directly in the JVM, enabling access to the latest Node.js frameworks while taking advantage of the Java platform’s scalability, manageability, tools, and extensive collection of Java libraries and middleware. This session demonstrates how to use Nashorn to create highly scalable JavaScript applications leveraging the full power of the JVM by using the projects Avatar and Node.js with Avatar.js and Vert.x, highlighting their key benefits, issues, and challenges.\n\n\nAuthors:\nLeonardo Zanivan\nLeonardo is a specialist in software architecture with a great knowledge of Java platform and currently works at Trier Sistemas as a software architect.\nHe is passionate for new technologies, programming and research.\nIn his free time, he also delivers talks in development events such as The Developers Conference in Brazil.\nView more trainings by Leonardo Zanivan at https://www.parleys.com/author/leonardo-zanivan\n\nMichel Graciano\nHigh familiarity with development techniques as object and component oriented programming as well design patterns applicability and software analysis.
