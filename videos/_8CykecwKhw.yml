description: "Speed is at the core of technology evolution. The need for speed, or at the very least the perception of speed, spells the success of today’s technologies. Staying ahead of the curve and providing a quality experience are critical for the industry as a whole. We’ll learn where realtime is heading for both developers and users.\n\nGuillermo Rauch (@rauchg) is the founder of LeanBoost and Cloudup, acquired by Wordpress.com in 2013. He was early in the Node.js space, is the creator of socket.io, mongoose and author of the best-selling Node.js book, Smashing Node.js: JavaScript Everywhere."
