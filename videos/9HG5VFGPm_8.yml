description: "Speaker: Josh Long, Pivotal \nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/joshlong/bootiful-sessions\nBack in the era of the application server, HTTP Session replication was a common way to scale out user session data, as well as make it fault tolerant. In today's world of lightweight containers, PaaS, and virtualization, Spring Session offers a 100% server and/or container portable HTTP Session. See how Spring Session easily plugs in implementations like Redis, scales out across a cluster, handles multiple users' browser sessions, works with WebSocket, and allows header based authentication within REST apps. It's a perfect fit for working with user data, particularly in a highly distributed environment like the cloud, or on a Platform like Cloud Foundry."
