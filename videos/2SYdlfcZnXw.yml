description: '*** FOR BETTER AUDIO: https://youtu.be/rd3G4IOrGEM *** The Digital Transformation Team, led by Diego Piacentini, has the ambitious aim of building the "operating system" of the Country: a series of fundamental blocks upon which services for citizens, the Public Administration, and enterprises are built with modern digital products. The Team is working on a double path: bringing a pool of selected existing projects to life (i.e. ANPR, SPID, PagoPA, etc.) and innovating with new projects. Developers.italia.it is an strategic project to collect SDKs, documentation, source code and Playgorund of all major public technologies.'
