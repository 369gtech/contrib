title: 'Update-Interlude Between GED Video 17 and 18'
recordingDate: 1380644205
description: "Update, a better way of doing things with include. This video is an interlude between Game Engine Development video 17 and 18. \n\nUpdate of an update: VS may auto correct the include Qt header file when you type out the Qt class name, that is okay the program will still compile. Example:  you type include QWidget by the time you press the left-angle-bracket key, VS would auto change that to #include qwidget.h. Both version of the include line would compile correctly."
