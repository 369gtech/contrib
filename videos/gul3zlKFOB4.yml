description: "Building an enterprise git repository (the hard bits!)\n\nMatthew Barr, Architect, Akamai Technologies\n\nSource code: Just put it in git, right? Enterprise scale? Github! \n\nBut what about when you have a lot of source code? Thousands of repositories? No problem! Github Enterprise or Bitbucket Server to the rescue!\n\nNow: Add PCI & SOX. Confidential information. Separation of concerns. Audit. SSO. Centralized SSH key management. DR. Geographic diversity.\n\nThis is the part where you roll up your sleeves, and start doing the real work. \n\nThis talk starts where the vendors stop- discussing workflows to keep work moving, security & audit protections to ensure code integrity, and automation to connect to other enterprise systems.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
