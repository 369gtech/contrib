language: English
recordingDate: 1554731894
description: "Moritz Simon Geist throws all predictions on ‘market development’ and ‘consumer behaviour’ overboard and enters the speculative domain of Art Fiction. Everybody is talking about machine learning, cyborgs and body enhancement these days. But how could actual speculative products, situations and problems look like in 10, 20 or 30 years? In his talk, Geist presents absurd devices-of-the-future and imaginary products for the yet unknown needs of our future self! This happens in the cross-section of society and art – for a world in which brain interfaces, body enhancement and nanorobots (finally!) have become everyday items.\n\nMoritz Simon Geist\nPerformer, Musicologist, and Robotics Engineer, SONIC ROBOTS\nhttps://twitter.com/simongeist\nhttps://www.instagram.com/moritzsimongeist/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
