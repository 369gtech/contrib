If you use Oracle Service Bus or Oracle SOA/BPM suite there are a lot out of the box diagnostics waiting for you. The puzzle here is how to get it out in a useful way. Besides the many commercial solutions also OpenSource tools can help you out with it. You can export runtime diagnostics out of the Diagnostics framework, monitor your SOA Composites, and trace down Service Bus statistics using Prometheus and Grafana. The session will elaborate on how to set up proper monitoring using these tools, also in a proactive way where automated monitoring is a must for every application environment."
