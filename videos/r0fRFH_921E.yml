description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Keynote: Upstream-First, High Scale Prometheus Ecosystem - Kemal Akkoyun, Software Engineer, RedHat\n\nWelcome to the beautiful world of cloud-native observability. Where things that your application is doing are understandable, clear, and non-surprising. Where you get notified only when the user is impacted or will be soon. Where you can in minutes drill down to what’s wrong, where the impact is and why. Where running the observability does not mean deploying 4 separate big, expensive systems with different UI and endpoints.\n\nThis is what is achievable right now with open source projects, we help maintain at Red Hat. Prometheus is no longer just one binary. It’s the way of thinking, a way of simplifying observability on all fronts. Join us to learn more about how Red Hat runs Prometheus and other open-source projects that share the same principles and patterns."
