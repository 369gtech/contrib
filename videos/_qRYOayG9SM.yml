description: "If you're a Java developer and you want to get into Scala you first have to address how to start \"thinking in Scala\".\n\nIn this presentation from JAXConf2012, Ted Neward will show you how to do just that by helping you figure out functional approaches, yet without abandoning objects. Additionally, Neward will review some classic GOF patterns, as well as start exploring new Scala patterns.\n\n** Tons more content from JAXConf2012 and other open source discussions available at  http://mrkn.co/txtch"
