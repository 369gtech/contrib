description: "In early October Google, Adobe, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, HP, Mozilla, Opera, Nokia, and W3C partnered to launch Web Platform - a new, comprehensive wiki designed to be the premier hub for web development knowledge. An open community, anyone can participate in the development of webplatform.org, and help make the web better for everyone. In this talk Peter Lubbers, from Google, goes over how Web Platform came to be, how it works, and how you can begin participating right now.\n\n This talk was given in front of the San Francisco HTML5 Usergroup on October 18, 2012, and was sponsored by Marakana, Adobe, Kaazing, Ludei, and O'Reilly"
