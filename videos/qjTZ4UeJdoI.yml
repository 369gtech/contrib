How can an overgrown message bus be getting this much buzz? Well, because Kafka is merely the center of a rich streaming data platform that invites detailed exploration.\nIn this talk, we’ll look at the entire streaming platform provided by Apache Kafka and the Confluent community components. Starting with a lonely key-value pair, we’ll build up topics, partitioning, replication, and low-level Producer and Consumer APIs. We’ll group consumers into elastically scalable, fault-tolerant application clusters, then layer on more sophisticated stream processing APIs like Kafka Streams and ksqlDB. We’ll help teams collaborate around data formats with schema management. We’ll integrate with legacy systems without writing custom code.\nBy the time we’re done, the open-source project we thought was Big Data’s answer to message queues will have become an enterprise-grade [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:48 Events\n04:03 The log\n05:55 Immutable event log\n06:27 Topics\n08:18 Partitions\n09:10 PUB/SUB\n17:00 Brokers and replications\n19:01 Streaming pipelines\n28:50 Demo\n37:22 Summary\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/2020/sessions/1559/kafka-as-a-platform-the-ecosystem-from-the-ground-up\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Kafka #Apache #ApacheKafka #ksqlDB #APIs #Streams #Confluent\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
