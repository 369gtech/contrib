description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nUncovering a Sophisticated Kubernetes Attack in Real-Time - Jed Salazar & Natália Réka Ivánkó, Isovalent\n\nAs Kubernetes adoption continues to explode, the threat actors working on attacks are growing in sophistication. Simple mitigations and security best practices are no longer sufficient alone to protect production workloads. While tools like vulnerability scanning, signed container images, and distroless containers help, constant monitoring must take place in a running environment to ensure it remains safe from compromise. eBPF, an emerging Linux kernel technology, provides us unique visibility directly into any Kubernetes pod. Because pods on a node share a single kernel, a single eBPF program has full visibility to the entire node’s workloads. We’ll show how using such a program gives us the network and process-level visibility to detect and a live sophisticated attack on our cluster. We’ll finish by showcasing how security teams can easily put these same tools to use to protect their critical Kubernetes environments from threats."
