description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - "Explorations in Cooperative, Distributed Systems with Uber''s Ringpop" by Jeff Wolski - Supporting the growth of Uber''s product, business and systems necessitated a new way to think about its dispatching systems. Availability is taken extremely seriously. Manual operational intervention should be kept to a minimum. And scaling is a continuous exercise and should be possible with little effort. With these tenets in mind, we developed Ringpop. Ringpop is a library that brings cooperation and coordination to distributed applications. In this talk, you''ll hear about gossip protocols, consistent hashing and the fun ways we applied Ringpop to distributed systems programming! Join me!'
