description: "Migrating legacy apps to the cloud can be daunting! Techniques, tools, and patterns exist to aid with the journey. We spoke last year about the wheel of transformation on just such topics. What if you have 100s (or 1000s?) of application to migrate? How do you scale your teams, and processes to rapidly transform applications to be cloud friendly, and beyond? We have field tested ways that can help, and well show you how it can be done. Well talk about how you can use funnels and buckets to move applications. How mobs, pathfinders, and mitosis can scale your migration efforts. And even how you can unleash a cat on your code to prowl for problems and traps.\n\nSpeakers:\nShaun Anderson\nAdvisory Solutions Architect, Pivotal\nRohit Kelapure\nAdvisory Solution Architect, Pivotal\nJoe Szodfridt\nManaging Principal Solutions Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
