description: "This week I discuss some reasons you should care about optimization and some common fallacies regarding optimization.\n\nThe program I'm referring to was stb_image_resize (actually not a program but a library) https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image_resize.h the guy who wrote the fast algorithm is Fabian Giesen: https://twitter.com/rygorous who is super smart, but I misspoke when I said he is a co-worker. I don't have any co-workers, I'm a student!\n\nNew video every Thursday. Question? Leave a comment below, or ask me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VinoBS"
