description: "Freedom sounds like a good idea but there's a reason why you'd want a fence near a ravine and a speed limit on a car. One might even call it common sense. The problem is that machine learning models don't typically have that and the results can be disastrous. This talk is about celebrating constraints on models in order to improve their applications.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
