language: English
recordingDate: 1574366671
description: "Presented at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh.\n\nGovernance is a recurring problem whenever you have multiple people that have to come to a decision. Formal or informal, deciding what kind of pizza to get with your friends or determining the foreign policy of a nation-state, decisions have to be made and not everybody is going to like the final choice.\n\nWe can use blockchain technology to vote, govern, and even execute contracts. With Polkadot, we can, Ouroboros-like, vote and modify the blockchain itself!\n\nIn this workshop, we'll discuss -\n1. What is meant by \"governance\", \"autonomous governance\", and \"on-chain governance\"?\n2. Problems with previous blockchain governance schemes (e.g. the Bitcoin - Bitcoin Cash split, TheDAO and Ethereum Classic, etc.)\n3. Why and how Polkadot solves these problems (and the trade-offs made in order to solve them)\n* Basic stake-weighted voting\n* Adaptive quorum biasing\n* Lock-vote multiplying\n* Delayed vote enactment\n* The Polkadot Council\n\nWe'll then actually participate in governance -\n\n1. Submit various referenda with different proposals\n2. Voting on differently-biased referenda\n3. Voting with different time weighting\n\nPresented by Bill Laboon of the University of Pittsburgh."
