title: 'Juan Ignacio Dopazo: Internationalize your web apps | JSConf.ar 2014'
recordingDate: 1432348993
description: "Traditionally, rendering of our web applications would be done on the server, where there are lots of established internationalization tools and libraries. However with the rise of single page apps (SPAs), user interfaces are being rendered in the browser using JavaScript. In this talk we'll be introducing FormatJS: a collection of JavaScript libraries for internationalization that are focused on formatting numbers, dates, and strings. We'll do a walkthrough of JavaScript's Intl API and some of the core libraries we've developed, as well as a set of integrations for Handlebars, Dust and React. Finally, we'll discuss how these tools can be useful even if your application is only written in one language.\n\nhttps://www.jsconfar.com/"
