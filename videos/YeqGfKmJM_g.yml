title: 'KotlinConf 2019: Putting Down the Golden Hammer by Huyen Tue Dao'

description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nWhen learning a new language, it is easy to get distracted by all the new syntax and fun constructs and to start using our new glittering, golden hammer everywhere. However, over time the code we write now often looks quite different than when we started. Through time, trial, and a bit of error we learn when to put down that hammer (even though it is fun and shiny).\n\nIn this session I'd like to share some ways that I've changed my approach to different features and utilities over almost 3 years of developing in Kotlin full-time. We'll talk about the fun and shiny side of these features and then examine how we can overuse and even abuse them: when writing slick, clever code can affect maintainability and readability and when not understanding the underlying implementation might lead to performance issues.\n\nIn the end, we'll see that recognizing these potential issues and avoiding them leads to even better and even more fun Kotlin.\n\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nHuyen Tue Dao is an Android developer and Google Developer Expert for Android and Kotlin.
