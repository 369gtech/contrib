description: "With how many apps are running in the cloud, hacking these instances becomes easier with a simple vulnerability due to an unsanitized user input. In this talk, weâ€™ll discuss a number of different methods that helped us exfil data from different applications using Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Using these methods, we were able to hack some of the major transportation, hospitality, and social media companies and make $50,000 in rewards in 3 months.\n\n\n\n\nBen Sadeghipour\nBen is the Hacker Operations Lead at HackerOne by day, and a hacker by night.
