description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nApril,  3 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\njQuery is a JavaScript library that stands out among its competitors\r\nbecause it is faster, focuses on writing less code, and is very\r\nextensible. In this talk, I will explore jQuery and how to use it. I\r\nwill start off talking about the basics of using jQuery. Then, I will\r\ntalk about building plugins. Finally, time permitting, I will take\r\napart some plugins and talk about how they work, and I will show the\r\nnitty gritty details of the library.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Dmitri Gaskin\r\nDmitri Gaskin drinks code with his cereal for breakfast every\r\nmorning. He's a jQuery whiz and a Drupal know-it-all. He\r\ncontributes patches for both Open Source projects. In the Drupal\r\nworld, he maintains many modules, is on the security team, and is\r\ninvolved in the upcoming Summer of Code as a mentor and\r\nadministrator. Dmitri has given many talks on Drupal and jQuery, in\r\nsuch places as Logitech, Drupalcon and live on a radio show out of\r\nL.A. When Dmitri isn't coding, a very rare occurrence, he is playing\r\nand composing contemporary music. And attending classes in the 6th\r\ngrade. (He's only 12.)"
