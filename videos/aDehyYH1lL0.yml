description: "The landscape of design is never a smooth terrain.\n\nJames White of the Signalnoise Studio had a rough 2015. It was a year of change, peril, emotion and distraction which had ill effects on his output and his company at large. Challenges happen without our permission and these can have serious implications on client and personal work alike.\n\nIn this talk, James tells the story of life’s curveballs and navigating the tricky road of rebuilding himself, his process, his company, and most importantly: rediscovering his artistic drive. Be prepared for stories, laughs, cries, ups, downs, lessons and maybe a little rock n’ roll.\n\nJames White\nArtist and Designer, Signalnoise\nhttp://www.twitter.com/Signalnoise\nhttp://instagram.com/signalnoise\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
