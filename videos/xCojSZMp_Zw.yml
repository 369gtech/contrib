title: 'Terracotta’s OffHeap Explained by Chris Dennis'
language: English
recordingDate: 1447405790
description: "Terracotta open sourced it’s core offheap library earlier this year. Despite being a Terracotta project, it:\n\ndoesn’t use byte code engineering,\ndoesn’t require running a modified JVM.\nDespite being an offheap library, it:\n\ndoesn’t use non-standard APIs or JNI,\ndoesn’t do reflection on core JDK types.\nIt does however:\n\nprovide a library of maps and caches with significantly sub-linear per key heap overheads,\nscale up to 6TB in a single node and 1TB in a single map.\nWhat follows will be an explanation of how well understood CS concepts from managed and unmanaged programing environments combine to produce a stable, reliable, and useful library. There is no secret sauce here, and the source is no longer secret."
