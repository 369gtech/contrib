description: "Building Psychological Safety in SRE Teams\n\nKatherine Lim, Innablr\n\nIn 2015, Google published the results of a two year study into what makes a great teamâ€”Project Aristotle. As engineers, we should all improve psychological safety in our teams. Google and others have produced tools to guide teams to understand and improve their effectiveness. While the studies show that the techniques are effective, there are scenarios where I think the guidelines could be harmful. This talk will cover psychological safety and its relevance for SRE teams, what happens in unsafe teams, why to improve it and how people leaders can help in creating safety. Along with discussing the advantages and pitfalls of each guideline, a framework will be proposed for building psychological safety in diverse SRE teams.\n\nKatherine Lim is a Senior Engineer at Innablr. An experienced DevOps Engineer, Katherine has built infrastructure-as-code and worked at the intersection of Development and Operations for the last 20 years."
