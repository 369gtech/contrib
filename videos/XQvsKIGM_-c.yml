Like other tourist attractions in Italy, the park was forced to close its doors for safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. When the possibility of reopening to visitors was on the horizon in mid 2020, managers of the park had to find a way to keep visitors safe by ensuring social distancing and avoiding any COVID outbreaks. To achieve its goals, the park implemented a cloud native, mobile application called MyPompeii on Apple App Store and Google Play. Join us to learn how Kubernetes, container registry, API gateway, serverless functions and other cloud technologies enabled Park of Pompeii to achieve its ambitious operational goals!"
