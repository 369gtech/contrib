description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia February 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nLiz Rice - VP of open source engineering at Aqua Security\n\nABSTRACT\neBPF has been described as “Superpowers for Linux,” and recently we’ve seen an explosion of tools that use it to power observability, security and more. It's an exciting technology that enables running bespoke programs directly in the kernel. In this talk Liz uses live-coding examples to explore how eBPF programs are loaded and run in the kernel, and how user-space code can communicate with them to extract [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:05 What is eBPF?\n04:34 Eyplore bpf syscalls in bpftrace\n04:39 demo\n06:43 eBPF programs & maps\n09:56 Attach custom code to an event\n10:35 demo\n11:39 How to write eBPF hello world?\n14:50 eBPF hello world\n14:58 demo\n24:40 eBPF maps\n25:37 demo\n31:55 Recreate bpftrace command\n32:05 demo\n34:48 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/february-2021/sessions/1688/a-beginners-guide-to-ebpf\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nLiz Rice • Container Security • https://amzn.to/3oU4iJe\nLiz Rice • Kubernetes Security • https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-security/9781492039075\nCalavera & Fontana • Linux Observability with BPF • https://amzn.to/3yV2yUR\nBrendan Gregg • BPF Performance Tools • https://amzn.to/3B1pxiV\nBrendan Gregg • Systems Performance • https://amzn.to/3ibg28i\nAaron Parecki • OAuth 2.0 Simplified • https://amzn.to/2A3IMOf\nAaron Parecki • OAuth 2.0 Servers • https://amzn.to/3ecHEsz\nAaron Parecki • The Little Book of OAuth 2.0 RFCs • https://amzn.to/3i7qnlC\nErdal Ozkaya • Cybersecurity: The Beginner's Guide • https://amzn.to/2T6OIj3\nRicher & Sanso • OAuth 2 in Action • https://amzn.to/3hXiAH6\nWilson & Hingnikar • Demystifying OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML 2.0 • https://amzn.to/2U8iLY2\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#eBPF #BPF #ExtendedBPF #Observability #Linux #GoLang #Kernel #BerkeleyPacketFilters #Demo #eBPFdemo \n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
