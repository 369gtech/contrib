Tips navigation time stamp (click to jump ahead): \n1:08 Tip #1\n1:51 Tip #2\n2:49 Tip #3\n3:27 Tip #4\n4:09 Tip #5\nHey, what’s up? I’m Marian and my passion is to create the web and help you be part of it.\nI’m also a proud mentor and helped so many people jumpstart their web developer career or to improve it.\nBefore I’ll reveal to you 10 tips on how to become a web developer without knowing how to code, I want to mention that I’m a living proof that those tips do work.\nMy last 4 clients hired me to do things I didn’t know how to do at the time of the interview. I’ve landed my first job as a web developer without knowing anything about coding. I didn’t even know what FTP was, it was the first time I was hearing that word. I had to ask the employer to spell it for me to make sure we’re on the same page, while I was taking notes. I’ll share this story with you in another video with my journey from nothing, being the poorest kid that couldn’t afford to take the bus and I had to run my way through the city to making my first impossible dream come true. I drive the quickest car in the world, a Tesla and I’m extremely proud of it.\n\n\n## Help us help you and others by subscribing to our YouTube channel using the following link:\nhttp://youtube.com/codetap?sub_confirmation=1\n\n## Or like our page on FaceBook:\nhttps://facebook.com/codetap\n\n# Related playlists:\n- for complete beginners\nBefore we start coding\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlgRhtOkjmmAnC-KqyZ72etjPD33pPw_9\n\neveryone can code - the beginning\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlgRhtOkjmmChKPBLToLu-scD1GIvzwQJ\n\n- for ones that know a bit about coding\nLearn to Code like a PRO for beginners\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlgRhtOkjmmBo5GJsUvclXs5mPIIsBczX\n\nYour resume online for free using HTML5 and CSS3\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlgRhtOkjmmDYRVs9jFwV4nkbCx8Q5wiP\n\n# Powered by \nhttp://codetap.io and http://bitbee.uk\n\n# Free resources\nW3Schools where you can discover HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/\n\nFree Code Camp - Amazing community where you can test your skills in well prepared challenges\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/"
