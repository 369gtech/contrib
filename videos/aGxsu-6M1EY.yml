title: 'Real Impact Testing Analysis for JVM Developers by Raquel Pau'
recordingDate: 1522160929
description: "Test Impact Analysis (TIA) is a modern way of speeding up the test automation phase of a build. It works by analyzing the call-graph of the source code to work out which tests should be run after a change to production code. Microsoft has done some extensive work on this approach, but itâ€™s also possible for development teams to implement something useful quite cheaply.\nTools for TIA are especially useful for mono-repos: a common practice in big companies (e.g Google or Microsoft) that consist of storing all the private project dependencies as part of the same Git repository.\nIn this session, we will learn how to build an open source tool such as junit4git (https://github.com/rpau/junit4git) using JUnit extensions that ignore those tests that are not related with your last changes in your Git repository."
