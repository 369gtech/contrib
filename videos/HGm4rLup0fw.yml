description: "Full Title: Distributed, Scalable, Fault-Tolerant Video Streaming with Riak Core, Elixir, and Kubernetes\n\n\nAt Savi Solutions, we were tasked with building a fault-tolerant, highly scalable video streaming platform with minimal operational costs. Elixir and Erlang VM (BEAM), coupled with Riak Core, provide a perfect fit by allowing distributed services, consistent hashing, routing, sharding, replicating, and near-linear scalability through adecentralized distribution of work."
