description: "Welcome to the post-mobile world, where people are visiting your site through smartphones, tablets, netbooks, desktop screens, or even that 9999-pixel-wide plasma TV they just bought. \nHow do we make the site look OK on all those platforms? That's what \"responsive\" is all about. Furthermore, how do we structure our work so that our site is still changeable, accessible, and HTML5-ready? In this seminar, we'll address all of these questions."
