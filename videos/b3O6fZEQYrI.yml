description: "\"Python Emergency Remote Teaching\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Ni\nOnline\n\nBy Fernando Masanori Ashikaga\n\nDuring the pandemic lockdown of COVID-19, we found a very different context from the usual: a) students with much more time available for learning b) many students who did not have a personal computer and could only access classes by cell phone c) difficulty to realistically assess learning. In this lecture we will present the real experiences in a traditional programming course given during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
