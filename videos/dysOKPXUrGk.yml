description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay, 15 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nKen Ingham, Ph.D. will describe the architecture and motivation behind the\ndevelopment of Amazability, Inc.'s Adept1 product. The Adept1 performs\nnatural language analysis and interprets spoken words and phrases or typed\ninput. It accepts and interprets verbal commands and responds with high\nquality speech. The Adept1 is equipped with voice recognition and\ntext-to-speech output that dynamically adapts multilingual spoken output to\ncontext. The Adept1 offers such applications as word processing, email,\naddress book, web browsing, and access to an online library of thousands of\nbooks. These applications along with others have been developed from the\nground up to work with speech and have a common command language throughout.\nThey can be employed using ordinary speech or typed words and sentences.\nThus the product represents a foundation for implementing practical natural\nlanguage transaction processing where simple English phrases and sentences\nare interpreted to command a sequence of complex operations. While the\nCompany's founders are offering a vehicle that can be used as a full\nprogrammer's workstation, the operating system is hidden with all\napplications designed to be used by person's with minimal or no technical\nbackground. The Adept1 will be demonstrated and a roadmap for future\napplications will be given.\n\nThis talk will be taped. \n\nSpeaker: Ken Ingham, Ph.D."
