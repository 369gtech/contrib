The Memento design pattern provides a way to store previous states of an Object easily.\n\nIt has 3 main classes:\n\n1. Memento: The basic object that is stored in different states.\_\n\n2. Originator: Sets and Gets values from the currently targeted Memento. Creates new Mementos and assigns current values to them.\_\n\n3. Caretaker: Holds an ArrayList that contains all previous versions of the Memento. It can store and retrieve stored Mementos. \n\nAll of the code is above to help you learn."
