The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nWhere's My Container? Visualizing the GitOps Container Journey at Microsoft - Andre Briggs & Samiya Akhtar, Microsoft \n\nGitOps has become the de facto approach for enabling simple, secure, and auditable deployments. When you deploy to multiple Kubernetes clusters, knowing where your services are in the GitOps journey can be challenging. It can be almost impossible to track permutations of service versions across clusters with current tools available.  In the session you will:  • See a comprehensive dashboard view of a container’s journey from code check-in to deployment on Kubernetes clusters • Learn concrete patterns for testing in production with GitOps and deployment rings • See a new automation tool that can be used to deploy a seamless end-to-end GitOps workflow.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zes5"
