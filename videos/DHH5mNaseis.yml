description: "Sometimes, when writing programs, we tend to use lots of polymorphic types. That's good! We can reuse those pieces, thanks to the types. But it can be difficult sometimes, when writing a program, to see how the polymorphic types should exactly fit together, given the things in scope haskell.org. HDD, or Hole Driven Development, is an approach which uses different types of hole to incrementally step toward a solution by leveraging the Haskell compiler and the information provided by its type inference engine - sort of like having a tour guide. HDD provides you with a compiling program, as well as information about the types you are working on, each step along the path to a final solution.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference and YOW!
