description: "Deep learning models now emerge in multiple domains. The question data scientists and users always ask is \"Why does it work?\". Explaining decisions from neural networks is vital for model improvements and analysis, and users' adoption. In this talk, I will explain interpretability methods implementations with TF2.0 and introduce tf-explain, a TF2.0 library for interpretability.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
