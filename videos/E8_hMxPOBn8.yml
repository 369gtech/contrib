description: "Keynote: Getting Permission or Asking Forgiveness? - Liz Rice, Technology Evangelist, Aqua Security\_\n\nIn this talk we’ll explore how permissions work in Kubernetes. If we think of Kubernetes as a distributed operating system, what's the equivalent of the read, write and execute permissions we see when we list files on Linux?\n\nAbout Liz Rice\nLiz Rice is the technology evangelist at container security specialists Aqua Security, where she works on container-related open source projects including kube-bench and kube-hunter. Last year she was Co-Chair of the CNCF’s KubeCon + CloudNativeCon events in Copenhagen, Shanghai and Seattle. She has a wealth of software development, team, and product management experience from working on network protocols and distributed systems, and in digital technology sectors such as VOD, music, and VoIP. When not writing code, or talking about it, Liz loves riding bikes in places with better weather than her native London, and competing in virtual races on Zwift."
