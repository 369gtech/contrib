title: 'Matthijs Brouns - 10x smaller docker containers for Data Science | PyData Eindhoven 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1610574246
description: "If you work with Docker on a regular basis you've probably been told that you should try to keep your container images small. We generally prefer smaller images because they upload faster and take up less disk space.\n\nIn this talk we'll try to build the smallest possible docker image, containing a basic PyData tools stack that includes Matplotlib, Scipy, Numpy and Scikit-learn.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
