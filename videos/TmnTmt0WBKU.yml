description: "This video was recorded at Lambda Days 2019 http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019\n\nGet involved in Lambda Days' next conference http://www.lambdadays.org\n\n---\n\n(DYS)FUNCTIONAL DDD\nby Jarek Ratajski\n\nABSTRACT\nDomain Driven Design patterns are commonly used in business applications.\nThere is, however, a visible mismatch when we look at them from a functional programming perspective. Some concepts seem to fit perfectly: like event sourcing. Some, however, seem to be built around mutability or side effects like aggregates or commands in CQRS. Some are just hard to grasp like domain events, integration events.\n\nIn this talk we will try to revisit the core concepts of DDD from a functional perspective and build a simple system using a little bit more functional approach.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/jarek-ratajski\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JAREK RATAJSKI\nJava developer with a functional heart \n\nJVM Developer since 1999\n\nMore on Jarek Ratajski: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/jarek-ratajski\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
