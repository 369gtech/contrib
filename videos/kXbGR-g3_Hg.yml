description: "Are you being asked to put more cloud in your strategy? If you’re like most people, the answer is a definite yes. The word “cloud” can mean so many things, however, that making an actionable strategy is impossible. At Pivotal, we divide cloud into two distinct parts: migrating as many legacy applications into SaaS as possible and focusing on perfecting the software you build in-house that runs your business. Gartner is predicting (http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3119717) that by 2020, 75% of applications used to support digital businesses will be built in-house. If you’re one of these companies, you’ll need to quickly evaluate how you develop and run your custom written software.\n\nWe believe that soon, every company will either be a software company or losing to a competitor who is. It’s time to focus on the craft of managing the software development life-cycle, and this brief, but dense webinar will help launch your efforts to become a software defined business.\n\nJoin us for the first installment of this 3 part webinar session: The Greenfield Journey (http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/features/the-purity-tyranny-of-a-blank-screen-the-greenfield-journey-part-2) - when you're starting with a “blank screen,“ how can you make sure you're successful enough to be given permission to work on the next project? Unfettered by existing applications you have a lot of freedom but will need to select the right kind of project, staff it appropriately, and ensure you're selecting the right technologies and practices to avoid incurring technical debt that can strip out all the advantages of being cloud native.\n\nSpeaker: Michael Coté, Director, Technical Marketing, Pivotal"
