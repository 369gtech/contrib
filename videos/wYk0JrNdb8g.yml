description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph\nhttp://gotocph.com\n\nThomas Vitale - Senior Software Engineer, Author of \"Cloud Native Spring in Action\" and Certified Red Hat Enterprise Application Developer\n\nABSTRACT\nDo you want to use a microservices architecture? Are you looking for a solution to manage access to single services from clients? How can you ensure resilience and security for your entire system?\nSpring Cloud Gateway is a project based on Reactor, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Boot which provides an effective way to route traffic to your APIs and address cross-cutting concerns.\nIn this session, Thomas will show you how to configure an API gateway to route traffic to your microservices architecture and implement solutions to improve the resilience of your system with patterns like circuit breakers, retries, fallbacks, and rate limiters using Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker and Resilience4J. Since the gateway is the entry point of your system, it’s also an excellent candidate to implement security concerns like user authentication. He'll show you how to do that with Spring Security, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, relying on Spring Redis Reactive [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:24 API gateway\n05:34 Demo\n14:38 Routing\n14:50 Resilience\n15:32 Retry\n15:51 Demo\n18:04 Circuit breaker\n20:10 Demo\n27:17 User authentication\n33:10 Demo\n40:34 Observability\n43:08 Outro\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2021/sessions/1956/spring-cloud-gateway-resilience-and-security\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nThomas Vitale • Cloud Native Spring in Action (available soon) • https://amzn.to/3kLu1ns\nAaron Parecki • OAuth 2.0 Simplified • https://amzn.to/2A3IMOf\nAaron Parecki • OAuth 2.0 Servers • https://amzn.to/3ecHEsz\nAaron Parecki • The Little Book of OAuth 2.0 RFCs • https://amzn.to/3i7qnlC\nErdal Ozkaya • Cybersecurity: The Beginner's Guide • https://amzn.to/2T6OIj3\nRicher & Sanso • OAuth 2 in Action • https://amzn.to/3hXiAH6\nWilson & Hingnikar • Demystifying OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML 2.0 • https://amzn.to/2U8iLY2\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Spring #SpringCloud #Security #Resilience #Microservices #MicroserviceArchitecture #CloudNative #Observability #SpringCloudGateway #Reactor #SpringWebFlux #WebFlux #SpringBoot #APIs #Resilience4J #OAuth2 #OpenID #OpenIDConnect #SpringRedisReactive\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
