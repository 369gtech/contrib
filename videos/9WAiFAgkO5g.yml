recordingDate: 1511811509
description: "DevOps Handbook Experiments in Accelerating Delivery\n\nJim Grafmeyer, Digital Solutions Architect, Nationwide \nCindy Payne, Director IT Application Development, Nationwide \n\nContinuing the Nationwide journey from the first 3 years, this focuses on the experiments which are based on areas from the DevOps Handbook and the results achieved working with 2 model line teams. The experiments include:\n- MInimize WIP\n- Fast and Reliable Automated Tests\n- Automate/Enable Low Risk Releases\n- Continuous Flow\n- Continuous Automated Feedback Loops\n\nResults (to date) include:\n- significant reduction in lead time (over 60%)\n- increased frequency in deployment\n- significant reduction in time to run automated tests (20X factor)\n- integrating security and performance testing into CI/CD flow\n- reduction of manual activities, waste and wait states\n\n\nThis will include technology enablers (e.g. Docker) and collaboration enablers like ChatOps and GitHub and also the SRE role in the experiments. \n\nWe will also discuss the experiment design and interaction model including the collaboration and balance between practitioner input and Systems Thinking ( https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/systems-thinking-carmen-deardo ) and also culture ( https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/devops-culture-changes-start-respect-people-carmen-deardo ).\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
