recordingDate: 1499244232
description: "React Native is a JavaScript framework for mobile apps by Facebook and allows developers to create “native apps” on iOS and Android.\n\nThis talks shows how functional programmers can leverage the full power of React Native in a functional and typed way by using modern tools like Fable and elmish. Fable is a powerful F# to JavaScript compiler and allows to write the React Native app in F#. Elmish on the other hand is library that brings the popular “Elm architecture” to F#. Together these tools build an excellent foundation for modern app development."
