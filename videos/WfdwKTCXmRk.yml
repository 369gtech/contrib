description: "Java 8 was one of the most important Java releases ever... but still wasn't free of bugs, or just places where things could've been done better.\n\nIn this session, we'll go through a quick post-mortem session and explore what went wrong with the Stream API, Lambda Expressions, and much more, along with ways how we can address those problems."
