description: "Change in large organizations can be very hard and slow to realize. Sessions that take continuous integration, TDD/BDD, and agile-anything for granted can be very discouraging for developers stuck in such organizations. An old culture can prevent new tools and techniques from taking root. Old tools can slow down the pace of development. Old processes can make even the smallest issue a catastrophe. This session talks about the speakerâ€™s experiences in large organizations and the small steps you can take to break down cultural, procedural, and technical barriers. A real-world project serves as the backdrop for the session.\n\nSpeaker:\nSterling Greene, Principal Engineer, Gradle Inc\nSterling is a core developer for Gradle. He has been a software engineer for nearly 10 years. He has helped lead transformative change in large organizations to improve quality, delivery speed and development costs. Gradle underpinned the automation of old processes and the transition into a continuous integration/delivery pipeline. Recently, he has been focused on making Gradle a go to build tool for native applications."
