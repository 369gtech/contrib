description: "This talk will feature a few off-the-beaten-path applications of APIs. Since the combination of Django and DRF makes it so easy to get a simple API running, it becomes a very powerful, flexible, and expandable tool for a variety of uses. The only thing these applications may have in common is their need to share data across the web. Whether you have not yet tested the waters of Django Rest Framework or you are a DRF veteran, this talk will inspire you to think both big and small when considering its potential uses.\n\nEVENT: \n\nDjangoCon US 2017\n\nSPEAKER: \n\nCharlotte Mays\n\nPERMISSIONS: \n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6tR5TffP0w"
