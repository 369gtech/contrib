title: 'Wix Engineering Podcast, episode 13: CI Police'
recordingDate: 1624365127
description: "How do you get all the divisions, teams, employees and projects in a company to follow a company-wide requirement? You can email everyone, but good luck getting them to read it. You can talk to everybody individually, if you have unlimited free time on your hands. \n\nLast year, Roy Sommer and his team members decided they needed a better way. So they founded CI Police."
