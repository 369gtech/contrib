description: 'There is a common thread in advancements in cloud computing – they enable a focus on applications rather than the machines running them. Containers, one of the most topical areas in cloud computing, are the next evolutionary step in virtualization. Companies of every size and from all industries are embracing containers to deliver highly available applications with greater agility in the development, test and deployment cycle. This session will cover various phases of application migration to the cloud using Azure container technologies.
