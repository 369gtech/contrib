description: "Apache jclouds is an open source multicloud toolkit for the Java platform that gives you the freedom to create applications that are portable across clouds while giving you full control for using cloud-specific features. There is a great community behind this toolkit working together to provide a better experience for developers in the cloud. Their goal is to simplify the control of many different clouds while still giving you the freedom to use cloud-specific features. The result is a toolkit that enables developers to write better code, in a shorter period of time, that works with many clouds. Attend this session to learn what jclouds can do for you.\n\n\nAuthor:\nEverett Toews\nI'm a Developer Advocate at Rackspace making OpenStack and the Rackspace Cloud easy to use for developers and operators. Sometimes developer, sometimes advocate, and sometimes operator. I'm a committer and PMC on Apache jclouds, and co-author of the OpenStack Operations Guide from O'Reilly. In the past I've developed web applications, taught workshops at conferences including SXSW and Gluecon, and presented at conferences including OSCON and the OpenStack Summits. I love spending time with my family. If it's calm outside, we launch rockets. If it's windy, we fly kites.\nView more trainings by Everett Toews at https://www.parleys.com/author/everett-toews-3\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
