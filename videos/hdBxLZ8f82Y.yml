description: "In this live-coding session, John demonstrates how software engineering design principles and practices can be applied to modern test automation. He automated a number of realistic BDD scenarios against a real-world application, using both UI and REST-API automation, and showed how the powerful Screenplay pattern can be used to make your automated acceptance tests cleaner, more scalable and more reusable.\n\nThe key technologies John used included: Java, Cucumber, Serenity BDD, the Screenplay Pattern, WebDriver and RestAssured.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2019, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
