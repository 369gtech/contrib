description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/322PlZf\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\n“Domain Driven Design is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model.”\nWhile there are many resources on the web about the DDD, they are generally theoretical rather than useful practical guides. One reason is that a DDD implementation quite varies depending on your domain and culture. However, it is still possible to provide some explicit rules those can help you while designing your code base.\nThis talk starts by introducing the DDD and providing a layering model based on the DDD and the Clean Architecture. It then introduces the core building of an application built on the DDD principles.\nIn the second part of the talk, it shows some strict coding rules for the core building blocks with real code examples and suggestions. These rules are essential to build a large scale application implements DDD patterns & practices.\nWhile the solution structure and code samples are based on .NET and C#, the talk is useful for developers and architects working with any server side technology."
