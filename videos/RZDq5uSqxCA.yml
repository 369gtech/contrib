There are a lot of misconceptions out there about how to license hardware designs. This talk will show you some of the common misunderstandings, highlight the open questions, propose some collective action to fix the situation and yes - of course - also explain how things are done the right way. \n\nThe talk will be a summary and extended version of the public FAQ \"Why are Creative Commons Non Commercial licenses not Open Source and a big problem in hardware and product design\".\n\nFAQ & Slides: https://mifactori.de/non-commercial-is-not-open-source/\n\n###########\n\nFollow us on Social Media and join the Community!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fossbckstg​\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/86530...​\n\nFOSS Backstage is an event by Plain Schwarz – https://plainschwarz.com"
