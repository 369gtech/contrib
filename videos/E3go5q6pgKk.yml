title: 'Against all odds, a cloudless smart home by  Kai Kreuzer'

description: "In the quickly growing smart home market, the industry has come up with a vast number of standards, protocols and products. Be it Apple HomeKit, Amazon Echo or Google Home, they usually don't play well together and there is hardly any interoperability across vendors. What is more, the only thing they connect to is their respective cloud service, which lets a typical smart home depend on dozens of remote servers - clearly not a desirable setup as it affects reliability, latency, data privacy, longevity and more.\n\nBut is there any other option? Yes! The Eclipse SmartHome project connects these isolated silos and promotes the concept of an \"Intranet of Things\". As an independent open source project, it is vendor-neutral and community-driven and a nucleus for innovation. In this talk, you gain an overview of the project and dive into some of its latest cool features, such as an IFTTT-like rule engine and offline voice capabilities. In a live coding session you learn how to include your own custom devices and how to create powerful automation rules.\n\nKai Kreuzer is a Java and OSGi expert, a Home Automation enthusiast, founder of openHAB.org, project lead of Eclipse SmartHome and co-lead of the Eclipse IoT top-level project. He works as a Developer Evangelist in the Connected Home department of Deutsche Telekom AG and is a regular speaker at international conferences."
