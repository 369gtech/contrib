description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #26\n14 August 2019\nSponsored and Hosted by booking.com\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nLight-field photography enables to record 4D images, containing angular information alongside spatial information of the scene. One of the most well-known applications for light-field is post-capture refocusing. This talk presents a novel implementation of digital refocusing based on sparse angular information using neural networks. This allows recording high spatial resolution in favor of the angular resolution, thus, enabling to design compact and simple cameras.\n\nShe is an MSc. graduate from Tel Aviv University in electrical engineering, majoring in computer vision, image processing and deep learning. \n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
