description: "Speaker: Greg Turnquist\nRecently, a friend of mine tweeted out a challenge:\n\n\"Name a framework in which you can create a new app expose a REST service with a database and deploy it to the cloud in five minutes. #grails\"\n\nThe moment I spotted that tweet, I responded, \"Spring Boot + Spring Data REST\"! I realized he was kindly pointing out how easy it is to build RESTful services with Grails (a great framework). But I couldn't resist showing the ease and power of Spring Data REST.\n\nTo prove my point, I couldn't resisting crafting a screencast. In the linked screencast, I show how Ã¼ber easy Spring has made it to pick the parts for your app from http://start.spring.io, define your domain, and then export them as a hypermedia-driven RESTful service.\n\nPlease enjoy!"
