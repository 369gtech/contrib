description: "0:00:00 - Introduction\n0:01:15 - SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking and Genomic Data Visualization\n0:42:40 - Q&A\n\nThe discovery of faster spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants(e.g., UK variant B.1.1.7, South African variant B.1.351) has raised alarm. Although most mutations in variants do not introduce any meaningful changes, some can alter the characteristics of the virus, for instance, helping the virus to spread more easily, reinfecting people who have had COVID-19 before, and/or reducing the sensitivity to antibody therapeutics or vaccines. Scientists need to detect and track these variants of concern as soon as possible so as to inform public health policy and the pandemic response in each region.\n\nA major challenge is that 100,000s of virus genomes are being uploaded into the GISAID database on a monthly basis, making this task of regularly tracking emerging variants insurmountable for many scientists.\n\nCOVID-19 CoV Genetics (COVID CG) is a free, open-source online tool to help scientists and public health officials to track viral variants more easily. COVID CG now enables users to manipulate and visualize 1,000,000+ SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Such a resource is critical for the current pandemic and future outbreaks where pathogens are routinely tracked and sequenced. This talk will:\n\n1) Give an introduction to SARS-CoV-2 biology, genomic sequencing, and why we care about tracking mutations within SARS-CoV-2.\n\n2)Walk through the process of building COVID CG, and the challenges and potential of visualizing pathogen genomics\n\n3)Discuss the ever-closer relationship between computers and biology, and how people with data science, data visualization, and UI/UX skills can play a major role in advancing science, therapeutics, and global health.\n\nRelevant links:\nCOVID-19 CG site:https://covidcg.org\nPaper:https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63409\nData:https://www.gisaid.org/\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\nAlbert Tian Chen is an associate computational biologist in the Vector Engineering group at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Albert is a project lead for the COVID-19 CG browser and contributes to the gene therapy efforts of the Vector Engineering group. He has prior experience in web development, and for the last 5 years has been working in academic research, both at the dry-lab (data science, engineering) and the wet-lab(hands-on, running experiments)\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
