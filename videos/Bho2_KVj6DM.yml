title: 'The Java Virtual Machine Is Over: The Polyglot Virtual Machine Is Here'

description: "Ever since Java’s inception, in 1995, people have been compiling languages that aren’t Java to bytecode and deploying them on the JVM. Lately we are seeing an explosion in JVM languages. This is partly, but not only, because of Java 7, the first JVM to ship with invokedynamic, which is a quantum leap in polyglot runtime implementation. This session explains why emerging language implementations are becoming more common and more feasible to implement on the JVM with satisfactory performance. It tells you how we got there and walks through the technology already in place (such as invokedynamic) and that which is in progress. The future for the JVM is bright indeed.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMarcus Lagergren\nMarcus Lagergren has an MSc in computer science from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Lagergren has a background in computer security but has worked with runtimes since 1999. He was one of the founding members of Appeal Virtual Machines, the company that developed the JRockit JVM, which was bought by BEA Systems in 2002. Lagergren has been team lead and architect for the JRockit code generators and has been involved in most other aspects of JVMs over the years. From 2007 to 2010 he worked for Oracle on fast virtualization technology, and since late 2011 has been a member of the Oracle langtools team, investigating dynamic languages on the JVM. Lagergren is also a general runtime futurist, and co-author of the book Oracle JRockit: The Definitive Guide, which, despite the product-centric title, has been praised as the best book ever written on JVM internals in general.\nView more trainings by Marcus Lagergren at https://www.parleys.com/author/marcus-lagergren-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
