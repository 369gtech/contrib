Achieving good test coverage for distributed systems can be a challenge. With so many components and moving pieces, it can be hard for unit tests to catch everything, and system tests become more important. So if you are relying on CRDs to implement your sweet new features, how can you write system tests for them?  Drawing on examples and experiences from testing Kubernetes itself we will see how you can write effective, stable tests for your CRDs, controllers and webhooks.  Weâ€™ll look at what Go libraries you can use, how you can combine them, what to avoid, and what tools you can use to make running these tests ints CI/CD a breeze. \n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuJa"
