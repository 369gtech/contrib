description: "The first principle of Agile manifesto says \"Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.” But, Is our highest priority to delight our customer, or to delight our sponsor. Do we understand who the real customer is and behave accordingly?\n\nI’ve often seen Agile teams producing software aimed to delight: another departments within their organization, an external organization hiring their development services, their management or even their Product Owners. But, are those the ones to be delighted by the product in development?\n\nI believe that software is awesome when it helps creating awesome experiences to the people the organization is serving. To create those delighting experiences is very important to understand who your real customer is and empathize with him.\n\nThis session is aimed to create that awareness and to introduce some practical tools that can help creating a \"Customer Centric” Agile implementation and culture in organizations. I will start the session by explaining what is customer centricity and how it can become the competitive advantage of your business and a powerful reason for adopting Agile. I'll continue with simple tips, and practical examples, which attendees can incorporate into your Agile implementation to empower customer delighting. Such as including “moments of truth” in “Personas” and going from \"User Stories\" to \"Customer Stories\" The listener will get from this session easy-to-apply tools to equip their Agile implementation an extra focus on their real customer to maximize customer satisfaction and create an important foundation for the buy-in of Agile by the business."
