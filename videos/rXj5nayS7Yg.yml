description: "For many companies, understanding what is going on in your business involves lots of data. But, how do you query 10s of billions of data points? How can a company begin to make sense of so much information?\n\nVille Tuulos, Principle Engineer at AdRoll, a company producing tons of big data, demonstrates how AdRoll uses Python to squeeze every bit of performance out of a single high-end server. They manage it with Numba, a new NumPy aware dynamic Python compiler based on LLVM, and thanks to Python, the system can provide a very expressive and developer-friendly API.
