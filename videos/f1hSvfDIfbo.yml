description: "Google Tech Talk\nFebruary 13, 2014\n(more info below)\nPresented by Baron Schwartz (Co-Founder & CEO of VividCortex)\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPredictions are hard to get right, especially when they involve the future. Rather than predict the future, I'll explain how I view the relational and NoSQL database worlds today, especially the MySQL product and community, but including open-source and proprietary data management technologies about which I know enough to get in trouble. I'll explain how my self-image as a practitioner and contributor has changed, especially as I've moved from consulting (where I tell people what they should do) into being a company founder (where I sometimes wish someone would tell me what to do). As for the future, I'll express my preferences for specific outcomes, and try to be careful what I wish for."
