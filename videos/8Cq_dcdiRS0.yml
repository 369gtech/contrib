description: 'This is my story about how I got involved in the Docker hackathon (and won) without knowing Docker at all. I''ll share what technological limitations I had before using Docker and how I managed to solve them, and also some tips to getting started. As a closing, I''ll talk about the Whaleprint project and some key features that we would love to see in docker today.'
