description: "Patricia Kovatch, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai\n\nThrough partnership with researchers, careful analysis of actual usage metrics and benchmarking, modern technologies can be leveraged to decrease the time-to-solution for scientific workflows. The fruits of our collaborative approach have enabled our researchers to tackle more complex scientific questions to better diagnose and treat disease. We aim to increase computational and thus scientific throughput with optimized, scalable and sustainable computational architecture specific for our application workflows. Computational and data challenges associated with genomic sequencing will be used as an example.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
