description: 'You can learn to be a great developer, regardless of being self taught or going through more traditional education avenues. However, when you start your first job in the industry or even begin to work collaboratively on a team, there are certain skills that you''ll need to know that aren''t always covered in school! In this series of livestreams and videos, we''ll dive deep into some of the skills you need to hit the ground running in your new job. In the series to come we will talk about using Git, setting up your development environment in VS code, using collaborative programs like GitHub, mastering the command line in VS code and so much more. Join Scott Hanselman and Sarah, Dr. G, in this introduction to the series!'
