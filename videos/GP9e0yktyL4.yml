description: "by Simone Mainardi\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB2.252A/augmented_network_visibility_with_high_resolution_metrics.webm\n\n\nIn the area of network visibility, having high-resolution metrics is useful to unveil patterns and behaviors that would otherwise be \"averaged out\" in smoother, lower-resolution signals. Visibility tools that have access to packets are, in theory, able to produce metrics up to the packet-by-packet resolution, that is, the best one could hope for. Nevertheless, high-resolution metrics are particularly demanding in terms of storage and this has actually posed a practical upper-limit on the metrics resolution, that rarely offer sub-minute samplings. Fortunately, thanks to the tremendous evolution of big-data stores, it is now possible to rethink network visibility solutions for the generation and storage of high-resolution network metrics. This talk discuss the challenges behind the generation and storage of high-resolution metrics and demonstrates how opensource software ntopng, InfluxDB, and Grafana can be used together to build an effective high-resolution network visibility solution. Intended audience is technical and managerial individuals who are familiar with network visibility. \nPrinciples of network visibility\nMetrics and metrics resolutions\nChallenges behind the generation, storage, and visualization of high-resolution metrics\nOpensource software: ntopng, InfluxDB, Grafana\n\n\n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:50:00+01"
