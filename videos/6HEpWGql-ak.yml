recordingDate: 1499244368
description: "In this session we will look at how we rewrote an application written using some classic ASP, some ASP.NET webforms and VB.NET with multiple databases in multiple SQL Server instances (and zero tests :-() to AWS using Serverless technologies (AWS Lambda, Kinesis, Elastic etc).\n\nWe will look at the challenges we faced, our journey from 6 monthly releases to continuous delivery, monolith to functions, tips and tricks, failures and learnings, from data driven to domain driven. The talk will be supported with live demos with tips on setting up a continuous deployment pipeline and how to monitor such applications in production."
