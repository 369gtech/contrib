description: "What comes to your mind when you hear the word \"type\"? Do you think of an integer or string? Do you think of an object type from your favorite OOP language? Do you think about never ending religious debates regarding static vs dynamic types? Do you realize that these things hardly scratch the surface of what it means to be a \"type\"? Be prepared to understand types on a whole new level. \n\nIn this talk, we will explore type systems. What is a type system? Why are type systems important? How have type systems been influenced by functional programming, category theory, and type theory? We will talk about variance, polymorphisms, higher-kinded types, existential types, algebraic data types, and type classes. \n\nWe will scratch the surface of type theory and learn how logic systems have influenced programming language design.\n\nEVENT:\n\nTechlahoma Events 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJordan Parmer\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nTechlahoma Events Organizer as well as Jordan Parmer provided Coding Tech with the permissions to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsGhJ2pKKYY"
