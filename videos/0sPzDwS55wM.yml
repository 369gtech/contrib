description: "Kotlin is new language growing in popularity as a complement to Java. Its major advantages and features compared to Java are immediately appealing. While it's quick to learn, it also has a lot of small and thoughtful parts which can be harder to discover. This short talk will cover 10 of my favorites with real-world examples. Attendees should come in having seen some Kotlin but looking to learn even more.\n\nJake Wharton is an Android developer at Square working on Square Cash. He has been living with a severe allergy to boilerplate code and bad APIs for years and speaks at conferences all around the world in an effort to educate more about this terrible disease."
