description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS Conference 2017, June 8 https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nAdam Sandor, Container Solutions\n\nCreating a stable and reproducible development environment can be a hassle. The more components you have the less feasible it becomes to run them all together on your laptop. Using Vagrant helps with reproducibility and isolation but putting all components on a single VM is very different from the way they will run in production. Docker comes to the rescue with lightweight containers that isolate each application component with minimal overhead."
