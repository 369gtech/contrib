This causes problems both for productivity: it's hard to collaborate, and reproducibility: which impacts on governance and compliance.\nIn this talk, Mark shares his team’s research comparing the evolution of Software Development & DevOps with that of Data Science & AI. Mark then presents a proposal for an architecture and a set of open source tools [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2018/sessions/583\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocph\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#DataScience #AI #DevOps"
