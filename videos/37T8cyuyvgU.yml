recordingDate: 1535635483
description: "Held on August 28, 2018\n\nIn this session, we showed how to visualize graphs – a powerful, intuitive way to interact with data. Using open source tools like Cytoscape or third party tools, you have several choices on how to visualize and interact with graphs from Oracle Database and big data platforms. Albert discussed why graph visualization is so powerful and how to get started, and Gaby showed a demo of all the steps, using a data set of banks and customer accounts.\n\nHighlights:\n00:00 – Welcome, the story so far. Jean recaps previous sessions (graph intro, architecture, use cases)\n08:25 –Visualizing graphs - Albert shows the “why and how”\n   08:25 - Ways that graph visualization brings powerful new insights about your data\n   11:40 – Libraries and third party tools you can use for visualization (Tom Sawyer, Linkurious)\n   13:00 – Cytoscape, an open source tool for graph analysis and visualization.  Where to download it, how to get started using it with Oracle Database, and using it to manipulate, visualize, and query your graphs.\n20:50 – Demo - Gaby shows how to use Cytoscape to visualize banks and customer accounts.  \n   20:50 - Load data, label vertices, run graph queries, create visual mapping rules \n   29:00 - Use Cytoscape to execute graph analysis such as pagerank, community detection algorithms (label propagation, WCC, group by property)\n   33:15 - Execute PGQL queries in Cytoscape, identify top influencers, get shortest path \n43:00 – Resources, quick preview of Oracle OpenWorld / Code One 2018,  and wrapup\n\nSlides are available here:  https://www.slideshare.net/JeanIhm/how-to-visualize-graphs \n\nThis is the 4th video in a series.
