description: "When developing HTML5 applications, your code is bound to get more complex over time. Employing design patterns like MVC are important for separating concerns and creating more modular and reusable code. Backbone.js is one of the more popular JavaScript frameworks to help you do this. Unfortunately, like most open source, the documentation is a work in progress.\n\nIn this presentation from HTML5DevConf, StackMob's Sid Maestre will walk you through a series of examples that build on each other to show how the moving parts work together, including adding the StackMob JavaScript SDK to persist your data in the cloud in minutes.\n\n** We've got HELLA PRESENTATIONS from HTML5DevConf!
