description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nIt’s a Polyglot World of Stateless Functions and Stateful Actors - Yaron Schneider & Aman Bhardwaj, Microsoft \n\nServerless applications are becoming dominate, but all too often they fall short by only supporting stateless functions, when most applications are polyglot in nature and combine both stateless and stateful services. What’s more when you write code, it's not portable across different clouds and hosting platforms. In this session we will dive into the Distributed Application Runtime, Dapr, an open source, vendor neutral project that has gained community attention as it enables developers to combine highly portable, stateless functions and stateful actors using any language or developer framework of their choice. With built in state management, distributed tracing based on Open Telemetry and pub/sub based on Cloud Events you can take advantage of Dapr to build highly available serverless applications that run on any cloud.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeky"
