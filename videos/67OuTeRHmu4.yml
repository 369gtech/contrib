description: "Keep Ruby Weird 2018 - Cats, The Musical! Algorithmic Song Meow-ification by Beth Haubert\n\nBeth is a software engineer at Flywheel, a web infrastructure startup in Omaha, Nebraska. She’s also a former airborne cryptologic linguist for the US Air Force, fluent in Mandarin. Things you can ask her about include Ruby, cats, board games, BSG, karaoke, and building applications that convert songs into auto-tuned cat meows. Things she’ll have to kill you if you ask her about: the airborne linguist part. Also, she likes to make emojis look like they’re farting."
