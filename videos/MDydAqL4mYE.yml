title: 'Consumer Driven Contracts and Your Microservice Architecture by Marcin Grzejszczak and Josh Long'
language: English
recordingDate: 1501673729
description: "Consumer driven contracts (CDC) are like TDD applied to the API. It’s especially important in the world of microservices. Since it’s driven by consumers, it’s much more user friendly. Of course microservices are really cool, but most people do not take into consideration plenty of potential obstacles that should be tackled. Then instead of frequent, fully automated deploys via a delivery pipeline, you might end up in an asylum due to frequent mental breakdowns caused by production disasters.\n\nWe'll write a system using the CDC approach together with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Contract. We’ll show you how easy it is to write applications that have a consumer driven API and that will allow a developer to speed up the time of writing his better quality software.\n\nMarcin Grzejszczak\nOpen source contributor.
