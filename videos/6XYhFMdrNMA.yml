description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nDeveloping mobile applications, and software in general, is a complex process. You're not only faced with lots of technical challenges to solve, but also many cultural and social challenges. This talk will focus on the latter because these challenges apply to every software development team in a very similar manner. Additionally, these aspects have exponential impact on a software development team's performance. Christian will talk about Runtastic's learnings regarding team, culture and delivering products for more than 200 million users. He will explain what's vital to being a software engineer and also link these requirements to the Agile principles.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
