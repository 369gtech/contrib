description: "Whether you're a coder, designer, or digital content creator - what unites us all is that we spend a majority of our daily lives sitting in a chair in front of a screen. We often don't eat well, don't stay hydrated, stay up late - and needless to say, a lot of us aren't doing a fraction of the exercise necessary to keep our minds and bodies in shape. VR gaming is a great method to put some fun activity in a co-working space or home office. If you think runner's high is a myth, try playing some fast-paced room-scale VR games - those have the reward mechanisms built in! Since last year's Øredev, I've used a biometric sensor to track how weeks of regular VR gaming compare to a regular physical workout and no workout at all - and how all of that affects your sleep patterns as well as your overall physical and mental condition. I've also built what is probably the ultimate home VR gaming setup - and I'll share everything I've learned.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
