title: 'Microservices on the JVM: A Practical Overview'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433231860
description: "There is a lot of chatting going on about the new cool kid on the block: microservices. Although actually not so new, this service-oriented approach to system architecture promises great advantages compared to its monolithic counterparts that are often found in real-life businesses. Unfortunately, it seems that many developers get lost on the way, due to a lack of concrete practical examples. This session shows different implementations of microservices on the JVM and their individual benefits. Come look at Dropwizard, Spring Boot + Java 8, and Play2 + Scala. The attendees will get an idea of how to get started with microservices, how to slice a  monolithic idea  into vertical services, and what the benefits are.\n\n\nAuthors:\n Martin Eigenbrodt\nMartin Eigenbrodt is a senior consultant for software architecture and engineering at innoQ.
