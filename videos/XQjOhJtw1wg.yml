Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nAirbnb Service Discovery: Past, Present, Future (Challenges of Change) - Chase Childers, Airbnb \n\nIn 2013, Airbnb released an open source service discovery solution (SmartStack) and has functioned on the same framework for years. Historically our infrastructure ran on AWS EC2 instances and utilized HAProxy (within Smartstack) for proxying traffic. With a migration to Service Oriented Architecture and Kubernetes, our service discovery must also change. In this presentation we will cover the evolution of our service discovery framework starting with where we started, where we’ve been, where we’ve failed, and where we’re going (hint: Envoy) at Airbnb. This includes both our missteps and our learnings from migrating within a hybrid EC2/Kubernetes world. We’ll dive deep into topics such as challenges of managing and migrating your own service discovery stack, migrating ingress and egress traffic independently, and rolling out infrastructure changes across a massive fleet of services. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaVz"
