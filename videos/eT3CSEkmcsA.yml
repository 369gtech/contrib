description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: Salesforce - Generic Sidecar Injector for Kubernetes \n\nWhen Kubernetes announced the support for Mutating admission controllers in 1.9 release, the sidecar pattern really became a “first-class citizen” of Kubernetes. Many of the infrastructure teams at Salesforce independently chose the Kubernetes mutating admission controller webhook model to dynamically inject sidecars in Kubernetes workloads. This worked well until we realized that each of the teams was writing the same code, debugging the same problems and testing the same code. At that point we took a step back and created a generic way of dealing with injection of sidecars and open sourced it. With very little configuration, any team can create a mutating admission controller without writing any code that works based on annotations and is battle tested. Let's take a look at the demo. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff1a"
