description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/consuming-data-services-with-spring-apps-on-cloud-foundry\n\nApplications running on Cloud Foundry often need to connect to data services such as relational databases, document and data structure stores, and messaging services. Spring Cloud Connectors, Spring Boot and Cloud Foundry make it easy to connect Java and Spring applications to these types of data sources. Spring Boot and the Cloud Foundry Java Buildpack provide auto-configuration capabilities that make it possible to connect to data services with no application code changes for simple use cases, yet back away gracefully when custom configuration of connections is required.\n\nThis talk will cover how these auto-configuration mechanisms work, their limitations, and how to explicitly configure connections when the need arises."
