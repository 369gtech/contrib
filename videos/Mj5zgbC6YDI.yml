A critical component to Lyft’s successful migration is their open source set of CNI plugins which implement a simple, fast, and low latency networking stack tying together multiple Kubernetes clusters into a flat network within AWS Virtual Private Clouds. Paul’s talk takes a deep dive into the design and implementation of Lyft’s multi-cluster Kubernetes platform from a network-centric perspective, including Envoy mesh integration and performance characteristics. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaay"
