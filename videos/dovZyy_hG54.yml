description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotscale.io on April 25th in Paris. More talks on https://www.dotconferences.com/talks\n\nIn this highly technical talk, Spencer explores CockroachDB's distributed transaction model, starting with a tour of the high level architecture of a cluster, from nodes to gateways to stores to ranges to replication. Then he takes a deep dive into the transaction model, including the common concurrency anomalies. He ends up with a complete exploration of how CockroachDB's two isolation levels (snapshot and serializable) deal differently with the write skew concurrency anomaly."
