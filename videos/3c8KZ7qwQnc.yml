title: 'April Jefferson - Design Thinking Workshop: Pass on Perfection'
recordingDate: 1557955488
description: 'When you have struggled to define a minimally viable result then you need a way to not only brainstorm ideas, but also a way to cut the unnecessary waste out. Pass on Perfection is an exercise for discovering and co-creating a solutions or products with what is minimally necessary. It mashes up Yes and… thinking for co-creation, and the essence of The Perfection Game (from the Core Protocols) for negotiation and prioritization in a collaborative round-robin game format. This workshop will provide the opportunity to try out the exercise and give you the opportunity to co-create something you or another participant desires. We’ll share our perfection results and discuss our learnings; including how psychological safety is created in its use. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/keJX6dzr85d with the Ustream Mobile App'
