language: English
recordingDate: 1506326611
description: "Visual Studio 2017 contains many new and exciting features, new C# 7 language features and IDE productivity enhancements to support web and cloud development, Windows app development, cross-platform mobile development and more.\n\nThe latest version of Visual Studio provides cutting-edge tools and technologies to create apps that take advantage of the latest platform capabilities, whether Windows, Android, iOS, or Linux. It's fastest, leanest version of Visual Studio ever.\n\nVS Code is Visual Studio 2017’s little brother. It’s lightweight, it’s free, it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, and it’s a little rambunctious. VS Code aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to its big brother. Being lighter doesn’t mean it’s not better. Most of the serious Angular 2 devs at SSW already choose VS Code as their weapon of choice. Watch as Adam Cogan gives you a tour of these great IDEs and expands your development horizons. This session is guaranteed to make you even more productive and highlight why the Visual Studio family is awesome for developing software."
