title: 'ColdFront17 • Kenneth Rohde Christiansen: Bridging the web and the physical world'
recordingDate: 1509353192
description: "The improvements in size, features and price of hardware has ushered new opportunities in creating small, smart devices (aka internet-of-things) which can be integrated in homes and industries. In these places, the devices can help automate common tasks, as well as give information about the state of things, such as temperature of a machine, air quality etc.\n\nInstalling an app for one such devices might seem fine at first, but it doesn’t scale nicely to 100s of devices, or devices you seldom interact with, like in an industrial setting. Devices might even have different security restrictions, like being locked behind a physical key.\n\nSo how do we communicate with these devices? The web has always been known for its low fraction and easy onboarding. No need to install any software, just type in a URL and off you go. And it has always been very secure with its sandbox system, and companies can even have URLs be restricted to certain WiFi networks (intranet).\n\nIn the last couple of years, the web has taken a quantum leap in usability, with offline support, and many ways to make the experience very app-like. So the question is unavoidable, can the web be the platform to make smart devices succeed?\n\nThe web lives in a sandbox, and its security model has allowed people to trust it and for it to grow enormously over time, but the world is changing around us. There is a growing need to access new hardware capabilities such as sensors or just connect to devices around us.\n\nThe great news is that the web sandbox is growing with new capabilities and with new security models, allowing us to connect to devices via Bluetooth, USB or even talk NFC. There are now even ways to directly get magnetometer readings on Android devices.\n\nIn this talk we will look at this new landscape and how it enables the new wave of smart devices. We will also look at how easy it is to use some of these new APIs.\n\nCome join me for a look at how the web can make your smart devices success\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13urpBTcAnKCi8iOccQfM4nIKDdxQrg5Qj6gymGPkk3s/mobilepresent?slide=id.g24e228bf8a_0_0\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/kennethrohde"
