title: 'How to build  .NET Microservices - Richard Banks'
recordingDate: 1474360882
description: "Thanks to organisations like Netflix, and the need to develop solutions that scale well in the cloud, microservices have become the hot new topic. Yet, for all the talk, there are few practical examples of how you actually build a microservice in .NET.\nIt's time to fix that littlle oversight as we show you how you can build a microservices based solution using .NET, and a number of open source tools (EventStore, RabbitMq and Redis to name a few).\n\nYou'll also get to understand the pros and cons of a microservices solution and consider how a microservices approach might impact how you and your team relate to your customers."
