description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nMarch 9, 2012\r\n\r\nPresented by Henk ten Cate Hoedemaker, Tim Laning, and Jetse Goris.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nLaparascopic (or keyhole) surgery is challenging for surgeons and can be dangerous for patients.  The surgeons who perform these procedures need ongoing training and hands on practice.  The University Medical Centers of Groningen and Leeuwarden in the Netherlands have teamed up with game developer Grendel Games (http://www.surgical-games.com/) to produce a unique solution.  Instead of using expensive, traditional simulators to teach their doctors the motor skills needed for laparoscopic surgery, they have developed a full Nintendo Wii game with customized controls that imitate a surgeon's instruments... but in a non-medical context.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this game unique is the choice to make a virtual game world that offers an immersive storyline, exciting puzzles and pleasing visuals, around the control scheme and motor skills of  laparoscopic surgery. This deliberate change of context is unique for a medical serious game.\r\n\r\nAt the 2010 Game Developers Conference (GDC), the first prototype of this game was presented. Forbes crowned it \"one of the ten games that can change the world.\" The 2010 presentation is one of the most viewed serious games videos in the GDC vault.  \r\n\r\nProject team members Henk ten Cate Hoedemaker, Tim Laning and Jetse Goris will describe their development process and demo the new version of the game and Wii controllers.  Time permitting, local/live attendees will be able test out the redesigned controllers and game.\r\n\r\nBios\r\n\r\nH.O. ten Cate Hoedemaker MD\r\nHenk ten Cate Hoedemaker is a gastrointestinal surgeon at the University Medical Center of Groningen (UMCG) in the Netherlands.
