description: "Speaker(s):\nJatin Lodhia, Manfred Zabarauskas\n\nDescription:\nIt doesn't matter if you're writing a multiplayer Android game, or a simple to-do app, your users are increasingly expanding multi-device access from anywhere.    However, sharing state from highscore lists to to-do lists between devices in a way that works well with spotty network connections is hard, error prone and expensive.   Wouldn't it be great if Google took care of all that, while providing an easy path to expand as your app grows and matures?   \nIn this session, we will show you how to build mobile apps which use new Google technology to simplify data storage, online/offline behavior and synchronization across multiple devices. You'll have full access to the data you store in the Google Cloud platform with app development features and the rich set of data analytics tools to get more use out of your data.   You'll see how Android Studio tooling makes this straightforward, and allows you to bring the full power of Google Cloud Platform to your app as your needs grow. Come away equipped with new tools and skills to make your app better than ever, without writing hundreds of lines of code.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
