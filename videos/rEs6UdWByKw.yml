description: "This session introduces org.ObjectLayout and StructuredArray, a new Java collection library and an array class designed specifically to enable JVMs to optimize memory layout for arrays of objects in a way that closely matches the performance behaviours of arrays of structs in C. org.ObjectLayout works on any JDK (version 6.0 and above), but when \"intrinsified\" in newer JDKs, it brings dead-reckoning and streaming speed to what is in essence an array of Java objects.\n\nThe presentation covers the APIs and design considerations behind them and explains the fundamentals behind logic that can allow Java JDKs to match C on data structure access speeds.\n\nGil Tene\nAZUL SYSTEMS\n@giltene\n\nGil Tene is CTO and co-founder of Azul Systems. He has been involved with virtual machine and runtime technologies for the past 25 years. His pet focus areas include system responsiveness and latency behavior. Gil is a frequent speaker at technology conferences worldwide, and an official JavaOne Rock Star. He pioneered the Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector (C4) that powers Azul's continuously reactive Java platforms. In past lives, he also designed and built operating systems, network switches, firewalls, and laser based mosquito interception systems."
