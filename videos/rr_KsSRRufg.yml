description: "Ethics in design - Where to draw the line and who is to draw it? \n\nIn this talk, Burcu Arsoy is going to share her thoughts on the problem of ethics in design. As designers, we strive to create a better world and most often we find ourselves caught in ethical conflicts. From very practical applications of ethics in design such as dark patterns in UX to the more complicated dilemmas in innovation, She will present a point of view that will make us think and question how to orient ourselves in this controversial subject. \n\nBurcu Arsoy, Senior UX Designer at Designit \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
