title: 'YOW! 2016 CTO Summit Ted Tencza - 5 Things I am Doing Wrong with Distributed Teams...'
language: English
recordingDate: 1514679010
description: "It’s increasingly common that teams are distributed across multiple offices, in different countries, all working on the same product or project. But how do you make this work well? There seem to be a number of readily accepted tenants of conventional wisdom to help deal with leading distributed teams, from seeming good ideas “teams must be co-located” to ones that are purely economic “offshore teams can be run at a far lower cost”.\n\nThis talk will challenge the conventional wisdom around leading distributed teams. I will explore how I have structured distributed teams at finder.com, and explain where and why I deviate from conventional practices (teams are not co-located or bounded by geography for instance). I will show how ignoring or modifying these can produce much better outcomes, happier, more productive teams, and a great culture of distributed work.\n\nI have over 10 years experience leading geographically dispersed teams (in the US, Australia, Manila, and Europe) and growing successful high performing tech teams. I recently set up teams in the Philippines and Poland and will be drawing on that experience for this talk\n\nTed has over 19 years of experience in Software Development, the last 11 of which have been in leadership roles. He is currently leading the finder.com technology team, with developers based in Sydney, Manila, Wroclaw, Milan and Adelaide. Prior to finder.com, Ted was managing multiple distributed teams at Bigcommerce, Atlassian, and Travelocity.\n\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
