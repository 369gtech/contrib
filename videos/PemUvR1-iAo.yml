description: 'As cyber security standards and frameworks proliferate, many of the challenges in securing maritime and offshore assets are not addressed. Frequent crew changes, remoteness of the connected asset and other unique challenges are difficult to address through regulatory means. I’ll discuss the state of the maritime industry relevant to cyber security and educate the audience on recent changes in maritime regulation, if not law. The audience will learn how “safety” drives everything in this sector and how cyber introduces a new law of physics (software vs steel vessels) to what historically was a slow changing field. I’ll include real examples, practical discussion of the gold nuggets and time permitting share a practical, copyable model for analyzing cyber risk.'
