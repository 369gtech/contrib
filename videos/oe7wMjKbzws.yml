language: English
recordingDate: 1519190508
description: "Traditionally cloud native APIs contain the logic to convert data from repositories into information. As the dataset grows it is difficult to scale traditional databases to meet increasing transaction volume. Apache Geode provides high speed, zero downtime data access that allows you to build fast, highly available APIs.\n\nIn this session, Anna and Paul will cover how to seamlessly integrate Apache Geode's high performance functions with cloud native APIs. In addition, they will showcase how to test drive the development of Apache Geode backed solutions (Test Driven Development).\n\nAnna Jung, Software Engineer, HCSC\nPaul Vermeulen, Senior Data Engineer, Pivotal\nRecorded at SpringOne Platform 2017."
