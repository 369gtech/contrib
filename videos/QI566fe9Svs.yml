description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl),\n20th of September 2013, Krak√≥w\n\nItamar Syn Hershko - \"Full-text search with Lucene and neat things you can do with it\"\n\nDescription:\n\"Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library. But it can do an awful lot more than just enable searching on documents or DB records.\n\nIn this hands-on session we will get to know Lucene and how to use it, and all the great features it provides for applications requiring full-text search capabilities. After understanding how it works under the hood we will learn how to make use of it to do other cool stuff that would amaze our users, get the most out of your applications, and maximize profit.\n\nDelivered by Apache Lucene.NET committer Itamar Syn-Hershko, this talk is aimed at providing you tools for starting to work with Lucene, and also to show you how it can be used to provide better UI and UX and to leverage data in use by your application to provide better experience to the user.\""
