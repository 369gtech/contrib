description: "About CLOSING KEYNOTE:\nIn February 2001, 17 software development leaders found, much to their own surprise, the common ground to their views on software development. The result was published as the “Manifesto for Agile Software Development”. The Agile paradigm gradually started replacing the industrial way of thinking.\nToday, in 2017, we observe how the dependence of businesses and society on software and technology only keeps accelerating; not just in terms of computing power, businesses and markets, but also in terms of human relationships. We need the Agile thinking and behavioral tools more than ever to deal with the reality of the new age, the age of information, knowledge and technology; this age of perplexity. We need to move to a state of Agility more than ever, so perplexity is seen as a vast collection of opportunities, rather than a wall blocking the way we operate.\nIn 2013 my book “Scrum – A Pocket Guide” was published. I am currently creating a new book, about ‘Agile’. I do it for the purpose of clarity, to disentangle the clew that ‘Agile’ turned into, to show the value and the originality of ‘Agile’ and restore simplicity. I have considered what Agile means to me, what it is that makes Agile work, what it is that makes Scrum work, and distill it into more substantive guidance.\n\nAbout Gunther:\nGunther Verheyen is a longtime Agile and Scrum practitioner (2003). After a career as a consultant, he started shepherding the Professional series of Scrum.org in 2013, while also leading its European operations.
