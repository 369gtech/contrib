description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nBuilding Fault Tolerant Microservices\n\nDespite all efforts to the contrary, faults will occur in our applications. When building an application we must prepare to minimize the faults' impact. This fact is especially evident in a microservices setting where the failure of one service must not be allowed to cascade to other, possibly more critical, services. This presentation will introduce you to stability patterns such as Bulkheads and Circuit Breakers. We will talk about how these patterns make your applications resilient to faults and how you implement them in a microservices architecture. Another important component to making your system resilient is the ability to detect and act on anomalies. Hence, we will also discuss monitoring guidelines for a distributed microservices system.\n\nKristoffer Erlandsson, Avanza\n\nKristoffer has been building, managing, troubleshooting, and monitoring transaction-intensive Java applications for over 10 years. He specializes in building fault-tolerant, scalable, and maintainable systems. Currently, Kristoffer is developing Avanza Bank's next generation banking platform."
