description: "Yaheeey my ninjas :). So I think it's finally time I introduced you all to my little friend, mr background. Yeah... He's mighty cool and can teach you a thing or two about CSS so you can progress to true ninja status like me.\n\nSo, what is the background property in CSS? Well, my friends, it is made up of several other background properties, such as background-position, background-image, background-color, etc - you get the picture.\n\nSo in this CSS tutorial I'm gonna teach you about my favourite ones. Not all of them mind you, cause I don't have that much time available ;). But to check out the rest, just take a peak at this article on Mozilla developer's website:\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background\n\nHey... where are you going?
