description: "The growth of the public cloud market is obvious to everyone. But whatâ€™s less well known is that enterprises are still growing the infrastructure and services they run for themselves. A host of reasons are given for why companies can't use public cloud solutions, but do these reasons stack up?\n\nThis talk analyses the concerns around the use of public cloud, including concerns about vendor lock-in. I'll also look at what makes cloud work (or not), we'll see why private clouds often fail to deliver.\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcdevops.com/"
