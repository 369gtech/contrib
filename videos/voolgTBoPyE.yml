title: 'APEX + Server-side JavaScript = Awesome!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1616130599
description: "Welcome to the future!  Starting with Oracle Database 21c, developers can now execute JavaScript within the database.  This functionality is enabled by the Multilingual Engine (MLE), powered by GraalVM.  And APEX 20.2 is the first (and only) low code framework on the planet which natively supports server-side JavaScript, out of the box!\n\nIn this special edition of Oracle APEX Office Hours, we will be joined by Lucas Braun, Program Manager for GraalVM and part of the esteemed Oracle Labs team, and Stefan Dobre, who is a developer at FOEX AT and a respected luminary in the Oracle APEX community.  They will:\n\n1) Present MLE and what you can do with server-side JavaScript in APEX\n2) Provide numerous real-world demonstrations\n3) Show you everything you need to do so that you can try this yourself today, and for free in an Always Free Oracle Database\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
