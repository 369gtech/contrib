description: "The best person to create observability for your application is you. Going from reactive monitoring and alerting to proactive observability enables you to deliver your apps with confidence. Make yourself, the business, SRE, and ops teams happy by delivering observability, with your code, to production.\n\nIn this session, the presenter discusses:\n\n*Thinking about observability before going to production\n*Getting started with metrics and the Spring Boot actuator\n*Using Micrometer for custom metrics\n*Using Sleuth and the benefits of tracing in distributed systems\n*Integrating Spring Boot with Wavefront\n\nThis will be a combination of abstract discussion and live coding demonstrations. Weâ€™ll develop an application and push it to production with a meaningful dashboard and observability.\n\nDaShaun Carter: Tanzu Solutions Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/spring-boot-observability"
