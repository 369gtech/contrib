This talk will discuss the differences between companies and communities that can lead to friction, confusion and missed opportunities. With one speaker from the company side and one from the community side, we plan to explore this occasionally prickly relationship from both directions. Companies and communities have different goals, different structures and different challenges. That said,\nmany of the largest and most successful free and open source software projects rely on a combination of both -- to\ncreate new code, address bugs and plan for the future of their codebase. A little more understanding could go a\nlong way towards a more harmonious and efficient working relationship. With one speaker from the company\nside and one from the community side, we plan to explore this occasionally prickly relationship from both\ndirections. \n\nThis talk will discuss the differences between companies and communities that can lead to friction, confusion and\nmissed opportunities. In order to build a sustainable future for free and open source software, we're going to need\nto get more comfortable with each other. Attendees will walk away with tactics for fostering better understanding,\nsuggestions for initiatives that can be put into practice in their own projects and some inspiration for what these\ntwo entities could accomplish if they were committed to working together on the future of FOSS. \n\nRoom: UB5.132\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:45:00+01"
