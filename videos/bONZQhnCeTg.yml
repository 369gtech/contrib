description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPromQL Compatibility Testing - Verifying Vendor Claims for End User Benefit - Julius Volz, PromLabs\n\nPrometheus' query language PromQL is one of the most important interfaces in the Prometheus ecosystem. Organizations rely on it to build their dashboards, critical alerting, and automation. With Prometheus becoming more popular, we are seeing more and more PromQL implementations outside of Prometheus itself, both in open-source projects and in hosted monitoring providers. While this is great, not all implementations that claim to be PromQL-compatible actually implement PromQL correctly. To avoid user confusion, ecosystem fragmentation, and vendor lock-in, we want to encourage fully compatible implementations and at the same time increase transparency around the actual compatibility of different solutions.\n\nIn this talk, Prometheus co-founder Julius Volz will present an open-source PromQL compliance testing suite that can shine a light on the compatibility situation. He will also outline test results of actual vendor PromQL implementations, dive into some of the encountered behavioral differences, and give recommendations for anyone wanting to implement PromQL in their own product or service."
