description: "Trent McConaghy (Ocean, BigchainDB): A Decentralized Substrate for AI Data & Services: Ocean Protocol\n\nModern society runs on data, and modern AI extracts value from data. The greatest beneficiaries are those that have both data and AI -- a small number of organizations. Ocean is a decentralized protocol & network of AI data/services. It incentivizes for a vast supply of relevant artificial intelligence (AI) data/services. This network helps to power AI data/service marketplaces, as well as public commons data. The heart of Ocean’s network is a new construction called Proofed Curation Markets (PCMs). PCMs bridge predicted relevance with actual relevance of each AI service, by combining curation markets with cryptographic proofs (e.g. proof of data/service availability).\n\nThe speech was given on 2018-05-23 at infoShare 2018 (Tech Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
