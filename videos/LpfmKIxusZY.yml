description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nJuly 24, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Prashant Deva.\r\n\r\nSilver Bullet allows you to record the execution of Java programs with a minimal impact on performance. The recorder is extremely efficient and makes good use of multiple cores. The recording is saved to a single file that can be shared among team members.  By recording every single assignment, method call, and so on, Silver Bullet eliminates 'non-reproducible' bugs.\r\n\r\nSilver Bullet comes with a unique time traveling debugger that integrates seamlessly into Eclipse. The debugger is unlike your traditional debuggers; it doesn't even support breakpoints. Using an extremely intuitive UI, it allows you ask questions as to when a particular event occurred and jump to that point in time."
