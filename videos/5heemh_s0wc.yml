description: "Shock to the system – digitally disrupted culture\nWe have to redefine what it means to lead and engage people in the future. In an exponentially changing world we have to get ready to challenge our old paradigms and find a way to engage the hearts and minds of our people. Meanwhile a new framework of organizational culture is forming and new behaviours and habits need to be built. Our mission is truly amazing but not impossible.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nStretch Leadership and Management Conference\nstretchcon.com"
