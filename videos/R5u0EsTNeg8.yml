description: "You Might Just be a Functional Programmer Now - Cornelia Davis, Pivotal \n\nThe declarative programming model of Kubernetes is markedly different from what most developers are used to. That the API is a set of resources rather than a list of methods on objects is a bit mind bending. But this programming model is not entirely new – rather, it smacks quite heavily of functional programming.    Functional programming had mostly been relegated to academic endeavors until recently. What’s changed that is that our apps are now distributed systems and are simply too complex for us to reason about without help. Kubernetes helps.     In order to effectively use Kubernetes to deploy and manage your workloads you need to understand some of the principles of functional programming and how they surface in K8s. In this session I will cover these underlying principles of the K8s programming model so that you can up the robustness and manageability of your application deployments. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXT"
