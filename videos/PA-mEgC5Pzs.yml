description: "Michael Hüttermann\nCTO\nhttp://huettermann.net\n\nIn this session we'll interactively set up a holistic Continuous Delivery pipeline with the use of DevOps enabler tools, based on Cloud, microservices and container technologies. We’ll examine how an introduced change on a Java EE web application is processed, holistically. The new version of the application will be automatically packaged, tested, inspected, containerized, staged, monitored, and promoted towards production environment, with Oracle Cloud. This session discusses concepts, and shows tools in action. Happy cooking!"
