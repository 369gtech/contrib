description: "Eclipse has been one of the most accepted platforms not only by developers but also by vendors. A great variety of plug-ins enables any language or platform to integrate with Eclipse seamlessly. However, times are changing, and being online and using online tools are a reality that makes sense because we all download our code from repositories, edit locally, and submit to repositories again. So why not do your coding in the cloud just next to your repo? Come to this session to get the answer.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMurat Yener\nA code geek, open source committer, conference speaker and Android Software Developer at Intel.
