title: 'A motivating process for deriving Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) - Helge Grenager Solheim'
recordingDate: 1602541849
description: 'Using Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for defining goals and focusing on what matters is super useful, and can provide teams with motivation in the form of autonomy and purpose. This talk provides a process, with examples, for how to come up with great OKRs in a step-by-step manner, and links this to the agile execution afterwards.'
