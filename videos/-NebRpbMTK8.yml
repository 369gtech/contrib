title: 'Communicating Risk Reactively - Mike Pearson'
language: English
recordingDate: 1479414184
description: "An experience report on how Clojurescript, React and Rum helped develop a project that started as a medical animation of risk adjusted mortality data, and rapidly morphed into a single page web site tackling some controversial and tricky issues. It's a story of researchers learning the needs of users and changing how they communicate, and of one programmer trying to keep up.\n\nAs an appendix, I shall add some thoughts and demonstrations of custom plots written in clojurescript for researchers who use R."
