description: "Jumpstart your Cloud Native development - Graham Charters, IBM UK Ltd\n\nDevelopments in Java technologies and cross-language tools are enabling rapid development of cloud native applications. This session will cover the different tools and techniques available and how to make the most of these new technologies. We will start by examining what is desirable for a cloud native application, such as dev/prod parity, externalised configuration, dependency management and containerisation. We will discuss how these are addressed by tools and modern frameworks at each stage of the development lifecycle, from local development, through packaging and deployment.\n\nBeginning with code generation, we will show some of the commonly used tools such as Yeoman, JHipster and Spring Initializr and how they can provide a starting point.\n\nMoving on to development, we will discuss how to reach dev/prod parity using Docker whilst enabling rapid iteration of your application. We will also introduce the Open API specification and how it can be used to define and expose any external APIs.\n\nFinally, with deployment, we will look at the packaging options provided by Spring and Microprofile and the composability options provided by applications servers such as Open Liberty and Wildfly Swarm. We will discuss the pros and cons of these different approaches and how they fit into a containerised environment."
