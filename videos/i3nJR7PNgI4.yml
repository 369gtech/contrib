title: 'Keeping Linux Great'
recordingDate: 1484965339
description: "Robert M. \"r0ml\" Lefkowitz\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/107/\nLinux is Great.  And part of that greatness was, at one time, attributable to the ascendency of Free Software.  Now that Free Software is in decline, it behooves us to reflect upon how to keep Linux great *despite* the fact that it is Free Software.\r\n\r\nThe underlying motivation for Linux and Free Software was (and is) to democratize software -- making it more accessible to all.  Free Software used to be the best strategy for doing so.  Now that the challenges for democratization have mutated, we must figure out new strategies for democratizing software, and keeping Linux great.\r\n\r\nThis talk will review the changes in the technology environment that have led to the decline of free software, and the emerging opportunities for democratizing the software of the future."
