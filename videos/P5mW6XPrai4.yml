description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nOctober 22, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Dr Alberto Di Meglio at the 4th Annual Google Test Automation Conference, October 21st, 22nd, 2009, Zurich, CH\r\n\r\nDr. Alberto Di Meglio graduated in Aerospace Engineering at the Politecnico di Milano in 1993 and received a Ph.D. in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from the University of Birmingham in 2000. Alberto has worked as Research Associate at the Electrical & Electronic Engineering School of the University of Birmingham from 1995 to 1997 as part of the EC-funded Vertlink communications project. In 1998 he joined CERN where he worked for three years as systems engineer in the Information Technology Division. During that period, Alberto was responsible for a number of projects in the field of networked and web systems.\r\n\r\nIn 2001 he left CERN to fund a software company developing a multi-platform system for the management and monitoring of distributed systems using the WBEM standards. During this period Alberto was Chief Technology Officer and R&D Manager responsible for development, integration and testing of the company software. In 2003, he was appointed by CERN as Software Integration Manager in the Middleware Reengineering Activity of the first EGEE project. At the end of the EGEE project, thanks to the successful results obtained with the integration and testing tools and procedures developed for gLite, Alberto set up the ETICS project, an international infrastructure co-funded by the EC FP7 program for building and testing software on the grid, of which he is currently Project Director. He is a member of the Italian Board of Engineers, a Chartered Engineer of the British Engineering Council, a member of IET and IEEE and a certified ITIL professional."
