Unfortunately, when it comes to distributed systems, it's a bit of a wild west with many small, competing solutions of varied quality.\n\nFirenest is an attempt to close this gap, by providing high-quality, ready-made components for building distributed systems in Elixir. The project is primarily built on extracted parts of the Phoenix framework with some improvements applying lessons-learned from running them in production at scale. \n\nIn this talk, you'll learn about the firenest project, the abstractions it provides, what it enables and how it's used within the Phoenix framework itself.\n\n-- Read the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2NzsZax\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MICHAL MUSKALA\nFreelancer at -\n\nSoftware engineer, open-source developer, speaker and trainer. Micha≈Ç is an Elixir Core Team Member focusing on the functional side mostly. An Elixir and Ecto core team member, he maintains and contributes to multiple open source projects, including the Elixir database library, Erlang compiler and the BEAM (Erlang's virtual machine).\nWhen not programming he enjoys reading, travelling, and sailing - no matter if sunny, rainy or stormy. It's even better if all of those are combined!\n\n-- More on Michal Muskala: http://bit.ly/2NzsZax\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 18\nCode BEAM Lite Berlin 18 was co-organised by Bitcrowd and Code Sync.\n\nBITCROWD\n-- Website: https://bitcrowd.net/\n-- Twitter: https://twitter.com/bitcrowd\n-- Mail: info at bitcrowd.net\n\nCODE SYNC \n-- Website: www.codesync.global\n-- Twitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\n-- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\n-- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\n-- Mail: info at codesync.global\n\n#CBLBerlin #Elixir #CodeSync #FireNest"
