description: "Resurrecting Mozilla Themes for LibreOffice Trying to uncover, fix and improve a hidden gem in the rough\nby Muhammet Kara\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.114/resurrecting_mozilla_themes_for_libreoffice.webm\n\n\nPast, present, and the future of LibreOffice's Personalization dialog. \n\nLibreOffice has had the ability to use Mozilla Themes (Personas) for some time (Tools ❯ Options ❯ Personalization); but it kept breaking all the time, and never had an acceptable UX. Also tons of errors/warnings, and very slow search and apply processes almost brought it to the point of being killed for good. But I couldn’t let it die, started looking into the related code and the bug reports. Now it has a better UX/UI, and got most annoying bugs/crashers fixed, and is much faster. \n\nI will try to present a summary about the journey so far, and the plans for the future. \n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 11:30:00+01"
