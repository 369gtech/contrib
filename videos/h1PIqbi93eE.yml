title: 'Using the Event Gateway to build serverless multi-cloud applications - Philipp Müns'
recordingDate: 1522486046
description: "As serverless technologies go mainstream many cloud providers are revamping their service offerings, adding more sophisticated cloud solutions and making it possible to create stellar applications in a breeze.\nServerless applications usually make heavy use of different service offerings. Most of the time those services are Cloud provider specific, since they’re easy to integrate and work with.\nBut what about services which are only available on another Cloud provider infrastructure? How could you consume them without the need to go all-in and re-write your whole application for this Cloud provider?\nThe Event Gateway is the answer to those questions. The Event Gateway acts as the central hub and broker, orchestrating event flows across decoupled services, not matter where they are located.\nCurious how the Event Gateway enables frictionless multi-cloud applications? Join this session to learn how."
