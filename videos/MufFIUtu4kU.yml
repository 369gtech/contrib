recordingDate: 1501170294
description: 'We''ll cover what it means for Ratpack to be non-blocking/asynchronous for the ground up and how it impacts the way you write your applications in Ratpack. We''ll cover Ratpack''s threading model, the execution model, how to work with Promises with both synchronous and asynchronous libraries and how to test asynchronous code ''deterministically''.'
