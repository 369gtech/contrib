description: 'Interactive workshops are the best way to engage teams and individuals and help everyone remember lessons learned. They may seem difficult to plan, hard to execute, and very time consuming to do both but any individual can create these compelling and interesting sessions by following a simple formula. Learn what this formula is and create a workshop that you can take back to your team, colleagues, and peers. You''ll leave with examples, a template, and a new confidence in your ability to create imaginative and meaningful activities that catapult your team forward.'
