description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Berlin 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOber\nhttp://gotober.com\n\nEvelina Gabasova - Machine Learning Expert & Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute\n\nABSTRACT\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence are becoming wide-spread and productionalized - you no longer need a mathematics PhD and months of software development time to implement and use a machine learning algorithm. You can just call an API and you get the answer! You can treat them completely as black boxes and use them directly in your applications! But beware - all the algorithms have some cases when they fail to deliver what you're expecting.\nThis talk is packed with live demos that show failure cases of popular algorithms, from linear regression to cutting-edge deep learning. I will look at practical examples, use standard algorithms as black boxes and observe [...]\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotober.com/2019/sessions/855/breaking-black-box-ai\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOber\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#MachineLearning #ML #DataScience #Data #AI #ArtificialIntelligence\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
