title: 'Java Benchmarking: Easy Peasy, Right? (Aleksey Shipil—ëv, Russia)'
recordingDate: 1406820230
description: "Performance measurement is easy! Get System.nanoTime() once, get it twice, substract, multiply, divide, stare at the numbers and go for optimizations. Nope!\n\nIn this talk, we will see how does one uses benchmarks to measure the application performance, what mistakes are usually done in the course of that work, how to avoid those mistakes, and all-in-all how to get any sensible data from the world where everything depends on everything.\n\nWe will use Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH), the standard harness in OpenJDK, in our tutorials."
