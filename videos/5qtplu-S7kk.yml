This raises the question, if there is a chance to close the gender gap through AI in order to prevent the distortions of the past from being machine amplified in the future. Does artificial intelligence really have an open outcome or do existing biases transfer to AI? Can we expect machines to be more intelligent than humans? Is the transfer of biases into artificial intelligence already irreversible? How do we ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated in the future? We want to discuss these aspects and find solutions and guidance."
