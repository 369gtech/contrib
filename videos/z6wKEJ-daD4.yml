Introduced to replace BIOS as a high-level interface between hardware and the kernel, it features many advanced features such as networking right after pressing the power button of your mainboard with a relatively simple C API. \nIn this session, we explore how we can apply modern C++ idioms to a bare metal environment like UEFI. Armed with a working modern C++ compiler, we'll wrap the C API with some metaprogramming tricks. This grants us better type safety and a cleaner API with no runtime overhead. Along the way we'll introduce a clean exceptionless error-handling method, and finally write a small demo application. \nFinally, we look at the some of the proposals for the next C++ standard and how it helps us writing more concise yet efficient code that is sill conformant.\n— \nMorris Hafner, Codeplay Software\nSoftware Engineer\n\nMorris is a Computer Science undergrad interested in computer graphics, the evolution of C++ and everything low level.\nHe tries to (ab)use the language and its tooling to prevent mistakes in software while keeping the code as general as possible.\nOn the GPU, he likes to play with shaders, lighting and bending the graphics pipeline.\nWhen he is not programming, he enjoys travelling and watching movies.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
