description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Zac Sweers, Slack and James Barr, Uber.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=172129\n\nCodebase maintenance is a fun, terrible, exciting, daunting, nuanced, and interesting line of work. Sometimes you’re the janitor and sometimes you’re the surgeon. This talk is about lessons learned over the years of doing core librarian work in open source and on a big team in a large codebase. From API design to engaging dogma, we’ll dive into the many facets of maintaining a codebase’s foundations and the community that grows around it, and how to leverage them for a better developer experience for everyone.\r\n\r\nOh, and tombstone cakes."
