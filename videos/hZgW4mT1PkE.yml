recordingDate: 1526828403
description: "I have been using Haskell in production at Checkpad MED, TramCloud and other many projects for more than 5 years and would like to discuss the advantages and challenges discovered during this time. We will look at first principles on structuring, building and testing Haskell applications at scale, discuss interfacing and deployment of microservices, performance and practical considerations like debugging, tooling support and IDEs.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPolyConf 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAlexander Thiemann\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPolyConf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nPolyConf YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/polyconf"
