I've started in December 2011 my own C++ User Group in Düsseldorf, and with Meeting C++ I have been supporting many new C++ User Groups in the last years, exchanged many thoughts and experimented with different formats for local groups. Let's have an overview on how you could get started today, and what one can do to keep a group running for several years.\n\nThe Talk begin on how to start a local group and give an overview on many different ways on what to do and how to keep a group running. Many of these ideas are also very good fits for your team, so if you don't have the time to become active in your local User Group, this talk can still give you many ideas for what to do in your own team meetings.\n\n— \nJens Weller\nMeetingcpp GmbH\nCEO\nGermany\n\nJens Weller has worked, since 2007, as a freelancer in C++, specialising in consulting, training and programming C++.
