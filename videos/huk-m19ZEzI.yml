description: "Paul Foxworthy\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/172/\nDuring 2016 Open Source Industry Australia (OSIA) made multiple submissions to Federal and state government inquiries, committees and taskforces.\r\n\r\nThis talk will look at the issues we raised, the changes we would like to see, what effect we’ve had, and what we’ve learned that might be useful to the open source community and other open source organisations."
