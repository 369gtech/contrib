title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2011: Felix Geisendoerfer - Node.JS for Heavy I/O'
recordingDate: 1545060760
description: "\"Server-side JavaScript has been around since 1996, but despite the huge success on the client, it never quite managed to attract a significant audience.\n\nThis all changed in 2009, when Ryan Dahl presented his non-blocking I/O framework for Google's V8 JavaScript engine at JSConf.eu. The radical new approach, combined with one of the fastest JavaScript engines, has attracted an explosive number of early adopters ever since.\n\nThis talk gives you a brief introduction to node.js, exploring the technology behind the buzz. You will learn about non-blocking I/O, what kind of applications can get the most out of it, as well as what problem domains are not targeted by it.\"\n\nhttp://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/nodejs-heavy-io\n\nDescription of Felix Geisendoerfer: http://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/felix-geisendoerfer"
