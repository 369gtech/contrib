description: "Video recording from AmsterdamJS Meetup https://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/244906789/\n\nThe times when a browser simply had to parse and show some markup are long gone. These days they are full of interesting APIs exposing various information and behaviour to web developers. This talk will walk you through a few of these APIs (speech, speech recognition, media recorder, location, ...), some of which you might know, some maybe not. I will show a quick example of what some of these APIs can do, and how to use them."
