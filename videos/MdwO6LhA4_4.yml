description: "What do an overnight 40% drop in road accidents, a night in on the sofa watching TV and a good night's sleep have to do with digital product design?\n\nHumans only have limited mental capacity and no-one is ever operating at 100%.\n\nWe are all influenced by the world around us and by how our minds work. As designers we need to be able to understand this and design for it.\n\nCombining psychology theory, the latest in UX techniques Joe will outline a modern design framework that matches the modern complex world we and our users live in.\n\nAfter all a designer who doesn’t understand psychology is going to be no more successful than an architect who doesn’t understand physics.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/mrjoe/ux-psychology-and-the-power-of-100-mrjoe-leech\nAbout Joe: https://mrjoe.uk/\nFollow Joe: https://twitter.com/mrjoe\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
