description: 'Communication is the key to Agile, but how exactly should we communicate about changes to the software we write in a real software development team? I will briefly tell about the problems we faced in Atlassian JIRA while scaling projects from small semi-independent agile teams to multiple distributed teams working on a single project. Then I will explain how we structure out Git repositories, use Code Reviews and Pull Requests to communicate or synchronize changes and keep our software in releasable state.'
