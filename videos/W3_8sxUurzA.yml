description: "Tiered of migrating thousand of code lines to the next popular JavaScript framework? Stuck in complexity and legacy code maintenance? Why not learn from the idea of microservices we already applied so well to our backend systems?\n\nIn 1976 ABBA sang ‘Breaking up is never easy, I know’, having the end of a long relationship in mind. But splitting up a long maintained frontend monolith can be hard and difficult as well.\n\nTherefore, this talk will ease the pain of separation by guiding you through the process of selecting suitable technologies and building a parent app shell to deal with loading and routing of all child components. You’ll learn how to avoid common obstacles and gain momentum on the road to a new long-lasting and future-proof frontend architecture.\n\n==========\n\nThis recording is presented by: Ressort Broadcast - Forschungsgemeinschaft elektronische Medien e.V.\n\nhttps://broadcast.fem.tu-ilmenau.de/\n\n==========\nLicence: CC BY-ND https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode"
