title: 'Engineer tested, manager approved: Migrating Windows/.NET services to Linux'
recordingDate: 1579223250
description: "Katie Bell\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/25/\n\nRunning .NET Framework code on Linux used to be something that you would approach with caution, and only if you needed to, especially if the code was originally written to only ever work on Windows. With improvements to Mono and the release of .NET Core, this is now easier, more reliable and more officially Microsoft supported than ever.\r\n\r\nAt Campaign Monitor we've got lots of Windows-specific C# .NET code, in particular we had these 78 http-serving and background task processing services that caused us some headaches. I and a couple of fellow engineers set out to convince management that a project to migrate them all to .NET Core (on Linux) was worthwhile, and convince them we did. I will take you through this six month project from its start as a crazy idea to its successful completion and results. We'll learn a lot about .NET Core on Linux and Docker, what is easy to migrate (and what is not), the expected and unexpected issues we encountered and how to get a project like this off the ground and done.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
