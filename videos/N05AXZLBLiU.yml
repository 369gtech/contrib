description: "Java Hates Linux. Deal with It.\n\nGreg Banks, LinkedIn\n\nAt LinkedIn we run lots of Java services on Linux boxes. Java and Linux are a perfect pair.

Finally we'll examine actual code samples showing how we fixed or hid the problems.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
