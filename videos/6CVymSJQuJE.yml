description: "Code is Here: http://goo.gl/41GCs\n\nWelcome to my Interpreter Design Pattern Tutorial! The Interpreter design pattern is ignored by most, but in this tutorial I'll show you how to do some cool things with it.\n\nIn top of that, I'll also answer all of the recent questions I've received about both Java Reflection and String manipulation. I found you can do pretty great things if you combine reflection with the interpreter design pattern.\n\nAll of the code in the link above is heavily commented to help you learn."
