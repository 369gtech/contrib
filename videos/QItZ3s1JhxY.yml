description: 'I come from a household of high achievers. Our parents never asked to be awesome in what we studied. They always had this unsaid expectation. Luckily, I did really well throughout school, college and university. I like to think I got my dad’s sense of achieving and my mum’s great way of organising her tasks. From my teens onwards, I started developing a high sense of perfection for every-thing I took on. However, I did not realise that how having this high bar was slowly consuming me. I will talk about how the desire to be awesome slowly engulfed me. The need to be constantly producing high quality deliverables added stress to my life and slowly started to burnout. I will talk about how I created a mini Personal Development Life Cycle and how I used my learnings from being in agile teams to being Agile about this PDLC.'
