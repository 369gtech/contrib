BigDL is a unified analytics platform that can directly run on top of existing Spark or Hadoop clusters, giving customers a consistent and integrated experience for the entire learning process. Along the way, Ziya explains how Intel optimized solutions to help cloud businesses, financial services, manufacturing, and other companies to gain more insights and drive business differentiation and points to future trends and work in the space.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Intel.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
