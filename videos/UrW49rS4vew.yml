language: English
recordingDate: 1633561353
description: 'You may be familiar with ECMAScript Language Specification, such as ES2021, which is defined by Ecma International to standardize JavaScript, and specifies language syntax and semantics of the core API. But probably fewer of you are familiar with the specification for Internationalization API, which designed to complement the Language Specification by providing key language-sensitive functionality. In this segment, Tomomi Imura talks about the Intl.DateTimeFormat​​and a little bit of trivia about Japan''s Imperial year.'
