language: English
recordingDate: 1528194605
description: "Apache Kafka is a battle tested stream-processing platform. Combined with Kafka Streams API, itâ€™s possible to build scalable, fault-tolerant and distributed event driven systems.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe the key components of an event sourced system and how simple building blocks can be combined using the powerful and declarative streams API to deliver business value. I will demonstrate possible solutions for the challenges of eventual-consistency and the object-relational impedance mismatch."
