title: 'The Java API for JSON type in Oracle JDBC 20c'
language: English
recordingDate: 1591806871
description: "Oracle 20c (currently available as a preview release only)  introduces a new built-in SQL type ('JSON') to support the efficient and type-rich storage of JSON data.  Values are both stored and transmitted across the network using Oracle's binary JSON format to provide fast ingest, retrieval, query, and update of JSON data. This session will give an overview of the new JSON facilities in JDBC (package oracle.sql.json).  Software engineer Josh Spiegel will cover functionality, architecture, and performance best practices for accessing JSON from a Java program.  A mixture of slides and live demonstration will be used throughout the talk.\n\n\nTimestamps:\n0:0 - 0:53   Introduction\n0:54 - 2:20  Recap JSON Type\n2:21 - 6:40  JSON type, JDBC, JSON data model, Performance \n6:41 - 8:05  Example for JSON  encoding on Database and Java/JDBC \n8:06 - 10:00 why store JSON in Oracle database\n10:01 - 12:20  The Java API for JSON in JDBC\n12:21 - 17:00  JSON Tree Model\n17:01 - 19:34  JSON Event Model\n19:35 - 25:35  SQL Integration\n23:36 - 42:00  Java Code Demos\n42:01 - 47:17  JSON-P (JSR 374)\n47:18 - 50:00  JSON-B (JSR-367)\n50:01 - 55:24  Performance Tips\n55:25 - End  - Conclusion, Links\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/ \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
