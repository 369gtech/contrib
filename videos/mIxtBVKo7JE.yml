title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2017 Brian McKenna - Nix for Functional Systems'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498916653
description: "When managing systems we often use imperative tools. We run commands and mutate state. Nix provides tools to convert imperative commands into functions. By using functions we gain code reuse, reproducibility and atomicity.\n\nNix’s tooling consists of a programming language, a package manager and an operating system. Using these tools we can define packages, cross-compiled binaries, chroot environments, virtual machines and Docker images.\n\nThis talk will skip the basics of how to use Nix and instead cover the basics of how Nix works, some of the benefits it gives and how I’ve been using it personally and professionally over the past few years.\n\nBrian McKenna is a functional programmer from Tasmania who works remotely for Atlassian. He has been using Nix personally and professionally since 2014, contributing back packages and configuration. He has been playing with Eta in an attempt to help solve The JVM Problem and to learn more about GHC’s runtime and compilation. He believes functional programming is the only ethical way we should be developing software.\n\nFor more on YOW! Lambda Jam, visit http://lamdajam.yowconference.com.au"
