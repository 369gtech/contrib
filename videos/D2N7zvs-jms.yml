description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotswift.io on January 28th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nSwift offers a unique choice for creating scientific applications. Swift can be used to bridge creating readable and debuggable code, using clean scientific notation, with a backend of powerful high-performance libraries. Object, protocol and functional programming paradigms freely mix, and when combined with prudent operator overloading and unicode notation, one has a powerful system. Despite Swift's youth, it is already up to the task of quality professional scientific programming.\nJeff walks through several small examples."
