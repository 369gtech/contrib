description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAutomating Your Home with K3s and Home Assistant - Eddie Zaneski, Amazon Web Services & Jeff Billimek, The Home Depot\n\nHey Google, turn off all the lights. Hey Siri, set the thermostat to low. Alexa, restart the nginx deployment. You may have dreamt (or had nightmares) about automating your home and connecting all things smart together. You probably haven't longed for doing all of that on top of Kubernetes. In this session you'll learn why you should and the benefits of having a homelab running Kubernetes. With everyone spending more time at home there has never been a better time to grab an old PC or a few Raspberry Pi's and install K8s. Eddie and Jeff will share their journeys of deploying Home Assistant, open source home automation software, on top of K3s, a lightweight K8s distribution. They'll cover unique solutions like building Device Plugins and using Node Feature Discovery to use external USB antennas for wireless smart home protocols. Ending with tying all of it together with Helm and using Flux for CICD. If you're looking for a personal project to learn Kubernetes this session is for you."
