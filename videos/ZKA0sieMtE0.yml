title: 'Writing Recommender Systems with Java: An Introduction'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433246106
description: "With the vast amounts of data available, adding personalized recommendations to a system is often a great way to enhance the user experience. There are several tools in Java that can be used to implement a recommender system without a lot of effort. Based on experiences in building tailored recommender systems, this session presents the available approaches:\n\n&bull; Using Apache Mahout Taste recommenders (single-node, small data)\n\n&bull; Using Hadoop-based Mahout recommenders (big data)\n\n&bull; Apache Spark MLib (in-memory distributed processing)\n\n&bull; Custom in-memory single-node recommender using MapDB\n\nThe presentation includes a live demo of one of the tools as well as tips on which approach is suitable for which situations.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAdam Warski\nI am one of the co-founders of SoftwareMill, a company specialising in delivering customised software solutions. I code mostly on the back-end using Scala, with an occasional foray into frontend/devops and other languages. I created a couple of open-source projects, such as Hibernate Envers, ElasticMQ, Veripacks and MacWire. I have been a speaker at major conferences, such as Devoxx, JavaZone, JFokus or Jazoon.\n\nApart from writing closed- and open-source software, I am interested in improving the way we use functional and object-oriented programming. When not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking in the mountains or playing tennis.\n\nI am also writing a technical blog (http://www.warski.org/blog) on a variety of interesting IT-related subjects.\nView more trainings by Adam Warski at https://www.parleys.com/author/adam-warski\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
