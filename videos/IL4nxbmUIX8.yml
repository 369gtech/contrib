Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nKeynote: E2E 5G Cloud Native Network - Heather Kirksey, VP, Community and Ecosystem Development, Linux Foundation; Azhar Sayeed, Chief Architect, Red Hat; & Fu Qiao, Project Manager, China Mobile \n\nIt’s no secret that Kubernetes has gained significant traction in the cloud and enterprise software ecosystem, but less widely known is how this momentum is now moving into global telco networks as the next major area of adoption. Building on the momentum from a live keynote demo In Amsterdam last fall (See the demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClQ7nBKfL5I&t=385s), a team made up of volunteers from several project communities, companies, and network operators has taken a cloud native approach to developing an E2E 5G network demonstration built on open source infrastructure. The demo will use a live prototype running in labs around the world using k8s and other open source technologies to deliver a fully containerized 5G network on stage in San Diego. The demo will showcase both how the telecom industry is using cloud native software to build out their next gen networks, and also show solution providers what’s possible in this exciting new space. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UdLd"
