title: 'You asked for it, you got it: type safe Actors by Konrad Malawski'
recordingDate: 1519313108
description: "Akka Typed is the next generation of the actor model APIs in Akka, providing what many have asked for: Using the type system to guarantee actors are only sent messages they can handle. After three long iterations of trying to formulate an API for typed Actors that makes sense we have finally found the right level of abstraction to build upon. In this talk we will take a closer look at the new Akka Typed APIs and how they allow you to achieve type safe asynchronous message driven systems, scaling up across many cores and out across many machines.\n\nKonrad Malawski, Akka Team\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
