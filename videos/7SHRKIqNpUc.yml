title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Demystifying Dependency Injection and Services in Drupal 8'
recordingDate: 1506526175
description: "Is there a way for someone to modify the process by which Drupal invokes modules without making changes to the core function in Drupal 7 ?\n\nOR Is there a better way to access the global variables without calling them directly in Drupal 7 ? The answer is No.The session aims at understanding the dependency injection and services in Drupal 8 that may be a bit complex but really usable.\n\nThe introduction of Object Oriented Programing in Drupal 8 is an evolution in the world of Drupal which has brought the concept of code reuse and encapsulation, allowing users to build better maintainable and structured code.One of the concept that contribute to this is Dependency Injection and Services in Drupal 8.\n\nDependency injection is an advanced software design pattern. It implements “inversion of control”, which means that reusable code calls task specific code.\n\nDependency injection :\n\nRemoves strong dependencies that were in \_Drupal 7.(Global variables,Invoking hooks,etc.)\n\nEnables us to reuse the functionality and make our services pluggable and replaceable\n\nTo understand and use best practices such as using service container in a decoupled manner.\n\nMake the code easier to read.\n\nIn Drupal 8, with the adoption of dependency-injection, literally every core subsystem, or services, can be overridden and changed.\n\nThe objective of the session are:\n\nProblem of reusability in Drupal 7.\n\nOverview of Services and Dependency Injection?\n\nDrupal 8 core services and how to use them.\n\nServices container and it is helpful.\n\nHow to use Dependency Injection in Contrib modules?\n\nMy session will talk about various scenarios and how can we use different services and Dependency Injection in these scenarios.The session will include demos, examples and code walk throughs.\n\nWhat level of knowledge should attendees have before walking into your session:\n\nThis session will be easy to understand for people with intermidiate level knowledge of Drupal.\n\nTake Away for attendees:\n\nBest practices of building custom and contrib module using services and dependency injection.\nDefining your own services.\nDecoupling of custom modules."
