description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nArgo and Tekton: Pushing the Boundaries of the Possible on Kubernetes - Alex Collins, Intuit & Jason Hall, Red Hat\n\nKubernetes isn’t just a platform for running apps anymore. Increasingly, it’s also becoming a platform for platforms, some of which challenge the idea of what Kubernetes can and should be used for. Tekton and Argo are two such projects, there are more, and there will be many more to come. These projects run unconventional workloads which often have quite different needs to running vanilla deployments. They often need to manage large amounts of data, manage massive parallelism, and special lifecycle requirements, none of which Kubernetes provides by default. In this talk, you’ll hear from the technical leads on the Tekton and Argo projects about how they’ve pushed the boundaries of Kubernetes to provide this new functionality. You’ll hear how users have benefitted from this work, how you can apply these same techniques, and how we can further improve Kubernetes as a platform for this kind of workload."
