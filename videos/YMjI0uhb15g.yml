description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.    \n\nKeynote: Moving Cloud Native Beyond HTTP: Adding Protocols to Unlock New Use Cases - Jonathan Beri, Founder, Stealth\n\nKubernetes and related projects have first-class support for serving and managing HTTP traffic. This makes sense since the most common protocol used by web servers is HTTP. However, there are many popular protocols in the world that are *not* HTTP. These protocols are used across a variety of domains, from IoT to gaming to telephony and more. In order to build cloud native services with these protocols, we need to understand how and where networking protocols are supported to uncover roadblocks preventing new applications in domains like IoT & gaming. This talk will provide you with a deep understanding of various projects and their protocol support to uncover what’s available today, what’s being worked and opportunities for the ecosystem to collaborate. \n\nhttps://sched.co/eoFA"
