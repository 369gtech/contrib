title: 'YOW! 2015 - Don Reinertsen - Thriving in a Stochastic World'
recordingDate: 1450964768
description: "Modern software developers have abandoned waterfall processes and embraced agile and lean methods. Yet, the waterfall process has left behind a dangerous legacy, one that stealthily controls our behavior. Developers act as if uncertainty is intrinsically bad, and predictability is intrinsically good. Consequently, they strive to eliminate as much variability as possible in schedule, performance, and cost. And, although they never use the term, they deeply value determinism. In this presentation, Don Reinertsen will present an alternative view. How could we design development processes such that variability improves economic outcomes rather than hurting them? When we seek to thrive in a stochastic world, rather than merely survive in it, we look at things quite differently.\n\nDon is the President of Reinertsen & Associates, a consulting firm specialized in the management of product development. He has worked with leading product development organizations for over 3o years, and taught executive courses at Caltech for 14 years. He is the author/co-author of three best-selling books on product development. His latest awarding winning book, The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean Product Development, has been praised as, “… quite simply the most advanced product development book you can buy.”\n\nFor more on YOW!
