description: 'The term "machine learning" is increasingly bandied about in corporate settings and cocktail parties, but what is it, really? In this session we''ll answer that question, providing an approachable overview of machine learning concepts, technologies, and use cases. We''ll then take a deeper dive into machine learning topics such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. We''ll also survey various machine learning APIs and platforms. You''ll be the hit of your next party when you''re able to express the near-magical inner-workings of artificial neural networks!'
