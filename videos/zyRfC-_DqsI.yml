The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nUsing Kubernetes for Handling Second Screen Experience of European TV Show - Jan-Erik Revsbech & Thomas Hector, Peytz & Co\n\nDanish TV station TV 2 runs a nationwide, very popular entertainment show called “Fuld Plade”. The show is basically a bingo show, where the audience can participate in the bingo game live on their smartphones, tablets, or computers. The nature of live TV shows add a very interesting workload scenario where the application needs extremely high scalability. During the hour of the show, the load on the system increases by a factor of 100, and is therefore a very good case for highly scalable solutions. The presentation will show how we at Peytz & Co solved the task of delivering this kind of solution, using GoLang deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, and how using Prometheus helped us gain valuable insight into the performance of the application.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuJV"
