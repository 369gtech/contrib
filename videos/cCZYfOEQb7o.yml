description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSponsored Session: NeuVector - Comparing Security as Code - Egress Inferno - Stayin’ Alive Edition  \n\nSecurity as Code has yet to gain the same popularity or notoriety as the practice of Infrastructure as Code.  Infrastructure as Code has become a cornerstone to automating software development pipelines, increasing development velocity and operational efficiency. Unfortunately, defining fine-grained security policies early in an SDLC is a much more complex, nuanced and (hopefully) layered endeavor.   To both the developer and the user, security shares neither critical path nor perceived value as new functionality is delivered. Yes, of course everyone cares when there is a breach or an attack or a laptop goes missing. But in ephemeral environments, the more granular the security the more likely it changes. When security changes have more potential to slow development velocity or “take down production”, developers, operations and security are left trying to balance creating, testing & managing security vs time spent delivering business differentiating value. NeuVector Engineer Tracy Walker examines a single security use case - egress control - and in 15 minutes describes how the granularity and management implemented via Security as Code differs between Kubernetes, Openshift, Istio, and NeuVector. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff17"
