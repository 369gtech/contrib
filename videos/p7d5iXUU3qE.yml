The last year has been focused on behind the scenes work for new Wi-Fi standards that make connection setup faster, make roaming smoother and also introduce new security standards including WPA3. This presentation will demonstrate the new advances in Wi-Fi support for Linux and show how they improve the usage from within Network Manager and other connection managers.\n\n\n\nMarcel Holtmann\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/ASG2019/talk/WBJNQQ/"
