description: "With Java 8 out the door, Java developers can at last benefit from the long-awaited lambdas to taste the newly found functional flavor of the language. Streams are there to work more easily and efficiently with heaps of data. Those things are not new to developers acquainted with Groovy. But what is left to Groovy to make it attractive beyond all the aspects in which Java has caught up with Groovy? In this session, a Groovy project lead shows you how Groovy is still relevant in the JVM landscape, how similar or different Java and Groovy can be, how Groovy further improves the developer experience on top of JDK 8, and what Groovy offers beyond Java.\n\n\nAuthors:\nCe?dric Champeau\nCédric Champeau is a Groovy core committer. He joined Pivotal Inc., in order to help developing the language. \n\nPrior to that, he spent several years at a software editor, where he used Groovy in multiple industrial contexts including DSLs for natural language processing, scripting or even workflows.\n\nHe implemented static type checking and static compilation in Groovy 2 and is specialized in compile time metaprogramming.\nView more trainings by Ce?dric Champeau at https://www.parleys.com/author/ce?dric-champeau-3\n\nGuillaume Laforge\nGuillaume Laforge is the Groovy Project Manager, and Spec Lead of JSR-241, the Java Specification Request standardizing the Groovy dynamic language in the Java Community Process. As Vice President Technology of G2One, the company dedicated to the development of Groovy and Grails, he provides professional services around those technologies (training, support, and consulting). Guillaume co-authored the Groovy in Action best-seller book for Manning, and reviewed and wrote forewords for most of the Groovy and Grails books on the market.
