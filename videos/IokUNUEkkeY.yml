description: "Anton will talk about the technical capabilities of Java that make it possible to develop JRebel & XRebel - the two tools for Java developers that I'm involved with. Instrumentation API, Javassist, bytecodeâ€¦ there's a lot more stuff to talk about when it comes to Java agents. Magic things are possible!\nAnton will describe the concepts behind JRebel magic and we'll do some live coding as well. There's a fun part too: we'll look into the accidental challenges that the tool developers have to overcome.\n\n\nCheers,\n - http://www.DevClub.ee\n - http://www.facebook.com/devclub.ee\n - http://twitter.com/devclub_ee\n\n - http://twitter.com/confueu\n \nSUBSCRIBE!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=ConFuEU"
