description: 'Two years ago the DevOps team behind the Legaltech online service Smartlaw decided to migrate from a monolithic architecture to Microservices. The resulting Smartlaw platform is designed to serve multiple tenants with different brandings, business models and markets by a single operational instance. This requires to switch the behavior and appearance of the application per request. The settings of a tenant, for example, the look and feel, activated features, connected 3rd party services or the customer journey, have to be configurable at runtime. The talk gives an overview of the challenges and explains how the Smartlaw team approached the solution as well as integrated it into the architecture based on Microservices. It describes the data model for tenant specific configurations and the infrastructure for a runtime distribution and resolution. A summary of the lessons learned concludes the talk.'
