description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nMICROSERVICES WITH ELIXIR\nby Rodrigo Nonose\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nElixir \nUmbrella \nMicroservices\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nThis walk will show the easiness of developing microservices with Elixir with approaches to project structure, communication protocols and libraries.\n\n\n- Umbrella apps allow code/configuration/state splitting and keep your apps isolated and independent.\n\n- Erlang Distribution Protocol allows you to invoke code in remote nodes without fuss.\n\n- Libraries like libcluster/swarm/partisan allow clustering and work stealing between the nodes\n\n\nUsing those mechanics, it allows us to use the good parts of monoliths and reduces the friction on going multi-node.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/rodrigo-nonose/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - RODRIGO NONOSE\nSoftware Engineer, concerned dog owner\n\nRodrigo is a software engineer with experience in multiple languages, such as Java, PHP, Python and now Elixir/Erlang. He's a curiosity-driven developer, studying a variety of topics and loves hands-on experience.\n\nMore on Rodrigo Nonose: https://codesync.global/speaker/rodrigo-nonose/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
