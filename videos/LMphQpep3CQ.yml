description: "This demonstration-rich session takes an in-depth look at Redis features and use cases. The microservices team at Oracle has been exploring the optimal approach to containerize and scale Redis for low latency, high availability, and improved performance. This session shares the design considerations, architecture, challenges, and lessons learned from this experience, with the intention of helping you understand how to \"Dockerize\" and scale Redis to maximize application performance and greatly enhance user experience. The session also covers continuous integration and delivery, and techniques for zero downtime upgrade and patching.\n\nSpeaker: David Delabassee"
