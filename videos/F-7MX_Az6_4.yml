And much more.\nPhoenix is a web framework written in Elixir. It provides the building blocks for creating fast, efficient, scalable web services.\n\nIt supports the standard request/response model, but also provides support for WebSockets out of the box.\n\nIn this talk, I'll show you just how easy it is to get up and running with Phoenix by building an application, live!\n\nYou'll learn about:\n\nRouting\nBlazing fast template rendering\nCommunicating with databases\nRealtime messaging with Phoenix Channels\nReleasing to production\nPhoenix certainly has a lot to offer. Come join in the fun."
