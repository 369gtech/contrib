title: 'Designing a DSL in Kotlin (Nicolas Fränkel, Senior Consultant at SAP)'
recordingDate: 1504536529
description: "Kotlin is one of those “new” JVM languages that are currently rocking the boat. Although it’s made a great impact on Android, it’s equally good on the server side. As Domain-Specific Languages are constrained by the language they run on, Kotlin frees developers from Java fluent builders to propose something better.\n\nTaking the example of a Vaadin UI DSL, I’ll demo how one could design its own DSL with Kotlin."
