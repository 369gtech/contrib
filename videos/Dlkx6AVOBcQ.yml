description: "Angular is what HTML would have been had it been designed for web apps. In this presentation, Mi≈°ko Hevery, from Google, and author of Angular is going to show you what it's all about. \n\nAngular allows you to extend the HTML vocabulary, have proper business-logic / presentation separation through bidirectional data-binding, declarative application assembly through dependency-injection, and testability story like no other framework. Angular is a fundamentally different way of building an AJAX app."
