description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nThe Uncomfortable Truth of Bad Code\n\nI have some scary examples for you, gathered throughout many years on maintenance and on large modernization projects. Examples of code so indescribably bad that it's difficult to understand how it came to ever exist. These (anonymized) examples have been analyzed in order to determine how they came to be. Participate in this presentation so that you can avoid making the same mistakes in your next development project. ...or live with the misconception that only bad developers make bad code.\n\nStian Grenborgen, Sopra Steria\n\nStian Grenborgen is an experienced Java programmer and software architect working for Sopra Steria. He has worked on large and critical systems in the Norwegian government and with infrastructurally crucial systems for the financial sector. He takes a special interest in computer interface design both in his professional capacity and in his spare time. Although a popular speaker at JavaZone, this is his first time presenting at Jfokus."
