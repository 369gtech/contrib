title: 'When to Use a Graph Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433233319
description: "Database models have their own strengths and weaknesses, and as software developers, we need to know which are best suited for each application domain. This session considers use cases where a graph database, such as Neo4j, excels. Although social applications are the typical poster child for graph databases, you’ll see that graphs are being used everywhere—from data center management and geospatial and master data management to fraud detection and recommendations. You’ll see real-world examples that show best practices as well as common pitfalls and antipatterns and how to avoid them.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTobias Lindaaker\nTobias Lindaaker is a software developer at graph database company Neo Technology, developers of Neo4j--the world’s leading graph database. Tobias has always been a tinkerer, taking things apart to understand how they work and then putting them together again to make them better. When he first encountered Neo4j in 2007, his programming language of choice was Python. In order to make Neo4j and Python play nicely together, Tobias undertook the task of updating Jython to support the language constructs of Python 2.5. His journey has taken him deep within the expanses of Python, Java, the JDK and Hotspot. He has delivered code contributions to each, and holds a bare-metal familiarity of matters from language implementation to concurrency--all which help him drive the machinery of graph databases as a member of the Neo4j core team today.\nView more trainings by Tobias Lindaaker at https://www.parleys.com/author/tobias-lindaaker\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
