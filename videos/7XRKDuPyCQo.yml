title: 'Elkhound, Elsa and Cqual++: Open-Source Static Analysis...'
recordingDate: 1191901355
description: "Google TechTalks\nApril 11, 2006\n\nScott McPeak\n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk will cover three pieces of infrastructure for writing static analyses for C++. All are available as open source. Elkhound is a Generalized LR (GLR) parser generator. Its input is a grammar augmented with reduction actions written in C++. The GLR algorithm works with any context-free grammar, even ambiguous grammars. The user provides additional actions to resolve ambiguities that may arise during parsing. Elsa is a C++ parser written using Elkhound. It solves many of the classic parsing challenges of C and C++ by using an ambiguous grammar, delaying much of the disambiguation until the type checking phase.\n\nNot only does this lead..."
