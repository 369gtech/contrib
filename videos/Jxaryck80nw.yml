description: "Crankshaft is a new compilation infrastructure for V8, Google Chromeâ€™s JavaScript engine. By using aggressive optimizations, Crankshaft dramatically improves the performance of compute-intensive JavaScript applications -- often by more than a factor of two! In this presentation, you will get an insight into how we decide which functions to optimize and how we gather type-feedback while running your code and use that to turn the performance-critical parts of your JavaScript programs into efficient native code.\n\nKasper Lund is a software engineer at Google working on the design and implementation of programming languages. He has more than 10 years of industrial experience in designing and implementing virtual machines and runtime systems and his primary areas of interests and expertise are efficient interpretation, dynamic compilation, and adaptive optimizations. \n\nFor more on YOW!
