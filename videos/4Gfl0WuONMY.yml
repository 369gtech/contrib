description: "You've been hearing about Hadoop and HDFS. How does it work? \n\nIn this video, we use an innovative method to show how HDFS works with Legos. Jesse Anderson shows how HDFS handles files and replicates the data, then covers the read and write paths for the data. Finally, he talks about how HDFS handles failure scenarios and the importance of data locality.\n\n** Hadoop & Apache Spark training from NewCircle: https://newcircle.com/category/big-data"
