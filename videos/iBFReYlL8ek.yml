description: "by Bradley M. Kuhn, Michael Jaeger, Philippe Ombredanne, Valerio Cosentino, Max Sills and Thomas Steenbergen\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.220/license_tools_panel.webm\n\n\nLicense Compliance has become big business.  Many proprietary tools exist, but fortunately in\nrecent years FLOSS tools to aid understanding the licenses of codebases have been created.\nThis panel includes developers of many of these freely available tools. We'll discuss what these\ntools do, if they can actually address compliance problems in the wild yet, and the general\nchallenges of developing freely available tools in a heavily proprietarized industry. \n\nRoom: UA2.220 (Guillissen)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:00:00+01"
