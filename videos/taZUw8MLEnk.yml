recordingDate: 1513331960
description: "The ConsumerLab report Merged Reality reveals insights into how consumers expect virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to merge with physical reality, and that 5G will be a key technology for such experiences to become mainstream.\n\nThe report reveals that when boundaries between people's perception of physical and virtual reality start to blur, this could result in a drastic impact on lives and society. 7 out of 10 early adopters expect VR/AR to change everyday life fundamentally in six domains: media, education, work, social interaction, travel and retail.\n\nThe qualitative research in the report included an innovative focus group discussion series completely in VR with participants from North America and Europe, as well as traditional focus groups with current users of VR from Japan and South Korea. A series of qualitative VR tests with 20 Ericsson employees were also done to understand how lag in VR can trigger nausea.\n\nIn the quantitative part of the study, the report presents insights from a survey of 9,200 consumers in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, the UK and the US, aged between 15-69 with awareness of the concept of VR.\n\nMichael Björn is Head of Research at Ericsson ConsumerLab. In his role he is studying global consumer trends, as well as the process of assimilation of ICT into everyday consumer life. Professionally, he is most well-known as the author of the Ericsson ConsumerLab 10 Hot Consumer trends report that has been published annually for six years and gained much international media coverage, including appearances at BBC World News and CNN.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2002, Michael Björn was responsible for mobile internet applications at Ericsson in Japan. He joined Ericsson in 1997 as an analyst, after having completed his PhD in data modeling at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. Michael is also adjunct professor at the Lund University School of Economics and Management, a novelist with two works of fiction, and a journalist regularly contributing to Tokyo-based rock music magazine Strange Days.\n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
