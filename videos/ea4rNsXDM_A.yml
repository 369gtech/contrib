title: 'A Deep Learning Approach to Annotating de novo Transcriptome Assemblies (Matt Stata)'
recordingDate: 1550844310
description: "In computational biology, assembling transcriptomes without a reference genome poses a challenge and results in many variant assemblies for each gene.  Artificial neural networks, implemented in Python, perform very well for classifying and clustering these variants and selecting a best isoform.\n\nPresentation page -- https://2018.pycon.ca/talks/talk-PC-52397"
