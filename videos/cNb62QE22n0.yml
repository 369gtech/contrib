title: 'Embedding observability into your engineering culture'
language: English
recordingDate: 1606934098
description: "Having the data that observability unlocks is a great tool for your engineering teams, but it’s the people and the culture that will be the true force for transformation. So how can you create a safe culture that allows engineers to learn, try, and test?\n\nWe’ll explore this and also consider how to demonstrate the value of observability to both the people in your teams and the people higher-up, how to establish observability into your workflows to ensure that it’s not an afterthought, and how to create an environment that promotes collaboration and ground-level ideation."
