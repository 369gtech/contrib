description: "We live in a world deluged with data and inundated with information, yet when we need to make leadership decisions about people in our organizations, we still feel we don’t have enough substance to rely on. How can this be? When it comes to taking over a new team or appointing new leaders, just what data can you rely on? What sort of information flows through your team? How do your internal relationships function? Wouldn’t it be great if you could visualize these relationships? Think of what you could learn from such maps. Using sociometric explorations, we will guide you through the theory of mapping, providing a practical guide and descriptive examples from 25- and 85-person organizations.\n\nhttp://www.stretchcon.com/"
