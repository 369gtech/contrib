description: "RubyConf 2018 - Refactoring the Technical Interview by Mark Siemers\n\nIs your technical interview optimized? Could it use a refactor?\n\nDo you ask candidates questions that could actually influence your production codebase? Or, do you ask them about problems that are solved and standardized? Or worse, contrived and trivial?\n\nHave you ever asked any of these questions:\n\nFind min or max in a list\nImplement a sorting algorithm\nFizzBuzz (or any contrived algorithm)\n“Now can you do it recursively?”\nLeverage your production code and commit history to make your next interview more effective in identifying the right hire. All while having more fun."
