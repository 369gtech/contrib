title: 'YOW! West 2016 Matt Davies & Rob Moore - Modern Authentication'
recordingDate: 1470546954
description: "Terms like OAuth, OpenIDConnect, claims, tokens, two and three legged authentication, etc. are becoming increasingly common in discussions about software development. Most of us rely on these for authentication to services we use nearly every day! In an era where applications are highly distributed and dependent on other services to perform their function, modern identity approaches are important in allowing us to access protected resources without needing to share passwords around. This talk will help unravel some of these terms, explain modern approaches to authentication and show you how to easily get started setting some of these up yourself.\n\nMatt is a Lead Consultant for Readify specialising in Windows Azure and mobile application development.He sets out to introduce targeted new Agile software delivery practices and modern technology options with the goal of always leaving teams he works with operating more effectively than when he first met them. He speaks at the Perth Cloud user group, Windows Azure workshops and hackathon events in Perth and is a co-organiser for the first DDD-Perth conference.\n\nRobert is a Principal Consultant with Readify and specialises in leading and mentoring software teams to deliver business value. He has had a range of experience working with organisations to introduce and/or improve the use of Agile, Lean and continuous delivery approaches and this is an area he is particularly passionate about. While Robert has experience in a range of technologies, he specialises in C#, ASP.NET and Windows Azure.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
