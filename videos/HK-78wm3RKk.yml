With Barrel, you can easily bring and keep a view of your data inside your application and replicate it between your different machines. \n \nAfter briefly describing the architecture of barrel and its key features, the talk will show how we use it to create a custom data platform in Erlang or Elixir for a consumer oriented product, mixing local and remote storages and different peer-to-peer replications strategies.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/benoit-chesneau/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BENOIT CHESNEAU\nP2P SOLUTIONS AND DATABASE CRAFTSMAN\n\n\nBenoît Chesneau is an IT craftsman, living near Paris.
