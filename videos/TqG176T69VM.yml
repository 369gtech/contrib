description: 'The art of juggling has fascinated people since the days of ancient Egypt. In this talk, we posit that juggling theory can inform software development. We start with the mathematical insights of Claude Shannon, renowned as the father of Information Theory. After introducing “siteswap” notation, we use ClojureScript to visualize juggling patterns. Finally, we review some interesing results in neuroscience regarding juggling.'
