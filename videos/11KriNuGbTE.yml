title: 'Erwin Staal - Architecting for DevOps and Continuous Delivery'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620119504
description: "With Continuous Delivery and DevOps, we strive to deliver features on-demand, any time we want. This allows us to quickly respond to change in the market and respond to any issues we might face in production. In addition to the changes that this entails in the organization, we will also have to adjust the architecture of our systems. We will have to design our systems in such a way that we can easily replace parts without having downtime.\n\nIn this session, we will discuss a number of architectural concepts and patterns that enable continuous delivery. We will discuss application design and microservices, branch by abstraction, Canary releases, and Dark Launching. I will show you how real-time telemetry and cloud technologies can help us to gradually roll out our changes to our users in a fast and reliable way."
