description: "Integrating large-scale, high-dimensional molecular and physiological data holds promise in not only defining the molecular networks that directly respond to genetic and environmental perturbations that associate with disease, but in causally associating such networks with the physiological states associated with disease. Eric Schadt will discuss modeling approaches that integrate diverse types of data on broad scales to derive predictive network models that inform decision making on multiple levels, whether deciding on the next set of genes to validate experimentally or the best treatment for a given individual given detailed molecular and higher order data on their condition.\n\nEric Schadt\n\nMount Sinai School of Medicine\n\nDr. Eric Schadt recently joined Mount Sinai Medical School as Chairman and Professor, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and as Director, Institute of Genomics and Multiscale Biology in 2011. Previously, Dr. Schadt had been the Chief Scientific Officer at Pacific Biosciences, overseeing the scientific strategy for the company, including creating the vision for next-generation sequencing applications of the company's technology. Dr. Schadt is also a founding member of Sage Bionetworks, an open access genomics initiative designed to build and support databases and an accessible platform for creating innovative, dynamic models of disease. Dr. Schadt's current efforts at Mount Sinai to generate and integrate large-scale, high-dimension molecular, cellular, and clinical data to build more predictive models of disease so that we may better diagnose and treat disease, were motivated by the genomics and systems biology research he led at Merck to elucidate common human diseases and drug response using novel computational approaches applied to genetic and molecular profiling data. His research helped revolutionize a field in statistical genetics (the genetics of gene expression), has energized the systems biology field, and has led to a number of discoveries relating to the causes of common human diseases. At the time Dr. Schadt left Merck in 2009, greater than 50% of all new drug discovery programs at Merck in the metabolic space were derived from Dr. Schadt's work. Dr. Schadt was also recently appointed as Fellow to the Institute of Systems and Synthetic Biology, Imperial College London. Dr. Schadt received his B.S. in applied mathematics/computer science from California Polytechnic State University, his M.A. in pure mathematics from UCD, and his Ph.D. in bio-mathematics from UCLA (requiring Ph.D. candidacy in molecular biology and mathematics)."
