description: "RailsConf 2019 - The Selfish Programmer by Justin Searls\n\nCloud 66 - Pain Free Rails Deployments\nCloud 66 for Rails acts like your in-house DevOps team to build, deploy and maintain your Rails applications on any cloud or server.\n\nGet $100 Cloud 66 Free Credits with the code: RailsConf-19\n($100 Cloud 66 Free Credits, for the new user only, valid till 31st December 2019)\n\nLink to the website: https://cloud66.com/rails?utm_source=-&utm_medium=-&utm_campaign=RailsConf19\nLink to sign up: https://app.cloud66.com/users/sign_in?utm_source=-&utm_medium=-&utm_campaign=RailsConf19\n\nUsing Ruby at work is great… but sometimes it feels like a job!\n\nThis year, I rediscovered the joy of writing Ruby apps for nobody but myself—and you can, too! Solo development is a great way to learn skills, find inspiration, and distill what matters most about software.\n\nBuilding a real app on your own can be overwhelming, but this talk will make it easier. From development to monitoring, you'll build a toolset you can maintain yourself. You'll learn a few \"bad\" practices that will make your life easier. You may even find that selfish coding will make you a better team member at work!\n\n#railsconf #confreaks"
