title: 'Michael Fogus - Zeder - Production Rule Systems in Clojure'
recordingDate: 1388434702
description: "In this talk I will discuss a production rule system that I've developed using Clojure. I'll start by discussing production systems, their history, and how they're used. I will then talk about the architecture of Zeder and share some details about its construction, including (but not limited to) its use of arcane macrology and Pod-like references. Finally, I'll run through some code examples and ideas including: knowledge and rule development, expert systems as a value, and integration with Datomic.\n\nMichael Fogus is software architect working in the DC area at Dynamic Animation Systems with experience in distributed simulation, machine vision, and expert system construction. He's a contributor to the Clojure and ClojureScript programming languages and the Underscore-contrib library, co-author of \"The Joy of Clojure\" and author of \"Functional JavaScript\"."
