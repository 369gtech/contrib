description: "In this session, the journey of re-platforming Turkcell TV service from ground zero to Cloud Native within a few months will be shared.\n\nThe motivation for re-platforming was mainly to shorten very long time-to-market durations, to minimise the high costs of adding new features or even changing very simple features on the existing platform and eventually improve the end user happiness.\n\nHowever, the challenges were all surrounding us. The very first challenge was to keep the existing platform doing its own work but shifting the ownership of control to the new platform while 2 Million users were already actively using the service and without moving a single leave.\n\nWe will demonstrate how Spring Boot and Spring Cloud has helped us to start from ground zero and build the platform within only 4 months, applying test driven development, managing the integration of diverse monster legacy services, generating automatically beautiful but more importantly synchronised-with-code REST API documentation from tests, handling unexpected cases smoothly without affecting the end user, and enjoying our time while generating all these values.\n\nWe could not achieve this so quickly and at this level of quality without the following tools:\n\nSpring Boot\nSpring Boot Actuator\nSpring Boot Devtools\nSpring Boot Test\nSpring Security\nSpring Data JPA & Redis\nSpring Web REST\nSpring Web Services\nSpring Cloud Config\nSpring Cloud Stream\nSpring Cloud Eureka\nSpring Cloud Hystrix\nSpring Cloud Zipkin\nSpring Cloud Feign\nSpring Cloud Contract\nSpring Cloud potential projects\nAnd many other open source libraries and software like RabbitMQ, Redis, ELK stack, etc.\n\nErdem Günay, Principal Solution Architect, Turkcell\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
