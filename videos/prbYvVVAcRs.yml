description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nProject Tye: Building Developer Focused Tooling for Kubernetes and .NET - David Fowler & Justin Kotalik, Microsoft \n\nAs Kubernetes and Docker become more prevalent, we have made some hypotheses about the current state of microservices: • Container orchestrators were made for operations teams, not developers. • Kubernetes popularized patterns that are now prominent for microservices that are very hard to replicate locally (for e.g. sidecars). • Developers want to use the tools they are accustomed to when running locally. • Developers rarely need to run the full application during development. • Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests duplicate lots of information that exist in developer assets. Project Tye is an experiment by the .NET team to solve common challenges that developers have while developing and deploying microservices. Project Tye includes a local orchestrator to make developing microservices easier and the ability to deploy microservices to Kubernetes with minimal configuration. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekAa"
