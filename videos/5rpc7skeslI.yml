description: "Service Mesh - The New Single Point of Failure - Mitch Connors, Google, Sabeen Syed, HashiCorp & Thomas Rampelberg, Buoyant\n\nInterested in knowing why your favorite service mesh was implemented that way? Architecture decisions have real user impact. When building a service mesh, it is possible to fall into a trap of choosing implementation that is easier to build but makes it difficult to operate in the real world. While service meshes enable new levels of resiliency for usersâ€™ applications, they suffer from a chicken and egg problem: How do you build a resilient and scalable service mesh without having a service mesh to rely on?\nMaintainers of Istio, Linkerd2 and Consul will walk through tradeoffs the projects have made during implementation and the impact on users. Topics will include:\n\n    - Why it is important to verify environments before installation.\n    - How to build a service mesh which can be safely upgraded.\n    - What regular security updates mean for upgrades.\n    - How to give users the same stability for config changes as they require for code changes\n    - What to do when the mesh breaks.\n    - Why the division of responsibility is important."
