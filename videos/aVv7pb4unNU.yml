description: "JDK8 is bringing lambdas into the Java world. But without significant Java SE 8 libraries extensions lambdas would be only a toy. The centerpiece of the new libraries is the Streams API (formerly ‘Collections bulk operations’). Unfortunately, attempt to tell the whole ‘Lambda Project’ story during the single talk would be a thankless job. That is why we won’t talk about lambdas, we will talk about streams.\n\nThis session presents the Streams API and examples how to get the best performance and scalability using the library."
