description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSponsored Session: Splunk - Finding the Issues in Microservices Applications  \n\n In today’s application world, complexity rules. We have elastic and ephemeral environments, clouds of all shapes; continual growth in data sources. Add to that the fact that “slow is the new down”. So while things can appear to be simpler, that doesn’t mean easier. Abstractions like containers and orchestration mean our tools need to be faster and capable of helping us discover just what is going on.  Today, you need to move to rich observability data, to cover the wide interaction of our infrastructure and applications. We need to be able to answers questions that we never considered. We need full-fidelity data in real-time and world-class monitoring, analysis and response options.  Find out how to discover the unknown unknowns and their interactions and get insights for today's cloud and microservices architecture. Learn how metrics, traces and logs means you are never in the dark. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff1b"
