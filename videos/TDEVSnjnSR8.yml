description: "Spring I/O 2018 - Barcelona, 24-25 May\n\nSpring Cloud Function provides a servlerless programming model for \nSpring Boot applications, abstracting away all of the transport details and infrastructure, allowing you to keep all the familiar tools and processes, and focus firmly on business logic. It has evolved quite a bit from its early snapshot releases - we have learned some things on the journey and would like to share some of those lessons in this presentation. You will also see in detail how to write and deploy functions targeting the major servlerless vendor platforms, including Riff (at the heart of Pivotal Function Service)."
