description: "Chien Huey - DevOps Engineer, XO Group Inc.\n\nThe container revolution arrived at XO Group as we inverted our DevOps organization and gave squads more control over their deployment pipelines. We used Amazon Elastic Beanstalk to help ease the learning curve associated with moving from homegrown orchestration tools to containerized microservices. As a result, the company has been able to containerize over 90% of our client-facing assets in under a year. Along the way, we realized that as we latched our hopes and dreams onto Beanstalk, we also unleashed a giant. The giant known as AWS spend. In this session, we will analyze our growing cloud spend, developed our cost containment strategy and executed it. We’ll also discuss the results of our implementation of Docker Swarm to improve our instance utilization and lower our cost per vCPU."
