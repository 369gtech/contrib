description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nApplication security, defined as preventing malicious, automated attacks that appear to be legitimate, or syntactically correct that target your public facing web, mobile and API-based applications is an often overlooked element of your cloud native security stack. The infrastructure is covered by the cloud providers, often augmented with native and 3rd party services. Your containers can be protected by services and augmented by an immutable approach to your architecture. Yet at the application level, security is often overlooked. In this webinar, Shreyans Mehta, co-founder and CTO of Cequence Security will discuss the need for application security and how cloud native tools such as Envoy and Prometheus allow you to bake application security into your Kubernetes deployments."
