title: 'Nathan Herzing & Chris Shea - Helping voters with Pedestal, Datomic, Om and core.async'
recordingDate: 1416592049
description: "Democracy Works has been using a combination of Pedestal, Datomic, Om and core.async to build software to help voters know the status of their mail-in ballots. And we're ready to condense months of work to under an hour.\n\nWe will write (on stage) a system that accepts FTP uploads of postal service data on one end and on the other end continuously updates a voter about the status of their mail-in ballot. We'll get through Pedestal, Datomic, Om and core.async on the way in four small, independent projects. And we'll do it \"backwards\", from the front-end to the back-end.\n\nIncluded in the talk will be some discussion of a couple of libraries we've released to make this easier.\n\nNathan is a developer at Democracy Works where he enjoys writing Clojure to save democracy. He, alongside his colleagues, is a co-author of various open source Clojure libraries. When heâ€™s not writing Clojure, he enjoys thinking about how software gets made and how to improve that process.\n\nChris Shea has been writing Clojure professionally since 2010, currently using it at Democracy Works to make voting easier. He was a judge for the Lisp In Summer Projects contest and has contributed to various open source projects in numerous languages. He received an MFA in Writing from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago."
