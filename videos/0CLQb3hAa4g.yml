description: "Rajesh Lingappa (Co-Founder and CTO of Redmart) will take us through a technical tale about how an online grocery retailer and marketplace distributed the industry in Singapore.\n\nHe has been in the IT industry for over 20 years and has occupied CTO / VP Engineering positions for the past decade.\nHe and his technical team at Redmart have successfully implemented a system based on Continuous Deployment, microservices, lots of automated testing. Doing so, the team has achieved great confidence about their code quality (as they have demonstrated on stage at Java User Group by coding and pushing code live on redmart.com in just 45 minutes)."
