description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nThe standard's algorithms typically require a 'strict weak ordering'. I will explain what this really means and show that even simple uses of sort can have latent failures. Programmers can avoid the problems today with a bit of work. Changes to the standard will reduce errors and programming effort.\n— \nDr. Lawrence Crowl has expertise in programming languages, compilers, and parallel programming. He has been mixing threads with C++ for twenty-five years and is a major contributor to C++11. His goal is to achieve both high quality and high performance programs.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
