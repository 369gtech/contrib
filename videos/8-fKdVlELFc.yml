Although several additional features are needed in typical BPM application, like persistence, audit, migration of processes in a cluster. In this talk we present a framework for implementing long running FSM based processes as well as several design patterns that rendered useful in practice. The main features the framework provides are the defined semantics for structured states, scoped timers, persistence, audit and clustering.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/karolis-petrauskas/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - KAROLIS PETRAUSKAS\nCo-founder at Erisata\n\nKarolis is a Chief IT Architect and co-owner at Erisata LTD., a company based in Lithuania, focusing on Erlang/OTP solutions. Here he designed a number of Erlang/OTP based systems for telecommunication and electricity companies, many of which involved management of long running business processes. Experience in building such systems allowed him to extract key features for the business process management platform to have it effective while being non-invasive.\n\nHe is also an associate professor at the Vilnius University, giving lectures on software engineering. His scientific interest is in the domain of formal modelling and verification of software systems. This experience lead him to successfully applying these methods (like specification in TLA+ language) in real business problems.\n\nMore on Karolis Petrauskas: https://codesync.global/speaker/karolis-petrauskas/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
