title: 'GopherCon 2018: Michael Stapelberg - Go in Debian'

description: "Even if you don’t directly use Debian, you certainly have come into contact with it somehow: Debian powers many servers, is the base of Ubuntu, Raspbian, and others, and can even be found on gaming consoles in the form of SteamOS. In other words, making software available in Debian gives you huge reach!\n\n\nHence, it is no wonder that, as Go adoption increases, more and more Go software enters Debian. Michael’s talk will give you a whirlwind tour of how Debian packaging works for a typical Go package, and highlight how you (as an upstream software developer/maintainer) can make things easy for your friendly Debian contributors.\n\n\nWith its now over 1,000 Go libraries, Debian also provides an interesting case for large-scale Go deployments. Michael will share how we tackle the scale, what challenges we are facing, and how an ideal world could look."
