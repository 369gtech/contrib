recordingDate: 1504534125
description: "We will discuss the challenges of building a distributed documents editor at a global scale. Some of the things covered:\n\n– Approaches for making group editors. Operational transformation algorithms with conflicts resolution.\n– The challenges of distributed data applications – consistency and durability requirements.\n– Overview of architectures that we investigated: atomic group broadcast, master-slave replication, distributed caches – Erlang Mnesia, Infinispan. How to choose the right one?\n– A scalable and reliable system with Java, Nginx-Clojure, Apache ZooKeeper, AWS S3 and DynamoDB. Lessons learned after a year in production.\n\nAfter this talk you will know:\n\n– How real-world group editors work.\n– Why service discovery and dynamic configuration is important.\n– Use-cases for Apache ZooKeeper, AWS S3 and DynamoDB. Tips and best practices for using them in your project."
