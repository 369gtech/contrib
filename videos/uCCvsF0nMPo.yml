title: 'Heresy! Combining Type Systems with PHP - Josh Watzman'
language: English
recordingDate: 1447429295
description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/josh-watzman\n\nHack is Facebook's dialect of PHP. One of the major features of Hack is its strong, static type system. This technical talk describes how Hack adds a type system onto a dynamic, untyped language like PHP. The talk goes into detail on both the type system as well as the static typechecker that enforces it. In particular, the talk focuses on how Hack does all of these things without compromising the core of what makes PHP an incredibly productive language to work in.\n\nTalk objectives: discuss some of the design decisions and tradeoffs that went into designing Hack's type system to lie on top of the existing PHP language, as well as some of the implementation complexity that arises when a typechecker needs a sub-second response time on a codebase with tens of millions of lines of code.\n\nTarget audience: anyone interested in programming language design, type systems, evolving legacy codebases, PHP, or scaling problems with any of those. The talk assumes fluency with general programming concepts, but not advanced knowledge of any of the above topics.\n\nAbout Josh\n\nJosh Watzman is a software engineer at Facebook, joining right after completing CMU's undergraduate CS program. After working in Facebook's frontend on news feed, he felt the pain of working in a completely untyped language, and joined the Hack team in order to help the conversion effort. With the conversion at Facebook largely complete, he's involved in the open-source side of Hack, and loves bringing the joy of the language to as many people as possible."
