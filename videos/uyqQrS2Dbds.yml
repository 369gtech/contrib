title: 'News from JUnit 5.x: From Revolution to Continuous Evolution (Marc Philipp, Germany)'
recordingDate: 1557862189
description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/news-from-junit-5-x-from-revolution-to-continuous-evolution/\n\n2017 marked a revolutionary year for the most popular Java testing framework: after two years of development, JUnit 5 was finally released – the first major release in over a decade. But work hasn’t stopped since then. If anything, the amount of feedback and the number of feature requests from the community have increased considerably. As a consequence, there have been 4 new 5.x releases with additional features and enhancements, and the JUnit team is committed to keeping up the pace and shipping a new 5.x release every few months. So it’s fair to say that JUnit is back to evolutionary releases, but the team intends to deliver them far more frequently than in the past.\n\nIn this session, we’ll take a closer look at the new features such as improved Kotlin support, module path scanning, programmatic extension registration, tag expressions, annotation-based conditional test execution, improved parameterized tests and, last but not least, parallel test execution. Moreover, we’ll see how the most popular Java build systems (Maven, Gradle, Ant) now provide built-in first-class support for running tests on the JUnit Platform. To round off the session, we will look at the roadmap of what’s still to come."
