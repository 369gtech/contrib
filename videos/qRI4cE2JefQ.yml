description: "Ouch! What I Learned From Being Hit by a Serverless, Ruby Boomerang! - Ewan Slater, Oracle \n\nHave you ever done something that's come back and bitten you?    I have (frequently). Asking an open source project to put more effort into supporting your favourite language (Ruby in my case) is asking to be hit by your own boomerang - \"that's a great idea, why don't you get started?\"    In this talk I'll describe how I got hit by my own Ruby boomerang and wound up maintaining the Ruby FDK for the Fn project (not my day job).    I'll cover:  - why I believe we need open source serverless  - the Fn project  - the Ruby FDK (Function Development Kit)  - my experience of contributing to open source  - why I still want to be involved  - how I've encouraged others to start  - why you might want to get involved \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPed"
