description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nMob Programming, A Whole Team Approach\n\nMob Programming is a development practice where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and on the same computer. It is a whole-team approach to doing all the work the team does including designing, coding, testing, and working with the customers, users and other stakeholders. This is an evolutionary step beyond pair programming, and accentuates face-to-face communication, team alignment, collaboration, and self-organizing team concepts of the Agile approach to software development. Mob Programming can be a highly effective approach to software development. Please join me as I share how the concept got started, the benefits, techniques we use, and some of the problems we've faced.\n\nWoody Zuill, Woody Zuill Agile Guide\n\nWoody Zuill, a Programmer, Senior Consultant, Trainer, and Agile Coach, has been programming computers for 30+ years. He is a pioneer of the Mob Programming approach to teamwork in software development, and is considered one of the founders of the \"#NoEstimates\" discussion on Twitter."
