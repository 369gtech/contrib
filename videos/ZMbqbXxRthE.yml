description: "Distributed Systems are difficult to build and test for two main reasons: partial failure & asynchrony. These two realities of distributed systems must be addressed to create a correct system, and often times the resulting systems have a high degree of complexity. Because of this complexity, testing and verifying these systems is critically important. In this talk we will discuss strategies for proving a system is correct, like formal methods. We will also discuss less strenuous methods of testing which will help increase our confidence that our systems are doing the right thing.\n\nCaitie McCaffrey is a Backend Brat and Distributed Systems Diva at Twitter. Prior to that she built services and systems that power the entertainment industry at 343 Industries, Microsoft Game Studios, and HBO. While at 343 Industries she partnered with the eXtreme Computing Group in Microsoft Research to productionize Orleans as part of her work rewriting the Halo Services. Caitie has a degree in Computer Science from Cornell University She maintains a blog at CaitieM.com and frequently discusses technology and entertainment on Twitter @Caitie"
