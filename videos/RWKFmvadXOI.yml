description: "Here is the link to the presentation: https://goo.gl/AajFLg\n\nThere's a lot of hype around MVP pattern in the Android world. Now it's time for concretes. During his presentation Mateusz will tell you how IG divided responsibilities between pattern's different components, how they tied Presenters' and Views' lifecycles and what they did to make it all testable. If you'd love to make your Fragments' and Activities' code simpler and increase your coverage, but you're confused how to glue it all together - don't miss Mateusz's talk."
