description: "In this episode, we chat with Katherine Kampf, PM on Azure Big Data team, about the newly introduced ML Services in Azure HDInsight.\n\nML Services includes highly scalable, distributed set of algorithms such as RevoscaleR, revoscalepy, and microsoftML that can work on data sizes larger than the size of physical memory, and run on a wide variety of platforms in a distributed manner. Learn more about the collection of Microsoft's custom R packages and Python packages included with the product.\n\nML Services bridges these Microsoft innovations and contributions coming from the open-source community (R, Python, and AI toolkits) all on top of a single enterprise-grade platform. Any R or Python open-source machine learning package can work side by side with any proprietary innovation from Microsoft."
