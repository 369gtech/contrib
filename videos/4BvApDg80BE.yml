title: 'React and Type Systems - Jiri Tobisek (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1459363576
description: "What is the place of data types and type systems in JavaScript, a language so proud of its dynamic character? Should we, React developers, care about them, and can we benefit from them? These kinds of questions usually arouse heated and somewhat repetitive debate regarding the merits and drawbacks of types. In this talk, we'll examine the possible role of types and type systems in the context of developing React components and React-based applications. In particular, we will pay close attention to the way types help us create contracts between components within larger ecosystems. We'll review React's own internal runtime type system and compare tools such as TypeScript and Flow.\n\nAt the end of the talk, you should come out not only with practical knowledge about existing software, but also with a fresh understanding of type systems' relevance to your current and future projects.\n\nLink to presentation slides: https://speakerdeck.com/tobisek/react-and-type-systems\n\nAbout Jiri: Ji?í Tobíšek is a software engineer currently working at Wix.com. He is intrigued by the challenges of human-machine interaction and fascinated by programs that create other programs. For most of his career, he found himself tinkering with UI systems for building other UI systems. His background in visual arts draws him to the intersection between software and beauty. Although born in Prague, he somehow got stranded in the Middle East, and has lived there for the past 15 years."
