description: "The purpose of this session is to share how Spotify supports engineers to become more cross-skilled learners. I will share the individual and organizational challenges Spotify identified on our way towards this goal. In the talk I will share our journey, the challenges and success stories when Spotify explored a new approach to cross-skilled learning. At Spotify we have identified some critical steps that helps a senior engineer to pursue this path. Finally, I will also explain how Spotify has changed our organization to support and grow cross-skilled learning. I hope to inspire you to take one first step in this direction too!\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
