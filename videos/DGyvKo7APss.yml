description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeakers: Lou Crocker, John Ferguson\nMuch like Spring burst onto the scene and became a defacto standard for Java, Sencha is vying for a similar role in the world of HTML5. From Ext JS for desktop development, Sencha Touch for mobile, and Sencha Architect as a design tool, it has become a pervasive technology in the new paradigm of multi-client development.\n\nIn this session we will use our own SpringTrader reference application to illustrate integration techniques of Spring with Sencha. We will go beyond the basic wiring of a REST call with binding results to UI components, and look at mapping the Spring MVC and Sencha MVC architectures, along with other tips and tricks to streamline your mobile application development efforts."
