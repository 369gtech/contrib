recordingDate: 1599606538
description: "Noah Kantrowitz\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/SL3C7M\n\nThis talk covers a very basic introduction to the Python Global Interpreter Lock from the point of view of container operations and deployment, along with the knowledge and tools to architect high quality Python application infrastructure. This includes how various application servers interact with the GIL, what problems is causes from an ops-centric point of view, and best practices for running Python applications efficiently and at scale despite the limitations.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 10:25:00 2020 at Python 2"
