Istio provides a complete solution for it by providing behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole. Unlike relatively new concept of Istio, different kinds of mature monitoring systems may already exist and running for a long time in the environment, like NewRelic, logDNA, Sysdig. And how to use those massive amount of valuable data and integrate with existing system is a question worth thinking of.  This topic will introduce how to extend Istio by creating a mixer adapter, and take NewRelic metrics adapter as an example, to help you fully understand the mechanism underneath and best practice we learned during the process. And by the end, you will be able to build one of your own for any kinds of backends, for metrics, logging, quota or authorization.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKZ"
