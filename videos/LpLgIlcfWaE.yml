title: 'Dion Stewart - Learning That Sticks - Upskill Your Teams with a Dojo'
recordingDate: 1557958550
description: "Pull back the curtain on organizations’ strategic plans and you’re likely to find one or more transformation initiatives to adopt and implement modern engineering practices, DevOps, Agile and/or Lean, API design, microservices, and cloud architectures. In addition, you may also find initiatives focused on innovation and product design in the form of Design Thinking, Lean UX, and Customer Development.\r\n\r\nAdopting all these practices requires a cultural shift that is hard to achieve through typical approaches to training. Most organizations adopt short, “sheep-dipping” training and workshops, despite their lack of effectiveness in forming new habits and ways of working that stick.\r\n\r\nOne solution is the dojo - where teams undergo six-week immersive learning experiences to learn new practices and processes, applying them while delivering real-world products and services, all within the constraints of their organization. The dojo is both a physical space and a way of learning and practicing. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/5NYvjSCMHMD"
