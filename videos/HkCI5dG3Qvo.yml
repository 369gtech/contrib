title: 'Programming on Linux on Windows using WSL'
language: English
recordingDate: 1618354723
description: 'Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a great tool that allows you to work in a Linux system while still being in your Windows Operating System. Linux is one of the most common operating systems because the development tools, languages and frameworks are easy to install and work with. However, with WSL, you can now run a GNU/Linux environment directly on windows, allowing you to take advantage of the command line tools, utilities and applications of Linux, and continue using Visual Studio Code.'
