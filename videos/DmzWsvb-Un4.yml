description: "Quantum computers are mind bogglingly powerful machines that take a novel approach to processing data. Built on the principles of quantum mechanics, they utilize complex and fascinating laws of nature that are always there, but usually remain hidden from view like superposition and entanglement. In this video, i'll talk about the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. Specifically, we'll discuss the examples of quantum annealing, sampling, and quantum gates as layers in a neural network. We'll first try to cover quantum mechanics though, get hype! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/quantum_machine_learning\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
