description: "This talk demos a vision that started to leak into reality as small prototypes. A vision of a world where writing and maintaining build scripts is fun and not black magic. A world without scoped-multi-config-multi-project builds. With fast dependency resolution. Intuitive and statically checked build configuration. Where large builds are composed from small self-contained and easy to understand builds. Where you only need to learn a small Scala library nothing more. \n\nWeâ€™ll talk about concepts, implementation specifics and do a live demo. This is not a complete tool, but a collection of crucial pieces and insights that may one day contribute to one.\n\nTalk by Jan Christopher Vogt\nMarch 4th, 2016\n\nhttp://www.nescala.org/\n\nProduced by NewCircle - Training & Resources for Developers:\nhttps://newcircle.com/"
