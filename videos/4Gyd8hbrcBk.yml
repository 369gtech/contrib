language: English
recordingDate: 1435305641
description: "Hey everyone, in this CSS lesson for beginners we'll explore what the line height, letter spacing & word spacing properties can do for us.\n\nLetter spacing controls the horizontal space between characters / letters. The word spacing controls the horizontal space between words, and the line height controls the vertical space between lines of text within a tag. This is not to be confused with padding or margin.\n\nAnyway, peace out, have fun & keep coding :).\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n========== HTML Basics Course ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
