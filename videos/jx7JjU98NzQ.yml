title: 'Integrating DEI into the game development process'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605546048
description: "How do we create a sense of belonging in video games? The industry does not yet have a consistent and actionable way to evaluate how well games align with the needs of diverse and underrepresented players. \nAt Stadia Games and Entertainment, we answered this challenge by developing a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) rubric for our game development process.

A key focus is on equipping video game professionals to set up similar processes at their organizations to meaningfully integrate DEI as a core part of the development and game evaluation process.\n\nWatch more MIGS sessions → https://goo.gle/2UpbOi1\nSubscribe to Google Developers → https://goo.gle/developers"
