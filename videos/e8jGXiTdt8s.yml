recordingDate: 1542725707
description: 'Simply building a successful machine learning product is extremely challenging, and just as much effort is needed to turn that model into a customer-facing product. As we cover the journey of Zendesk’s article recommendation product, we’ll discuss design challenges and real-world problems you may encounter when building a machine learning product at scale. We’ll talk in detail about the evolution of the machine learning system, from individual models per customer (using Hadoop to aggregate the training data) to a universal deep learning model for all customers using TensorFlow, and outline some challenges they faced while building the infrastructure to serve TensorFlow models. They also explore the complexities of seamlessly upgrading to a new version of the model and detail the architecture that handles the constantly changing collection of articles that feed into the recommendation engine. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/crunch'
