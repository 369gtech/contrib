language: English
recordingDate: 1620776592
description: "Imagine machines that interact with us using the same interface we use to interact with each other â€” spoken language! Recent progress in NLP has opened up new possibilities for language-based systems. In this talk, we'll explore the recent history of language models and highlight novel applications of statistical and deep learning approaches. Then, we'll explore emerging products that automate, generate, and create using these models, and discuss the implications for building them, including safety, ethics, and the invention of new design metaphors. Finally, we'll speculate about where this might take us in the next few years. Can machines ... play?\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\nHilary is the co-founder of Hidden Door, an online game platform for kids to discover and create stories with AI, and the Data Scientist in Residence at Accel.
