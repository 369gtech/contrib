description: "Have you ever had a Spark job fail in it’s second to last stage after a “trivial” update or been part of the way through debugging a pipeline to wish you could look at it’s data or had an “exploratory” notebook turn into something less exploratory? Come join me for a surprisingly simple adventure into how to build recoverable pipelines and have more debuggable pipelines. Then join me on the adventure where in we find out our “simple” solution has a bunch of hidden flaws, how to work around them, and end on the reminder of how important it is to test your code.\n\n-----\n\n- Learn more about Scylla Open Source: https://www.scylladb.com/open-source/\n- Test drive Scylla Enterprise: https://www.scylladb.com/test-drive/\n- Find out about Scylla Cloud: https://www.scylladb.com/product/scylla-cloud/"
