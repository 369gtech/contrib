title: 'Olowoniwa Gabriel Ayokunle - CYBERSECURITY! The good, the bad, and the hacked'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620644934
description: "With security moving closer to the beginning of the software development lifecycle, developers are being asked to make their code more secure as they write it. Not only will that better protect organizations from cyberattacks, but it can save time and money by getting apps online faster.\n\nDevelopers, however, are not security experts. That's why compilations such as the OWASP Top Ten list of critical web application security risks contain the same vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, year after year.\n\nThis session aims to expose developers, technology enthusiasts, and the general public to the need for security and they can build secure products."
