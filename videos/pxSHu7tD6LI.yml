description: "Novel Address Mappings for Shingled Write Disks\n\nWeiping He and David H.C. Du, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities\n\nShingled Write Disks (SWDs) increase the storage density by writing data in overlapping tracks. Consequently, data cannot be updated freely in place without overwriting the valid data in subsequent tracks if any. A write operation therefore may incur several extra read and write operations, which creates a write amplification problem. In this paper, we propose several novel static Logical Block Address (LBA) to Physical Block Address (PBA) mapping schemes for in-place update SWDs which significantly reduce the write amplification. The experiments with four traces demonstrate that our scheme can provide comparable performance to that of regular Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) when the SWD space usage is no more than 75%.\n\nView the full HotStorage '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotstorage14/workshop-program"
