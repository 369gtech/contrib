description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Xavier F. Gouchet and Jérémy Bartolomeu Bonze, Workwell.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=ZPP-9970\n\nAs developers, more often than not, you have access to fast and reliable internet connection, all day long. But the users you target won't. Limited data plans, unreliable network coverage, commuting : those are real obstacle that your users will see daily. This means that network will only be available at some times, and not necessarily when the user wants to interact with your application.\n\nOur talk will focus on creating a user experience with ‘offline’ being the default working state, and having access to the internet being a bonus for your users. We’ll see how to design your UI/UX to make offline more than an edge case scenario, as well as how to architecture your application, and which tools and libraries can help you to implement it.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
