description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Crossplane and Promises - Steve Cavallo, Cloudcheckr\n\nConfiguration management has become virtually standard in every industry. As we have moved to infrastructure as code, and most recently serverless, the tools have changed but many of the principals for governing systems have remained the same. In this presentation I will talk about the Promise theory and how it applies to several of the most popular infrastructure-as-code solutions - Crossplane, terraform, cloudformation. https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/promise-theory%E2%80%94what-it Most notably, how Crossplane keeps promises and how this is fundamentally different than other existing toolsets, to quote Mark Burgess, \"by shifting the attention away from what changes (or which algorithms to enact), onto what interfaces exist between components and what promises they keep and why.\" The approaches to describing systems will have different output and challenges when applied at scale."
