description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nEthereum is a Turing complete Blockchain. Instead of just processing transactions like Bitcoin, the Ethereum Virtual Machine can run programs. There is one catch regarding any code that is deployed: Fixing errors is almost impossible. Hence, testing becomes incredibly important. The beauty of Unittesting in Ethereum? You can do it in Python and I will show you how.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/SmokinCaterpillar/Snowballs\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
