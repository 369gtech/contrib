title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Hardware Hacking Village - Joseph Long - Learn to Solder the Badge Buddy Kit'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597706551
description: "Learn to Solder with HackerBoxes. Assemble your very own BadgeBuddy. HackerBoxes has updated a special edition BadgeBuddy soldering kit for DEF CON 28 SAFE MODE.\n\nThe BadgeBuddy is a simple and fun kit to introduce basic soldering skills. Once assembled, the blinky mini-badge PCB can be hung from a conference lanyard, backpack, purse, belt, etc using the included bead-chain. The BadgeBuddy uses self-cycling rainbow LEDs for a reduced bill of materials requiring no external control circuitry. The result is a very nice colorful effect that is still simple enough for a first time soldering project.\n\nAs in past years, the BadgeBuddy is free (as in beer) and in light of DEF CON 28 SAFE MODE, HackerBoxes will send it directly to you, anywhere in the United States, for only $1 S&H. If you do not already have soldering tools on hand, HackerBoxes is also making a set of basic soldering tools available at cost. Both can be found at HackerBoxes.com and can be ordered now to ship starting on July 20. Orders as late as July 25 should still be received in time for DEF CON 28 SAFE MODE, but earlier is always better in light of recent postal delays."
