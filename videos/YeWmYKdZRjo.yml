description: "New Cloud Foundry Architectures and Features and their Performance Impact - Surya Duggirala, IBM\n\nAs Cloud Foundry architecture is evolving with design changes to CFCR, CFAR and routing layers, we are focusing on how these changes impact overall Cloud Foundry performance and scalability. As Cloud Foundry is working to embrace both Kubernetes and Istio service mesh while keeping its core strength of developer experience, it is important to understand how these integrations impact performance. At the same time, we need to understand the impact of new design features like C2C, OCI, Envoy sidecar process etc., on Cloud Foundry. This session gives an update on all the new design features and architectures from a performance point of view.\n\nAbout Surya Duggirala\nSurya Duggirala is IBM STSM responsible for Architecture and Performance Engineering of IBM Watson and Cloud Platform.
