title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: A smarter Way to Test Accessibility'
recordingDate: 1523513027
description: "There's no doubt that accessibility is important. WCAG 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation nearly 20 years ago, and WCAG 2.1 is soon to be a Candidate Recommendation. Our community has been talking about accessibility for years, and each major release of Drupal is more accessible than the last. Nevertheless, we find it hard to make the time to thoroughly test our work, and like all testing, when crunch time comes, if it's not automated, it may not happen.\n\nWe can drastically reduce the effort involved in accessibility testing, and reduce human errors, by automating some tests as part of a standard Continuous Integration (CI) process. There are a number of paid and free tools available on the market, and we've chosen three to compare.\n\nGoogle's Litehouse (using Deque's aXe-core rules engine)\nOpen source\nFree\nIncludes tests for performance, progressive web apps, and more\nTenon.io\nSoftware as a service\n30-day trial\nGrowing in popularity,\nWAVE API (from WebAIM.org)\nSoftware as a service and self-hosted\n100 free credits\nFrom the makers of the popular browser extension (http://wave.webaim.org/extension/)\nWhat you will learn:\n\nWhat is automated accessibility testing, and what can be tested\nHow to integrate Lighthouse, Tenon.io and WAVE API with your CI process\nWhat are the benefits of Lighthouse\nWhat are the benefits of Tenon.io\nWhat are the benefits of WAVE API\n\n\nSlides available at\n\nhttps://laura-johnson.github.io/accessibility-presentation/"
