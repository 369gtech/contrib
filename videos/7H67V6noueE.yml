description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJesper Boeg - Agile/Lean Coach and Author of Priming Kanban\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this session I will share my personal Agile journey. From my first encounter with Extreme Programming at university, through experiences with Scrum, Lean and Kanban. A journey that has taken me from having great success implementing Scrum and a growing belief that Scrum was the one silver bullet to rule them all, to an identity crisis when my religion came crashing down on me. From rebelling against Scrum as local optimization, batch thinking and cargo cult religion when discovering Lean and Kanban principles, before new experiences and success with Scrum and \"Scrumban\" forced me to realize that the world is not black and white, either or.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
