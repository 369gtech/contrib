description: "Speaker: Martin Splitt @g33konaut\n\nVR is cool, Web is great - how about WebVR? In this workshop we will be creating a WebVR application using A-Frame. We will explore the WebVR API and the A-Frame library to build a small VR application that works in your browser - even on your phone! \n\nRequirements: Make sure your laptop is capable of rendering 3D graphics in the browser by visiting https://get.webgl.org - if you see a spinning cube, you're ready. If you have a smartphone that is WebGL capable, bring it too (and have it charged)!\n\nMartin is open source contributor, WebGL tinkerer and web evangelist by heart from Zurich with a decade experience from the trenches of software engineering in multiple fields.\nHe works as a software engineer at Archilogic in front- and backend. He devotes his time to moving the web forward, fixing problems, building applications and systems and breaking things for fun & profit.\n\nEvent Page: https://2018.jsconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: Huiren Woo\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/eoM1/"
