description: "O'Reilly's Fluent Conference was created to give developers working with JavaScript a place to gather and learn from each other. As JavaScript has become a significant tool for all kinds of development, there's a lot of new information to wrap your head around. And the best way to learn is to spend time with people who are actually working with JavaScript and related technologies, inventing ways to apply its power, scalability, and platform independence to new products and services.\n\nFluent Conference provides a variety of forums for learning, from workshops and sessions with experts to the \"hallway track\" between sessions, where attendees informally connect and share questions, knowledge, and perspectives with their peers."
