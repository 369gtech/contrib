description: "While cloud native appears to be on a huge winning streak, there’s an elephant in the room—too many enterprise development teams have been left behind, facing a host of cultural changes, complexities, and training challenges. Bob Quillin outlines how the cloud native community can address these challenges and create a more open multicloud future, reduce complexity (rather than piling more on), and be more inclusive to all teams—modern and traditional, startups and enterprises alike.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
