language: English
recordingDate: 1510141205
description: "Did you know that an average Jenkins installation has around 100 plugins installed to build and deploy software? And more and more plugins are added every day? Together with the new features in the weekly releases, Jenkins attempts to stay current in a competitive Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tooling landscape.\n\nThe downside of all these possibilities is that it is hard to wrap your head around what is possible with Jenkins and what are best practices.\n\nAt a rate of 1 tip per minute I'll take you through some core and advanced features to successfully unleash the full potential of Jenkins in your CD process. Tips are applicable to both Jenkins novices and pros. So even if you know the differences between Declarative and Scripted Pipelines, you'll probably pick up some new tricks.\n\n# Joep Weijers\nJoep is a Build Master at TOPdesk with a keen interest in delivering quality software continuously. He loves playing around with Jenkins Pipelines, Selenium, Docker and keeps in touch with his inner developer by educating his colleagues on testable Java code."
