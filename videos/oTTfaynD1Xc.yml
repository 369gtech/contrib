description: "In the world of cloud-native distributed architectures, such as microservices, “event driven” is more popular than ever. But it's a broad category that covers a variety of use cases, ranging from a simple enterprise integration to a complex data streaming. So, how to make sense of it all? In this mostly hands-on session, we'll cover Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Function as defacto technologies for Spring-based, event-driven microservices, and provide an overview of the recent developments and features in both projects.\n\nSpeaker: Oleg Zhurakousky, Developer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/event-driven-with-spring"
