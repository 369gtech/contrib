title: '"Rosie Pattern Language: Improving on 50-Year Old Regular Expression Technology" by Jamie Jennings'

description: "Regular expressions are everywhere, including in the inner loops of most data mining code. But they don't scale! Almost every implementation uses exponential backtracking, which can stall mining of big data, where input format anomalies are likely. And building collections of regex is fraught, because they don't compose. Perhaps most importantly, regex don't scale to teams of people, because they are famously hard to read, understand, and maintain.\n\nThe Rosie Pattern Language (RPL) addresses all of these scale challenges: big data is processed in linear time in the input size; packages of composable patterns are easily shared; and it has a readable syntax, with named patterns, flexible whitespace, and comments, like a programming language.\n\nYou can see the advantage of named patterns even on the command line. To extract network addresses from a file, would you rather type this:\n\negrep -o '(([0-9]{1,3})([.][0-9]{1,3}){2}|\\w+([.]\\w+)+)' \n\n(and hope you got it right, and keeping in mind that you won't get ipv6 addresses with this pattern), or would this be easier:\n\nrosie grep -o subs net.any \nRPL is based on Parsing Expression Grammars, which are more powerful than regular expressions but share many their features. (Unlike regex, PEGs can match recursively defined data, like HTML/XML, JSON, and more.) RPL will look familiar to people who use regex, and is meant to be easy to use for everyone. It is open source software, under the MIT license.\n\nSpeaker: Jamie Jennings"
