Thanks! https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/wdnfhm4n75e7bkh7mgqg3xwlrue\n\nEach year we try to help people who've got great ideas. We aim to help them polish their proposals to speak at ngConf. In this, our 3rd, office hours we will be covering what we want to see from speaker submissions this year. And unlike years past, we have some additional feedback and requirements for speakers. \n\nng-conf is a two day, single track conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 500 to 700 Developers from across the country will converge on beautiful Salt Lake City, UT to participate in training sessions by the Google Angular team, and other Angular experts. In addition to the invaluable training, ng-conf will deliver a premier conference experience for attendees, providing opportunities to network with other developers, relax at social events, and engage in some of the unique entertainment opportunities available in Utah."
