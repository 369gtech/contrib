title: 'Enhanced Deprecation in Java 9'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474497522
description: 'Java has grown immensely since its introduction, more than 20 years ago. However, there has not been a corresponding effort to remove obsolete features from the system. Some features have been deprecated, but very few have actually been removed. The platform has grown ever larger and more complex, resulting in an accumulation of complexity and technical debt. These impose a continual tax on development. This session explores “deprecation,” the trailing edge of the feature lifecycle. This includes work in Java 9 to update and clarify the @Deprecated annotation, plus additional tools being provided to enable developers to assess the impact of deprecation on their codebases and to help them deal with code migration more effectively.'
