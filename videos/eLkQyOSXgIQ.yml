And the ones who aren't usually include not only an HTTP server, but a complex interface to access all the components of the underlying application. All this in realtime.\n\nFarwest is a new web development platform that allows you to painlessly build realtime web applications. It is designed to allow a clean separation of concerns, allowing an Erlang developer to only worry on the backend, and a frontend developer to never have to look at Erlang code.\n\nFarwest packs many great libraries and mechanisms to cut down the amount of code you need to write. It's entirely built on REST principles and all existing Farwest code can be used as a REST API out of the box. It also brings Erlang's upgrade management to the frontend, allowing you to fully upgrade both server and client-side of your web application in a single step.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory \nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
