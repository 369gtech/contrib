description: "Speaker: Zion Ng (@zionsg2015)\n\nPHP developers today are spoilt for choice when choosing a framework to use for their applications. Frameworks have come a long way from isolated libraries of code to embodiments of design patterns and best practices. This is in no small way due to PSR (PHP Standard Recommendation). Thanks to it, one can even mix and match components from different frameworks! This tutorial seeks to bring more awareness, appreciation and encourage adoption of PSRs as we sit down together to understand the fundamentals and try our hands at implementing some of them.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nZion Ng is a Singaporean freelance web developer at intZone.com. Programming has been his favourite hobby since his teens, a tool to create solutions for himself, family and friends. He believes in lifelong learning as passion may die off but passion for learning will keep the flame alive. He graduated from the School of Computing, National University of Singapore and is also a Zend Certified Engineer (PHP and Zend Framework).\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VGAF/"
