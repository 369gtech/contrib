title: 'Configure Requisition bot on PeopleSoft'
language: English
recordingDate: 1626672524
description: 'Leveraging Chatbots within PeopleSoft helps interact with PeopleSoft applications through natural, conversation-like interactions using voice or text messages. The pre-built skill for Requisition Inquiry will enable requesters to quickly search for their requisition items and view the status of the items in the Request Lifespan. It saves the time and effort of searching and managing the requisitions through Chatbot. The video demonstrates a step-by-step procedure to configure the Requisition Skill (ODA 21.06) on PeopleSoft Financials and Supply Chain Management (PeopleSoft FSCM 9.2 Update Image 40, PeopleTools 8.59.01).'
