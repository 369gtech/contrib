description: "http://www.cppcon.org\nâ€”\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nI have been developing software for roughly 30 years. Yes, I started before I was born. I have been doing C++ for roughly 20 years, not very well at first, and slightly better now.\n\nI work at F5 Networks, and have worked at Disney, VMware, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, among many others. I have benefited from a wide range of experience and personalities.\n\nI have a personal grudge against code that does not strive to reach a high standard. I am dismayed at code that does not reach its potential. And I firmly believe that writing code well creates a better, more stable, more maintainable product.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
