description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nIn the process of migrating our architecture to microservices we suffered from a lack of alignment across the different applications we have. This brought several painful effects to our organisation, like missing heterogeneous procedures, problems in managing services at scale and a lot of duplicated work across development teams.\n\nAlmost one year ago we started to develop a common internal framework based on Spring Boot to tackle problems at different levels. We began with monitoring, logging and metrics and we quickly added several other features.\n\nOne of the main benefits we achieved was to streamline and improve consistency in the way we deploy and support our services from an ops perspective.\n\nIn this talk we describe the journey that brings us to what we have at the moment: a project inherited from more than 40 different microservices that provide a lot of common features and a clean space where our new contribution model can take place."
