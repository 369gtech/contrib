description: "In this talk, I'll cover how the TypeScript project grew from a small project to a popular web tool, and some of the bumps along the way.  I'll also compare this with how Rust has changed and adapted since its 1.0 release.\n\nLastly, I'll talk about how Rust's collaborative design works and how it helps to shape Rust's direction, and how other open source projects may be able to use similar techniques.\n\nEVENT:\n\nLinux Conf AU 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJonathan Turner\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s87cTnmfM0k"
