description: 'So what exactly is needed to get containerized microservices to run in production at scale? In this talk, we will briefly explore the concepts behind microservices and Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS) can be used to simplify the deployment and management of microservices. We will dive deep into some of the challenges of running microservices, such as load balancing, service discovery, and secrets management, and weâ€™ll see how Amazon ECS can help address them.
