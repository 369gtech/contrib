description: "Christopher Biggs\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/115/\nThe concept of \"Continuous Delivery\" has been paraphrased as \r\n\"Move fast and break things\", that is automate your testing and deployment \r\nto remove as many delays as possible between developer and\r\nproduction, and be prepared to react rapidly when something goes wrong.\r\n\r\nThe trick is knowing whether something has gone wrong.\r\n\r\nMost businesses have analytics, monitoring and dashboards.  \r\nIn fact, if you look really hard, most businesses have a dozen or more \r\ndifferent silos of monitoring data.   The problem is that it's difficult\r\nto get a business-wide overview of all this data.\r\n\r\nNode-RED is a visual data-flow tool that has a rich collection of \r\ninterfaces to other services, and is capable of talking to most of these \r\nsilos in order to provide synergistic insights, and real time alerts.\r\n\r\nIn combination with mobile dashboard tools like Blynk, this allows \r\ntargeted mobile dashboard applications to be built and deployed in minutes, \r\nfor one user or a thousand.\r\n\r\nThe attendee will learn the capabilities of Node-RED and Blynk, \r\nsee some examples of dashboard apps, and receive practical advice on \r\nhow to get started with their own data.\r\n\r\nWith \"dashboard driven development\" your process becomes first build \r\na dashboard to monitor some element, second make a change, third\r\nverify that the change had the desired effect.\r\n\r\nEvery time you make a change to your operating environment, you'll be \r\nable to monitor vital statistics from your pocket, in real time.   \r\n\r\nThe collection of dashboards you've built over time will give you increased\r\nconfidence whenever you make a change that your business' key performance \r\nmetrics are where you expect them to be."
