title: 'One Ring to Bind Them - Mark McGranaghan'
recordingDate: 1355703262
description: 'Ring is a tool for writing web applications in Clojure. It provides some functionality itself, but also acts as a binding between various other Clojure web libraries. In this talk I discuss how the Ring spec enables this interoperability, show examples of Ring-based libraries, and discuss the emerging Clojure web development ecosystem. I suggest that web development with Ring is an example of the more general idea of composable, functional abstractions.'
