title: 'Detox: tackling the flakiness of mobile automation - Viktorija Sujetaitė'
recordingDate: 1551084756
description: "As the number of smartphone users is expected to hit the 5 billion mark next year, we can confidently assume that the popularity and demand of mobile apps will continue to grow. Naturally, mobile apps do require testing, but a lot of it is done manually. The most difficult part of automated testing on mobile, is only the tip of the testing pyramid - E2E tests. The core of the problem with E2E is flakiness, which results in unreliable tests.\nAt Wix, we believe the only way to tackle this flakiness head on is by moving from black box testing to gray box testing. And for that, React Native mobile apps automation library - Detox - is being created.\n\nBio:\nViktorija is a Mobile QA Engineer at Wix. After gaining experience in Web and Windows desktop apps testing, she followed her passion for technology and trends to work with mobile apps. At Wix, she’s making mobile automation an inseparable part of the QA cycle - working with Detox and teaching others to work with it."
