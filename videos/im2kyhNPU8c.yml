description: "\"ADTK is an open-source Python toolkit for unsupervised/rule-based time series anomaly detection. Focusing on building practical models in IoT environments, the toolkit offers a set of common model components with a unified API, which includes detection algorithms (detectors), feature engineering methods (transformers), and ensemble methods (aggregators), as well as pipe classes that connect them together. It also provides several auxiliary modules for data processing, visualization, model evaluation, etc.\n\nIn this talk, we will first discuss some simple, but important, concepts of time series anomaly detection that are often handled incorrectly in practice. Those discussions will lead to the motivation for creating ADTK. We then will dive into the key components of ADTK and demonstrate how to design and assemble them into a model. It will be followed by an introduction to some auxiliary modules that data scientists may find useful. Various examples will be presented in the demo of the toolkit.\"\n\nADTK is an open-source Python package for unsupervised/rule-based time series anomaly detection. It provides a unified API for common building blocks of anomaly detection models, several auxiliary tools, and includes easy access to scikit-learn models. In this talk, we will present how a data scientist may use ADTK to build a practical anomaly detection model on time-series IoT data.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
