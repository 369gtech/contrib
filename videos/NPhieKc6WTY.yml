description: "Value Stream Integration at Worldpay\n\nDr. Tuuli Bell, Partner Account Manager, Tasktop\nJames Percival, Senior Project Manager, Worldpay\n\nWorldpay, IntelliQA and Tasktop jointly present Worldpay’s transformational DevOps journey to eliminate silos. The key theme for the presentation is Cost vs. Speed. From a value stream integration perspective we’ll also discuss how the on-going initiative addresses Fragile vs. Resilient practices. The journey, not without its challenges, commenced three years ago, and we would at this point like to share our lessons learnt with the community and share our knowledge and experience. The next phase of the project is to incorporate Service Management within the DevOps Value Stream.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
