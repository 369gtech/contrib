description: "Today's application stack is a much more complex environment than the traditional JEE one. Moving from a Spring/JEE background to the cloud can be a complicated transition, but Nati Shalom, of GigaSpaces, is going to help you get there.\n\nIn this talk given at the San Francisco Java Meetup Group, Nati shows you how Groovy can help you map and translate an old JEE evironment to a new cloud-based one.\n\nThen, using his company's product, Cloudify, as a case study, he shows you how to deploy these concepts in a way that anyone can adapt to their own needs.\n\n** More videos on Java Development at http://marakana.com/s/"
