recordingDate: 1487930237
description: "It takes effort and discipline to be a great developer, but how do you know what to focus on, what to pursue, what to say no to? And how do you fit it all into an already packed life of family, friends, discovery and ambition?\nGetting a grasp on key professional skills, such as time management, learning to say no, building a network and, most importantly, keeping an open mind is no simple task. This talk will provide guidance and share personal experiences on how to build up the life of your creation, rather than the life you have settled for. From managing 3 businesses, being an author and speaker, organising conferences, giving as much back to the community as possible as well as being a father and partner, there are gold nuggets aplenty in this talk. Be inspired to think beyond yourself."
