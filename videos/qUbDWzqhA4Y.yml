description: "Whether you are trying to attack or defend Active Directory, BloodHound has been the default tool for identifying attack paths. With its latest release, BloodHound3 has introduced a number of new edges including the collection of ACLs for Organizational Units.\n\nIn this talk we will present a method to abuse edit rights on an OU by serving malicious Group Policy Objects in order to compromise any computer or user object that is a member of the vulnerable OU or any of its child OUs."
