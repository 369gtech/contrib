We'll look past the APIs and Reactive Stream concepts, towards less abstract matters such as the Reactor execution model (is there even such a thing?).\n\nWhat is the difference between assembly time and execution time? What is work stealing? Why does nothing happen until we subscribe? What is operator fusion? Magnets, how do they even work?\n\nCome join us and we'll try to answer all of these questions, and more!\n\nSimon Basl√©  From Pivotal\nProject Reactor maintainer, fan of all reactive things :)"
