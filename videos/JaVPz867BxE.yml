description: "Bring-Your-Own Service Mesh to Cloud Foundry - Andy Paine, EngineerBetter\n\nAndy Paine will demonstrate how he used some advanced Cloud Foundry features including container-to-container networking, sidecars and metadata to deploy Hashicorp Consul as just a normal SpaceDeveloper. This will involve deploying the Consul control plane in a way that allows it run automatic leadership elections as well as deploying applications with the Consul + Envoy sidecars that register applications into the service mesh."
