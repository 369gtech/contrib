title: 'Make your testing Groovy'
recordingDate: 1501170339
description: 'This talk explores using the Groovy scripting language as the basis for Agile testing. It covers tools, libraries and techniques for Unit and BDD style testing. The goal is to show how an open source scripting language such as Groovy can be useful for your testing but many of the ideas are applicable to any language and toolset. It covers different runners like JUnit, TestNG, Spock, auxiliary libraries like Geb as well as techniques like all combinations, all-pairs and property-based testing.'
