language: English
recordingDate: 1624875058
description: "In this age of information it is imperative to be able to clearly, simply, and accurately explain and communicate sometimes complex data.\nRight at the intersection of journalism and statistics lies visual communication - the art of using data, charts, and maps to convey information. This has been called \"the truthful art\" as it is an extremely powerful tool that must be wielded with the utmost care.\nJust like any other tool, however, it can be used for sinister purposes. This session is all about exploring ways that data can be misrepresented to further a goal - while still seem perfectly reasonable. It is intended as an eye-opener for anyone interested in the how and why of data deception. We will walk through five stories and explore where the trickery is hidden, discuss a more honest way of communicating the information as well as look at ways to spot potential foul play with data."
