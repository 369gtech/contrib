description: "Load Balancing Building Blocks\n\nKyle Lexmond, Facebook\n\nLoad balancing is often presented as a simple solution for difficult application problems, like providing redundancy and smooth blue/green application upgrades. But not all load balancers are created equal. Is a L7 load balancer better than an L4 one? What makes DNS a load balancing technique? Does using a CDN help?\n\nThis talk answers these questions and more. It covers 3 common variants of load balancing (L4, L7 and DNS) in a product agnostic manner, important properties of each variant, and why you would consider using them. It concludes with an overview of how Facebook uses all 3 variants to manage and control traffic flows globally.\n\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
