description: "Angular grew significantly in the past few years from both a tooling and developer experience standpoint. This talk will explore many of the features and newer improvements in the pipeline that allow anyone to build and deploy performant apps with very little overhead.\n\nThrough real demos and examples, we’ll cover bundle budgeting, differential serving, automatic code-splitting, and more! In the second part of the talk, we’ll focus on how to efficiently prefetch and preload different modules and components.\n\nPresented by: Minko Gechev\n\n#ChromeDevSummit All Sessions → https://goo.gle/CDS19\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nEvent photos → \_https://goo.gle/CDS19Photos"
