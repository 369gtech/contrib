description: "Express Scripts, a Cigna corporation company, is reimagining its data and software architecture to bring best-in-class user experience and provide the foundation of next-generation applications. The challenge lies in the ability to efficiently and cost-effectively access the ever-increasing amount of data. \n\nThis talk will showcase how Pivotal Platform and Apache Kafka are leveraged within Express Scriptsâ€™ transformation from mainframe to a microservices-based ecosystem, ensuring data integrity between two worlds. \n\nYou'll learn: \n\n- how Express Scripts is building cloud-based microservices when the system of record is a relational database residing on an on-premise mainframe\n\n- how Change Data Capture (CDC) enables event-driven architecture\n\n- how Spring framework is used to bind microservices to Kafka\n\n- how Express Scripts uses Pivotal Platform to build and scale microservices\n\n- how to use Kafka streams and Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) to offload the database as part of a data pipeline\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/33R7YRf\n\nSpeakers: Dmitry Milman, Director, Platform Software Engineering, Express Scripts; Ankur Kaneria\nPrincipal Architect, Express Scripts / Cigna\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/from-mainframe-to-microservices-with-pivotal-platform-and-kafka-bridging-the-data-divide"
