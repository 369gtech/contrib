description: "\"Tensorflow Estimators\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Osaka / Samarkand [PyData track]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Mai Giménez\n\nTensorflow is one of the most powerful machine learning libraries. \nHowever, one could argue that it is as well one of the most convoluted libraries to utilise. Or it used to be. \nTensorflow has been updating its API, simplifying the pipeline while keeping it flexible. You could either predict your class label using a pre-trained canned estimator or doing some fancy operations with the inner tensors of your neural network. It's a choose your own adventure game. \nBut it's challenging to make sense of all the new changes. Fear not. Here, we learned what changes we should adopt. \n\nThis talk will walk you through the following new features:\n    - codeEstimators/code: complete representation of a model. We will learn about the different levels of abstraction of an  codeestimator/code.\n    - codeDatasets/code: efficient input pipelines. We need large datasets to train models, and we should be conscious about how we are handling them. \n    - codeTf-hub/code: a repository of Pre-trained modules. Starting each task from zero is not the best option. Particularly,  when we have pre-trained models ready to boost the performance of our system.\n\nThe objective is at the end of this talk you will learn how to design a neural network following the best practices.\n\nBasic knowledge of neural networks and the naming conventions in Tensorflow will be useful for understanding this talk, but I will try to minimise the gibberish to a local minimum.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
