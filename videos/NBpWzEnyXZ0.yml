description: "John Ceccarelli, Oracle\n\nShay Shmeltzer, Director of Product Management, Oracle\n\nThe combination of HTML5 and JavaScript front ends with REST-based back-end services is the de facto standard for cloud-age app architecture. However, getting developers up to speed and productive with such a technology stack can be challenging and results in a constant backlog of unaddressed business needs. This session discusses and demos how new tools and frameworks simplify adoption of this architecture through low-code development platforms that are extensible via standard open-source technologies."
