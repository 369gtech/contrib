description: "Ask and vote for questions: http://goo.gl/t3SFT\n\nJoin us next week as we show you how we used a Chrome App to control an AR Parrot Drone! This is just one of the many cool things that you can do with Chrome Apps.  Using the networking APIs, we were able to pilot the AR Parrot Drone, and get data back from its on-board sensors.  We'll take the app apart, show you how were were able to get everything to work, and maybe even take it for a live spin on air!"
