description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeaker: John T. Davies, CTO of C24\nWe've had powerful Rules Engines and Complex Event Processing for a good decade now and there are several powerful ones on the market, some even open source. Many of these engines though have been build around single albeit efficient applications running on a single machine. As we take Big Data head on we start to see the need to rules that we can distribute and complex events processing across our distributed system. Combining Pivotal's GemFire and C24's Integration Objects, naturally glued together with a little Spring, we can process millions of complex events in seconds. John will walk through some of the design and use-cases of these powerful system.\nLearn more about Pivotal Gemfire at: \nhttp://www.gopivotal.com/products/pivotal-gemfire"
