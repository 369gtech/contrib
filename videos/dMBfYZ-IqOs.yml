description: "How Financial Services Leverage Legacy IT Investments When Transitioning to DevOps\n\nManuel Schuller, EMEA Technical Director, Electric Cloud \n\nFinancial organizations have been making huge strides in recent years in adopting DevOps practices to accelerate software innovation. Like other large enterprises, these veterans, ‘horses’ are faced with a challenge to modernize their infrastructure and processes for the digital age, while still being heavily reliant and invested in legacy IT systems. Some of these systems may only be a couple of years old, while others are coming up on decades. This poses a challenge mainly from an architecture, technology or process perspectives, but also from the standpoint of CAPEX, utilization, team buy-in and cultural change.\n\nI’ve been helping organizations DevOps-ify their software delivery for over 20 years, focusing primarily on large financial organizations in Europe. In this talk, I will share key patterns employed by these enterprises to leverage old IT investments and legacy systems to transition to DevOps.\n\nFrom service mainframes, source control, home grown scripts, backend systems, deployment runbooks, compliance and security checks, and more – discover tips for modernizing and utilizing legacy investments on an iterative path to improving delivery operations while minimizing resistance to DevOps transformation in the organization.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
