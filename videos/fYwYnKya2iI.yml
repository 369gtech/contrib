description: "Adrian was involved in developing software for domains like energy, ecommerce, banking, customs and ERP/CRM. As a constant participant to conferences, he is recognized for challenging ideas and getting people out of their comfort zone, not out of disrespect or lack of reverence for his peers, but out of his desire to show people that there are always things to learn.\n\nThis is a discussion about five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design: Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion. Together these principles are known as the SOLID Principles. \n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E. Unconference: http://itakeunconf.com\n\nThe organizer of I T.A.K.E.
