title: 'Resilient microservices with Kubernetes by Mete Atamel'

description: "Creating a single microservice is a well understood problem. Creating a cluster of load-balanced microservices that are resilient and self-healing is not so easy. Managing that cluster with rollouts and rollbacks, scaling individual services on demand, securely sharing secrets and configuration among services is even harder. Kubernetes, an open-source container management system, can help with this. In this talk, we will start with a simple microservice, containerize it using Docker, and scale it to a cluster of resilient microservices managed by Kubernetes. Along the way, we will learn what makes Kubernetes a great system for automating deployment, operations, and scaling of containerized applications.\n\nAtamel Mete (Google)\nIâ€™m a Developer Advocate at Google, currently focused on helping developers with Google Cloud Platform. As a long-time Java and a recent C# developer, I like to compare the two ecosystems. Prior to Google, I worked at Microsoft, Skype, Adobe, EMC, and Nokia building apps and services on various web, mobile and cloud platforms. Originally from Cyprus, I currently live in Greenwich, not too far away from the prime meridian."
