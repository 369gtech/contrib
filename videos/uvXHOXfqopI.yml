description: "Don't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nImproving Monitoring Systems Interoperability with Prometheus & OpenMetrics - Chan Shik Lim, NexCloud \n\nPrometheus is the top-listed monitoring technology in use for container clusters whilst enterprises are taking their legacy IT infrastructure the cloud native environments such as Kubernetes. Prometheus collects and stores the metrics that are preset in exposition formats that it makes the container cluster monitoring feasible by exporting the metrics data in exposition format regardless of OS and programming languages.\n\nThe OpenMetrics Project is in progress in an effort to further extend the Prometheus exposition format by determining a standard for exposing metrics data, and is aimed at allowing heterogeneous monitoring systems to share data effortlessly as a means to improving interoperability. In this presentation, ChanShik will cover the methodology of improving Prometheus-based monitoring systems by taking advantage of OpenMetrics-based standard metrics protocol."
