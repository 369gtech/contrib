title: 'Growing TypeScript and Rust'

description: "Jonathan Turner\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/166/\n\nIn this talk, I'll cover how the TypeScript project grew from a small project to a popular web tool, and some of the bumps along the way.  I'll also compare this with how Rust has changed and adapted since its 1.0 release.\r\n\r\nLastly, I'll talk about how Rust's collaborative design works and how it helps to shape Rust's direction, and how other open source projects may be able to use similar techniques.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
