description: "Customer experience is the most important goal for any company, small or large. \n \n At T-Mobile, one of the most important ways we interact with our customers is through messaging. In this talk, we'll showcase how T-Mobile overcame a middleware service-oriented architecture and built a centralized product for managing customer messaging. Plus, how organizational domains should think more like products than services to better serve their customers.\n\nAl Garay, Manager, Enterprise Technology Solutions at T-Mobile\n Raj Palanisamy, Senior Software Engineer at T-Mobile\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/modernizing-customer-messaging-at-tmobile"
