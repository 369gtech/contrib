description: "Google I/O 2009 - Debugging Arts of the Ninja Masters\r\n\r\nJustin Mattson\r\n\r\nEver have one of those days where your application just doesn't run correctly, and you can't figure out why? Well, we've been there, and we're going to show you how to fix it.  In this session, Justin Mattson will school you on the advanced usage of Android debugging tools like traceview, the hierarchy viewer, and the instrumentation system. He'll also present several case studies where Google used these tools to solve real world problems, and show you the before-and-after results.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
