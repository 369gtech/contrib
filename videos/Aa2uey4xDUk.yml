However, running containers on cloud is far from ideal. It still requires significant efforts on cluster setup, configuration, and servers management. A new paradigm \"Serverless Container\" came out recently, which eliminates the need of managing cluster and servers, aiming to run containers on cloud more easily and agilely.  In this topic, we will present the landscape of serverless container ecosystem, and how we build the serverless container service at Alibaba Cloud, which is easy to scale and has a flexible resource model, also provides the native Kubernetes API. Users will learn how to deploy container, ingress, and service discovery in cloud native way. We will also unveil its innovative cloud scale architecture, and talk about how it helps our customers to focus only on the application rather than server management.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKQ"
