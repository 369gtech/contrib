description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/extending-the-platform-64887940\n\nCloud Foundry is a powerful structured platform. For many organizations their first experience with Cloud Foundry feels like jumping in a time machine and emerging in a world where the automations are done and--even more surprising--they work! But that’s just the beginning. \n\nCloud Foundry is a trustworthy, capable foundation you can build upon. It’s power lies in the flexibility provided through a structured, clear framework for extension. That’s what I want to show you in this talk. \n\nThere are several supported mechanisms for extending the platform. In this talk we’ll consider each method and which problem areas they address well. We’ll cover everything from user-provided services to first class services managed by BOSH. \n\nYou may be extending the platform to provide unique, new services to your users; or to bridge cloud-native applications running on Cloud Foundry with existing data centers and tools. No matter your use case you’ll gain a valuable understanding of the extensibility of the platform itself to truly make it your own. \n\nCloud Foundry gives platform operators and platform engineers an incredible framework for delivering transformative value to application developers. Learn how in this talk.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeaker: Kenny Bastani; Developer Advocate, Pivotal."
