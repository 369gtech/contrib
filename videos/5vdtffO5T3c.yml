description: "In this talk we will cover ElasticSearch, an open source, distributed, RESTful search engine built on top of Lucene.\n\nWe will start with a quick introduction to ElasticSearch, and then dive into its distributed model (with reference to how it was used in conjunction with Lucene). We will also compare it to other nosql distributed models.\n\nWe will also cover new features such as versioning and percolator, and who knows how many more will be added by conference time ;)\nhttp://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/elasticsearch-distributed-search-engine\n\nDescription of Shay Banon: http://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/shay-banon"
