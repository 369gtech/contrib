description: "In today's session Alfredo Fernández, Software Craftsperson at Codurance, brings us a new topic to explore with the Barcelona Software Craftsmanship Community.\n\nImagine you need to modify some legacy code that is a tangled nest of ifs, loops and duplicated code. Not only is it very difficult to understand, you don’t know where to start and it has no tests. On top of all this, you don't have much time.\n\nHow can we safely use provable refactors to start making sense of it without adding tests?\n\nIn this workshop, we experiment and learn about provable refactors through a kata and discuss our findings at the end. Thank you Alfredo for this interesting talk!\n\nLegacy remediation tools given in the presentation:\nOfficial repo: https://github.com/digdeeproots/provable-refactorings\nLlewellyn Falco: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp6oSVDdbXQ\n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/.\n\n\nPresentation  0:00\nIntroduction to provable refactors 04:18\nDemo  12:00\nThoughts and questions   55:11\nQ&A    01:01:06"
