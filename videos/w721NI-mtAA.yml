description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nPatrick Lucas, Senior Data Engineer at data Artisans\n\nApache Flink, a powerful distributed stateful stream processing framework, is an especially good fit for deployment on a containerization platform: its storage requirement is primarily external (e.g. HDFS or S3), clusters often share the lifetime of the jobs that run on them, and the flexibility of allocating resources on such a platform allows for scaling jobs up and down as necessary. In this talk I will give a brief introduction to Apache Flink, then describe the journey to making it a first-class citizen of the container world. I will cover my experience preparing to publish the “official repository” of Flink images on Docker Hub, the challenges of fitting a Flink deployment in a Kubernetes-shaped box, and the rough edges of Flink itself that were exposed by this process.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/secret/LoapqB0KLIavlt\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
