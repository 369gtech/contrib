description: "A lot of folks have been asking when is the Polymer team going to build a date picker or a data table? Today on the show I want to highlight some of the awesome community built elements that meet these needs. paper-date-picker by Ben Davis is a super slick, Material design, responsive date picker that works in Polymer 1.0 apps. And the vaadin-grid is a full featured data table with a fancy pants expense manager demo. Got a cool element you've built? Tell us about it on Twitter with #builtwithpolymer!\n\nCustomElements.io\nhttps://customelements.io\n\nPaper Date Picker\nhttps://customelements.io/bendavis78/paper-date-picker/\n\nVaadin Elements\nhttps://customelements.io/vaadin/vaadin-core-elements/\nhttps://vaadin.com/elements\n\nExpense Manager\nhttps://demo.vaadin.com/expense-manager/\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel at http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
