title: 'GeeCON 2019: Tomasz Borowiec - The Slower the Stronger: A Story of Password Hash Migration'
recordingDate: 1563984049
description: 'Did you know that a single modern GPU is able to compute almost 20 billion MD5 hashes in a second? That’s why we need SLOW hashing algorithms! This talk is a case study of a successful migration of www.ocado.com customer password hashes. I will not only show you the “why”, “what” and “how”, but also what was problematic, what went wrong and how we dealt with it. I will talk about slow hashing algorithms - such as Argon2, PBKDF2, BCrypt or SCrypt - and compare them to other popular hashing algorithms - like MD5 or SHA1. Next, I will tell you a story of hashes which took about 80 ms to compute - not slow enough, fairly easy to crack. I will show you what our password hashing code looks like and I will guide you through our migration plan, describing in detail how we executed it, and what problems we encountered on the way.'
