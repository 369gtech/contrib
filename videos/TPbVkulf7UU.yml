title: 'nor(DEV): An Introduction to Flutter with Tom Alabaster'
recordingDate: 1591973424
description: "In this session on Flutter, we’ll take a look at how easy Flutter is to get started along with looking at constructing a full 2 screen UI for an app using widgets (UI components) given to us out of the box.\n\n## Agenda\n\nThis will be a hands-on coding session which you are more than welcome to join along with! The agenda is as follows:\n\n1. Introduction\n2. Getting started in Visual Studio Code\n3. Widgets\n4. Navigation\n5. Dependencies\n6. Data persistence\n\n## Requirements\n\nTake a look at https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install to get Flutter installed as **this isn’t something covered in this talk**. You can follow along on Windows, macOS or Linux using Android or iOS (macOS only).\n\n## About Flutter\n\nFlutter is Google’s cross-platform development framework. It enables developers to make apps for both Android and iOS (and for desktop and the web) from a single codebase. It produces native apps with native performance and can allow for significantly faster development times.\n\n\"Having been making mobile apps for over 4 years, I haven’t been a lover of cross-platform frameworks until now, and while I could go back to writing purely native apps, I see very few reasons to as long as Flutter is around.\"\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes. We aim to bring you local, national and international speakers and workshops.\n\nYou might want to try something new or wish to take your software development up to the next level. Norfolk Developers wants to jump depth-first into the detail and bring you practical value. We want to make it easy for you to access knowledge, progress and prosper in the highly specialised and valuable field of software engineering.\n\nFollow us https://twitter.com/NorfolkDev or Join the community https://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/\n\n---\n\nRecorded Live Thursday, May 7, 2020, 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM"
