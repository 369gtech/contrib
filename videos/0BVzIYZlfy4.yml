recordingDate: 1526548321
description: 'Designing, building for and working in Space provides some seemingly unique challenges for a project developer. Innovation, reliability and good management practices especially risk mitigation are key to success. Examples of each area and definitions of each are taken from the Beagle 2 project whereas we know now the UK and ESA successfully landed on Mars back in 2003. Lessons from this project have applications in many fields including Earth based IT technology development. The story of the finding of Beagle 2 after its apparent loss will be told, and the importance of Space as a strategic asset and the new approaches to Space Engineering will also illustrated by Mark Sims Beagle 2 Mission Manager, now Director of the Space Research Centre at the University of Leicester.'
