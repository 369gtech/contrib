Showing off your knowledge and targeting the “important” connections is the wrong approach. If you genuinely want to be an effective networker, you have to shift away from looking at these interactions as transactional. That said, it’s still hard to find people to talk to, and even harder to know how to start up a conversation. I’ll give you tips that will help you work through those issues and ultimately make you more comfortable in new spaces with new people. You’ll come away from this presentation with advice you can put to use immediately.\nWatch all the ng-conf: Hardwired presentations/videos at https://videos.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nng-conf: Hardwired is brought to you by:\n- https://thinkster.io/ The best Angular and JavaScript tutorials on the web\n- https://herodevs.com/ Engineering and consulting by web development experts\n- https://xlts.dev/  Extended support for AngularJS\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
