description: "Even when located in one of the largest cities on the continent of Africa, we still face many challenges when building software: lack of electricity, little to no connectivity particularly in rural areas, cash-based transactions, lack of an address system, and more. But out of these constraints come creative and innovative ways to address these unique challenges … and with it some frugal software innovation you might want to hear about.\n\nBetty Enyonam Kumahor is the Founder and Managing Partner of The Cobalt Partners and serves on the Board of Directors of a number of Civic Society Organisations and technology-led enterprises.\n\nAs a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader with an impressive background in the consulting and technology industries, Enyo now invests in and mentors technology-driven companies committed to sustainable business in Africa.
