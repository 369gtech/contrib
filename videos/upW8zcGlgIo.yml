description: "From Mashups to Mapplets\r\nDavid Day (Google)\r\n\r\nMapplets are mini-applications that run within Google Maps, allowing you to add new feature or overlay your data directly onto Google Maps. These applications allow a developer to take advantage of the power of the Maps API while getting exposure to millions of users on Google Maps. In addition, Google provides free hosting, free bandwidth, and an official directory where users from all around the world can find your Mapplet.\r\n\r\nWe'll introduce Mapplets in detail, explain the benefits of writing one, and walk through the details of how to get started. This includes what you need to host your Mapplet and best practices for gaining users.\r\n\r\nParticipants should have knowledge of basic JavaScript and HTML. Knowledge of the Google Gadgets API is recommended, but not required. We'll discuss how Mapplets relate to Gadgets in this session."
