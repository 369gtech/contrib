description: "Smarter Kubernetes Access Control: A Simpler Approach to Auth - Rob Scott, ReactiveOps \n\nConfiguring Kubernetes authorization policies with RBAC is an important part of securing any cluster. Unfortunately implementing effective and maintainable policies can be quite challenging. Many organizations end up struggling with a common set of challenges as they try to implement RBAC across their clusters. These challenges have often resulted in insecure configuration that grants far more access than necessary.     In this talk, Rob will highlight open source tools and best practices that address many of these common challenges. This presentation aims to make RBAC more approachable for all, and will provide a straightforward path toward effective and maintainable configuration that can make your cluster more secure. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPdi"
