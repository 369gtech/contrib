description: 'Do you miss your personal bank teller? Me neither, but sometimes I wish I could hear a friendly voice tell me my account is not empty (yet). Thanks to The Payment Services Directive II, PSD2 among friends, and a bit of code, now I can. In this talk I will show I made my favourite voice commanded personal assistant integrate with my bank and talk to me.'
