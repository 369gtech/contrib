title: 'What''s Wrong With The WEB?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1512414000
description: "The web was originally imagined to be a simple distributed document retrieval system. It is now being used for applications that go far beyond the system's original capabilities and intentions. We have found ways to make it work, but they are difficult and far too fragile. Many times companies have offered to replace the web with superior proprietary systems, but we rejected them. We have been adding features to the web, but this does little to correct the deep underlying deficiencies, increasing instead of reducing its complexity.\n\nThis talk suggests a way forward, taking inspiration from our successful transition from NTSC to HDTV. There is a way forward to a web that is safer, easier, and as good as we desire.\n\nEVENT: PolyConf 16\n\nSPEAKER: Douglas Crockford\n\nPERMISSIONS: Event organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9AwYiwIvXE"
