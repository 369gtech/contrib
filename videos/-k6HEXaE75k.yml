description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nUsing Kubernetes Secrets in GitOps Workflows Securely - Seth Vargo & Alex Tcherniakhovski, Google \n\nAdopting GitOps for Kubernetes provides a single source of truth for cluster configuration and enables facilities like peer reviews and automated rollbacks. While many organizations store their Kubernetes configurations in git, Kubernetes Secrets are often managed via bespoke implementations outside of source control. Storing plaintext secrets in source, even in private repositories, is a horrible idea, but can we meet somewhere in the middle? In this session, attendees will learn how to securely store and manage Kubernetes Secrets in source control using Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) and a Key Management Service (KMS). After this talk, attendees will be able to securely store and manage their Kubernetes Secrets in source the same way they manage their existing Kubernetes configurations.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeiP"
