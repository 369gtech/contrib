description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nDerek Ferguson - Head of Technology for Fitch Solutions\nMatt Jones - Head of Product Architecture at Fitch Solutions\nRashid Mohammad - Senior Engineering Lead at Fitch Solutions\n\nABSTRACT\nMicroservices are no longer just for API developers. Fitch Solutions has been building API microservices for years while maintaining a monolithic front-end application architecture. In this talk, Rashid will describe how to successfully migrate to full-stack microservices serving not only the APIs, but also the web components necessary to deliver the features to customers.\nThe main areas of concern will include:\n• How a service mesh helped route traffic within Kubernetes to support full-stack services.\n• How web components allowed Fitch Solutions to mix and match heterogeneous UI technologies\n• How developing along service context boundaries increased their productivity by removing inter-team dependencies\n• How continuous integration tools have automated security checks that were previously manual\n• How this transition will enable developers to release multiple times per day\n• How smaller, more discrete deliverables have improved the resiliency, maintainability [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:56 Problem statement\n02:31 Previous situation\n03:41 Kubernetes\n05:06 SONARQube\n06:14 Kafka\n07:35 Target situation: \"event sourced architecture\"\n08:35 Why service mesh?\n12:24 Continuous delivery\n14:17 New situation\n15:45 Demo\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1282/microservices-out-in-the-wild\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Microservices #APIs #Kubernetes #k8s #SONARQube #ApacheKafka #Istio #ContinuousDelivery\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
