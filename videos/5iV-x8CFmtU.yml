description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \n\"These crazy FP concepts are very interesting but how do I apply them to my job at XYZ?\" Indeed, it is one thing to learn what a \"catamorphism\" or a \"natural transformation\" is, and another one to use it in our daily programming. \n\nIn this talk you will learn how to decompose a REST microservice into several components: authentication, request to other services and database access. Then we will use the Eff monad to precisely define the interface of these components and support additional concerns like logging or asynchronous execution. \n\nOnce you get the basic idea, the possibilities are endless! Rate limiting is just another component and another set of effects involving time and state. And testing is so much easier: no execution context or mocks!"
