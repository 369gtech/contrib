description: "It's about hacking ...\nLinus Kvarnhammar is a pen-tester, his job is to hack organisations and private persons. He was recently in the Swedish TV serie Hackad (still available on SVT play). We are talking about the TV serie and what's the best way to protect you from hackers both from an organisations point-of-view as well as a private person.\nSorry for the tight camera close up, our brilliant camera staff was not with us  during this recording."
