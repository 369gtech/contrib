title: 'Lazy QObject tree traversal - Vitaly Fanaskov'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604063949
description: "This talk is about using modern C++ for improving iterating over QObject tree. I'm going to talk about some issues with the current non-lazy implementation and ways of fixing them.\n\nDuring the talk, I'll show how to create a custom composable range object and use coroutines to implement getting QObject's children upon request. I'm planning to briefly describe Qt framework itself, ranges, and coroutines as well.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
