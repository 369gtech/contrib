Some of these programmers don’t know a different way and some would love to start from scratch with a more modern approach, but they all share something in common. They all want to build the best code they can with the paradigm they are are using.\n\nObject-Oriented Programming was state-of-the-art C++ programming for decades and industry best practices developed to produce high-quality code and avoid practices that lead to buggy, hard-to-maintain code. With billions of lines of OOP code in C++ currently in production, someone should be talking about OOP best practices, because old-school doesn’t mean easy. But OOP just isn’t trendy anymore.\n\nIn this session, instead of lecturing you that you shouldn’t be using OOP, I’m going to share the industry best practices developed during the last four decades and updated to latest language features.\n\n— \nJon Kalb\nJon Kalb, Consulting\nConference Chair\nSilicon Valley\n\nJon has been programming in C++ for almost three decades and does onsite training for teams that want to up their C++ game.\nJon chairs\_C++Now,\_CppCon, the C++ Track of the Silicon Valley Code Camp, and the\_Boost\_Steering Committee.
