recordingDate: 1441010128
description: "Many agile software development organizations have self managing teams when it comes to implementation of software, but still use a Product Owner role\nfor product discovery, user and business value and story prioritization. \n\nAt CCP Games, developers of award winning science fiction MMO EVE Online, the product owner role has been eliminated as a position held by individuals, and instead the responsibility of product ownership has been integrated into the development feature teams with good results. Hear how the change happened, how team based management is part of the puzzle, and what the results have been a year into this change for the EVE dev team.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
