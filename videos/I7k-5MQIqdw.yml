description: "The availability of Internet of Things devices and solutions is predicted to growing at an enormous rate in the next couple of years. The rise of these IoT devices and solutions creates a unique opportunity for mobile development in the upcoming years. Mobile connected IoT devices are convenient, efficient, effective, and very popular amongst consumers. Building IoT solutions with mobile companions becomes more powerful and scalable when connected to the cloud for controlling IoT devices, storing and processing data, offline scenarios, and enabling AI use in apps. Whether its a mobile app that controls an IoT device or a wearable or an IoT device using a mobile phone as the hub to the cloud, there are various design patterns to consider. Session includes code and demos that will show how to configure/add components to IoT and mobile cloud backend, and how to leverage these components as a part of mobile and IoT cloud connected development using the appropriate SDKs. The demo will use AWS services: - Amazon Cognito: secure access permissions - AWS IoT: connect devices to cloud & other devices - AWS Lambda: serverless IoT backend - AWS Mobile SDK for Android - AWS IoT Device SDK.\n\n# Tara Walker\nTara is a technical evangelist for Amazon Web Services, dedicating her time helping developers build apps, games, and solutions on AWS cloud.
