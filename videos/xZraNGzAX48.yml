recordingDate: 1469195255
description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Berlin 2016\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAnstract:\nIn this talk/live-coding session, we will have a practical look at how a reactive web application is different from a \"normal\" one and how resilience, elasticity and responsiveness translate into code. We will start by having a quick theoretical introduction to asynchronous computation and then build, run, deploy and load-test a small reactive web application built with the Play Framework, exploring a few key concepts such as Futures, Actors and Circuit Breakers along the way."
