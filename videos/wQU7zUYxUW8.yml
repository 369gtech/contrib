recordingDate: 1630425626
description: "As database professionals, we all know how to manage SQL Server Agent jobs using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), TSQL, and PowerShell. With Azure Data Studio and SQL Server Agent extension, we have new tools to create, maintain and manage SQL Agent jobs using Notebook. These are called Notebook Jobs. Once you successfully execute a Notebook job manually or via schedule, each run's results are saved into a separate Notebook, which you can easily share with others.
