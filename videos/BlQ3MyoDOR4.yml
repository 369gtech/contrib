description: "The Wall Street Journal already mentioned it in 2011: “Software is eating the world.” Nowadays, every company is an IT company. Product owners and other business representatives seeing their competitors release new features to end users every day are demanding the same from their own software teams.\n\nHow do you measure up to this heavy pressure as an IT organization?\n\nHow do you quickly make changes to software systems in fast-paced environments without losing your grip on quality?\n\nHow do you build and test software in such a way that it's always in a releasable state?\n\nThis session explains the principles of Continuous Delivery and DevOps. You’ll leave this session with enough insights into how and where to get started yourself.\n\nBert Jan is CTO at OpenValue in the Netherlands and focuses on Java, Continuous Delivery and DevOps. Bert Jan is a Java Champion, JavaOne Rock Star speaker, Duke's Choice Award winner and leads NLJUG, the Dutch Java User Group. He loves to share his experience by speaking at conferences, writing for the Dutch Java magazine and helping out Devoxx4Kids with teaching kids how to code.
