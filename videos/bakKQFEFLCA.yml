title: 'Large image databases and small codes for object recognition'

description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay,  8 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWith the advent of the Internet, billions of images are now freely available online and constitute a dense sampling of the visual world. Using a variety of non?parametric methods, we explore this world with the aid of a large dataset of 79,302,017 images collected from the Web. Motivated by psychophysical results showing the remarkable tolerance of the human visual system to degradations in image resolution, the images in the dataset are stored as 32x32 color images. Each image is loosely labeled with one of the 75,062 non?abstract nouns in English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the image database gives a comprehensive coverage of all object categories and scenes. The semantic information from Wordnet can be used in conjunction with nearest?neighbor methods to perform object classification over a range of semantic levels minimizing the effects of labeling noise. For certain classes that are particularly prevalent in the dataset, such as people, we are able to demonstrate a recognition performance comparable to class?specific Viola?Jones style detectors.\n\nIn the second part of the talk, we present efficient image search and scene matching techniques that are not only fast, but also require very little memory, enabling their use on standard hardware or even on handheld devices. Our approach uses the Semantic Hashing idea of Salakhutdinov and Hinton, based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines to convert the Gist descriptor (a real valued vector that describes orientation energies at different scales and orientations within an image) to a compact binary code, with a few hundred bits per image. Using our scheme, it is possible to perform real?time searches on our Internet image database using a single large PC and obtain recognition results comparable to the full descriptor. Using our codes on high quality labeled images from the LabelMe database gives surprisingly powerful recognition results using simple nearest neighbor techniques.\n\nThis talk will be taped\n\nSpeaker: Rob Fergus\nRob Fergus is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.
