description: "James Colgan's keynote from the 2014 O'Reilly Velocity conference in Santa Clara, CA, \"Building Self-Adaptive Autonomous Infrastructure with an Advanced Monitoring Architecture.\"\n\nInfrastructure demand can be volatile and difficult to predict. Bigger, more complex web applications make manually handling dips and spikes in load unsustainable. Build a self-adaptive autonomous infrastructure to get out of DevOps fire drills and focus on the business value you deliver to customers. But how do you do that? This lightening talk will show you the high-level architectural components you need to make your infrastructure resilient in an increasingly unpredictable age.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Rackspace.\n\nAbout James Colgan (Rackspace):\nJames has 20 years experience working in high tech as a product management and product marketing executive.
