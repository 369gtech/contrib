title: 'Type Transformations in C++ - lecture by  Dan Saks - Code Europe Spring 2017'
recordingDate: 1505911572
description: "The type system in C++ enables many basic language facilities, including expression evaluation, function argument passing, exception handling, and\ntemplate instantiation. All of these facilities rely on some kind of implicit or explicit type transformation, such as as promotions, conversions, casting, and type deduction. This talk explains the differences among the various transformations, and why being aware of these differences helps you program more effectively."
