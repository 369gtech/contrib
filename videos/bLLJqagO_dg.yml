recordingDate: 1573162251
description: "You might’ve heard of Angular Schematics, but do you know what they do? Learn how you can use this powerful tool to develop workflows and simplify configurations for your Angular projects.\n\nIn this session, you'll learn how to create a schematic, how to test it, and how you can use them with non-Angular projects.\n\nMatt Raible is a well-known figure in the Java community and has been building web applications for most of his adult life. For over 20 years, he has helped developers learn and adopt open source frameworks and use them effectively. He's a web developer, Java Champion, and Developer Advocate at Okta. Matt is a frequent contributor to open source and a big fan of Java, IntelliJ, TypeScript, Angular, and Spring Boot. \n\nHe’s a member of the bad-ass JHipster development team and loves classic VWs. You can find him online at @mraible and https://raibledesigns.com."
