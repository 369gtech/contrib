recordingDate: 1487162933
description: "Microservices architectural style is a new flexible way of building software systems. Early adopters, such as Amazon, Netflix, and other cloud-based disruptors, utilise latest technologies and platforms. Large traditional companies can also benefit from this style. However, with all the legacy and limitations they have it is not just a walk in the park to implement it.\nIn this talk I will present details on how Yle – a public service broadcasting company owned by the Finnish people – leverages the benefits of this new brave world. Yle is building a modern API layer on top of old systems using microservices architectural style. Today Yle APIs are powering many of the applications Finnish people use daily for consuming the content provided by Yle."
