title: 'Lock That Sh*t Down! Auth Security Patterns for Apps, APIs, and Infra'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327286
description: "In this session, you'll learn about recommended patterns for securing your backend APIs, the infrastructure they run on, and your SPAs and mobile apps.\n \n The world is no longer a place where you just need to secure your appsâ€™ UI. You need to pay attention to your dependency pipeline and open source frameworks, too. Once you have the app built, with secure-by-design code, what about the cloud it runs on? Are the servers secure? What about the accounts you use to access them? \n \n If you lock all that sh*t down, how do you codify your solution so you can transport it cloud-to-cloud, or back to on-premises? This session will explore these concepts and many more!\n\n Brian Demers, Developer Advocate at Okta\n Matt Raible, Java Web Developer at Okta\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/lock-that-sht-down-auth-security-patterns-for-apps-apis-and-infra"
