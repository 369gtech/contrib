We believe that engineers implement all security requirements without error before deploying systems to production. We take for granted that the security solutions we purchase and implement actually protect our applications, infrastructure, and data. The ultimate effectiveness of a security program, however, cannot rely on assumptions. Mistakes, accidents, and misconfigurations weaken the best-designed security solutions, architectural patterns, and technical designs, leaving our companies vulnerable to breaches.\nThe application of Chaos Engineering to the security domain proves to be the logical solution to this problem. By testing and validating our own systems, we can tease out false assumptions, proactively identify opportunities for security hardening or remediation, and fix them before an adversary exploits them.\nIn this session, we will discuss the principles of Security Chaos Engineering and share the real-life story of establishing the practice at Cardinal Health – a Fortune 20 healthcare company. We will also show you how you can do the same – regardless of your organization’s size, scale, industry, or cybersecurity [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:29 Agenda\n02:03 Reality check\n07:25 Security chaos engineering basics\n13:08 Real-world implementation\n17:30 How to get started\n10:15 Impact of security chaos engineering\n20:41 Outro\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.us/chaos-day-2021/sessions/1711/converging-applications-and-audiences-the-return-to-dumb-pipes-security-chaos-engineering-pushing-security-from-theory-to-practice\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Security #ChaosEngineering #SecurityChaosEngineering #Programming #ContinuousVerification #ContinuousValidation\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
