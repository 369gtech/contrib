description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nImagine that we have a large body of text, a series of sequels that has been going on for decades. Using NLP and Deep Learning - can we train our computer to write a short story by itself? Can we hint the plot but let the machine fabricate the rest? In this talk I'll describe the whole journey: A fun ride from the idea to the very end including all the struggles, failures and successes.\n\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NkcdGRiTMXeNhqzOFRz6mjNEjnDN_F73/view?usp=sharing\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
