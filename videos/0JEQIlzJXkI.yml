description: "The beauty of the web is that it works anywhere, no download and no installation. It has come a long way from text pages with links, but the only language that you could use to build applications for it was JavaScript - until now.\n\nThink about cases where you need to use software outside of the browser: video games, 3D rendering, music production and more. These things require a high degree of performance and thatâ€™s where WebAssembly steps in - a standardized compilation target for native languages. The support rolled out last year in all major browsers, and there are exciting real-world examples already.\n\nThis will be your gentle guide into what is WebAssembly, why we need it and how you can benefit from it in your next project (even if you continue to work with JavaScript only). The future is here now and it looks fast and bright.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDACHfest 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMilica Mihajlija\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEreVL0id_M&t=21s"
