description: "Flaki shares about his journey in tech, speaking at events, and the communities he's been a part of. He feels endlessly indebted to them for making everything possible. This is a short but passionate love song to the Mozilla and JavaScript communities who taught him how to pay it forward, to not just wish, but make tech a place we all would rather see it to be.\n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/community-lounge/"
