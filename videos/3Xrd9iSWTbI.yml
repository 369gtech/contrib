title: 'CON5823   Moving to G1 GC'

description: "This session looks at several case studies where applications have been moved to use the Garbage First garbage collector (G1 GC). The G1 GC has come a long way since it was first supported, in Java 7 update 4. At that time, it was very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain results that came close to those obtainable with the mostly Concurrent Mark Sweep collector. Now there is a JEP proposing that it, instead of the parallel collector, be the default collector. Although it is possible to move the G1 with very little difficulty, you may still face a few hiccups. The presentation discusses these hiccups as well as what can be done to work around them.\n\nSpeaker:\nKirk Pepperdine, Consultant, Kodewerk Ltd."
