recordingDate: 1539019290
description: "Our world changes at increasing speed. Things that werenâ€™t possible 5 years ago come into reach. Incumbents need to adept to match start-ups. We evolve towards smaller, faster, shorter. Smaller teams or even micro-teams, flat organizations, no management, even shorter cycles, smaller components. During this inspiring talk Sander discusses Cynefin, how development goes wrong, how to go beyond Scrum, why self-organization is hard, why continuous delivery allows you to stop doing projects.\n\nDevConf 2018 (http://devconf.pl)\n26-28 September 2018"
