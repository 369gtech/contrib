title: 'Math for Game Developers - Predicting Projectiles (Integration)'
recordingDate: 1411671606
description: "By integrating gravity twice we can find a formula for the position of a projectile at any given time, which we can use to predict the path of the projectile and draw a preview.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/calculus-integral\n\nNew video every Thursday.
