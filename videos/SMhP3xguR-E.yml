description: "Shoddy software quality, disgruntled customers, missed deadlines… Such is daily life in many software companies. But there exists a better way.\nJoin me as I will be telling a story of turning around a demoralised and disengaged group of developers into a high performing team, while improving software quality, customer satisfaction and reducing technical debt.\n\nEvery agile journey is unique, as every team is different. I will not be offering silver bullets or absolute recipes for success. You will learn about the gradual transformation from cargo cult Scrum to effective Scrumban implementation, what practices worked for us and what we tried and discarded.\n\nVasilij Savin\nVasilij is a senior full stack craftsman and experienced agile coach. He has been working with agile teams since 2008 in different fields ranging from online gambling to financial information services. Coaching team transformation in search of quality excellence is his specialty and lifelong passion."
