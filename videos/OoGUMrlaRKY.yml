description: "Mobile app development has always required learning each platform’s programming language and peculiarities. For developers coming from the web, where you write once and run anywhere, this is tough. The alternative – hybrid development – never quite matches the native experience users expect. But now, there’s a better way! With NativeScript, any JavaScript developer can build rich, native mobile apps for iOS, Android and Windows Phone, and even share most of their code across all three platforms. I bet you’re thinking, “okay, but surely it’s going to suck.” Actually, it doesn’t! In this lightning talk, I’ll show you some examples of really awesome apps, and then dive into how they were made. If you’ve ever written JavaScript before, this is going to blow your mind.\n\n\nAbout Ben King\n\nI am a Full Stack Developer working remotely for Planetary, a digital product studio based in New York City. At 23, I am coming up on 10 years as a professional web developer, having started my first freelance business in 2006 at the age of 13. In my spare time, I like to go to university studying for a degree in Media and Communications."
