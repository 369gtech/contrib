description: 'Health@Google Series May 26, 2011 Presented by Dr. Daniel Siegel.  Studies of physical health, emotional well-being, longevity, happiness, and even wisdom suggest that our ability to be aware of our own internal world and feel deeply connected to others is at the heart of both resilience and mental health.  This ability to see the mind or to have "mindsight" is a learnable skill that stabilizes the lens through which we come to sense our feelings, thoughts, and memories.  Mindsight promotes more meaningful and empathetic relationships, an integrated and flexible brain, and a coherent and resilient mind.'
