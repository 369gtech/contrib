description: "Google Tech Talk\n1/8/13\n\nPresented by Nigel P. Smart\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMulti-Party Computation (MPC) allows, in theory, a set of parties to compute any function on their secret input without revealing anything bar the output of the function. For many years this has been a restricted to a theoretical tool in cryptography. However, in the past five years amazing strides have been made in turning theory into practice. In this talk I will present the latest, practical, protocol called SPDZ (Speedz), which achieves much of its performance advantage from the use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption as a sub-procedure. No prior knowledge of MPC will be assumed.\n\nSpeaker Info\n\nUniversity of Bristol, U.K."
