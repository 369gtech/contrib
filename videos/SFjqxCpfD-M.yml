description: "Liz Frost, VMware\n \nA lot of SREs are (or will soon be) responsible for Kubernetes clusters. But what exactly makes up Kubernetes? This talk will dive into the services and systems that make a cluster work, how they interact, and what can go wrong. Kubernetes will no longer be a black box, but a system that can be debugged, reconfigured, and improved to suit every administrators' needs.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
