title: 'Webinar: Hybrid Cloud Kubernetes with Nodeless'
language: English
recordingDate: 1591816222
description: "Nodeless Kubernetes enables you to stretch a single Kubernetes control plane to schedule pods across heterogenous compute types (on-demand, pre-emptible, Fargate, ACI, etc) on multiple cloud providers (on-prem, AWS, GCP, Azure, etc). The webinar will enumerate the motivation for wanting a hybrid cloud control plane, provide an overview of the state of the art in open source Nodeless projects like virtual-kubelet and Kip, and call out current limitations. We will walk through a live demo of stretching an existing Kubernetes control plane to dispatch pods to a different cloud provider using virtual-kubelet and Kip.\n\nPresenter:\n\nMadhuri Yechuri, Founder @Elotl"
