description: "Navigating the Software Delivery Minefield: DevOps and the Art of Release Engineering\n\nJ. Paul Reed, Managing Partner, Release Engineering Approaches \n\nReleasing software today is trivially easy, right? The DevOps landscape is covered with tools to address every aspect of software delivery, from committing code (in all those exciting new languages!) to deployment (on every environment from mainframes to a serverless clouds) to monitoring performance and security when it's off to production! And our silo-free, completely cross-functional teams are now all aligned behind the ethos of collaboration and customer value as the ultimate measure of success, right?\n\nOr... something like that. This is, of course, the quintessential DevOps story we're told, but for most of us, our software release reality probably doesn't quite match the tale. In this talk, we'll cover some industry examples of various hurdles real-world organizations struggle with while delivering software in a DevOps world and specific solutions forged from the _one_ discipline still seldom discussed in many DevOps deployments:\ngood, ol' fashioned build and release engineering.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
