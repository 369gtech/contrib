description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nComponentConfig Technical Challenges - Michael Taufen, Google & Alexander Knipping, Noris Network \n\nMichael Taufen and Alex Knipping will give a technical deep dive into some of the trickier problems our working group has encountered while implementing ComponentConfig. The talk will focus on recent areas of work such as strict decoding of ComponentConfigs, the \"instance-specific\" config problem, and how ComponentConfig applies to hierarchical components like kube-controller-manager. The working group deals with broad issues that affect a large number of users, but you don't need to be an expert to start helping. Alex will share how he was able to quickly make an impact on these problems as a new contributor, and how others can get started too.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeun"
