description: "http://strataconf.com/stratany2013\n\nStrata + Hadoop World is where big data's most influential decision makers, architects, developers, and analysts gather to shape the future of their businesses and technologies. Since joining forces last year, Strata + Hadoop World is also one of the largest gatherings of the Apache Hadoop community in the world, with emphasis on hands-on and business sessions on the Hadoop ecosystem. If you want to tap into the opportunities brought by big data, data science, and pervasive computing, you'll want to be there.\n\nThe future belongs to those who understand how to collect and use their data successfully. And that future happens at Strata."
