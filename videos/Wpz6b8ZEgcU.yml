description: "Writing and running tests is an essential part of delivering reliable software, but we don’t always do so as efficiently as we could. For example, all too often we reach for an integration test when a unit test that’s far quicker to run would have delivered the same benefits more easily. In this talk, you’ll be encouraged to reconsider how you test your Spring Boot applications. We’ll look at why we write tests and what kinds of tests we need to write to meet those goals. For the occasions when it’s right to venture beyond a unit test, we’ll take an in-depth look at some of Spring Boot’s advanced testing features, including @MockBean, @SpyBean, and test slices. You’ll leave understanding exactly how those features work and the benefits that they provide so that you can apply them to your own tests, confident that it’s right to do so.\n\nAndy Wilkinson: Senior Principal Software Engineer, Pivotal\n\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/testing-spring-boot-applications/Pivotal/testing-spring-boot-applications"
