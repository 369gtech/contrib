description: 'Not long ago, most companies looked down on front-end engineering. They thought the real engineers programmed the server in Java, while the script kiddies played around with it''s wannabe little brother, JavaScript. But, in the last several years, React and its ilk have proven that sophisticated approaches to immutability and asynchrony allow for unprecedented scale and complexity in the front-end. Now, the tables have turned, and back-end frameworks are starting to wake up to the benefits of asynchronous processes and event sourcing patterns, following the trail that React has blazed.'
