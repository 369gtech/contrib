recordingDate: 1433518096
description: "Jetty has always been known to be a technology leader in several areas—from Jetty Continuations (later standardized as Servlet 3 asynchronous servlets) and WebSocket to SPDY—delivering exceptional production performance. Jetty 9 comes with major improvements in performance, features, and documentation. It is not only a great production server but features such as the Jetty Maven plug-in and embedded Jetty will also help you in application development and integration testing. This session covers Jetty 9’s scalability, stability, performance, and features such as WebSocket and SPDY support, the new HTTP client, how to configure Jetty for optimal production performance, and little gems you always wanted to have in your servlet container.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSimone Bordet\nbio\nView more trainings by Simone Bordet at https://www.parleys.com/author/simone-bordet\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
