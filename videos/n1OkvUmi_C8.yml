description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nBayesian learning is a principled approach to dealing with ever-present problems in machine learning with neural networks, such as overfitting and uncertainty estimation. In this talk I provide an overview of Bayesian inference and Bayesian learning with neural networks, as well as examples of Bayesian learning in practice using a Python-based probabilistic programming language, PyMC3.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
