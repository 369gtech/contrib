description: "The Internet of Things is upon us and being able to efficiently interconnect things will become increasingly difficult as more of them become available. How can we handle the stampede of connecting devices efficiently? When Ruby failed to live up to the task, we turned to Elixir and Erlang and were astonished by the results. This session will showcase the use of Elixir for a real-world production system.\nWe will walk though the actual code and discuss some of the struggles we faced while learning (enough) Erlang and Elixir to get things up and running. At the end of the presentation, you will have a basic understanding of Erlang's OTP behaviors, realize the importance of restart strategies, know what an \"Acceptor Pool\" is, and how we built one without knowing it.\n\nby Doug Rohrer (@JeetKunDoug)\n\nDoug has over 20 years of software development experience in complex business and scientific systems.\n\nAfter almost a decade in consulting, he took several years to work with product companies, including what might have been the first application monitoring system for cloud computing applications that itself ran in the cloud. In late 2012, he took a sharp left turn from the world of .Net to focus on Ruby on Rails and other open-source systems, and has a passion for IoT problems based on his work with Nexia Home intelligence and Elixir/Erlang."
