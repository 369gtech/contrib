description: 'Writing high-quality error-free C++ code is a challenging task, let alone when having to juggle multiple platforms at the same time! In this session we will be exploring the many challenges in cross-platform C++ development and how developer tools can help. What options do I have if my production environment is different than my dev box? Can I be as productive when working with remote Linux machines? How can I efficiently build and debug CMake projects and how can I acquire open-source libraries? Come see what Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio Code, CMake, WSL, Vcpkg, and more have to offer to make your C++ development much easier in this demo-heavy talk.'
