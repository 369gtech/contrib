description: "Thordur Bjornsson, a software developer at Yubico, has over a decade of experience hacking on databases, protocols, storage, and open source operating systems. His talk will cover the details on how to cryptographically sign your work; from PGP fundamentals and best practices, what gets signed and how to verify those signatures, to possible impacts, and benefits to your workflow. He'll also take a look at GitHubâ€™s interface changes from earlier this year that added visual cues to highlight verification status of commits and tags.\n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels.
