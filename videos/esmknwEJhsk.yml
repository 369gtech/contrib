description: "Speaker:  Mark Koester (www.markwk.com)\r\n\r\nDescription:  \r\n\r\nIn early 2017, I started studying react native but without a specific project in mind. Towards the end of 2017, I got inspired to build a quantified self / self-tracking app about my photos. I wanted to know more about my photo data, my trends, and what this data my tell me.\r\n\r\nThe result was PhotoStats.io, which lets you track, visualize, and learn from your photo data.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll share what I've learned about react native, photo data, building cross-platform apps, some good libraries and resources, and, of course, tips for anyone else getting started using react native to build apps.\r\n\r\nEvent Page:  https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/245149764/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/eH40/"
