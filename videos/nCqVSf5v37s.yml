description: 'As more businesses move their critical applications to the cloud, they are shifting their software paradigm to a Microservices-based architecture to leverage the features that the cloud offers, like resiliency, scalability, and efficiency. Java EE 9 provides an excellent opportunity to propose application standards to take the pain out of running in the cloud and make applications portable across cloud environments. This talk will cover the key areas spanning the lifecycle of a cloud application, including packaging, grouping, service discovery, aggregation, resiliency, auto-scaling, and versioning. Then a demo will be shown to illustrate how application standards can be used to address some of these concerns.'
