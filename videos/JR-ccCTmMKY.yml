description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMike Brittain - Director of Engineering at Etsy\n\nABSTRACT\nContinuous Delivery changes the fundamental processes involved with building software and launching new features. This talk will focus on the impact of Continuous Delivery on software release cycles, managing versions of software and database schemas, the structure of your engineering team, and risks involved with Continuous Delivery and how to manage them. Using Etsy as a case-study, I'll discuss each of these aspects with takeaways that you can apply to your own teams.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
