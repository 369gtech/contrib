A variety of storage services such as mirroring, snapshots, replication, backup and restore are utilized to protect data against failure and disaster scenarios (including human errors).\n\nAchieving the requisite Recovery Point Objective (RPO) / Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for cloud native applications require the use of a combination of these storage services.
