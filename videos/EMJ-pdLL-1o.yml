description: "Artificial intelligence models the real world around us, learning from social animals, people, and situations. But from where do AI researchers derive their inspiration?\n\nLili Cheng shares two examples of AI inspired by nature. In the first, Microsoft researchers created a system that uses artificial intelligence that draws on the way birds fly to keep a sailplane aloft. The second explores what makes people unique, our language instinct, and our ability to model how people socialize and accomplish work.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Microsoft.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
