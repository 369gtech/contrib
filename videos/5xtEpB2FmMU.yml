recordingDate: 1312241118
description: "By Costin Leau & Salvatore Sanfilippo\n\nRedis is an open source, advanced key-value store known for its excellent performance, its small footprint and embed-ability. The Spring Data project makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational \"NOSQL\" databases and cloud based data services.\n\nThis webinar will introduce Redis, its data structures, the fundamental concepts behind it and the Redis support in Spring Data, and will showcase how easy it is to get started and scale out into a cloud environment such as Cloud Foundry."
