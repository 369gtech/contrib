description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA.\nSpeakers: Jeremy Grelle, Mattias Niemela, Tim Branyen\nAs clients have become more capable, developers are revisiting the server-centric page rendering approach and moving the MVC layer, in part or sometimes in whole, onto the client. When building a rich front-end there are an increasing number of choices available. This talk will dive into two emerging choices that are taking the web by storm: AngularJS and Backbone.js. Leaders from both communities will provide an introduction to each technology followed by a round table discussing front-end technology, answering questions from the audience. Special guests from Sencha and cujoJS will join the panel for Q&A."
