recordingDate: 1511886382
description: "From Mainframe to Microservices: How Somos Keeps Telcos and Us All Connected\n\nGary McKay, Scrum Master, Somos \n\nSomos is a neutral and trusted agent with the responsibility of managing and administering over 41 million Toll-Free Numbers for a whole industry both in the US and Canada. For over 30 years, this done on a mainframe, written in PL1 running against an IMS Database. It was decided to move off of this platform due to cost and the difficulty of adding new features.\n\nIn early 2015, we embarked on a path to modernize our mainframe application and migrate to a distributed, microservices architecture. One of many challenges was how to modernize and build a DevOps culture and environment for Somos, moving to a microservices applications, while still running the legacy mainframe that \"keeps the light on\". We share our challenges and patterns for supporting both containerized and mainframe workloads - evolving our processes, tooling and our mindset to support modern delivery practices to accelerate our releases and scale DevOps in the company.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
