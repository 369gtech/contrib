title: 'SC London (Day 1) Usable Software Design by Johan Martinsson'
language: English
recordingDate: 1508257006
description: "Did you ever think of the user of your code? Not the one using the application, but the developer that has to change the code after you. Does that person have a good tool for the job, i.e. is the code usable? What can we learn from other domains like ergonomics, usability and in general design of objects, where the user has been in the center of the design process for decades?\n\nWell first of all it tells us what are the weaknesses of all designers, even the greatest and how to remedy that. Secondly you'll learn why \"It's not the users fault, it's the designs fault\" and how to remove sources of bugs using BugsZero design. You'll get a fresh new perspective on Clean Code, difficulties in TDD and what's the power of DDD. \n\nLast but not the least, you'll discover how \"Usable Software Design\" naturally gets a lot of traction where TDD and Clean Code meet resistance.\n\n\n// This talk was given by Johan Martinsson at SC London 2017, a conference dedicated to Craftsmanship values, XP practices & clean code.
