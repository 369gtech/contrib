description: "The apple always falls down attracted by the gravity of the earth. It’s the law of physics. The function is never inlined if it’s source is bigger than 600 characters long. It’s a heuristic - a physical law of our dystopian cyber-world confined inside a JavaScript Virtual Machine.\n\nEver wanted to rebel against the sad immutability of the physics? Lets try to make functions fall upwards and inline all the apples.\n\nIn an ultimate attempt to create a space-time paradox that will rip our universe apart we will look at Java programmers implementing JavaScript on JVM through invokedynamic and then will implement invokedynamic in a JS VM instead.\n\nThe true freedom is just one heuristic away.\n\nTranscript/slides at: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/vyacheslav-egorov-invokedynamic-js.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
