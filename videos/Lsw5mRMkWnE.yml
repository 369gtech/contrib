description: "Do you remember the name of every person you've ever met? Where you've left your keys? Would you like to? What if face recognition and an Augmented Reality headset could give you this ability? This inspiring talk will show you the key ingredients of developing an application that integrates Augmented Reality with on-device and cloud AI algorithms to recognize faces and objects. Imagine looking at a colleague, and the device immediately showing you their profile or last Facebook post so you can pretend to remember what's going on in their lives!\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
