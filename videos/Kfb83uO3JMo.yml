description: "This session discusses performance antipatterns in Google App Engine related to data store and task queues. It starts with common mistakes and suboptimal usage of the Google App Engine Datastore, tackling such topics as efficient retrievals and updates with transactions, indexing, and batching. The presentation explains not only how lower-level code constructs degrade performance but also how to combine them to design an efficient app. Then it shows caching techniques with Memcache that help optimize data store access. Finally it describes how to program and configure task queues to achieve low latency. The presented code examples illustrate how the antipatterns can decrease performance and how to implement GAE apps to shorten execution times and reduce costs.\n\n\nAuthor:\nPatrycja Wegrzynowicz\nPatrycja Wegrzynowicz is the Head of Software R&D Department at NASK, Research and Academic Computer Network.
