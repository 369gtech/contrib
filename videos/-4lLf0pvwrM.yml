description: "Our new HITB Studio track where we’ll keep you updated on what’s happening throughout the event including pre and post interviews with speakers and friends of HITB\n\n=== \n\nAn Ask Me Anything session with Andrea Zapparoli Manzoni from Crowdfense as we talk about the current state of exploitation pwnage and what’s next in the ‘new normal’ for pwners and exploit writers.\n\nCrowdfense is a world-leading vulnerability research hub, engineered from the ground up to serve institutional Customers and cyber-security Researchers alike.\n\nWe strive to establish a new standard in researching, testing and trading active cyber-defense capabilities, where both Researchers and Customers can benefit from higher levels of professionalism, transparency and trust.\n\nWith our dedicated technical and organizational support, Researchers can achieve the best returns on their work and Customers the best returns on their investment.\n\n--- \n\nAndrea Zapparoli Manzoni manages Crowdfense Limited, which he designed in 2017 with a multidisciplinary team of ethical hackers, lawyers and vulnerability researchers.\n\nThe company’s main goal is to develop and apply new standards and processes to the vulnerability trading industry, which has become too strategic and complex to be managed with the old “crafts of the trade” methods. After more than two decades working in, studying in and consulting in the industry, Manzoni realized that there had to be a smarter and safer way to buy and sell active cyber-defense capabilities and decided to launch the Crowdfense Vulnerability Research Hub.\n\nSince 2012, he has served as a board member of Clusit (Italian ICT Security Association). In 2011, he started an in-depth analysis of the most severe national and international cyber-attacks (researching and classifying more than 7,700 attacks over 84 months). This work is published in Clusit’s yearly “Report on ICT Security.” To his great surprise, over the last seven years, this research has become a reference for private and public organizations in Italy and abroad."
