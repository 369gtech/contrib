Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nKEDA: Event Driven and Serverless Containers in Kubernetes - Jeff Hollan, Microsoft  \n\nEvent driven and serverless architectures are defining a new generation of apps. However, to take full advantage of the serverless benefits of event driven, your application needs to scale and react to those events instantly - scaling from zero to potentially thousands of instances. These events may come in the form of queue and Kafka messages, or events from a cloud provider like AWS SQS or Azure Event Hubs. KEDA 1.0 is an open sourced component created in partnership with Red Hat and Microsoft Azure that provides event driven autoscaling for your Kubernetes workloads. In this demo-filled session, learn how to get started with KEDA, how customers are using it to efficiently scale and run event-driven apps, and how everything from a simple container to a serverless function can integrate seamlessly and scale natively in an event-driven and Kubernetes world. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaa6"
