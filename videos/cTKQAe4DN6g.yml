title: 'TCP? UDP? Que? – Fundamentals that were abstracted away from us by Hadi Hariri'

description: 'Abstractions are an intrinsic part of software. We build them to try and raise the level at which we need to write code and not have to deal with the nitty gritty details. But abstractions also have a downside: lack of concern about how things work can prove problematic. We can make wrong decisions and use abstractions counterproductively. With widespread adoption of single page applications that use both HTTP and at times web sockets or other frameworks built on top of sockets, it is good to understand what goes on under the cover. In this talk we’re going to go back to basic, and dive into sockets, covering TCP, UDP, creating custom protocols et al. and see how sometimes something that would seem complicated can easily be addressed simply. It will be a trip down memory lane to recall important concepts that might have been forgotten.'
