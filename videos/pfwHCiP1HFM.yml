description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nC++ is a great tool for solving complex problems in a thorough way. But every once in a while, the desire for a simpler language emerges. For those parts of our code where performance is of secondary concern, but the ability to perform rapid iterations over the code is paramount, a scripting language might be a tempting choice. But integrating a second language besides C++ and managing the interaction between the two is also scary. \n\nLua is a lightweight, dynamic language that was designed to be used as an embedded language within existing applications. It is easy to learn, has very reasonable runtime performance, and a memory footprint small enough that it is usable even on embedded systems. Furthermore, it is almost trivial to integrate with C++. \n\nThis talk will give a brief introduction to the Lua scripting language, highlighting specifically how it can complement C++'s language features to enrich a developer's toolbox. In the second part of the talk, we will look at Lua's C API and give suggestions how to integrate it with a modern C++17 codebase. In particular we will focus on how to interface with the dynamic language Lua without compromising the benefits of C++'s strong type system.\n— \nAndreas Weis: BMW AG\n\nAndreas Weis has been writing C++ code in many different domains, from real-time graphics, to distributed applications, to embedded systems. As a library writer by nature, he enjoys writing portable code and exposing complex functionalities through simple, richly-typed interfaces. Both of which C++ allows him to do extensively. Andreas is also one of the co-organizers of the Munich C++ User Group, which allows him to share this passion with others on a regular basis. He currently works for BMW, where he tries to make cars smarter than humans.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
