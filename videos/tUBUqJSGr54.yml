description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nIf you are excited by the tools available from the Clang/LLVM project but are unsure how to bring them into your company's codebase or culture, this is the talk for you. \n\nWe'll cover how to make code standards-conformant and keep it that way, how to safely apply automated changes to codebases with few unit tests, and how to write custom tools to migrate away from those old container classes.\n— \nJames Bennett, Software Engineer\nEsri\n\nJames Bennett maintains legacy code and develops refactoring tools. Even though he has seen many questionable uses of reinterpret_cast, he still believes all code is redeemable. If you are aware of any usage of formal verification with C++ code, he'd like to talk to you.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
