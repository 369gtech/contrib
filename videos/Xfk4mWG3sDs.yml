title: 'DataKernel: Mastering Ukrainian highload framework (Alexander Syrotenko, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1577304647
description: 'Creating a full-stack Java framework from scratch is a comprehensive and challenging task on its own. But creating a framework which outperforms Spring, Vert.x and Javaspark may sound even above attainment. Yet, the new DataKernel framework proves it is possible. We want to share our experience, and speaker will tell how you about the results were achieved and will bolster them with numerous benchmarks and implementation insights.'
