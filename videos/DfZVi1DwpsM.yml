title: 'Type safe GraphQL with TypeScript'
language: English
recordingDate: 1625939100
description: "When building with GraphQL you define the schema up front and this can be really handy go use when it comes to writing the queries, resolvers, etc., especially if it’s in TypeScript. So, how do you go about doing the type generation? We’ll take a look at a tool that can generate you the TypeScript types, then implement our backend using them before looking at how they can plug into the front end with React Hooks. We’ll cap off by learning how to model our storage platform effectively using its own types and combine them with the GraphQL schema types.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
