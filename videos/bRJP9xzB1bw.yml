description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nCan we visualize software complexity?\nby\nRafał Studnicki \n\nABSTRACT\nWe all know that certain software design principles help with system maintenance. Assigning every module a single responsibility is one such principle. It’s common that these principles are only applied at early stages of development, since it’s much easier to follow good practices when the system is still in on pen-and-paper. It gets harder with a real programming language. One picture can say a thousand words. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could see an architecturial diagram of our application at any time? Not as designed, but as actually running in production. In this talk Rafał will show you how.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Rafał Studnicki\n\nRafal is a software engineer with 10 years of experience in Elixir, Erlang and C. He has worked on various distributed systems, ranging from tiny clusters on microcontrollers to some of the largest chat servers in the world.\n\nHaving consulted on many real-world projects, he has come to believe that clean architecture, ruthless simplicity, and a principled stance towards testing for correctness are required for software to serve its business purpose successfully in the long run.\n\n---\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: https://www.elixirconf.eu/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU"
