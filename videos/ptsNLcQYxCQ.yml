description: "Get the game code: http://goo.gl/OKMBp\n\nIn the last part of this tutorial I showed you how to make the PhotonTorpedo class using a UML class diagram.\n\nIn this tutorial, I show you how to make your space ship shoot the torpedos on the screen. As you'll see, because I used good OOP design principles in the last video, adding the shooting feature will require very few changes.\n\nAll of the code above is heavily commented to help you learn."
