description: "Wireless for events becomes more and more ‘normal’ and a must but it was far from when we started of 6 years ago.\n\nGet an insight into the infrastructure and challenges we have faced over these 6 editions.\n\nGlenn De Haes\nMy wireless journey started back in 2001 when there was still pre-Wi-Fi equipment. Over the past 15 years I trained and educated hundreds of people in the field of wireless indoor and outdoor networks, performed site surveys, made designs for , installed and went troubleshooting networks all over the world. Most of these networks have had a ‘special’ in it from the first voice-over-wireless over busses transporting people without driver to moving podia for artists with wireless streaming of studio quality sound and Wi-Fi on the biggest festivals and events.\n\n[SFJ-2079]"
