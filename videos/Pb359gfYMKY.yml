title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Why Building Awesome Culture is Essential, Not Just a Nice-to-Have'
recordingDate: 1523570748
description: "The Drupal community that we all cherish so much may be at risk.\n\nFrom lower levels of adoption and increased market competition, companies committed to Drupal need to adapt, or risk seeing the technology we love get left behind.\n\nThe key to weathering the change we’re all experiencing and carving out a strong future is investing deeply in our companies’ cultures. \_How are we helping our people acknowledge and respond constructively to changes in the marketplace? How are we inspiring teams to create the way forward?\n\nFor the past six years, I’ve supported the development of culture at Phase2, an agency deeply committed to Drupal. I’d love to share what we’ve learned. I’ll also talk to others in the community in the lead-up to this session to surface how you’re building resilient cultures that fuel innovation, and will facilitate an open and provocative discussion where we can all learn from each other.\n\nThis session is for any business leader in the Drupal space who is looking to deal with the intense pressures of change, recruiting and retaining talent as well as inspiring people to innovate through difficult times.\n\nAttendees will walk away with a common framework for understanding why culture is so critical to running a successful business, and with the information they need to begin strengthening culture today."
