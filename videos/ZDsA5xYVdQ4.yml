language: English
recordingDate: 1597334820
description: "Rearchitecting and moving SaaS application from the data center to a public cloud is often the forcing event for leveraging Kubernetes and microservices-based architectures--but it’s not without risk for most organizations. Especially when apps are for real-time communication like voice, video meetings, chat, and team messaging and deployed at scale for your customers. As you modernize your application architecture, you will also need to modernize your application delivery. In this webinar, we’ll share the firsthand experience of the DevOps team at 8x8, a company that provides a global cloud communications platform for its customers. We’ll cover key considerations and learnings from successfully migrating a VoIP offering from an on-premises environment to Kubernetes in AWS. Learnings will cover designing application delivery infrastructure, automation, analytics, security, and rapid scaling\n\nPresenters:\n\nLance Johnson, Director of Engineering, Cloud R&D @8x8\n\nMichael Laws, Sr. Site Reliability Engineer @8x8\n\nPankaj Gupta, Senior Director @Citrix"
