description: "Most of our interactions with technology aren’t really intuitive. We’ve had to adapt to it by learning to type, swipe, execute specific voice commands, etc… but what if we could train technology to adapt to us?\n\nProgramming for hardware in JavaScript has already been made accessible with frameworks like Johnny-five, but, combining it with machine learning, we have the opportunity to create new and smarter interactions.\n\nIn this presentation, I will talk about how to build a simple gesture recognition system using JavaScript, Arduino and Machine learning."
