This session is meant to provide you with a high level overview of APIs and equip you with the fundamentals suitable for product managers and empower you to decipher and analyse common api document formats.\n\nRidzwan Aminuddin is an entrepreneurial and passionate product leader with deep experience in mobile, web, digital data and e-commerce. He has over 10 years experience leading product and technology teams to carry out large-scale, complex consumer/commercial enterprise products and services. Ridzwan is currently the head product guy at Ninja Van, and is focussed on building a kickass product team with world-class product practices to disrupt last-mile logistics in South East Asia. His favourite quote in product management is “A great product manager has the brain of an engineer, the heart of a designer, and the speech of a diplomat.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Singapore/events/249256495/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
