language: English
recordingDate: 1590695065
description: "2020 saw one of the biggest jumps in production usage of Kubernetes. Deployments are getting larger as cloud native adoption becomes mainstream. You canâ€™t operate Kubernetes without a registry, making Harbor a key ingredient in any cloud native environment. Harbor 2.0 takes a giant leap in expanding the types of supported artifacts by standardizing to the OCI format.\n\nIn this webinar, you will get an in-depth overview on how to use Harbor as the solution to the challenges of managing your cloud native artifacts.\n\nHarbor is an open source registry that secures artifacts with policies and role-based access control, ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted. As a CNCF Incubating project, Harbor delivers compliance, performance, and interoperability to help you consistently and securely manage artifacts for Kubernetes.\n\nPresenter:\nMichael Michael, Maintainer of Harbor and Director of PM @VMware"
