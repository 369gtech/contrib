For now let's start from the basics: what the developer and the business should know before getting involved in this game.\nJust half a year ago the very foundation of mobile industry was challenged — the first stable version of Flutter was released. Now it's time to review the first results. From humble DIY experiments to store releases — we pioneered this path for you, collected project analytics, developed best practices and architectural solutions, created some useful reusable artifacts for the community. It's time to find out how Flutter changes lives, helps businesses and what could it all mean for the future.\n\nGeneral Partner –Apalon (https://www.apalon.com/)\nVideo Partner – Flo (https://flo.health/)"
