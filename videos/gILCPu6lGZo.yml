recordingDate: 1433495723
description: "Find more information here: http://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/understanding-databases-distributed-docker-applications\n\nIn this talk we'll focus on the use of Crate alongside Weave in Docker containers, the technical challenges, best practices learned, and getting a simple web application running alongside it. You'll learn about the reasons why Crate.IO is building \"yet another NoSQL database\" and why it's unique and important when running containerized applications. We'll show why the shared-nothing architecture is so important when deploying large clusters and talk about the ways we've leveraged Lucene, Elasticsearch, and built an optimized distributed SQL planner. You will learn how to deploy a Crate cluster within minutes in the cloud using Docker, some of the challenges you'll encounter, and how to overcome them. Crate focuses on super simple integrations with any cloud provider, striving to be as turnkey as possible with minimal up-front configuration required to establish a cluster. Once established, we'll show how to scale the cluster horizontally by simply adding more nodes. The session will also give you examples when you should use Crate compared to other similar technologies such as MongoDB, Hadoop, Cassandra or FoundationDB. We'll talk about Crate's strengths and what types of applications are well-suited for this type of data store, as well what is not. Finally we'll outline how to architect an application that is easy to scale using Crate, Docker, Weave, and a simple web application."
