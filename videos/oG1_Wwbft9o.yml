description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/what-i-learned-from-four-years-of-scienceing-the-crap-out-of-devops\n\nFour years, over 25,000 DevOps data points, and some science... What did we find? Well, the headline is that IT does matter if you do it right. With a mix of technology, processes, and a great culture, IT contributes to organizations' profitability, productivity, and market share. We also found that using continuous delivery and lean management practices not only makes IT better -- giving you throughput and stability without tradeoffs -- but it also improves quality and security outcomes and makes your work feel better -- making your organizational culture better and decreasing burnout. Dr. Nicole Forsgren will share these findings as well as tips and tricks to help make your own DevOps.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeaker: Nicole Forsgren; IT Impacts Expert, Chef"
