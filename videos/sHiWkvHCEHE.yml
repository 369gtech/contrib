description: "Six years has passed since we had our Grand Opening at Foo Café. Since then we have now made 2048 events.\n\nWe will celebrate this with a talk on what a community really is and why they're so important. At least the communities that we can call the committed communities. \n\nEster Daniel Ytterbrink is a software developer and co-founder of Foo Café - the worlds by far biggest tech conference.\n_________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing and learning.\n\nBorn out of the desire to create a year round conference like atmosphere, Foo Café is THE place for planned and spontaneous meetings of all sizes and interests within the IT arena.\nEnjoy a coffee or a cold beer, along with light pub fare, and engage with other like minded individuals interested in sharing their knowledge and learning from one another. Foo Café is sourced by individuals, small, medium and goliath-sized enterprises, as well as entrepreneurs. Awaiting you, after stepping over the Foo Café threshold, is a space that is recruitment and product placement safe!\n\nWe look forward to igniting inspiration and creativity year round to patrons of Foo Café."
