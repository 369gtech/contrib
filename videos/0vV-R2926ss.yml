description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/XmRUy\n\nWelcome to my Flyweight Design Pattern Tutorial! The flyweight design pattern is used to dramatically increase the speed of your code when you are using many similar objects.\n\nTo reduce memory usage the flyweight design pattern shares Objects that are the same rather than creating new ones. In this tutorial, I'll create 100,000 rectangles and show you the difference in speed versus creating unique rectangle objects versus the flyweight design."
