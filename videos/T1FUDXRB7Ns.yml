title: 'Using field masks with Google APIs for partial response (The G Suite Dev Show)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1490980792
description: "When working with Google APIs, developers will likely come across the concept of \"field masks\" to reduce the amount of data returned in the response payload from an API. Knowing what field masks are and how to use them is a skill all Google Developers should have. In this first of a 2-part video series, engineer Wesley Chun shows viewers how to use field masks for “partial response” and why you should consider doing so. Featured are JavaScript & Python code snippets using various (Google Drive, Sheets, Gmail) APIs to demonstrate how to use field masks! In part 2, you’ll learn about using field masks in update API requests as well as some general tips on using field masks.\n\n“Updating your signature with the Gmail API” DevByte video: https://goo.gl/GbAOvb\n\nPartial response with the Gmail API: https://goo.gl/1wsBeH\n\n“Listing your files in Google Drive” DevByte video: https://goo.gl/ZIgf8k\n\nPartial response with the Google Drive API: https://goo.gl/Ko3QRh\n\nPartial response with the Google Sheets API: https://goo.gl/COVWPO\n\nPerformance & partial response (READ): https://goo.gl/bAUcdI\n\nSlides API field mask guide (READ+WRITE): https://goo.gl/IZ5mva\n\n“Setting up new Google API projects” DevByte video: https://goo.gl/RbyTFD\n\nGoogle Developers Console: https://console.developers.google.com\n\nGoogle APIs Client Libraries: https://goo.gl/xXCn0K\n\n“Common Python code walkthrough” DevByte video: https://goo.gl/KMfbeK\n\nG Suite Dev Show video series playlist: https://goo.gl/JpBQ40\n\nLaunchpad Online developer video series: https://goo.gl/kFMUa6\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers YouTube channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
