title: 'Jeff Hoffer: Solve Technical Debt by Decoupling Apps From Architecture | June 2020'
language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1597960061
description: 'This all started when I needed to architect a new platform from scratch for a new version of an existing product â€¦ 12 years ago. It led to work, prototype, more work, and now what I have to present today. Every App no matter how carefully crafted at the outset incurs Technical Debt. Our choice then becomes to solve it early with a lot of upfront architectural work or solve it later by moving quickly on the Application itself. I say, "why choose?" By leveraging proven architectural principles, tao.js was built to enhance the technologies we already use and provide a simplified way of Decoupling our Apps from the Architecture on which they reside to allow each to evolve as necessary and only when needed. In this talk you will learn Why it works with live coding of converting an existing application to use tao.js, and then evolve the App''s architecture easily without affecting the App''s functionality.'
