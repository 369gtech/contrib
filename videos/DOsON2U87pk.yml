description: "Talk recording from JSNation Live 2020, the biggest JavaScript conference in the cloud: https://live.jsnation.com\n\n# Going Live from a Browser...with Another Browser \n\nThere are other ways to proxy live video from a browser to an RTMP endpoint, but what if we wanted to interact with that stream first? And not just interact by writing obtuse ffmpeg filters, but just some good ol' HTML and CSS? Let's do that! We'll talk about how you can allow your streamers to go live directly from their browser by using headless Chrome and ffmpeg."
