language: English
recordingDate: 1450189946
description: "Akka and AngularJS are a great combination for Reactive Apps. Akka takes care of vertical and horizontal scaling as well as resilience and with AngularJS it's easy to implement a rich and highly responsive UI talking to an Akka backend via messages. In this session we will build an exemplary Reactive App step by step: starting from the stanalone UI we first introduce Akka HTTP and Server-Sent Events running on a single node and then move on to an elastic and resilient service built with features like Akka Distributed Data (CRDTs), Akka Cluster Sharding and Akka Persistence.\n\n## Take-Aways\n- See the Reactive Manifesto implemented live\n- Introduction to Akka HTTP and advanced Akka Cluster features\n- Get a glimpse at idiomatic Scala/Akka code\n\n## Level\n- Intermediate\n- Only a few slides, but a lot of code"
