description: "In this talk we will present a number of common patterns from Erlang systems and how these patterns relates to business needs. Most of the patterns revolve around the notion of how failure is handled and we will discuss how active treatment of failure leads to better options for the product owner when it comes to prioritising fixes and new features. By modelling the patterns using the newly created Visual Erlang notation we get a new way of talking about Erlang systems and architectures, which will make our thoughts and insights easier to share.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Introduce Visual Erlang as a way of documenting Erlang patterns and sharing some common ones, while relating the patterns to business needs.\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Anyone trying to understand how an Erlang architecture works. Architects will benefit from getting a way to express their ideas and people with limited or no knowledge of Erlang will get a precise description of what goes on in an Erlang architecture."
