We'll talk about what you could discover in each project, what you can get out of this experience as techniques, technologies, workflow etc and you get to vote your favorite.\n\nEveryone including you get to be part of this movement, we shape our journey together.\n\nThis is a special time and if I didn't asked for sharing that much so far, this time sharing matters. Share on your personal profile and if you're part of any small or large group share it over there too, so you can get more to vote for your favorite project. Get your friends over and ask them to vote.
