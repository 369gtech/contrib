description: "Serialization toolbox for Akka messages, events and persistent state that helps achieve compile-time guarantee on serializability by Paweł Lipski & Marcin Złakowski\n\nEvery message leaving a JVM boundary in Akka needs to be serialized first. However, the existing solutions for serialization in Scala leave a lot of room for runtime failures that are NOT reported in compile time. \n\nWe’re glad to introduce Akka Serialization Helper, a toolkit including a Circe-based, runtime-safe serializer and a set of Scala compiler plugins to counteract the common caveats when working with Akka serialization.\n\nPresented at Sphere.it Tech Talks #5 - Runtime Safety of Akka & TDD"
