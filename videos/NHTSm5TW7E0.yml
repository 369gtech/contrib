title: 'Knowledge-infused Statistical Learning for Social Good Applications - Manas Gaur and Kaushik Roy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1598423531
description: "Abstract: Humans are able to provide symbolic knowledge in structured form for potential use by an AI system in learning human desirable concepts. In clinical settings for instance, prediction of patient outcomes by an AI can be guided by knowledge from patient history. This history contains concepts such as treatment information, observational and drug-related information, mental health condition, and severity of disease/disorder. Additionally, there is also often a certain graphical structure to the knowledge among the concepts, for example, \"patient symptoms cause certain tests to be taken\", which in turn affects prescription of medication. This type of structure between human interpretable concepts contained in knowledge can aid the AI to an informed prediction.\n\nReferences:\nhttp://kidl2020.aiisc.ai/\nhttp://wiki.aiisc.ai/index.php/Main_Page\n\nBio:\nManas Gaur is currently a Ph.D. student in the Artificial Intelligence Institute at the University of South Carolina. He has been Data Science and AI for Social Good Fellow with the University of Chicago and Dataminr Inc. His interdisciplinary research funded by NIH and NSF operationalizes the use of Knowledge Graphs, Natural Language Understanding, and Machine Learning to solve social good problems in the domain of Mental Health, Cyber Social Harms, and Crisis Response. His work has appeared in premier AI and Data Science conferences (CIKM, WWW, AAAI, CSCW), journals in science (PLOS One, Springer-Nature, IEEE Internet Computing), and healthcare-specific meetings (NIMH MHSR, AMIA).\nPersonal Webpage: https://manasgaur.github.io/\n\nKaushik Roy is currently a Ph.D. student in the Artificial Intelligence Institute at the University of South Carolina. He completed his master's in Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington and has worked at UT Dallasâ€™s starling lab. His research interests include Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge graphs, Machine Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. His work has been featured at reputed conferences (IEEE, KR).\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
