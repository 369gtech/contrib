title: 'Foot-Gun Features to Avoid in jQuery with Dave Methvin'
recordingDate: 1412801018
description: "jQuery began its life in 2006 and some of the features still reflect 2006 priorities rather than 2014 ones. Although the jQuery team has worked to fix APIs and features that can cause problems – and has even removed some of the worst offenders – there are still foot-guns lurking for the inattentive developer. This talk will help you to avoid those problems by understanding the work jQuery does on your behalf when you call common APIs.\n\nDave Methvin\nPresident, jQuery Foundation\nhttps://twitter.com/davemethvin\nhttps://jquery.org\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
