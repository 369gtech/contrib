recordingDate: 1574413422
description: "This talk is not totally carved in stone but the below outline is what I want to do: – Introduction of myself, who am I, what do I do – Explaining the area where voice input and processing is at this time in time and why it is the next input method and maybe better – How voice to text and NLP (natural language processing) works and the difficulty of language with a live demo to let them shout a words or terms and maybe get people with accent on stage (will ask people on the conference before my talk). As a backup I have video’s recorded with different accents – How to implement a voice action in React and React Native in iOS and Android with live demo (ordering 500 coffee from Starbucks or something like that) with a video as backup plan – Show how to do NPL on React and React Native and show it in the app and with weird results. Then take action or let it dictate the tekst on screen – Summary of the solutions and my opinion about the best solution\n\nAbout the speaker\nWouter van den Broek is a dutch mobile developer and consultant currently working at Synappz Mobile Health and as freelancer for start-ups and big companies.
