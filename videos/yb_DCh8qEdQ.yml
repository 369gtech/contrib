recordingDate: 1469194160
description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Berlin 2016\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAnstract:\nGetting to grips with a new programming language can be daunting, especially if it requires learning a new discipline such as functional programming. In this talk, Sofia and Dave will provide a step-by-step guide to adopting and mastering Scala from two different perspectives: the graduate developer and the visiting consultant.\nSofia Cole is a developer at YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP with eigtheen months' experience working with Scala. Dave Gurnell is a consultant at Underscore with over a decade's experience writing functional code. Between them, they will walk you through their experiences at YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP migrating from a legacy Perl monolith to a Scala microservice architecture.\n\nTopics covered will include:\n* How to sell Scala within your organization. \n* What benefits do managers and developers care about?\n* A step-by-step guide for navigating the sea of Scala and FP concepts, without losing yourself in a monadic storm\n* Shared joys and pains from different developers from disparate backgrounds, and how to reconcile them\n* The tactical and targeted use of hack days, and functional programming workshops, including a step-by-step guide for running coding dojos\n* A guide to pair programming from two different perspectives: peer-pairing and teacher-student pairing\n\nThis will be an entertaining and enlightening alternative take on the Scala adoption story. The speakers absolutely promise not to quarrel on-stage (unless the situation particularly demands it)."
