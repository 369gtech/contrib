description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nManaging Kubernetes clusters and the application workload running on them is complex. Developers and teams should have a means of quickly shipping solutions into K8s and ensuring they can lifecycle those solutions. Tooling and complexity become problems that chip away at precious dev time. Weâ€™ll show you how this problem can be solved and unified in a way that makes it easy to manage clusters in public or private environments and their associated workload. This will be a demo rich webinar."
