title: 'Niels Leenheer JavaScript On Microcontrollers at Mobile Era 2019'
recordingDate: 1574093620
description: "This talk is the continuation of my \"Fun with Bluetooth\" talk from last year. I will try to show people the building IoT devices using JavaScript is relatively easy and definitely something a web or app developer can dot .\n\nDuring the talk, I will live code and show the results of:\n\na connected lightbulb\na pixel display\na remote-controlled LEGO car\nAnd as a final demo, I will try to drive the remote-controlled car of a table. And hopefully, the car will refuse to do that. Because it has a LIDAR sensor and will sense the danger and will back away from the edge.\n\nEarlier this week I've given this talk for the very first time at YGLF in Lithuania where it was very well received.\n\nhttps://noti.st/nielsleenheer/y6lwCY/javascript-on-microcontrollers\n\nAbout the speaker:\nNiels is a self-professed browser geek. He has been hooked on browsers ever since somebody showed him the original Nexus browser on a NeXT Cube back in the dark ages of the internet. Niels is the creator of HTML5test.com and is a Mozilla TechSpeaker, Google Developer Expert and a Microsoft MVP. He loves procrastinating, collecting weird devices with even stranger browsers, drawing pixel art monsters, procrastinating, researching obscure browsers and tinkering with hardware. For his day job, he is CTO of Salonhub and creates web applications for hair salons.\n\nAbout Mobile Era\nMobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.
