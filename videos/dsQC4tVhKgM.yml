We will present how Netflix uses immutable Spinnaker pipelines to stream your favorite movies and shows, and how to use containers with Spinnaker on Azure.  We will also demonstrate an elastic CI of .Net core at cloud scale with Jenkins, and we will show a fully automated pipeline for releasing an Azure service using Visual Studio Team Services.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
