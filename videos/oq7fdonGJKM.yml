description: '#Codemotion Rome 2017 - Modern race cars produce lot of data, and all this in real time. In this presentation I will show you how data could be generated and used by various applications in the car, on the track or team head quarter. The demonstration will show how to move data using messaging systems like Apache Kafka, process the data using Apache Spark and use various storage technics: Distributed File System, NoSQL Database. This presentation is a great opportunity to see how to build a " near real time big data application". The code from this talk will be made available as open source.'
