description: "Nearly every designer after a few years of working for an agency, begins to think about starting his or her own studio. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a fancy office, work only on the projects that you like, without having to sell your soul to the devilish client and compromise when amending designs? But reality is more complex than that and definitely less romantic. Irene Pereyra and Anton Repponen will talk about transforming a small studio into a hyper successful project and share their experience including all the achievements and failures they went through on their way to the top.\n\nIrene Pereyra & Anton Repponen\nCo-Founders, Anton & Irene\nhttps://twitter.com/antonandirene\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
