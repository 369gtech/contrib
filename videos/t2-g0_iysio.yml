description: "by Arnaud Le Hors\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/hyperledger_fabric_blockchain_for_the_enterprise.webm\n\n\nThis session will introduce attendees to the Hyperledger Fabric framework, its design principles, its architecture and roadmap, leaving attendees with some practical information on how to get started setting up their own permissioned blockchain network and developing a blockchain application. Hyperledger Fabric is the most popular Hyperledger framework with over 280 contributors from over 27 different organizations and a growing number of applications in production. It is designed for the Enterprise use case and presents some unique characteristics that differentiate it from all other blockchain frameworks, providing finality, performance, confidentiality, and flexibility. \n\nThis presentation will cover those characteristics, and walk attendees through Fabric's unique architecture, consensus model, and its different components. It will then give insights to Fabric's roadmap, covering the release schedule, the main axis of development, as well as what's in the works for the foreseeable future. \n\nFinally, attendees will be given practical information on how to get started using Fabric. This includes setting up a first blockchain network and start developing an application. The various options available to developers will be covered both with regard to the SDKs and smart contract languages available. \n\nThis session is designed to give attendees a good understanding of Fabric so that they get started with their own development with confidence. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 16:20:00+01"
