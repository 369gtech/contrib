description: "Next design patterns video will drop early next week. In the meantime, check out this quick video where I talk about three ideas that I believe are fundamental to programming.\n\n1) Everything begins and ends with a requirement.\n2) Requirements are in constant flux. (The system is never done.)\n3) Estimates are always wrong.\n\nCheck out this (mentioned) video to learn more about E-Type, P-Type, and S-Type systems:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08ZUNsekFdY\n\nBtw I've invested in a compact camera but I didn't use it in this video and instead used my broken iPhone 6 camera :/ Stupid mistake. Hope you can forgive me for the quality :)"
