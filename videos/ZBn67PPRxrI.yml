title: 'Why you should love Rust as well - Colin Ingram'

description: "For the fourth year in a row, Rust has been listed as the most loved programming language in the Stackoverflow survey but with a small but growing pool of developers using it. So what inspires such love from them?\n\nRust is a performance focused language which aims to steer you away from common memory and thread bugs associated with other languages.\n\nIt is also versatile, being able to be used for web services, embedded development, to generate WebAssembley and its great toolset and compiler will help you through all.\n\nThe session will introduce some of the language features and tools Rust has, and time allowing will explore a use case for WASM (WebAssembley) generation.\n\nColin Ingram is a backend developer and self confessed dotnet fanboy with around 11 years experience. He brexited the UK 5 years ago and is currently working at BIMobject where his unhealthy addiction to dad humour keeps his colleagues endlessly entertained.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
