description: "Joe Robinson\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/141/\nIf you've taken a glance at the docs of an opensource project you contribute\r\nto, or something you've worked on either professionally or for a hobby, and\r\nthought \"that word doesn't sound right when I read it\" or \"is there a better\r\nway to write the steps needed to work this project?\" this short talk aims to\r\nprovide\\ practical and effective writing style information for new and\r\nexperienced developers. Using basic computer science, this talk describes\r\nand explains writing style points such as how to use definite articles,\r\nactive voice, punctuation, and plain language."
