recordingDate: 1581884631
description: "Hello, my name is Ivette, I am Dennie's mom. Hello, my name is Dennie. I have autism. I am a developer and an entrepreneur. I like to do what I am doing. As mom sometimes I think Dennie does to much. Sometimes Dennie goes beyond his own limits.\n\nBut I like so much the life that I live. Together Dennie and his mum are strong and united. They have found a way for communicating about limits and borders. They found a way to live so happy and good as possible. We are sure the tips and advice can help others. The insights from another generation and open communication is a good solution. â€˜Cause many people go beyond their limit.\n\nDennie Declercq\nDDSoft (nonprofit)\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
