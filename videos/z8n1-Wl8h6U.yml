description: "Strata Online Conference: Data in Motion - Data moving people, movement making data.\n\nWith every step, every commute, every leap, we make data. From the diagnostics on a jet engine to the muscles of a top athlete, from the train we take to work to the way we track sports scores, data is in motion. In this Strata Online Conference, we'll look at data and movement across a variety of sports and industries.\n\nData Science for Agile Strategy. From Formula 1 to the Boardroom\n\nSimon Williams\n\nStrategy has changed. The step-change is data abundance, speed and competition means that static business planning striving for that perfect answer are obsolete. We'll demonstrate how the Data Science underpinning race strategy engines used in Formula One to plan, track and update strategy in real-time are enabling Fortune 500 firms to be more agile. In this hyper-competitive environment differences are measured in hundredths of seconds and data informs decisions that can win or lose you races. We'll discuss how the techniques and principles used to underpin Race Strategy have translated successfully to industry with examples of how these have created advantage in strategy development, product direction and organisation design.\n\nData: the future of city's public transport\n\nDr. Neal Lathia\n\nCities already hold over half of the world's population: in order to keep their residents moving, public transport infrastructure is becoming increasingly critical. Smart cards (like London's Oyster card) are already capturing vast amounts of data from network's passengers. My recent research has analysed this data and asked: what valuable services could be built for urban residents? This journey has uncovered wasteful patterns in Londoner's ticket-purchasing habits, inconsistencies in transport-policy incentives, and linked community's usage of public transport to social deprivation. However, it has also uncovered the potential that this data holds to address many shortcomings if it were combined with the techniques that are readily available and used daily by web services.\n\nBig data in the 1950s\n\nJohn Graham-Cumming\n\nWhat did a big data project look like in 1955? I'll preview my StrataConf London talk coming later in the year with a look at the big data challenges that faced the early computing pioneers and how they are not so different from today's problems.\n\nData in Flight: The Science of Aircraft Information\n\nJayson Agagnier\n\nAirplanes generate a lot of data. From flight plans to flight recorders, today's aircraft is both a collector of information, and a consumer of it. In this session, Bombardier's Jayson Agagnier takes us on a quick tour of the data that flows through airplanes, both in the air and on the ground, and considers the state of the art in telemetry, diagnostics, and other data applications that keep air travel working.\n\nTwitter Location Data.
