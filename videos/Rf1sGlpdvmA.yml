description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nBanking on Kubernetes, the Hard Way, in Production - Miles Bryant & Suhail Patel, Monzo Bank \n\nHave you ever wondered what it takes to deploy and operate Kubernetes at scale, in production? Self hosted clusters often have a bad reputation as a complex and costly choice when compared to managed services. Let’s look at an alternative viewpoint and evaluate the tradeoffs.  Monzo started self hosting Kubernetes out of necessity a few years ago when managed services were in their infancy. In this talk, Miles and Suhail will explain why Monzo has chosen to continue operating their own clusters, and how this can be a viable option.  This talk discusses Monzo’s experiences with operating, upgrading, customising and configuring the control plane, networking and cloud integrations. We think this has been the best choice, but we also want to discuss the challenges we’ve faced along the way - like the time when network policies took down a large chunk of Monzo's cluster.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeot"
