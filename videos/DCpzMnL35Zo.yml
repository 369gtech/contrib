title: 'SREcon19 Americas - Getting Started with Observability Lab: Opentracing, Prometheus, and Jaeger'
language: English
recordingDate: 1555953519
description: "Kevin Crawley, Instana\n \nBuilding a cloud native organization without having a robust understanding of what your applications are doing in production is almost impossible. Exposure to these tools early will give engineers who are beginning to make the transformation in their organizations a greater understanding behind the need for observability.\n\nIn this session, we will cover how to install the Prometheus Operator, Grafana, Jaeger, and begin monitoring a live production Kubernetes cluster. We will then instrument an example application composed of Java and AngularJS microservices using technologies such as Opentracing and Micrometer.\n\nWe will show how developers can see transactions occurring between their applications and explore how these tools will help both developers and operations troubleshoot and diagnose issues. We will also cover how these tools can be leveraged to build alerts and deliver business intelligence.\n\nJoin the SREcon Slack workspace (http://usenix.org/srecon/slack) and join the #19am_o11y_wkshop.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
