title: 'KotlinConf 2018 - Datomic: The Most Innovative DB You''ve Never Heard Of by August Lilleaas'
recordingDate: 1539593559
description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nDatomic is a strange database. The writer is single threaded. It writes to other databases and has no storage of its own. It has a completely different API for reads and writes. Queries runs on the client, not the server. Time travel is built in, and you can query the history of your database.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn where Datomic fits and for which use cases the above are good ideas, how Datomic actually invented very little and stands on the shoulders of BigTable and VoltDB, all using Kotlin, of course :)\n\nAbout August Lilleaas:\nA full stack software developer, working as a consultant in Oslo. Builds CRUD for clients, with SQL databases, Datomic, JVMs, Clojure, Groovy, React and React Native."
