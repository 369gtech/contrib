title: 'Microservices Distributed Tracing: from traces to operational insights'
language: English
recordingDate: 1616707409
description: "Slide Deck:\_http://bit.ly/slidedeck-210325\n\nMicroservices delivered in containers are the de facto pattern for rapid development with scalable software deployment. Opentracing and Distributed Tracing Systems help developers address the challenges involved with diagnostics of such deployments. Trace data allow the developer insight into the execution of individual transaction instances. Data mining of the vast number of collected traces, and the event data attached to them, can provide rich operational information, far beyond the diagnostic use case.\n\nIn this session, learn how to implement Opentracing in your microservices deployment, how to extend the coverage to older legacy java components, and how to use the trace data for diagnostics, monitoring, planning and reporting.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
