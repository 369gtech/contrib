But for a long time there was no tool to help you figure out which parts of a codebase were lacking documentation the most. This talk covers how Inch filled that niche for hundreds of Elixir programmers, what’s unique about Elixir’s approach to docs as first class citizens and how the recent support for EEP 48 in Elixir 1.7 changed the rules for documentation analysis.\n\n-- Read the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2C6rK0E\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - RENÉ FÖHRING\nSenior Software Architect at 5Minds\n\nRené has been fortunate enough to work as a professional software developer since he’s been 17 years old. He’s an Open Source enthusiast and the creator of Credo and Inch as well as ElixirStatus and ElixirWeekly.\n\n-- More on René Föhring: http://bit.ly/2C6rK0E\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 18\nCode BEAM Lite Berlin 18 was co-organised by Bitcrowd and Code Sync.\n\nBITCROWD\n-- Website: https://bitcrowd.net/\n-- Twitter: https://twitter.com/bitcrowd\n-- Mail: info at bitcrowd.net\n\nCODE SYNC \n-- Website: www.codesync.global\n-- Twitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\n-- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\n-- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\n-- Mail: info at codesync.global\n\n#CBLBerlin #Elixir #CodeSync #Documentation #Inch"
