description: "Rich Hickey gave us an amazing talk “Simple made easy” about how to leverage Clojure to build simple solutions. But what can we do if the problem we’re solving is intrinsically complex?\nThis talk will show how we can leverage Clojure simplicity to solve complex problems that evolve over time based on the Nubank experience of building a 6 year long system that we managed to solve for the complexity in a bearable way."
