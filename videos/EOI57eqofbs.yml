description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJosh Graham - Atlassian's SaaS Architect\n\nABSTRACT\nIncorporating downloadable products into a SaaS offering is a challenge, particularly when a new version of the product is downloadable every 3 months or so, yet the SaaS offering is updated at least weekly.\n\nOn our road to continuous delivery, we established a target cadence for software delivery and deployments, and set about removing the obstacles blocking us in achieving that cadence. Things like team structure, software architecture, integration architecture, and requirements granularity all play their part.\n\nWe then encountered the consequences of continually changing software releases, and learned how to handle them. Josh will cover the testing and build time issues, architectural changes, and process changes you may also need to deal with. You'll also get a peek behind the curtain at the deployment automation used to drive the continuous delivery of a successful SaaS offering.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
