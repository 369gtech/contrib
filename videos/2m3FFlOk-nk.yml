description: "The future of work is remote, but what's holding us back from living in that future now? We already have the technology - the next step is to build a remote working culture. By working \"remote-first\" with asynchronous communication, everybody benefits - even people who work in the office. I'll describe my experiences working fully remote successfully for 3.5 years at Stack Overflow, including the benefits and the challenges. I'll talk about ways we levelled the field between those in the office and those working from home, and how your company can move towards a remote-first culture. \n\nAbout: Alex Warren, Engineering Manager, AlphaSights\n\nAlex Warren is an Engineering Manager at AlphaSights in London. Before that, he spent 3.5 years working remotely as a full-stack web developer at Stack Overflow. Previously, he built the textadventures.co.uk website and Quest, an open source text adventure game engine."
