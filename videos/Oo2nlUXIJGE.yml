description: 'Since I''ve been working on distributed systems I always wanted to back in time and teach myself what I know now, in order to avoid the silly mistakes I did! Things like vector clocks, the CAP theorem, how replication really works (and why it''s needed), what BASE means and in general all about how this stuff really works! This is the speech I''d needed wheI wrote my first DT, and it''s something you need to know if you fancy working in this area. And we will also be coding some very simple examples in NodeJS, as I am not a big believer of diagrams... show me code!'
