She has also published her first comedic crime novel, Fresh Squeezed. She writes a monthly column called \"WebWatch\" for Better Investing magazine and is a regular contributor to www.interest.com. As a consultant, she manages projects for clients and wins accolades for her ability to herd cats.\n\nWhen unshackled from her computer, she hikes in the mountains, cycles, walks her dogs, takes aerial dance classes, and cooks gourmet meals.
