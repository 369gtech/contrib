description: "RubyConf 2018 - The Case of the Missing Method — A Ruby Mystery Story by Nadia Odunayo\n\nBusiness is slow for Ruby Private Investigator, Deirdre Bug. She’s on the verge of switching industry when she gets a call from an anxious young man. \"Some class methods have gone missing,\" he tells her breathlessly. \"I need your help.\"\n\nDeirdre takes the case and begins exploring Ruby objects behind the scenes. Though she thinks she's on familiar ground — Ruby's object model, method lookup — she's about to discover that she really has no clue."
