description: "TDD:Test-Driven Development\nby Alastair Smith \n(@alastairs)\n\nTest-Driven Development is far from dead, and it can be applied to more than just software. We'll look at tSQLt, an open-source framework for unit-testing T-SQL, how to get those tests running as part of your CI build, and how we can use tests to drive the development of your database.\n\nAlastair is a developer at Redgate, based in Cambridge. He enjoys writing C# on the back end and HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the front end, but he's tried a number of languages and found his real interests lie in good coding practices and ensuring software quality with automated tests. He is the founder of the Cambridge Software Craftsmanship Community and a co-organiser of DDD East Anglia. \n\nTo find out more see:\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/205705982/"
