description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2018 Conference https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nVue JS Best Practices\n\nAt GitLab we use Vue JS in production more than a year. I refactored old parts of GitLab with Vue and created many new features using the framework. We are really impressed how Vue is simple yet powerful. First 10 mins of the talk are an introduction for new comers, then deep dive into the best techniques, like state management, reactivity, tooling and also the experiences about new feature development and migrating a legacy featue to Vue."
