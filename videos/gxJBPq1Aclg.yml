language: English
recordingDate: 1575916164
description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n----\n\n\"I made one great mistake in my life - when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made\" --Albert Einstein, 6 Nov. 1954\n\nEthics. It's a complex discipline, and it's rarely as clean cut in the moment as it seems when looking back through the lens of history. So what can you do to ensure your company isn't building bombs? How can you ensure your organization is trying to make ethical choices? Is it ethical to ask engineers to work 80 hours a week during their on call rotations? Is it sustainable? What about the contract the sales team just signed which promises a fully functioning product, from scratch, in less than six months? What do you do when you realize your app is leaking unencrypted data?\n\nIn this talk, I'll walk you through some of processes that my company has around ethical sales, sustainable workflows, and preventing burnout. I'll talk about what's worked for us & what hasn't-- from surfacing and discussing ethical concerns to ensuring our development process is sustainable -- both for our employees during a contract's term and for our clients after we hand off the finished product.\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#Ethical%20Software:%20How%20Not%20to%20Build%20Bombs%20in%20the%20Modern%20Era-Jeri%20Sommers"
