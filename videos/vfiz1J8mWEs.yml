Period. After talking to many Rails developers about their application performance, I realized many performance issues can be solved by understanding your database a bit better. So I thought I’d share the statistics Postgres captures for you and how you can use them to find slow queries, un-used indexes, or tables which are not getting vacuumed correctly. This talk will cover Postgres tools and tips for the above, including pgstatstatements, useful catalog tables, and recently added Postgres features such as CREATE STATISTICS."
