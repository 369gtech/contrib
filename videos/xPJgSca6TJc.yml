description: "Peeling Away the Layers of the Network Stack by Ufuk Kayserilioglu\n\n\"As Rails developers, we depend on network protocols to ensure the products we build are available and accessible to our users. Despite this, many of us are poorly aware of how the layers of the network stack actually work, or why they are there.\n\nUnderstanding the things that happen between physical signals on the wire and your Rails application will help you hone your craft and level you up. Fortunately, the basic concepts of network protocols are easy to grasp, with a little guidance. So let's walk together through these concepts, and peel away the layers of the network stack one by one.\"\n\n__________\n\nUfuk is a Physics PhD turned polyglot software developer. He is currently working as a Senior Production Engineer on the Ruby and Rails Infrastructure Team at Shopify. He has over 20 years of experience working with statically and dynamically typed languages and he brings that to Shopify for the adoption of better Ruby tooling and practices. He currently works remotely from Cyprus where he lives with his beloved wife and wonderful daughter. In his free time, he teaches computer science to high-school students."
