description: "In essence, Azure Functions give you the ability to take a small piece of code, and painlessly deploy and run it in the cloud. Not surprisingly, then, Functions shine for \"programming in the small\", for instance scripting automated tasks. But what if you wanted to build a serious application, Serverless style?\n\nUnless you are careful, you will probably quickly end up with a spaghetti of functions on your hands. Azure Functions make some problems disappear, but also introduce issues of their own, without much guidance available. In this talk, we'll explore what types of challenges can arise and why, and present some techniques to help you grow Serverless code and staying sane."
