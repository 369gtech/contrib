description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nHelping a developer to stop wasting energy on routine tasks and focusing on the most important concepts is what defines an IDE - IntelliJ Idea is constantly improving its support for writing code more productively and quickly.\n\nIn this talk I'll aim to introduce people unfamiliar with the IntelliJ Platform to Scala plugin coding assistance features and broaden the knowledge of those who consider themselves already to be experienced IDEA users.\nAnd for the most involved it will also contain a sneak peek into the future of cross-platform metaprogramming support in IntelliJ Idea using the scala.meta API."
