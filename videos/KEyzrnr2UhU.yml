description: "Andrew Bartlett\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/204/\n\nFor a number of years Andrew Bartlett has given presentations along the lines of 'the road to 100k users', and this so in part, this is another update on that long road.  \r\n\r\nBut it is also a milestone, because in the past year Samba has successfully added 124,000 users to the DB in a 4-hour benchmark, re-targeted to LMDB and successfully stood up a second replicated domain controller at the 100,000 user scale. \r\n\r\nBeyond scale, Andrew Bartlett will also update the audience on the many other new features coming up in Samba 4.10.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
