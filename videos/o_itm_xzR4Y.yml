description: "When developing distributed systems (with its services inter-dependent on one another), how do you ensure that everything is working as intended? Sometimes, you can have end-to-end tests and use monitoring tools like Pingdom or Prometheus, but those may not be able to detect changes made to other services. In this talk, we will learn about the how and why about building a canary testing framework, that can help alert you to issues and regressions in your systems.\n\nSpeaker: Iheanyi Ekechukwu"
