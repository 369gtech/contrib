title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Content Strategy in Popular Culture, Part Deux'
recordingDate: 1493314955
description: "Another year, another array of pop culture obsessions to examine and apply to the work we do. By exploring how crucial aspects of content strategy play out in movies, music, comic books, and video games, we’ll continue to expand the palette of language we can use to explain and convince more people about the importance of content strategy online, and ensure they understand that it’s not just vital, but fun, as well.\n\nWe’ll dig into:\n\nHow Niantic built Pokemon Go on top of a psychological model to create a game that appealed to everybody (well, for a few months, anyway).\nWhy artists like Jay-Z, Beyonce, Drake, and U2 have dropped new albums with little advance warning.\nWhat Marvel’s doing with its B-lineup – Talking racoons! The Sorceror Supreme! – that DC can’t seem to grasp, much less match.\nWays you can build an audience on the integrity of your content while everybody else pursues click bait and alternative truths.\nAnd so much more!\nAs with the best sequels, you don’t have to have seen the first one to learn and have fun the second time around. This time, however, we’ll focus less on theory and more on the practical application of the ideas we explore to your actual content strategy work, with examples from real projects on live Drupal sites."
