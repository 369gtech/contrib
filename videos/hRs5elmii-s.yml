title: 'Lambda Days 2015 - Tam√°s Kozsik - Static analysis to identify divide-and-conquer algorithms'
recordingDate: 1431446627
description: 'Divide-and-conquer algorithms are good candidates for parallelization. Their identifying property is that a d&c routine divides its input into "smaller" chunks, calls itself recursively on these smaller chunks, and combines the outputs into one. We set up conditions which characterize a wide range of d&c routine definitions. These conditions can be verified by static program analysis. This way d&c routines can be found automatically in existing program texts, and their parallelization based on semi-automatic refactoring can be facilitated. We work out the details in the context of the Erlang programming language.'
