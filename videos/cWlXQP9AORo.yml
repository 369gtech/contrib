description: "gRPC Performance; Tuning Applications and Libraries - Noah Eisen, Google \n\ngRPC C++ team has been working on performance for over a year now. In this presentation we will share the story of our journey, sharing insights on tuning applications that use gRPC as well as optimizing the library itself.    All concrete examples will be from gRPC, but the high level concepts will be interesting to anyone who has worked on performance.    We will focus on:  - benchmarking  + microbenchmarks  + synthetic benchmarks  + application benchmarks  + cutting down noise on benchmarks  - tooling  + flamegraphs  + latency breakdowns  - concrete optimizations  + tuning the threading model of gRPC apps  + high performance network polling systems \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrYz"
