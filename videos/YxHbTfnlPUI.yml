description: "Swift is advertised as a C++ replacement. In this talk, I discuss how true is this claim, how Swift is built to compete on the same field, what is the current status of Swift 4 performance and how it compares to other languages. Youâ€™ll learn about Swift Intermediate Language, about memory management details and what to do to get the best out of Swift to make it fast.\n\nMore information about awesome conference: https://devfest.gdg.lv"
