description: "This session revisits the story  Jack and the Beanstalk.  Let’s follow Jack the Java developer in his quest to reach the castle in the clouds. We have all been there: receiving the magic beans that will solve all our development problems—or become our worst nightmare. The presentation examines software development today and looks at solutions proposed by cloud computing. Is there really a hen that lays golden eggs? How big are the giants that can make Jack fall? As we reach for the clouds, we’ll navigate among vendors, frameworks, and tools. This session is fun and lightweight, packed with information and demos. It repeats the journey that many developers are taking. How far can Jack go, and what will he discover?\n\n\nAuthors:\nBruno Souza\nundefined\nView more trainings by Bruno Souza at https://www.parleys.com/author/bruno-souza\n\nEdson Yanaga\nEdson Yanaga is a Software Craftsman, with a particular taste for difficult projects.
