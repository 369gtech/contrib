description: "This presentation was recorded at Zurich's GOTO Night 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJens Meydam - Head of Development at Zahnärztekasse AG\n\nABSTRACT\nWhen is the best time to design a feature, or even a whole product? In parallel with implementation, a few sprints ahead, or before the first sprint? While there is probably no right answer for all scenarios, Jens Meydam will give two examples from his work at the Swiss Zahnärztekasse that support what interaction designers and product management experts like Marty Cagan have been preaching for many years: design is best done before implementation. Jens Medam will also argue that this may lead to more, not less, agility, and that this approach is actually in line with recent movements like Lean Startup.\n\nhttp://www.trifork.ch/tag/scrum\nhttps://twitter.com/triforknews\nhttp://www.facebook.com/Trifork\nhttp://gotocon.com"
