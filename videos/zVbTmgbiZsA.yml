description: "Starting with .NET Core 2.1 a new feature called Local GC has been added. It allows you to do magic things - you can completely replace the default GC used by the runtime with your own, or you can use the default GC outside .NET environment.\n\nIn the session we will look at this possibilities - how and why we can do it. We'll find out exactly where to start writing your own GC and whether it is difficult or not. \n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
