language: English
recordingDate: 1621033912
description: "Oracle Data Safe is our newest and fastest growing security service, with something new almost every month. This month we focus on advanced data masking scenarios in Data Safe. We'll also spend a little time with an exciting new capability from the Oracle Identity Management team, the Oracle Radius Agent.\n\nWe hold two sessions on the second Wednesday of each month, one at 9:00 am US Central time, the other at 18:00 pm US Central time. Content for both sessions is identical, so just pick whichever works best with your schedule."
