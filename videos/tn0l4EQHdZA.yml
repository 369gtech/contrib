description: "Much has been said about how the upcoming module feature in C++ will improve compilation speeds and reduce reliance on the C++ preprocessor. However, program architecture will see the biggest impact.\n\nThis talk explains how modules will change how you develop, organize, and deploy your code. We will also cover the stable migration of a large code base to be consumable both as modules and as normal headers.\n\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
