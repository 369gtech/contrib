title: 'YOW! Conference 2018 - Christine Yen - The Problem with Pre Aggregated Metrics'
recordingDate: 1549836000
description: "The Problem with Pre Aggregated Metrics\n\nPre-aggregated metrics and time series form the backbone of many monitoring setups and have many redeeming qualities, but simply aren't sufficient for capturing the many ways things can go wrong in modern or complex systems. Problems inherent in the concepts behind and implementation of pre-aggregated metrics prevent them from being effective for any sort of debugging or diagnostics; we'll talk about why that is, and what techniques we should be leaning on instead.\n\nChristine Yen is the cofounder of Honeycomb, a startup with a new approach to observability and debugging systems with data. Christine has built systems and products at companies large and small and likes to have her fingers in as many pies as possible. Previously, she built analytics products at Parse and Facebook, and wrote software at a few now-defunct startups.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
