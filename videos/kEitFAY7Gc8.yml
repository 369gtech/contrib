language: English
recordingDate: 1530633607
description: "Elm is a delightful functional language for reliable webapps. It compiles to JavaScript, has great performance, no runtime exceptions, and can be embeded easily into existing JS projects without the need for huge rewrites or time investment.\nWe'll be taking a practically focused crash course tour of Elm, ideally you'll walk away being able to put Elm into production either from scratch or in an existing project.\n\nMario is an Australian living in London with his wife, working for locomote.com as Head of Technology. He organises the Elm London meetup group. He believes technology should make life simple and joyful, and enjoys being able to prove so.\n\nTalk by Mario Rogic (@realmario) at the Reactivate London meetup.\n\nRecorded by Pusher.com.
