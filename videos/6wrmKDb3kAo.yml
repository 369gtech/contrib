description: "Sander van Vugt\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/117/\nIn this talk you¹ll learn how to manage performance\r\nparameters through systemd. You¹ll discover how systemd splits the Linux\r\noperating system into 3 different slices - and how that may lead to\r\nunexpected situations in some cases. You¹ll also learn how to modify a\r\nunit file to ensure that your services will always be sure that the\r\nresources they need will be available."
