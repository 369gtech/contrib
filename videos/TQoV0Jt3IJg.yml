description: "www.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a two day, single track conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 500 to 700 Developers from across the country will converge on beautiful Salt Lake City, UT to participate in training sessions by the Google Angular team, and other Angular experts. In addition to the invaluable training, ng-conf will deliver a premier conference experience for attendees, providing opportunities to network with other developers, relax at social events, and engage in some of the unique entertainment opportunities available in Utah.\n\nBurke Holland\nTopic: Angular Directives that Scale\n\nAs more and more jQuery developers begin to adopt AngularJS as their full stack framework of choice, they are staring down the possibility of creating a lot of directives. And what if their favorite UI library doesn't have directives for Angular? Should they create their own? Does every UI widget really need it's own directive? The open source project Angular Kendo UI faced this same challenge. With nearly 40 widgets and charts in various configurations, building a directive for every widget looked like a daunting task. How do we create directives that scale as our UI libraries get larger? Does it always have to be a one to one relationship? In this talk, we'll look at some alternatives for building directives for AngularJS that will scale with your UI needs."
