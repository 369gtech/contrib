description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAIOps for CI with Kubeflow Pipelines - Oindrilla Chatterjee & Aakanksha Duggal, Red Hat\n\nIt’s easy to get lost in logs and dashboards while getting to the root of build or test failures. By leveraging the data made available by Kubernetes testing and visualization platforms like Prow and TestGrid, we have built AI4CI (Artificial Intelligence for Continuous Integration), an open source AIOps tool to monitor builds and help developers get to the root cause of failures. In this session, the speakers demonstrate how they developed a set of Jupyter Notebooks which are automated using Kubeflow Pipelines into a repeatable process that collects data from various CI/CD tools, calculates key performance indicator metrics, and performs analyses such as failure type prediction and build log clustering. These metrics are then displayed and explored as interactive dashboards. By the end of the talk, the audience will learn how to build AIOps monitoring tools and automated dashboards that can help provide more visibility into their tests to better support their CI/CD processes."
