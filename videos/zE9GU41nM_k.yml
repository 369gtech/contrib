We want to minimize misunderstandings in our code to be able to work effectively as teams. This means we need to learn how to look at our code to spot areas where we could improve our communication skills. We want to get our ideas across. We want that our abstractions, our models, make sense to others.\n\nLiterature is a discipline with a long track record of authors and researchers trying to find out how to make writing communication effective. What could we learn from them?\n\nIn this talk, Alvaro explores the relation between the process of writing computer programs with that of writing literary works of fiction. In particular he wants to show some ideas presented by Umberto Eco in his book Lector in Fabula, seeing how we can improve knowledge sharing via our code, tests, documentation, and other artifacts.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/alvaro-videla/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ALVARO VIDELA\nCo-author of RabbitMQ in Action\n\nMember of the Azure advocates’ team at Microsoft.
