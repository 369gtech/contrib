description: "Chances are if you’ve followed web dev news over the past few years, you know about React, and about React Hooks. But, if you haven’t written with either before, it can be a little intimidating to get started on that learning curve! \n\nIn this talk, Cassidy will be demystifying and explaining React, how it works, and how to use some important hooks to get a state-driven application up and running from scratch.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
