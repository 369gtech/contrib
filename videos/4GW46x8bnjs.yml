title: 'Azure Functions - Marc Duiker'
recordingDate: 1623831041
description: "I created a serverless Twitterbot which tweets when new releases are made available in public GitHub repositories related to Azure Functions.\n\nIn this session, I'll walk you through the serverless application, highlighting which Azure cloud services and Azure Function specific libraries are in use and why they've been chosen. I'll show two architectural patterns which are used: function chaining and fan-out/fan-in and I'll cover the C# clients for GitHub and Twitter and describe their limitations.\n\nFinally, I'll also go into continuous integration & deployment aspects so you'll end up with a complete picture of what is necessary to deliver a serverless solution to the Azure cloud.\n\n\nMarc Duiker - Marc is a lead consultant at Xpirit with a strong focus on event-driven architectures. He has extensive knowledge of the serverless offerings in the Azure platform and he enjoys helping organizations making effective use of cloud-based technology. You might have seen Marc at a developer meetup or conference since he's a regular speaker in the area of Azure cloud &amp; serverless technologies. He started Azure Functions University, a free and open source learning curriculum on GitHub, where everyone can learn about Azure Functions in their own pace. In his spare time, Marc likes to give attention to the creative part of his brain. He likes to create pixel art (check out VSCode Pets), code visuals &amp; music, and an occasional retro game. \n\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
