description: "by John Sullivan\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.220/nobody_uses_the_agpl.webm\n\n\nThe GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) is an important tool for\nprotecting user freedom on the network. Detractors have criticized it\nfor being both too weak and too strong/demanding. In 2018, it was in\nthe news more than ever. Are the interests of corporations that are\nafraid of their free code being turned into network services run by\ncompetitors starting to align with users losing their freedom to such\nservices? Historically, the AGPL has been the target of criticism from entities\nthat want to extinguish it. Some companies have banned it from their\npremises, sowed fear about how it operates, and propagated a myth that\nnobody is using it. \n\nOthers claim that the AGPL is being used primarily by companies\nseeking to strong-arm downstream users into purchasing a proprietary\nversion of the covered software -- by catching those users being out\nof compliance with the AGPL, and telling them that they must buy the\nsoftware under a proprietary license to avoid being taken to court for\ncopyright infringement. \n\nA third group of companies is now claiming that the AGPL doesn't go\nfar enough to protect their software against being turned into\nservices that deny users freedom -- though freedom may not be their\nprimary concern. \n\nIn fact, the AGPL is being used today by a variety of interesting and\nimportant projects, including ones started by governments, nonprofits,\nand even businesses. I'll highlight some illustrative examples. I'll\nalso do my best to separate understandable concerns that people have\nabout using the AGPL from attacks on user freedom masquerading as\nconcerns, and see if there is any synergy between the concerns of the\nthird group above and those of individual users. \n\nWhile not a full solution to the problems raised when users replace\nsoftware running on their own machines with software running on\nsomeone else's machine, the AGPL is a tool that is being embraced and\nshould be embraced even more. \n\nRoom: UA2.220 (Guillissen)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:00:00+01"
