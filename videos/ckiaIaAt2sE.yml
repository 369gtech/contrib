language: English
recordingDate: 1637176271
description: "Many developers believe that Functional Programming (FP) arrived in Java 8, with the addition of the Streams API. But is this really true? In this talk, Ben Evans will talk about what FP really is, and examine whether Java is really FP or not - and consider some possibilities of how we could have done things differently, in another world.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
