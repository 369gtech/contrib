description: "Ближайшая конференция — Mobius 2020 Piter\n22-25 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/mobius2020piter\n\n. If you're serious about your iOS app, you need to be serious about making your app's user experience a pleasant and efficient one for people who depend on technologies such as VoiceOver. Apple's tools and frameworks do almost all of the heavy lifting for you, especially if your app uses mostly standard components. It's much more a question of empathy than technical difficulty, even when you need to do a little extra work for custom UI elements.\n\nAt Netflix, we care a lot about accessibility both from content and software point of view. Investments in ensuring high-quality accessibility yield multiple benefits from making automated testing possible to ensuring customer happiness."
