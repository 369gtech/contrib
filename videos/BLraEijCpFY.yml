description: "Somewhere, a project is failing. More than likely the project isn’t failing because it’s difficult, or the budget ran out, or because there wasn’t a market fit. The project is failing because of people. People introduce communication problems, staffing problems, politics, disenchantment with the client or stakeholders, and often result in lack of motivation. It doesn’t matter what methodology you use to scope, design, and implement a project if you’re unable to deal with the underlying people issues because people are hard and people are what cause project failures.\n\nBermon Painter\nhttps://twitter.com/bermonpainter\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
