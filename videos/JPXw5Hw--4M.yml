OpenThread supports a variety of chipsets and product platforms such as Android Things, Linux, and RTOS. This talk will provide a brief overview of Thread and how developers can quickly build IoT solutions using OpenThread.\n\nRate this session by signing-in on the I/O website here ? https://goo.gl/qS1xyt\n\nVisit the website ? https://openthread.io/\nOpenThread Github ? https://goo.gl/mXFBd8\nSimulating a Thread network using OpenThread codelab ? https://goo.gl/vrn8ay\nOpenThread Hardware codelab ? https://goo.gl/npEBc1\n\nWatch more IoT sessions from I/O '18 here ? https://goo.gl/xfowJ8\nSee all the sessions from Google I/O '18 here ? https://goo.gl/q1Tr8x\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel ? http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\n#io18"
