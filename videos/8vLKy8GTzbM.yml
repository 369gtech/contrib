description: 'We want our users to stay with us because they want to, not because they''re locked in. The Data Liberation Front started in 2007 as a way to help users get their data out when they decide to go. In this show Data Liberation Front founder Brian Fitzpatrick talks to host Louis Gray about the group''s origins, progress, and future, and will tell us why the group likes to operate just a little subversively.'
