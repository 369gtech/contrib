description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nJuly 15, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\n Org-mode is a large Emacs sub-systems that has been integrated into\r\n Emacs with the version 22.1 release. From it original intend,\r\n Org-mode is a system for structured note-taking and project planning.\r\n It uses strictly plain text files, making it a truly portable,\r\n system-independent solution. The project-planning features are\r\n implemented using a fairly simple outlining paradigm, upon which\r\n meta-data concepts like due dates, priorities, TODO states and tags\r\n are overlayed in a non-intrusive way. Besides outlining the system\r\n and its basic concepts, I will give background information into the\r\n history of Org-mode and discuss the properties of such an evolved\r\n system compared to a top-down designed one. Finally, I will also\r\n briefly touch on some technical aspects that may be interesting for\r\n Emacs wizards and developers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Carsten Dominik"
