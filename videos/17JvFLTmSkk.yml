description: "Peter Brady is CEO and founder of Orbital Media, one of the UK’s most innovative full service Digital Agencies. Founded in 2003, Orbital Media has worked with some of the world’s biggest organisations on national and global accounts (including Aviva, NHS, Sanofi, Nestle and Mitsubishi).\n\nAlthough Orbital Media’s traditional focus was on projecting brand engagement and awareness through social and digital channels, over the last 10 years it has developed a strong innovation and technology focus, becoming the UK’s leading supplier of gamification apps to the healthcare industry.\n\nPeter talked about Orbital Media’s journey and how it has moved into large scale tech projects (including a collaborative Artificial Intelligence project with an NHS body and the University of Essex, to reduce the burden of minor ailments in primary care). Peter also told us about how Orbital Media is developing and exporting virtual / augmented / mixed reality projects in healthcare, education and pain therapy sectors into global markets."
