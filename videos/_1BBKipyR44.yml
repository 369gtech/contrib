description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nIn this talk, I will present my work in computer vision, namely landmark detection and 3D face tracking, and the two C++ libraries that were developed in the process. The first part of the talk will give an introduction to detecting facial landmark points and work through a hello-world code example that presents and uses the superviseddescent library, a cross-platform library for cascaded regression that can be used to solve problems like landmark detection or pose estimation. The second part of the talk will present an approach that uses the found landmarks from the first part to use a 3D face model to track a person's face. With the library presented in the process, we hope to make 3D models easier to use and more widespread in the community. Both libraries are designed to be lightweight and simple to use, and try to follow modern C++11/14 programming paradigms. The talk concludes with my views on code sustainability in academia and a wish list of standard library features for computer vision.\n— \nI'm a PhD student in computer vision at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing of the University of Surrey, UK. My research is about using 3D face models to reconstruct a 3D face from a single 2D image, object tracking and facial landmark detection. My interest in C++ emerged in 2013 when I discovered the power of modern C++ programming, and I have since then open-sourced much of my research software. In my free time, I love to practice Yoga and I'm working towards obtaining my gliding license!\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
