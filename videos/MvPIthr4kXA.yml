description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/cloud-native-key-management\n\nCredential hygiene is a perennial concern in all distributed computing systems. It’s certainly of utmost importance in cloud-native platforms. It’s common practice to encrypt credentials for storage and distribution, but they ultimately need to be made available as cleartext to the application that requires them. In this talk, we will discuss the options available and best practices for these sensitive operations. Topics include: key encrypting keys, hardware security modules, and relatively new and promising advances in muti-party computation."
