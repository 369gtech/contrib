description: "by Susanne Holzgraefe\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1301/improve_sql.webm\n\n\nWhat are Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Window Functions? Why do you need them? How to use them? Correlated subselects are a pain, but your software needs them? You still could need recursive queries? You want an easy way for finding lagging or leading rows? The keywords are Common Table Expressions (CTE) and Window Functions. Finally, both, MariaDB and MySQL support them. After explaining functionality and use cases, the talk also will show the ease of use. \n\nRoom: H.1301 (Cornil)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:40:00+01"
