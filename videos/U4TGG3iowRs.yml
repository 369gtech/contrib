description: 'In October 2015, work on software for a Polish satellite’s, PW-Sat2’s, on-board computer started. Since then, Maciek has been taking part in it, jumping between the world of "boring .NET web applications" and the world of electronics, C++ and Space. During his talk, Maciek will speak about technology, the differences and similarities between the two worlds and about the challenges he encounters – both the earthbound ones and the out-of-this-world sort.'
