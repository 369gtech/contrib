description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nSteve Vinoski - Senior Architect with Basho Technologies\n\nABSTRACT\nDistributed systems are hard. Many have attempted to circumvent this fact via a variety of approaches, typically by ignoring difficult problems involving latency, partitioning, concurrency, and system evolution. Remote Procedure Call (RPC), originally devised to simplify the development of networked applications for programmers familiar with writing local applications, is one such approach. In this talk, Steve will explain the origins and evolution of RPC and bust some of the myths surrounding the alleged benefits it provides to distributed application developers.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
