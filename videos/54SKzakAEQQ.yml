description: "This video was recorded at CBL AMSTERDAM - http://bit.ly/2PPbW7J\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n---\n\nTHE BEAM IN THE CLOUD NATIVE ERA\nby Veronica Lopez\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nCloud Native, Distributed Systems, Erlang\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate, but everyone is welcome\n\nABSTRACT\nModern microservice architectures are constantly trying to replicate, with thousands of lines of bash and Go (mostly), features that the BEAM offers out of the box. Although it is said that imitation is the best form of flattery, in this talk we will go through some of the most popular constraints and pitfalls of cloud native architectures that could be more efficiently solved or even dismissed thanks to Elixir (or the BEAM)â€™s capabilities. We will discuss the impact on effort and resources that the current approach represents for companies and users, but also including a positive review on how can Elixir coexist and take advantage of the current cloud native tooling catalogue without overlapping or overengineering a project. \n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/veronica-lopez/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - VERONICA LOPEZ\nSr. software engineer\n\nMore on Veronica Lopez: https://codesync.global/speaker/veronica-lopez/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CBL AMSTERDAM 19\nCBL AMSTERDAM is powered by Code Sync.
