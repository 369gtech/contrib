It is a 100% Java EE alternative to solutions like Spring Cloud Eureka. Just as simple and at least as\npowerful. Using SnoopEE let you benefit from the full power of the JavaEE platform without the need of more 3rd party frameworks.\n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
