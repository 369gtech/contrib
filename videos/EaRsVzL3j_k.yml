description: "This is Agile?\nby Letitia Fearon \n@Letitia_Fearon\n\nHow many times have you been told that you will be working on an agile project but when you start this doesn't seem to be the case. Sometimes all the scrum ceremonies are in place but it just doesn’t feel particularly agile.\n\nIn this talk we'll take a look at what agile is, why you would want to run a project using it and the pros and cons of doing so.\n\nHas agile lost its original meaning and just become a buzzword? Is it no longer possible to solve the problem it was intended to, due to the way people are trying to implement these techniques? If you are currently working on an agile project, we'll look at what can you can do to improve things or change the way the team is working. I will demonstrate different ways of achieving this.\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/nordevcon2015/\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/LetitiaFearon-ThisIsAgile.pptx"
