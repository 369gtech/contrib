title: 'DR. JAMES STANIER: The spectrum of synchronousness'
recordingDate: 1634642953
description: "With 2020 being a year of unexpected distributed working, and with the future of our industry looking more remote, being able to wield the right tools for communicating efficiently has never been more important.\n\nYou'll leave this talk with practical “bug fixes”, tricks, and a host of tricks that you can take away and implement immediately. We’ll go through a spectrum of communication -- from synchronous to asynchronous -- and plot our common workplace interactions on it. How can we do better? From there, we’ll also consider how the permanence of our communication varies as we move along the spectrum and what that might mean for the future"
