description: "CI/CD for embedded development with an ESP8266, Arduino-cli, Gitlab-ci, Raspberry Pi, and Kubernetes Blink a LED with gitlab-ci and arduino-cli\nby Benjamin Henrion (zoobab)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.401/hw_gitlab_ci_arduino.webm\n\n\nBlink an ESP8266 board via an arduino-cli CI/CD pipeline hosted on Gitlab.com, with Kubernetes, and a Raspberry-pi board. \n\nWARNING: This replaces the \"MCU Immutable Booting\" talk from Michael Schloh von Bennewitz, which was canceled since the speaker could not attend FOSDEM due to a lack of financial sponsorship. It was about protecting microcontroller bootloaders with immutable boot. In this live demo, I will show how to blink an ESP8266 board\nvia a CI/CD pipeline hosted on Gitlab.com.\nGitlab-ci is connected to a stripped down Kubernetes cluster (K3S\nfork) hosted on a local raspberry-pi board,\nto which we have attached an ESP8266 board. I will explain how to use\nthe new Arduino CLI instead of the Arduino IDE. \n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 12:30:00+01"
