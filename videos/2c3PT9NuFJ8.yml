title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Ethereum and React: An introduction to building your first web dApp'
recordingDate: 1523570701
description: "Ethereum, a blockchain based technology, empowers you to write decentralized applications (dApps) utilizing smart contracts and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Sound scary? It’s not.\n\nDid you know that that you can create web-based applications on top of Ethereum? That its language, Solidity, shares similarities to JavaScript? That tools exist to leverage popular front-end frameworks like React?\n\nThis session will serve as an introduction to dApp development with the goal of setting a baseline to understand the core concepts and tools you need to start hacking away at the bleeding edge. Some of the topics we’ll cover include: understanding Ethereum and smart contracts, setting up a local blockchain testnet environment, the Truffle framework, Metamask plugin, the Solidity language and building React components to execute contracts that interact with the blockchain.\n\nInterested in what the hype is about? Excited to learn how to be a part of it? This session is for you."
