description: "XP @ Unruly\nBy Lewis Moore\n\nUnruly is the leading programmatic platform for social video advertising. Founded in 2006, we now have 14 offices and employ over 190 people globally. We've been applying eXtreme Programming (XP) from the start and that's still a core part of how we develop our software products. As our company and customer base has grown, we've had to figure out how to shape user stories and make plans with stakeholders spread across US, Europe and Asia. We also have grown our tech team so we can continue to develop new product offerings with rich user-experience while improving our underlying infrastructure to handle a growing amount of traffic and data. Come to this session to hear about how we use XP and where we've had to make adjustments to adapt to scale while remaining as Lean as possible. \n\nBio \n\nLewis Moore leads Solution Engineering with Unruly in London. We use extreme programming at Unruly and he is responsible for engaging our product development teams in supporting end users globally. Lewis has been working in the software industry since 2008, including large corporate clients and fast moving start ups."
