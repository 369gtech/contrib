description: "When the web was new, design and structure were all mixed up together. Eventually we realised this was very messy, so we invented CSS and separated design from HTML. Everyone felt much better after this, and went and had a cup of tea.\n\nBut while everyone was drinking tea (and not really paying attention), the line between design and structure began to get messy again. Things like the before/after pseudo-selectors made it possible for CSS to directly change content, and features like FlexBox push the concept of separation to breaking point. Conversely, CSS is being used as a development tool for visualising semantic information like role and state, when added to an interface using ARIA.\n\nIn this talk Léonie will look at the changing relationship between design and structure, and what it means for accessibility mechanics in the browser. She will share CSS code examples and design patterns for solving common accessibility problems, so everyone can go and have another nice cup of tea.\n\nSlides: http://ljwatson.github.io/decks/2016/cssday/index.html\nAbout Léonie: http://tink.uk\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
