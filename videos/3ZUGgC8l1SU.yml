description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015/kenneth-lundin\nKenneth Lundin will share the latest news from the OTP team.\n\nKenneth Lundin has been working with SW development since the late 70s.  As a curiousity it can be mentioned that Kenneth was one of the pioneers in the use of C++ at Ericsson. Unsurprisingly Kenneth's interest for OO languages has been slighty revised since then.  He joined the Erlang/OTP project in it's early stages 1996 and has been working both with application components and the runtime system since then. Has been managing the team for about 10 years now."
