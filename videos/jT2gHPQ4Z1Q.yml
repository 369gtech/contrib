description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nCoroutines have intrigued programmers for a long time. Some languages of the past implemented coroutines, but programmers using the mainstream languages of recent decades largely did not get much exposure to this programming construct. There's a resurgence of interest for coroutines and some serious work has been done in Kotlin to implement it. We'll take an example oriented approach to learning about the benefits of coroutines and along the way explore this feature of Kotlin.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with sustainable agile practices on their software projects.
