description: "The Diversity Conversation: Making the Invisible Visible: Seeing, Respecting, and Valuing Care and Maintenance in our Code and Beyond - Lauren Bacon, &yet\n\nThis year's COVID-19 pandemic has pulled back the curtain on the role of care work within our individual, social, and collective lives. While many of us in the tech sector have experience working remotely and from home, few of us have done so under such extreme and trying circumstances.\n\nIn particular, parents with children living at home have been navigating a new world of remote schooling and loss of childcare in an economy that tends to treat child-rearing and other forms of care work as externalities, rather than as central to our lives. In her talk, Lauren Bacon explores the ways in which care work is and isn’t noticed or valued, especially in the tech sector -- and what each of us can do to make that invisible work more visible, more clearly understood -- and ultimately, more valued.\n\nThe Diversity Conversation is dedicated to subjects relating to diversity, equity and inclusivity. It is a session open to all Summit attendees. We invite you to attend this event regardless of your prior experience with these topics. It is our hope that you leave the Diversity Conversation inspired and with a call to action, whether it’s a workshop to take, a conversation to have, a book to read, a practice to implement, or a question to ask."
