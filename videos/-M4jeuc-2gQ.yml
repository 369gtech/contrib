description: "Eugenio Marletti, Android GDE & Lead Android Engineer at Clue\n\nThe last Google I/O was probably the most exciting ever, especially for one reason: Kotlin received official recognition as a first-class citizen on Android. \nThe quantity of developers cheering for this shouldn't come as a surprise, as some of them have already been using the language for years, and for good reasons. \nJoin us to understand what Kotlin really is, and witness how its principles and advanced features make it so unique today, plus what will make it transcend into something even more powerful in the future."
