title: 'Sending Packets of Money with Interledger.js'
recordingDate: 1530629527
description: "Payment networks today are still silos, like Compuserve and GEnie many years ago. Can the concepts behind TCP/IP be transferred to payments? Stefan Thomas, CTO at Ripple, thinks so. In this tech talk, he explains Hashed Time-locked Agreements (HTLAs), Penny Switching and other technologies that together form the Interledger Protocol (ILP), an open-source project which brings internetworking to money. The talk includes a live demo of how ILP could transform web applications, APIs and how to write your own payment-enabled API using Node.js TODAY.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
