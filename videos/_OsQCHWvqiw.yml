description: "Google Tech Talk\nNovember 4, 2015\n(click \"show more\" for more info)\nPresented by Lisa Maurer\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA meta-analysis of countless studies reveals that technology alone does not enhance learning. It is the fundamental Learner Experience (LX) design principles, which when implemented well, can promote more effective and efficient learning. In this Tech Talk, we’ll draw upon a variety of sources to include evidence-based learning design principles, and usability guidelines, which are part of a comprehensive research-based approach to learning design. A set of heuristics which set the stage for making a measurable impact on learning will be presented, and the intersection between instructional design, user experience research and participatory design will be explored.\n\nSpeaker Info:\n\nLisa Maurer- Lisa has always been fascinated with the learning process, particularly within digital environments. This began during her teaching career when her use of educational technology led to startling reading growth for her students, and continued as she applied rigorous instructional design principles to the development of digital military training programs. This range of experiences has shaped her approach to managing a variety of Human Computer Interaction research activities within the Product Design Research & Efficacy Center at Pearson Education. Lisa holds a B.S. in Sociology from Northern Arizona University, Post Baccalaureate teaching certification, and a Master’s in Educational Psychology from the University of Iowa."
