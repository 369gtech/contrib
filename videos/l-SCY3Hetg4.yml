description: "HTML emails are a time capsule for the web. Tables for layout and inline styles abound. You can't even use JavaScript. Or can you? AMP for email is a project by the AMP Project to bring interactivity to emails. We'll take a look at what this means for email development, the abilities it affords us in progressively enhancing our communications and demonstrate how to build an interactive email live. Is this the future of email or a really bad idea? Together we'll work it out.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
