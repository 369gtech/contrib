description: "We live in an era of extraordinary increases in available bandwidth, disk space, and processing power, and an ever faster growing World Wide Web. Now, the Web is about to take a gigantic leap forward when it comes to Web communication and connectivity, a leap that will go very fast and most likely take the established World of Legacy Web solutions by surprise. We have already felt the beginnings of change; the Web is moving into its next phase morphing from a static and stale network to a live, interactive, and constantly changing mesh of communication and connectivity, a living Web. This new living Web will allow us to interact with our friends and colleagues at levels we couldn't have imagined 5 years ago, solve business problems that seemed impossible, continue to innovate using the Web as a foundation for new solutions benefiting humanity, accessing systems and share information at levels never seen before. The Web as we know it today was only the beginning, now the Web will change everything.\n\nAt the forefront of this (r)evolution is HTML5 and some of the new communication features associated with this new Web standard. Features that makes it possible for Web applications to be on par, or even exceed traditional desktop applications while at the same time reduce the burden on our Web middle-tier. This session will explore what is possible and how we might rethink our approach to Web architecture.\n\nPeter is a Developer Advocate for Kaazing, a software company enhancing the way business and customers communicate across the Web using the new HTML5 WebSocket standard. Peter works closely with the developer community to architect and deploy the best possible web communication solutions. Before joining Kaazing, in various product management leadership roles Peter was responsible for Oracle's portal product strategy. Peter is a frequent speaker at conferences and industry events, such as JavaOne, Oracle OpenWorld, and various user group meetings, and is the co-author of the Oracle WebCenter 11g Handbook. Peter is currently busy co-authoring The Definitive Guide to HTML5 WebSocket book, published by Apress.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
