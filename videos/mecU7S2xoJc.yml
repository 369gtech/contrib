description: "Google Tech Talks\nDecember, 12 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nShawn Frayne, a 28 year old inventor based in Mountain View, will talk about his wind belt. This is a power generation device, that is low cost and consists of a membrane that resonates like a guitar string, with a pair of magnets that oscillate between coils.\n\nThere was a story recently in Popular Mechanics - watch the video at:\nhttp://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4224763.html?series=37\n\nSpeaker: Shawn Frayne\nShawn is the inventor of the core wind generator technology on which Humdinger is founded. Previous to his involvement with Humdinger, Shawn successfully matured two technologies, in the fields of \"green\" packaging and water disinfection, from concepts into developed products in pre-production. He established a strong intellectual property base surrounding those technologies and in early 2006 sold substantial rights to a Fortune 500 company. He is presently involved with refining the manufacturing processes of those products in facilities that have been built overseas.\n\nHe is also part of an on-going effort established four years ago at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop low-cost technologies by which entrepreneurs in Haiti can transform agricultural wastes into saleable cooking fuel.\n\nShawn has six pending U.S. patents. He has his Bachelor of Science in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
