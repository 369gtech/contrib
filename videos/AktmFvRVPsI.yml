recordingDate: 1526553720
description: "Over the past few years there have been a series of breakthroughs in machine learning that have lead to significant increases in AI capabilities. This has lead to several amazing technologies like machines that can drive cars, detect emotions, and diagnose diseases. These advances are largely the result of deep-learning algorithms like deep neural networks.\n\nIn this session, we’ll learn what deep learning is and why it is so important to the future of the software industry. We’ll learn about the current capabilities of deep-learning systems and their predicted future capabilities. In addition, we’ll learn about the tools that allow us to create deep-learning models like TensorFlow, Torch, and the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit."
