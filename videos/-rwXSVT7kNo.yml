description: "Commercial products for interacting with CAN can be pricey and not easily extensible. Some good open source hardware are very often out of stock by distributors. ChupaCarBrah is a Python based device for sending and receiving CAN messages from your vehicle that requires just a BeagleBone Blue and some wiring.\n\nWe cover how to build a device 100% based on open source software and hardware. It makes it more affordable, and easy to use/extend. It is designed for newcomers to the car hacking community, and also for more seasoned hackers that will be able to leverage a single board computer attached to the car's CAN bus. As an example on how to extend it, we show how to use cellular LTE network to exfiltrate all the OBDII/CAN and GPS data to the cloud. It is pretty useful specially for remotely monitoring the car, and also for online training and/or virtual meetings. All source code and detailed instructions on how to install, assemble and use the device are shared on Github and Hackster.io."
