description: "SweetXheart is a video game about race, gender, and micro-aggressions. Itâ€™s also a native JavaScript-based web game with a handmade dialogue system. In this talk, Catt discusses how she designed and built this extensive game over the span of five years using a JavaScript framework called Phaser and a dynamic data platform called Google Sheets. Attendees will leave the talk with an expanded idea of the potential of web-based software.\n\nCatt Small\nSenior Product Designer, Etsy\nhttps://twitter.com/cattsmall\nhttps://github.com/cattsmall\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
