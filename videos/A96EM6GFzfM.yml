title: 'Paul Bakker - Modularity in the cloud -- Deploying large scale OSGi applications'
recordingDate: 1391770111
description: "Bio:\n\nPaul Bakker is a software architect for Luminis Technologies. His current focus is on building modular enterprise applications and the cloud. Paul believes that modularity and the cloud are the two main challenges we have to deal with to bring technology to the next level, and is working on making this possible for mainstream software development. Today, he is working on educational software focused on personalized learning for high school students in the Netherlands. Paul is an active contributor on open source projects such as Amdatu, Apache ACE, and Bndtools, and is a member of the OSGi Enterprise Expert Group. He is also co-author of the book \"Modular Cloud Apps with OSGi\" recently published by O'Reilly. He has experience as a trainer on Java-related technology and is a regular speaker at conferences like JavaOne, Devoxx, and Jfokus. He was awarded the JavaOne 2012 Rock Star Speaker award.\n\n\nPresentation:\n\nDeploying applications in the cloud mean a lot of new possibilities but also challenges. Modular applications bring even greater deployment flexibility. In this session, you will learn how to use basic infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to enable autoscaling and automated failover and recovery and how to deal with hot, zero-downtime updates. The speaker has been doing this in a large project for the past two years. In the presentation, he will share his experiences in using an open source OSGi-based development and runtime stack. You will learn about scalable modular architecture and how to deploy this using Apache ACE, an open source provisioning server that takes care of distributing bundles to targets such as cloud servers."
