title: 'YOW! Data 2021 - Jennifer Marsman - Using AI to Mine Unstructured Research Papers to Fight COVID-19'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628827940
description: "There is an overwhelming amount of information (and misinformation) about COVID-19. How can we use AI to better understand this disease? In this session, we take an open dataset of research papers on COVID-19 and apply several machine learning techniques (name entity recognition of medical terms, finding semantically similar words, contextual summarization, and knowledge graphs) which can help first responders and medical professionals better find and make sense of the research they need. We will dive into the techniques used and share the code repository, so developers will walk away with the understanding of how to build a similar solution using Cognitive Search.\n\nJennifer Marsman is a Principal Software Development Engineer in Microsoft’s Developer Experience group, where she educates developers on Microsoft’s new technologies with a focus on data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In this role, Jennifer is a frequent speaker at software development conferences around the world. In 2016, Jennifer was recognized as one of the “top 100 most influential individuals in artificial intelligence and machine learning” by Onalytica. She has been featured in Bloomberg for her work using EEG and machine learning to perform lie detection. In 2009, Jennifer was chosen as “Techie whose innovation will have the biggest impact” by X-OLOGY for her work with GiveCamps, a weekend-long event where developers code for charity. She has also received many honors from Microsoft, including the “Best in Role” award for Technical Evangelism, Central Region Top Contributor Award, Heartland District Top Contributor Award, DPE Community Evangelist Award, CPE Champion Award, MSUS Diversity & Inclusion Award, Gold Club, and Platinum Club. Prior to becoming a Developer Evangelist, Jennifer was a software developer in Microsoft’s Natural Interactive Services division. In this role, she earned two patents for her work in search and data mining algorithms. Jennifer has also held positions with Ford Motor Company, National Instruments, and Soar Technology. Jennifer holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering and Master’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Her graduate work specialized in artificial intelligence and computational theory.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit, www.yowconference.com.au"
