title: 'Eliminating Hidden Dangers to Your Applications  Patterns for Reliable Systems - Barry Stahl'
language: English
recordingDate: 1640011118
description: "There is a danger lurking in every system that hasn't taken explicit steps to eliminate it. This under-recognized data killer can cause inconsistencies in your system which can be as difficult to find as they are to correct. Fortunately, recognizing this monster is easy, and there are a number of great techniques you can use to keep it away for good.\nIn this talk, we will learn about the Dual-Writes anti-pattern: how to spot it, and what to do to avoid it. In doing so, we'll discuss several well-known patterns that when implemented in your microservices architecture, can help prevent the difficult errors often caused by dual-writes so you can spend more time at awesome conferences and less time supporting your applications. We'll review a number of examples in C#, including demonstrations using SQL Server, Cosmos DB and Kafka.\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/"
