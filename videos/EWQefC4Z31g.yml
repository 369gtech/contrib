description: "Nicolai Plum, Booking.com Ltd\n\nAbstract: \nThis talk will discuss the different orthogonal axes that data storage systems scale up along. Storage system designs can grow successfully in one or more of read rate, write rate, data size and data complexity. They cannot grow in all of these directions; modern highly scalable storage systems are a compromise. This talk will discuss the restrictions of hardware that force the need for smart software, then describe how to scale up an RDBMS and NoSQL datastores. It will cover strong and weak points of a variety of system architectures with examples of how they succeeded and failed in operational use, as well as the types of solution that can be applied to solve challenges in organisational objectives that need scalability along particular axes.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
