In addition, he shows how to leverage the Web Performance API in conjunction with browser dev tools, and how to use it for performance monitoring to prevent performance regressions.\n\nBio:\nDan is the Performance Tech Lead at Wix.com, responsible for making over 100 million sites hosted on the Wix platform load and execute faster.
