recordingDate: 1510239616
description: 'CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is well known for its LHC particle accelerator, and the discovery of the Higgs particle. Unsurprisingly, innovation in Engineering and Information Technology are key to its success; technologies, such as Computing Grids, the World-Wide-Web, and capacitive touch screens all began at CERN. In this presentation, Derek Mathieson will give an introduction to CERN from an IT perspective. After more than 25 years working at CERN, Derek will share his unique insights of this extraordinary organization at the heart of Europe.'
