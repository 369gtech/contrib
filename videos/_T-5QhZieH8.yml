description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nThreat Modelling: Securing Kubernetes Infrastructure & Deployments - Rowan Baker, ControlPlane \n\nSecurity teams are often the last to know about an installation of Kubernetes, and are frequently concerned by its adoption. They have every right to be: poorly architected clusters can easily become exposed to unexpected threats, compromised by hostile workloads, or impossible to maintain.  It doesn’t have to be this way! This talk details mechanisms for architecting Kubernetes securely in regulated organisations, and shares lessons learnt threat modelling with the CNCF Financial User Group including:  - How to use threat modelling to secure clusters and workloads  - Real-world examples of Kubernetes deployments, and multi-tenant security architectures from financial services  - Where to apply controls to layer defence in depth  - Using compliance standards to satisfy security teams  - How to integrate Kubernetes with a global SOC  - Gotchas, common threats, and advanced mitigations\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeow"
