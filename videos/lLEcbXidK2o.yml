description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nMemory safety in C++ remains largely unresolved. A technique usually called \"memory tagging\" may dramatically improve the situation if implemented in hardware with reasonable overhead. \n\nIn this talk we will discuss three implementations of memory tagging. One is SPARC ADI, a full hardware implementation. Another is HWASAN, a partially hardware-assisted compiler-based tool for AArch64. Last but not least, ARM MTE, a recently announced hardware extension for AArch64. We describe the basic idea, evaluate the three implementations, and explain how they improve memory safety. We'll pay extra attention to memory tagging as a security mitigation.\n\nIf you know what AddressSanitizer (ASAN) is, think of Memory Tagging as of \"Low-overhead ASAN on steroids in hardware\". \n\nThis talk is based on the paper \"Memory Tagging and how it improves C/C++ memory safety\".\n— \nKostya Serebryany, Google\nSoftware Engineer\n\nKonstantin (Kostya) Serebryany is a Software Engineer at Google. His team develops and deploys dynamic testing tools, such as AddressSanitizer and ThreadSanitizer. Prior to joining Google in 2007, Konstantin spent 4 years at Elbrus/MCST working for Sun compiler lab and then 3 years at Intel Compiler Lab. Konstantin holds a PhD from mesi.ru and a Master from msu.ru. \n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
