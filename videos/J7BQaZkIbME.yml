title: 'Developer Joy!  Create Java applications with Quarkus - Syed M Shaaf (Jfokus Brown Bag series)'
recordingDate: 1632990023
description: "Developer Joy! Create Java applications, easier, simpler and faster with Quarkus, Syed M Shaaf\n\nYou can deploy your applications to Kubernetes; that's great! You can have pipelines and a breadth of tools to do analysis, etc. But what about how you develop and what you develop, and finally, how you interact with applications deployed in Kubernetes while in the development inner loop. How can that be done easier, simpler, faster? Java has been there for a long time, and all of us have ways to develop applications and tools that we all love. So how does Quarkus do any of this differently?\n\nLive coding, adding functionality, extensions without restarting, spinning up dev services e.g., databases, making coding and testing easier and continuous, enhancing the inner loop, etc. In this talk, I will create an application from scratch with Quarkus, add databases to it, use streaming with Kafka, etc. And finally, debug it while it's deployed in Kubernetes using my dev machine and effectively live code remotely. Join this talk to learn about the Java developers journey to developer Joy!\n\nRecorded Tuesday 18 May 2021 12:00"
