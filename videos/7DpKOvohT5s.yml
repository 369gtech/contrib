description: "Fun Hacks and Cool JavaScript:  The Advanced Techniques Behind the Google AJAX API Playground - Ben Lisbakken\r\n\r\nFor those who are attending Google I/O 2009(http://code.google.com/io/), these video are an opportunity to hear from some of the speakers in advance. The speakers introduce their topic and provide a preview of one or more topics that will be covered in their talks.\r\n\r\nIn this session, learn advanced Javascript, why App Engine is so easy to develop on, protecting from XSRF vulnerabilities, cutting the load time of your app in half, and hear about general client-side web app techniques. These lessons are taught in the context of the design and development of the AJAX API Playground (http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground/), a tool which can help developers learn about and experiment with many of Google's APIs."
