description: "RubyHack 2019 - Using Tests as a Tool to Wrangle Legacy Projects by Jason Swett\n\nMost of the production projects we developers work on are, to some extent, legacy projects. Legacy project work is often characterized by painfully low development velocity, scary deployments, frequent bugs and outages, and less-than-thrilled stakeholders. It's not a lot of fun. Fortunately it's possible to mitigate the pains of maintaining a legacy project. Automated tests can be used as a tool to permanently fix bugs, speed up development velocity and turn deployments into a non-event."
