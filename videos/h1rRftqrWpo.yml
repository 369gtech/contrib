description: "http://www.erlang-factory.com/berlin2016/dave-cottlehuber\n\nAt iwantmyname we are migrating a complex perl app to a mix of Erlang/OTP and Elixir. This talk explains how we design & operate our system to be both loosely coupled and reasonably redundant, both at the application layer, and also at the infrastructure layer. You'll see how we deploy and manage production BEAM code, learn about designing real-world OTP applications, & have a whirlwind tour of monitoring and managing it in production with open source tools.\n\nTalk Objectives\n\nHelp people to understand how to deploy & manage Erlang & Elixir to production, architecting both infrastructure and OTP for reliability.\n\nTalk Audience\n\ndev/ops/architects"
