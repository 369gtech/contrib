language: English
recordingDate: 1639062000
description: "In the AI Development 101 whiteboard series, David Carmona, General Manager, Microsoft AI & Innovation, explains the key concepts behind AI technologies - all the way from the basics of machine learning to the most advanced concepts  like massive AI models trained in AI supercomputers.  In episode 3, we will explore classification algorithms, and we will go deeper in the most popular algorythm for classification: the logistic regression. We'll see the basic math behind this fundamental algorythm, and we will learn how to train a model with it from scratch. \n\nTo learn more about AI and Innovations at Microsoft with David Carmona, please visit https://www.microsoft.com/AI/introduction-to-AI-with-david-carmona?OCID=AI101_Ep3_FY22Q2_omc_Tech_yt.\n\nAdditional MS Learn Resources:  \n\nMachine learning 101: Other algorithms\n• https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/create-machine-learn-models/?WT.mc_id=academic-51695-cxa\n• https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-regression-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/?WT.mc_id=academic-51695-cxa\n• https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/understand-regression-machine-learning/?WT.mc_id=academic-51695-cxa"
