description: "We need to get our laser weapon to intersect with the floor, so we do a line plane intersection to simulate that. We use a trick involving vector projection to develop a super fast way of calculating the intersection.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/line-plane-intersection\n\nQuestion?
