recordingDate: 1571334935
description: "In this talk, we'll look at how one goes about modernizing a .NET Framework application using the rich tooling available on Azure DevOps. We'll successfully migrate a monolithic app from a classic IIS environment to .NET Core with microservices, leveraging Pivotal Application Service for Windows running on Azure Cloud. Along the way, we'll address topics like:\n\n-pluggable components using Azure DevOps Artifacts\n\n-things to avoid when going cloud-native\n\n-how to be successful with Pivotal’s Swift Method of monolith decomposition\n\n-build and deployment automation with Azure Pipelines\n\n-how to address an app’s dependencies that won't be modernized but still must be a part of the modernized app\n\n-creating a cookbook to minimize duplicate efforts\n\nAttendees will leave with an understanding of what a PAS/Azure DevOps app modernization strategy looks like and will have the building blocks to begin their own strategy.\n\nSpeakers: Shawn Neal, Principal Solutions Architect, Pivotal; Jason Stevens, Senior Software Engineer, Microsoft\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/net-application-modernization-with-pas-and-azure-devops"
