Online training for 4 weeks with live instructor coaching, really helped me clear my concepts otherwise I would have been lost in the PMBOK. Instructor led Weekend morning classes with mock test at the end of each module is really helpful. Ofcourse just the classes is not enough to crack the exam you have to prepare from the PMBOK. I am highly satisfied with the study material, excellent instructor and extensive mock test that they have put up. I would recommend people to take the PMP course from www.edureka.co”"
