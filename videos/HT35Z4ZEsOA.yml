title: 'Wix Engineering Podcast, episode 10: Performance, Bundles and Headaches: Optimizing Your Code'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614611130
description: "When members of his analytics team began noticing long load times in the Wix Dashboard, originally, Eyal Eizenberg wasn’t quite sure why. When taking a closer look at the code he realized what was wrong: a progress bar--a minor, largely superficial feature that happened to be weighing down the entire app. Turns out Eyal’s problem is common to all web developers (even those who don’t realize it).\n \nIn this episode, we’ll talk with Eyal and Addy Osmani --Engineering Manager at Google --to learn how developers optimize their code and avoid major headaches."
