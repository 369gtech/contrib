description: "When we talk about automation in software development, we immediately think of automated builds and deployments. We may also be using scripts to help make our daily work easier. But this is actually just the beginning. This presentation shows you how leading developers are using tools and scripts for automating much more. They’ve got \"robots\" for monitoring production servers, reviewing code, setting up laptops—and even automating daily stand-ups. Automation helps us avoid having to do the same thing twice, helps us work better together, and frees up time to write production code. Plus, as it turns out, spending time on automation is fun! Even if it saves you just half an hour a week, this session will be a beneficial investment of your time.\n\nSpeaker:\nSven Peters, Evangelist, Atlassian\nSven is a software geek working as an Evangelist for Atlassian. He started with Java development in 1998 and has been programming for longer that he'd like to admit. Besides coding his passion is effective software development, keeping developers motivated, and helping them kick-ass. Sven has extensive speaking experience in 20+ countries on myriad topics."
