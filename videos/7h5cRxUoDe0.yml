description: 'A genuine drama based on a true story! We’ll showcase the consistent tests that we did to get the product to the point where we envisioned it to be. It will be a sincere talk about the issues we faced while maintaining several competing KPIs, and the challenge to keep an open mind after several iterations. We’ll also share some practical examples of how changing copy and moving pixels can dramatically influence the behavior of users.'
