title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: The Collaborative Content Audit'
recordingDate: 1523550025
description: "A content audit is the basis for ensuring great user experience. It helps align your organizationâ€™s brand, message, and objectives with the needs and expectations of your site visitor. It lays the groundwork for the site architecture, content model, and page layouts. It addresses content ownership and the content creation process.\n\nIn our agency, the content audit consists of two phases. In phase one, we do a deep dive into the available content, including analytics, meta, and tone. In phase two, we work with our clients collaboratively to determine what to keep, modify, or cut, as well as identify what is missing. We discuss content governance, consistency, and brand alignment.\n\nIn this session, you will learn how to conduct a content audit and what to do with the results. You will discover some of the tools that can help you to analyze your website. You will understand how the insights you gain can feed into the core model process; taxonomy and sitemap development; and content modeling. You will then see how to tie the audit to the needs of content creators, and how to think about sustainable content. You will come away with a full picture of how a content audit drives the website design process, and results in more than just an inventory."
