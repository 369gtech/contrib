description: "We are going to release a tool for automated runtime memory analysis for mobile apps (IOS & Android). All the existing tools are not working with runtime memory analysis processes preferring to dump and analyze memory after app finish it’s execution.\n\n\n\nOur idea is to gather information during runtime to be able to track changes of the state and application behavior with the final goal being to simplify reverse engineering of obfuscated code. We also made a single interface to manage this process and automated some most common checks that should be done during penetration test.\n\n\n=== \n\n\nIgor is a huge fan of information security since high school. My interests cover things like bug hunting, penetration testing, social engineering, red team, security research, but I’m also interested in building things to destroy things. I am a security researcher at one of the best pentest teams in Russia. Also I was in organizers committee of ZeroNights 2018 in Russia.\n\n\n\n--- \n\n\nEgor is a huge fan of mobile security. Penetration tester. Open source lover."
