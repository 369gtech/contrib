description: "PyData NYC/Miami/Philly joint virtual meetup - September 16, 2020\n\nHugo Bowne-Anderson \nEstablishing a Healthy Data Culture\n\nIt’s time we started treating data science like the social discipline it is. In this talk, I’ll highlight the challenges faced by organizations attempting to become more data-driven, along with those that have already established data cultures, and propose key moving parts that need to be in place for successful data-driven transformations.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
