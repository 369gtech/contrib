recordingDate: 1463006082
description: "For years we’ve talked about separating content and presentation. Structure, reuse, and standardization are the name of the game in a future-friendly, multi-channel world — aesthetics are someone else’s concern … right?\n\nIs it really possible to keep the two separate? Layout, stylistic choices, art direction, and other trappings of “presentation” are all important part of your communications arsenal. In this session, we’ll explore through the best ways to re-integrate design and editorial without sacrifice well-structured content. In particular, we’ll focus on:\n\nTechniques that can bring nuance and variation to template-driven web sites\nStress-reducing ways to model and manage “design decisions” without sacrificing clean, reusable editorial content\nBaby steps towards structured content for projects that can't sacrifice high-touch design"
