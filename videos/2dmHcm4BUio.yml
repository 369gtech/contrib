title: 'But there is no web component for that! by Horacio Gonzalez'

description: "When start working with Web Components, you are often drawn to webcomponents.org site, surprised and delighted to see the number of available custom elements (and their quality). It's a nice phase, you choose your custom elements, gather them, and build your app like if you were working with LEGO bricks.\n\nThen you begin to get more proficient with Web Components, writing more complex apps, with exotic features, and sooner or later you will be face to a feature for which there is no available component. Or better said, for which there is no web component yet... because you are going to write it!\n\nIn this talk we show how to easily transform a JS library in a web component by wrapping the library with a Polymer envelope, and how that element will be as simple to use as any other component of the catalog. And in order to do it, I'm going to use two real life custom elements that I wrote to use in the Devoxx Lead Scan app.\n\n# Horacio Gonzalez\nSpaniard lost in Brittany, unconformist coder, Java craftsman, dreamer and all-around geek.
