description: "GitOps, an Elegant Tool for Hybrid Cloud Kubernetes\n\nRyan Cook, Red Hat, Inc.\n\nApplication management, migration, and portability is difficult. Through the use of GitOps, we can ensure that a consistent experience is delivered whether the application and objects are deployed on a single Kubernetes cluster or multiple clusters all over the world.\n\nIn this presentation, you'll learn through a series of live demonstrations how to deploy, manage, and migrate applications between three clusters spread across the United States. After the session, you will have a better understanding of managing resources and objects that will be under revision control, resilient, and automatically deployed.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
