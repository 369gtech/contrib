description: "Since it’s beginnings, our vision for YourGrocer was to create a company where the founders didn’t have the final say on everything, and where anyone could take an idea forward to shape our product. We have iterated through many models, but one thing hasn’t changed. All the company votes every two weeks to decide our short term roadmap\n\nI will talk about the process that we use and the benefits and challenges of the model. Attendees will be able to understand how it practically works and how it enables every one in the company to behave like a product owner and be innovative on the areas they work on.\n\nI will not only describe the current model, but the journey and iterations of it that led us to where we are now. That means attendees will also have an understanding of the challenges and roadblocks we have faced in the past, and the trade offs we had to accept in order to establish this process.\n\nFrancisco is a software developer by trade, jack of all trades by practice. Having been in the IT industry for more than 10 years, he has worked in software projects across diferent countries as a consultant at ThoughtWorks, helping teams with technology and product development.\n\nHe is currently one of the directors at YourGrocer, trying to hold the computers together while groceries are being delivered.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
