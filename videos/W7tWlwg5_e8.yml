description: "Adding AI to a web application need not involve complexity, managing large datasets, or learning advanced math. With Lobe.ai, you can create an image recognition model by using a friendly UI, and import it into a web project. Join us as Jen Looper shows off Lobe.ai, a free service, and how to create a project. She'll walk through how to create an app which can act as a guide to make smart decisions on what to feed your pets, so even if Fido begs for that chocolate bar, you know not to allow even one taste!\n\nLearn more!\n\nComputer vision on Microsoft Azure: https://aka.ms/WebWed/ComputerVision"
