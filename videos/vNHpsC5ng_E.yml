description: "Code is Here: http://goo.gl/jaonq\n\nBest Design Patterns Book : http://goo.gl/W0wyie\n\nSupport me on Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/derekbanas\n\nHere I begin my design patterns video tutorial. I have talked a great deal about OOP design principles in the past. I've shown you how to turn requirements into a UML diagram. Then I covered how to turn a UML diagram into a class.\n\nThis tutorial will start off by revisiting OOP concepts. I'll also provide answers to the most common questions I receive. \n\nBy the end, you'll be able to use design patterns to solve common software design problems."
