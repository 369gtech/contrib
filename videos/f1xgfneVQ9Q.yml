description: "Love it or hate it, advertising is currently a main source of revenue for many websites. But digital advertising is a complicated space that not many developers understand.\nIf you'd like to understand the ad code on your site better, if your ad ops team has been talking about header bidding, or if you're just curious about how ads work, this is the talk for you. I'll give an overview of how programmatic advertising works, what header bidding is, explain some common tools and libraries, and address some common misconceptions and complaints about ads.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
