Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWho Killed My Pod? #Whodunit - Suneeta Mall, Nearmap\n\nA few weeks ago, we deployed a brand new thoroughly tested, and profiled application onto a self-managed Kubernetes cluster. Suffice to say, all hell broke loose. The pods were getting OOMKilled with error code 137 left and right. This sparked a massive crime scene investigation and some interesting insights were discovered. In this Kube-CSI [crime scene investigation] episode, we will talk about exactly whodunit, why, and the fix!"
