description: "As more mainstream IT organizations adopt Kubernetes and cloud-native application architectures, they often identify as one of their main concerns the ability to do so securely. (Interestingly, this almost precisely matches concerns about adopting virtual machine architectures fifteen years ago.) In this session users will be guided through the domain of security concerns, starting from system hardware up through the operating system stack, Kubernetes itself, and applications deployed on it, as well as some of the tools used to address the issues.\n\nPresenters:\nRoger Klorese, Senior Product Manager @SUSE\nDanny Sauer, Senior Software Engineer @SUSE"
