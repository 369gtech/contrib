language: English
recordingDate: 1604369394
description: "DevOps is here to stay, and the terminology and concepts involved are now permeating the market. New products have been launched right and left that promise the benefits of DevOps - operational efficiency improvements and ultimately faster delivery timelines. Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery/Deployment and Build Pipelines that accelerate every step of the Software Development Life Cycle are all advertised as idyllic solutions, but for exactly what problems? During this session, Melissa will take a step back and answer the question that should be at the top of your mind: What is the problem we are trying to solve? She will discuss, from a developer's perspective, the considerations you should take in order to effectively incorporate DevOps concepts into your existing environment. You will come away with a solid understanding of why these concepts are important, how to steer clear of the hype, and how to make the promised benefits of DevOps a reality for your team.\n\nAdditional Resources:\nImplement CI/CD with Azure DevOps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/implement-ci-cd-azure-devops/?WT.mc_id=events_jdconf\nEvolve Your DevOps Practices: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices/?WT.mc_id=events_jdconf\nBuild Java Apps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/java?view=azure-devops&viewFallbackFrom=azure-devops%3FWT.mc_id%3Devents_jdconf"
