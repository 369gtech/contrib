description: "As a developer, you usually have detailed designs, wireframes, mockups, and other documents by the time you start working on a website. But even with that start, you often have to make decisions that will affect the usability of the finished site, such as choosing appropriate input types, maximizing performance, and including accessibility features. Learn to think like a user and uncover usability problems that might not be apparent at first glance. Hear some tips to make your site more usable and accessible. User experience isnâ€™t just for designers to think about: everyone who works on a website has the opportunity to make the user experience better. Even little changes can make a big difference.\n\nClarissa Peterson\nhttps://twitter.com/clarissa\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
