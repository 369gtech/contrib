description: "Depression Memes for Devops Teens: Self-Care for Server Janitors and Other Humans\n\nAnirudh Ra\n\nContent warning: depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, domestic violence, abuse. This talk also contains language that some viewers may find objectionable.\n\nCome listen to Anirudh Ra get real and talk about his journey through mental health and Production Engineering / Site Reliability Engineering. He'll share his failures and the lessons he learned, the mistakes he made and the tools he collected in order to work and live better, the times when his toes were stepped on and the times when he stepped on toes.\n\nAnirudh will also talk about living with neurodivergence in and out of the workplace. There will be a bunch of advice for noobs as well as advice for people who are managing, leading, or mentoring noobs. This will be focused on self-care, mental health, time management, life-work balance, emotional burnout... You get the drift. Remember the salt: if you have met one neurodivergent person, you have met ONE neurodivergent person. Treat everyone on a case-by-case basis. YMMV.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
