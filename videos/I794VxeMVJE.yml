title: 'KEYNOTE: Unlocking the next wave of applications with Stream Processing - Stephan Ewen'
recordingDate: 1563217722
description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nStream Processing as helped to turn many monolithic database-centric applications into fast, scalable, and flexible real time applications. However, there are still entire classes of applications that are built against databases, because today's streaming processing model is not yet rich enough to support these applications.\nWe present what we believe is still missing in today's stream processing models, and how we envision to evolve stream processing for the next wave of application to be able to move to a stream processing architecture.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
