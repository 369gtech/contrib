description: "Debugging Cloud Foundry Apps: Via Service Mesh, Open Tracing - Idit Levine, Solo.io\n\nThe mainstreaming of containerization and microservices is raising a critical question by both developers and operators: how do we debug all this?\n\nDebugging microservices applications is a difficult task. The state of the application is spread across multiple microservices, and it is hard to get a holistic view of the state of the application. Currently debugging of microservices is assisted by openTracing, which helps in tracing of a transaction or workflow for post-mortem analysis, and linkerd and itsio which monitor the network to identify latency problems. These tools however, do not allow to monitor and interfere with the application during run time.\n\nIn this talk, we will describe and demonstrate common debugging techniques and we will introduce Squash, a new tool and methodology. \n\nAbout Idit Levine\nIdit Levine is the founder and CEO of solo.io, where she is aiming to streamline the cloud stack.\nPrior to founding solo.io, Idit was the CTO of the cloud management division at EMC and a member of its global CTO Office.\n\nAt EMC, Idit lead, designed and implemented project UniK, an open source platform for automating unikernels compilation and deployment and project layer-x, an open source framework for cross-cluster scheduling . At solo, Idit recently released Squash, an open source platform for debugging microservices applications."
