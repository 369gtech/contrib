description: "From the 2015 Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose, Michael Greene's keynote: \"Intel and the Role of Open Source in Delivering on the Promise of Big Data\".\n\nThe exponential growth of digitally stored data and the transition of data science from academia to real world applications hold the promise of improving nearly every aspect of our lives. Michael Greene’s talk will dive beneath the hype of “big data” and “analytics” to reveal what Intel is building with the open source community to ensure that all developers have the tools needed to change the world with Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. Intel’s vision is a horizontal, reusable and extensible architectural framework around these two big data cornerstones that supports many big data domains, facilitates simple integration of data science innovation and allows developers to focus on building the products and services that deliver the benefits and profits of big data analytics.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Intel.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop San Jose 2015: http://goo.gl/k9J3GB\nVisit the conference website to learn more: http://strataconf.com/big-data-conference-ca-2015/\nSubscribe to O’Reilly on YouTube! http://goo.gl/szEauh\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia\n\nAbout Michael Greene (Intel):\nMichael Greene is vice president of the Software and Services Group and general manager of System Technologies and Optimization at Intel Corporation.
