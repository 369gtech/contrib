description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nC++ is seen as a complex language to teach. There are many reasons to think that: the language if taken as a whole is huge, its complexity daunting.\n\nThat goes, to be honest, for many programming languages: programming is a complex and stimulating activity, and C++'s growth mirrors the fact that is has been used to solve complex problems in efficient ways.\n\nHowever, introducing C++ to beginners or to people coming from other languages is feasible, and is done every day. Amusingly, so-called \"modern\" C++ actually makes the language more approachable in many ways. Instead of starting with the traditional \"basics\" such as arrays and pointers, one can treat these as more advanced topics, and introduce the language through more contemporary abstractions.\n\nWhat this talk aims to do is to show, through comparisons of solutions written in C++ with solutions written in other languages (mainly C# and Java), how C++ can be used as an introductory language as easily as other reputedly-easier-on-beginners languages, while still paving the way for the introduction of reputedly-more-difficult features.\n— \nPatrice Roy\nUniversité de Sherbrooke\nProfessor\nSherbrooke (Québec), Canada\n\nPatrice Roy has been playing with C++, either professionally, for pleasure or (most of the time) both for over 25 years. After a few years doing R&D and working on military flight simulators, he moved on to academics and has been teaching computer science since 1998. Since 2005, he’s been involved more specifically in helping graduate students and professionals from the fields of real-time systems and game programming develop the skills they need to face today’s challenges. The rapid evolution of C++ in recent years has made his job even more enjoyable. He’s been a participating member in the ISO C++ Standards Committee since late 2014 and has been involved with the ISO Programming Language Vulnerabilities Committee since late 2015. He has five kids, and his wife ensures their house is home to a continuously changing number of cats, dogs and other animals.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
