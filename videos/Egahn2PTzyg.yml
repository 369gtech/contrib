Pre-written user stories, pizzas and fizzy drinks in, code out - but the truth is that every single one of us has so much more to offer than this. Escaping this mentality, and bringing our full set of talents and creativity to the table, can make a great impact, be immensely fulfilling, and really launch us to new possibilities in our careers.\n\nThere are also very real opportunities and threats in the modern job market - if all we offer is code, then there are ever more people who will do this for less and less money. We need to get ahead of the game, and go beyond this minimum, or risk obsolescence.\n\nThis will mean going outside your comfort zone, and thinking differently - but the pay-off can be huge! I want to share some my experiences from making this transition, and some ideas for how to make the first steps in breaking down the preconceptions and barriers, and starting the journey.\n\nRichard Wellum From Richard Wellum Software Ltd\nI've been in software for about a decade now, originally from an engineering background. I like to work out what's really needed, and solve those needs - with or without software. I progressed through technical roles, mostly building distributed architecture, but am also fascinated by process and getting the most from teams - I believe architecture and process have a vital overlap, and this is where I try to operate, helping software teams to get results."
