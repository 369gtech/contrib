description: "Skilling Up: How to Effectively Grow a Cloud Foundry Organization - Steve Greenberg, Resilient Scale\n\nCloud Foundry is a large and complex ecosystem. Coupled with modern, cloud-native development approaches, the amount of information a developer (or operator) must learn is staggering. Because of this, enterprises face significant challenges when growing teams and capabilities at scale. The old methods simply do not work.This talk will help enterprises understand how to best skill up teams to be effective cloud native developers and/or operators on Cloud Foundry. This talk does not focus on the specific tasks or curriculum, but rather the approach and methodology to building effective organizations. We will discuss the challenge, the shortcomings of traditional approaches, and how to best build lasting and scalable competency in Cloud Foundry and cloud-native.\n\nAbout Steve Greenberg\nSteve Greenberg is the Founder and CEO of Resilient Scale, a consultancy focused on building capabilities through collaboration, training and mentoring. He is a long time application developer and architect and a proponent of Spring & Cloud Foundry.

He lives in the mountains of Colorado and spends his free time skiing, mountain biking, fly fishing and making things in his workshop.\n\nSteve spoke at CF Summit in Santa Clara in 2017 and lead the microservices training in 2016, as well as at various meetups."
