Fortunately, we now have tools to help us find issues before they can manifest. Guided by Herb Sutter's paper on lifetime analysis, the Clang community has implemented new lifetime warnings which work on single statements. These warnings are only a subset of what is described in the paper, but they have no false positives and still catch important problems in your code. During this talk we will introduce you to the basic principles of the new warnings, share their results on open source projects, and show you tips and tricks on how to get the most out of these diagnostics both for library and application code authors. Spoiler alert: these warnings found bugs in very popular projects!\n— \nGábor Horváth\nEötvös Loránd University\nPhD Student\nGabor started a Ph.D. in 2016. He is a contributor to research projects related to static analysis since 2012. He is a clang contributor, participated in Google Summer of Code twice as a student and twice as a mentor, interned for Apple and Microsoft. He teaches C++ and compiler construction to undergrads at Eotvos Lorand University.\n\n\nMatthias Gehre\nSilexica GmbH\nSenior Software Architect\nCologne Area, Germany\n\nMatthias co-maintains the Clang-based implementation of Herb Sutter’s lifetime checks, available online at https://github.com/mgehre/llvm-project and godbolt.org. He is currently working as a Senior Software Architect at Silexica. With its headquarters in Germany and offices in the US and Japan, Silexica provides development tooling to unleash the power of FPGAs from C/C++ applications. Matthias got his Ph.D. in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the University of Bremen, Germany. He loves tinkering with his home automation electronics.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
