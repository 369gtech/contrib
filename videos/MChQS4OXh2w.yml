description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/when-java-shops-grow-up-they-become-web-companies\n\nIt’s been a long journey to Cloud Native for the Java ecosystem. Over the last 10 years or so we watched as Web company after Web company ran into scaling and management challenges that led them to adopt Java-based platforms. Meanwhile the Big Data revolution has also largely been an open source Java phenomenon. And then there’s Android of course. Java has been reinvigorated by lessons from the web – in areas such as Continuous Integration, DevOps and Microservices. Today enterprise Java shops are bringing it all together, learning from the web, adopting Java technology that has been refactored and refreshed, and tooling up to become Web Companies. Java is going to drive organisations through digital transformations. This talk will look to bring the threads together about the Java renaissance and associated cultural change.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeaker: James Governor; Co-Founder, RedMonk."
