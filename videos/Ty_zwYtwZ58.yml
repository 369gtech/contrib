description: "Speaker: Dave Thomas\n\nA major dominant concern for most software development is how to increase the productivity of development; evolution and/or execution. Systemic change in process and/or technology seldom result in more than an incremental impact on productivity and ROI. Increased value is best achieved by targeting specific waste/opportunities in the value chain by introducing an innovative solution. In this talk, we describe 10 techniques that are effective in accelerating software development. We discuss how one identifies optimal change points to impact both new and legacy code.\n\nDave Thomas, Chief Scientist/CSO, Kx Systems, Co-Founder and past Chairman of Bedarra Research Labs (BRL), creators of the Ivy visual analytics workbench and ACM Distinguished Engineer. Founder and past CEO of Object Technology International (OTI), becoming CEO of IBM OTI Labs after its sale to IBM.\n \nWith a unique ability to see the future and translate research into competitive products, he is known for his contributions to Object Technology including IBM VisualAge and Eclipse IDEs, Smalltalk and Java virtual machines. Dave is founder and chairman of the YOW! Australia and Lambda Jam conferences, and is a GOTO Conference Fellow.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/yow-night-2017-singapore-dave-thomas-may-18-tickets-33806379792\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/7EXD/"
