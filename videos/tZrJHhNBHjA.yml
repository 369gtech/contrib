description: "by Shawn Tabrizi\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/substrate.webm\n\n\nSubstrate is an open-source framework which allows developers to easily create new, customizable blockchains. At its heart, Substrate is a combination of three technologies: WebAssembly, Libp2p and AfG Consensus. Substrate chains have three distinct features that make them \"next-generation\": a dynamic, self-defining state-transition function; light-client functionality from day one; and a progressive consensus algorithm with fast block production and adaptive, definite finality. The STF, encoded in WebAssembly, is known as the \"runtime\". This defines the execute_block function, and can specify everything from the staking algorithm, transaction semantics, logging mechanisms and procedures for replacing any aspect of itself or of the blockchainâ€™s state (\"governance\"). Because the runtime is entirely dynamic all of these can be switched out or upgraded at any time. A Substrate chain is very much a \"living organism\". \n\nSubstrate is being developed by Parity Technologies, a company who has build client software for multiple blockchains such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, and the upcoming Polkadot network. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:50:00+01"
