description: "Panel: The Microservices Stack: Are We There Yet? What’s Missing? - Moderated by Dormain Drewitz, Pivotal\n\nEvery so often, a new computing paradigm emerges. It causes ripple effects across many layers of technology. New categories of software and tools are invented. When the dust settles, a new stack has emerged. \n\nSpring Cloud Services stormed onto the scene in 2015. Cloud Foundry has since proven to be the ideal place to run these cloud-native Java apps. But has the dust fully settled? Microservices change the requirements for data, messaging, monitoring, API management, and more. Are vendors ready to support these requirements? How does the Cloud Foundry platform help with this? What remains an unsolved challenge? \n\nThis panel brings together: Kenny Bastani from a Spring developer perspective, Cornelia Davis and her work on the platform's data layer requirements, Ed Anuff from an API management perspective, and Alex Williams as an industry observer view. Moderated by Dormain Drewitz, this panel will debate what's real and what's not when it comes to the emerging microservices stack.\n\nAbout Dormain Drewitz\nDormain spent over five years as an investment analyst following infrastructure software, including Red Hat, IBM, Oracle, and numerous pre-IPO companies.
