Mostly, you can't and shouldn't do that. This presentation will show you another path. Youâ€™ll see how at Liefery, Tobias and his team have started with small steps instead of rewriting everything. This allowed them to reap the benefits earlier and get comfortable before getting deeper into it. In this talk, Tobias examines, in detail, the tactics they used to create two Elixir apps for new requirements, and how they integrated them with their existing Rails code base.\n\nJoin Tobias on his tale of adopting Elixir and Phoenix and see what the Liefery team learned, what they loved, and what bumps they hit along the road.\n\n\n-- Read the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2C7ac4s\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - TOBIAS PFEIFFER\nTech Lead at Liefery\n\nTobi is a clean coder, Full Stack developer, Benchmarker by passion, Rubyist, Elixir fan, learner, teacher and agile craftsman by passion. He organises the Ruby User Group Berlin, maintains Shoes and benchee as well as contributing to a variety of projects while thinking about new ideas to put into code and push boundaries.
