description: "Timothy B. Terriberry\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/61/\nLast year, various disparate open-source efforts to produce a royalty-free, next-generation video codec united to form the Alliance for Open Media. It boasts contributions from [Google's VP10](https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libvpx/+/nextgenv2), [Cisco's Thor project](https://github.com/cisco/thor), and [Xiph and Mozilla's Daala project](https://xiph.org/daala/), and industry partners such as Adobe, Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix, with hardware partners including AMD, ARM, Intel, and NVIDIA. We think this is our best chance yet to create a successful video codec that achieves wide deployment. \r\n\r\nThis talk will explain the directions the codec is taking, what we learned in the Daala project that we feel we can contribute, where we think we can improve over prior generations, and how far we've come to date. It is intended for an audience with a technical background who does not already have significant signal processing experience."
