description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary,  8 2008\n\nNIH awards more than $500M/yr for grants to researchers pursuing research in biomedical informatics. This includes computation, simulation, modeling, and, increasingly, work on storage, retrieval, curation, and analysis of massive amounts of data needed for biomedical research. Dr. Marron will outline the investment strategy for making awarding funds in this broad area of research.\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Michael Marron\nMike Marron is the director of the Biomedical Technology Division of the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). His group focuses on funding development and collaborative sharing of cutting-edge technologies ranging from new imaging techniques using advanced light sources (e.g. synchrotrons) to computational and networking infrastructure for integrative, multi-disciplinary science (e.g. http://www.nbirn.net/)."
