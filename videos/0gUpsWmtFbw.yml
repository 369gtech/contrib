title: 'Why I''ve to waste my time on cryptography by Andrea Pompili'
recordingDate: 1525690185
description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - Cryptography is a magic ring of darkness and mistiness, but seems that every time a new attack comes in town, technicians need to evaluate, configure or change something, surviving in the sea of the unawareness or following signals coming from misterious compliance regulations. We''ll try to give a little survival guide for this world, which can make us more aware and confident on the future, or at least prepare for the next fashionable attacks. Maybe.'
