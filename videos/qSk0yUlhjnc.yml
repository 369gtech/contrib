description: "Join us for a FREE Webinar on Android :http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course\n\nThis android tutorial talks about Broadcast Receivers in detail:\n\nBroadcast Receiver :\n------------------------------\n\nA broadcast receiver is a dormant component of the Android system. Only an Intent (for which it is registered) can bring it into action. The Broadcast Receiver's job is to pass a notification to the user, in case a specific event occurs.\n\nUsing a Broadcast Receiver, applications can register for a particular event. Once the event occurs, the system will notify all the registered applications.\n\nFor instance, a Broadcast receiver triggers battery Low notification that you see on your mobile screen.\nOther instances caused by a Broadcast Receiver are new friend notifications, new friend feeds, new message etc. on your Facebook app.\n\nIn fact, you see broadcast receivers at work all the time. Notifications like incoming messages, WiFi Activated/Deactivated message etc. are all real-time announcements of what is happening in the Android system and the applications.\n\nSecurity :\n--------------\n\nAs the broadcast receivers have a global work-space, security is very important concern here. If you do not define the limitations and filters for the registered receivers, other applications can abuse them. Here are a few limitations that might help:\n\n    Whenever you publish a receiver in your application's manifest, make it unavailable to external applications by using android: exported=\"false\". You might think that specifying Intent filters while publishing the receiver would do the task for you, when in reality they are not enough.\n    When you send a broadcast, it is possible for the external applications too to receive them. This can be prevented by specifying a few limitations.\n    Similarly, when you register your receiver using registerReceiver, any application may send it broadcasts. This can be prevented using permissions as well.\n\n(PS: As of Android 3.1, the Android system will not receive any external Intent, so the system is comparatively secure now.)\n\nRead More about Broadcast Receivers at :\n\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/android-tutorials-broadcast-receivers/\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \nhttp://www.edureka.co\n\nUse the link to watch all videos of this session :\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOHiWL2R-gYcF8oA4yPJKTNb"
