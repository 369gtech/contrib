description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nSince 2012, Google's C++ Library Team has published an essay/guidance series called the \"C++ Tip of the Week.\" Internally, this is used as a sort of secondary to the C++ Style Guide - while the style guide is roughly treated with the force of law, the TotW series is only \"very strong guidance.\" With the release of Abseil at last year's CppCon, we've begun re-publishing the relevant TotW entries on http://abseil.io/tips/. \n\nWe think this can serve a good purpose in the public C++ ecosystem. The Core Guidelines cover basically everything, and do a good job, but are often only a shallow summary of the topic at hand. Any given TotW, on the other hand, covers a relatively narrow topic in greater detail. \n\nThis talk will give a general overview of the series: it's major themes and most commonly cited entries. As such, this talk will hit on things like: understanding copy vs. move, how to use `emplace`, enums and producing readable APIs, how to construct a unique_ptr clearly, and how to structure your unittests.\n— \nJon Cohen\nSoftware Engineer, Google\nJon Cohen is an engineer at Google, maintaining our core common C++ libraries. He spends most of his days directing Google's robot army to rewrite its own source code to be more readable and efficient, and has so far managed to do so without accidentally creating Skynet.\n\nMatt Kulukundis\nStaff Software Engineer, Google\nMatt is a senior software engineer on the C++ libraries team at Google.  Prior to Google he has worked on compilers, machine learning, and underwater robotics.  In his free time, he scuba dives in warm places.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
