description: "Let's make a virtual reality game! Join Shanee Nishry for a live coding session using the Unity Cardboard SDK to create a virtual reality game. By the end of the session we will have a small yet fun \"defend the castle\" game with a terrifyingly cute enemy army and a player controlled cannon to fend off the attack. We'll explore stereoscopic rendering, user controls using input and the Cardboard Reticle and even add 3D real-time binaural audio!\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
