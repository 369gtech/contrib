language: English
recordingDate: 1514385196
description: "Facebook takes pride in its “move fast” culture, and both PHP and HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine for PHP) are fundamentally tied to its success. As the Facebook product has evolved, so has it’s underlying web language, with several Facebook specific language and runtime extensions helping it scale in both developer efficiency and execution efficiency. We explore this evolution, and deep dive on our latest language goodness.\n\nJulien Verlaguet is a compiler/static-analysis expert from France. He currently works at Facebook as an Engineer on the HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine) languages and tools team. Previously, he was working on model-checking and compilers at Esterel-technologies.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
