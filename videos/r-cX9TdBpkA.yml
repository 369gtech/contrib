description: "As we develop as leaders we hear different quotes like: “be the change you want to see in the world”, “leadership is about people”, “true leadership is when people say we did it ourselves”, etc. But what do they really mean and how do they actually apply in practice?\r\n\r\nThe leadership literature is filled with models and examples that want us as managers of organizations no matter what level we are at, how long our experience is or how big our organization is to be some super gurus close to Gandhi or alike.\r\n\r\nOur office table is full of responsibilities, reports and requests and we are supposed to not just ensure the well-being of our organization, to grow it, scale it, thrive but also to ensure the well-being of every person in our organization. We were educated as doctors, teachers, bankers, software developers, you name it... and now we have to be personal counselors, mentors, coaches, motivators, charismatic and inspiring leaders. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch"
