title: 'YOW! Connected 2016 Kai Koenig - Anko - The Ultimate Ninja of Kotlin Libraries?'
recordingDate: 1485478894
description: "Kotlin is a new language for the JVM that aims to be a ””better Java”“. Made in-house by Jetbrains, the company behind IntelliJ IDEA and also Android Studio, it’s been in development for more than 5 years. Just a few weeks ago the final version of Kotlin 1.0 saw the light of day.\n\nThe language itself gives one so much niceness and syntactic sugar that you’d probably never want to go back to coding in Java again. Things get even better with Anko. Anko is pretty much the ultimate Ninja of Kotlin libraries. The feature it’s best know for is its Layout DSL that allows one to programatically write UI code in Kotlin. No more XML layout and no awkward piecing together of your UI through clunky Java APIs. We will look at how to use and how to extend the Layout DSL for your own requirements and then move on to Anko’s advanced, non-layout-related features:\n\n* Intent wrappers\n* Shortcuts to system services\n* Asynchronous task management\n* Anko SQLite and more\n\nI work as a Software Solutions Architect for Ventego Creative in Wellington, New Zealand. I co-founded the company with two partners and I’m also the CTO of Zen Ex Machina, an agile management consulting company in Canberra, Sydney and Wellington.\n\nMy work really comprises a mix of consulting, training, mentoring and actual development work using a range of technologies, common themes being Java, Kotlin, Android or Mobile Web with Javascript, CFML etc.\n\nOther stuff I occasionally do: Write for magazines (currently mainly Heise’s iX magazine in Germany) or in my Blog, publish a very occasional Podcast (2 Developers Down Under) with my friend Mark Mandel from Melbourne and since 2007 fly small, single- and twin-engine airplanes around New Zealand and sometimes Australia, currently working on my Commercial Pilot License.\n\nFor more on YOW!
