recordingDate: 1513268856
description: "To rapidly deliver microservices to production, organizations are turning to infrastructure automation provided by a cloud-native platform, like Cloud Foundry. With a platform in place, every microservice team will have what they need to create a CI/CD pipeline that safely delivers applications to a production environment. The final ingredient for success is knowing the right patterns for connecting microservices together over HTTP using REST APIs.\n\nIn this session, Kenny Bastani from Pivotal and Prithpal Bhogill from Google dive into a reference architecture that demonstrates the patterns and practices for securely connecting microservices together using Apigee Edge integration for Pivotal Cloud Foundry.\n\nThis session covers:\n\nBasics for building cloud-native applications as microservices on Pivotal Cloud Foundry using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Services\nPatterns and practices that are enabling small autonomous microservice teams to provision backing services for their applications\nHow to securely expose microservices over HTTP using Apigee Edge for PCF\n\n\nSlides: TBA\n\nPrithpal Bhogill, Product Manager, Google\nKenny Bastani, Spring Developer Advocate, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
