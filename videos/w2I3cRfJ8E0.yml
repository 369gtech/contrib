description: 'Is 2019 the year of the Mixed Reality revolution with the HoloLens 2? Regardless if it is, itâ€™s an amazing time to be a developer and to be part of the next computing revolution where Mixed Reality is dramatically changing how humans interact with computers. Developing applications for this bleeding edge technology means learning new things every day while creating outstanding User Experiences. Often it also means facing challenges and running into pit falls while working in untouched territory. In this session Rene will demonstrate some of the HoloLens Mixed Reality projects he and his team worked on since 2015 and share how they were able to overcome challenges. His best practices and recommendations will help you avoid pit falls and might provide inspiration for your next AR/VR projects. He will also provide you with a future perspective of Mixed Reality combining AI + MR by leveraging on-device Machine Learning for intelligent edge experiences.'
