recordingDate: 1387782271
description: "\"Mobile market is currently dominated by Android and iOS. Blackberry, Windows Phone, Firefox and Ubuntu are looking ahead to capture this market as well. With such a plethora of devices and operating systems if a product or service providers looks at mobile devices to capture the market; it has to be beyond single platform for meaningful adoption. Cross platform toolkits have spawned up to address this issue; however a lot of them mean leveraging web technologies while compromising on User Interface. The talk will primarily be focused pros and cons of various mobile cross platform frameworks and the new framework 'Calatrava' which brings best of both the worlds (native and cross platform).\"\n\nAnand is a long-time developer at ThoughtWorks Technologies and has worked in small and large scale Agile projects.
