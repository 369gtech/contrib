description: "www.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a two day, single track conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 500 to 700 Developers from across the country will converge on beautiful Salt Lake City, UT to participate in training sessions by the Google Angular team, and other Angular experts. In addition to the invaluable training, ng-conf will deliver a premier conference experience for attendees, providing opportunities to network with other developers, relax at social events, and engage in some of the unique entertainment opportunities available in Utah.\n\nSean Hess\nTopic: How to use Typescript on your Angular Application and Be Happy\n\nTypescript is a compile-to-JavaScript language that adds ES6 features, and optional type system. Using strict types in an application allows you to catch errors much earlier in the development cycle, avoid regressions, and greatly increases ease of maintenance. Modern type systems like the one included in Typescript make typing a joy to use. The types in TypeScript are optional, meaning you can incrementally add it to a project. The productivity gains from strict typing outweigh those from testing, and are easier to realize. It's not immediately obvious how to structure a Typescript+Angular project. Typescript uses ES6 modules, which conflict with Angular's module system, and it's hard to know when to use classes, how to set up the project, how to get the compiler to typescript angular itself, etc. I will spend a short time talking about WHY people should use Typescript on an angular project, but the presentation will be mostly hands-on and technical, showing where to put files, what tools to use, and how to do it productively."
