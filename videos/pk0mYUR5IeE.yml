description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\nMany offices will not be able to open and operate at full capacity for a long time. At the same time, some people don’t want to go back to the office, even when it’s safe to do so. Most people don’t want to leave the office behind entirely, preferring instead some sort of hybrid scenario - where they work some days at the office and some days at home. And in the end, I think all people would like the freedom to choose when and where they are most productive.\n \nSo now, as lockdowns are being lifted, companies are re-evaluating their previously held views of remote working - and wondering how we can navigate the new world of working as a hybrid team."
