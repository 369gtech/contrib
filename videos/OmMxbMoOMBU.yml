description: "A 3-D environment can provide beauty and immersion in a user interface. Unfortunately, it can be really heavyweight for small devices or even the Web, but there are simple techniques that can make your UI unbelievably realistic without the need for 3-D hardware. A technique often used in video games is to use independent layers that are scrolled at different speeds in a simulated parallax motion. This effect provides the illusion of depth, resulting in a rich user experience. If you include touch and screen orientation, the result is a unique and very realistic interface. Attend this session, which includes demos, to learn about the implementation of this unique UI pattern.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAngela Caicedo\nAngela Caicedo has been a Java Evangelist for 11 years, first at Sun Microsystems and now at Oracle.
