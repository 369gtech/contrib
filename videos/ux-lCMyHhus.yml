title: 'Why you failed when you tried to change things in your organization'
recordingDate: 1605246673
description: "Recognize this? For some time now you have tried improving the way you work in your team or organization. But whatever you try, things tend to go back to how they were. The case is so clear and all the benefits are there, ready to grab! But still, it’s like some magic gravitational force field pulls you back to status quo land.\n\nWe know why you failed. You only focused on one-third of what makes people change their behaviours in their working environment. The good news: we will tell you about the other two thirds!\n\nThis presentation is for anyone who wants to see improved ways of working for whatever purpose: efficiency, customer understanding, collaboration, quality or innovation. We’ll talk about how you can try out new stuff, get your colleagues attention, inspire action and watch it spread in the organization.\n\nNo, this is not a presentation about a specific development method or process. It’s a presentation about how to change things in your organization or team, without expensive and time-consuming change management programs that focus on formal stuff like organization structure, training, budgets and process redesign.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
