description: "There are women –rarely known– who have had a massive impact in the Erlang & Elixir community. We wouldn’t even be here in this conference if it wasn’t for some of them. Their achievements and stories are known only in small circles because often their protagonists have been humble and discreet.\n\nBut these heroines have done and are still doing amazing things for our community. It is high time we gave them the recognition they deserve and celebrate their contributions together. Who knows? Maybe this talk will plant the seed of the next generation of Erlang & Elixir role models.\n\nMore details on website here: https://codesync.global/speaker/miriam-pena/"
