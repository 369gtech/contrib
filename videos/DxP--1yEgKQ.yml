description: "Slides: https://github.com/psteinb/meetingcpp2017\n\nC++ programmers care about performance in every minute of their worklife. As a matter of fact, the central differentiating criterion for using C++ in a software project is speed almost exclusively. But how do we measure it? What tools are out there to help us measure the performance for a given code snippet inside a larger project. What tools are out there to judge the performance of new algorithms or of our collaborators recent contribution? In this talk I would like to address these questions and provide demonstrations and experience report from the field. I'll discuss layman tools as well as open-source tools and finish with proprietary tools. With this talk, I hope to motivate a more vivid discussion in the C++ community on how we measure the speed of our implementations."
