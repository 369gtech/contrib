title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2019 - Andrae Muys - Functional Modelling of Contractual Workflows in DAML'
recordingDate: 1565125203
description: "The Australian Security Exchange (ASX)'s CHESS[1] replacement[2] will be one of the most institutionally significant deployments of pure FP in the world. The CHESS settlement and registry system tracks the ownership of $1.5 trillion of the Australian economy on a daily basis. Its replacement is being developed by Digital Asset in DAML[3], and is due for completion in 2021.\n\nRunning on a distributed ledger technology (DLT), DAML is a smart contract language inspired by Haskell. It shares much of Haskell's pure core; however, it removes the infamous IO type, and instead provides a dedicated and restricted ledger-interaction type. This type, and the underlying ledger model it encapsulates, captures DAML's first-class control of authorisation and privacy.\n\nThis presentation introduces the DLT architecture style. It will explain the strengths and weaknesses of DLT, especially when modelling contractual workflows. It will demonstrate the use of DAML language to implement multi-party workflows that include authorisation and privacy requirements on the DLT platform developed by Digital Asset.\n\nAn attendee will come away with an understanding of how DLT is a distinct architectural style, a taste of DAML as a programming language, and an insight into the platform and language behind the highest profile functional programming project in Australia.\n\n[1] CHESS: Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (https://www.asx.com.au/research/chess_brochure.pdf)\n\n[2] https://www.asx.com.au/services/chess-replacement.htm\n\n[3] Digital Asset Modelling Language (https://daml.com)\n\nBackend Developer, Software Archeologist, and Semiotic Engineer @DigitalAssetCom\n\nAndrae has spent the past twenty years variously meandering and blundering his way to some semblance of understanding of knowledge representation and management. In 2017, he was a part of the Digital Asset team that built the first existence proof that DLT can simultaneously meet the high-availability, disaster recovery, throughput, and functionality requirements of the world's largest post-trade financial settlement systems. Subsequently he is now helping build the CHESS Replacement Clearing and Settlement system for the Australian Stock Exchange. Given half a chance he will make you regret asking him about post-modern data modelsâ€”but that won't be the subject of his talk.\n\nFor more on YOW!
