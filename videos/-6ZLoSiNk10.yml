description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nService oriented architectures are getting more and more widespread popularity, because of the benefits they offer. They have some design requirements though, a very important one of them is designing services (and their combinations) for scalability and resilience. We at Ustream built a couple of these in the past years and learned a lot about how to do it and what open source tools are available to achieve the goal."
