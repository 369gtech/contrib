description: "DBaaS on Kubernetes: Peanut Butter and Jelly, or Oil and Water - Steve Croce & Wes Ashkinazy, ObjectRocket \n\nKubernetes wasn't designed to run databases, but recent features have opened the door to stateful applications and databases in particular. However, once you add the \"as a service\" part, things get a whole lot more interesting. Steve Croce and Wes Ashkinazy from ObjectRocket talk about the problems they expected, the challenges that surprised them and ultimately the solutions that allowed the ObjectRocket team to design Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and Redis as a service on Kubernetes. The session will cover a set of particular challenges in the design of custom Kubernetes operators, solving problems with Event Recorder, Remote Execution, and Stateful Set Update Strategies, to name a few, and leveraging other CNCF projects to fill in the gaps. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grap"
