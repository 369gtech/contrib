description: "Effective Patterns and Practices for Polyglot Programming [A] - Martin Kreibe, ECS Team    \n\nPolyglot programming is not just using multiple programming languages, it also involves multiple frameworks and multiple services.\n\n\nWhether we choose it or not, as technologies evolve, polyglot programming is already there in every corporate environment. Best thing to do is to understand it better and make the right decisions to choose the right programming language/framework/service based on the problem at hand. \n\nWe will look at \n• What is polyglot programming? \n• Risks of polyglot programming? What are the trade-offs?\n• What are the patterns and anti-patterns you need to watch out for when you are using it? \n\nMartin Kreibe\nECS Team\nSr Cloud Architect\nDenver, CO\nMartin is a Senior Cloud Architect who is constantly striving to improve application and business processes.
