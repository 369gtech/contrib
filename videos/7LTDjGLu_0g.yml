description: "Slides:\_https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bYMoXh7GewL0nzglOH1lZ6vxzj1NFiO9fk-WaVEwOa4/edit#slide=id.p\n\n\n\nHave you ever wanted a standardized, flexible and pluggable solution for creating sites that allow:\n\n\n\nUploading multiple images / files at once\nSelecting and re-using an image / file already present on the server\nUsing an arbitrary view as Media gallery or Content gallery for your editors\nCreating related content without having to exit the main content form\nEtc.\n\n\nEntity Browser is a Drupal 8 contrib module that was created to solve these common needs in a generic and flexible architecture. While this allows for powerful tools and workflows to be implemented, the price is often an increased learning curve about how to properly configure and fine-tune it for the different use cases.\n\nIn this session we will:\n\nExplain the basic architecture of the module, and how to take advantage of its plugin-based approach to extend and customize it.\nSee how to configure it from scratch to solve different use-cases, including some pitfalls that often occur on that process.\nCheck what we can copy or re-use from other contrib modules.\nExplore some possible integrations with other parts of the Media ecosystem.\n\n\nAlthough not mandatory, the audience of this session is expected to have basic site-building experience with Drupal 8, allowing them to follow along the demos and configuration steps more easily."
