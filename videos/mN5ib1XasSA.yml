description: "Get the Code Here: http://goo.gl/zPL7r\n\nWelcome to my Java Quick Sort tutorial! In most situations the Quick Sort is the fastest sorting algorithm.\n\nIn essence, the quick sort works by partitioning arrays so that the smaller numbers are on the left and the larger are on the right. I'll cover what partitioning is in this video.\n\nThe Quick Sort then recursively sends small parts of larger arrays to itself and partitions again. Between the code and the video you will completely get it in the end."
