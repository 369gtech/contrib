description: "From the 2014 Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City.\n\nThe past few decades have delivered us incredible technical capabilities. Today we can profit from the vast quantities of data that our institutions generate. Yet with these new capabilities come risks. Data can be abused. As a society, we now begin the process of deciding how to limit this new power. The policies and practices we develop in the next few years will set the stage for the coming century. In this presentation Eli Collins, Cloudera’s Chief Technologist, will discuss how we might both reap the benefits of data while avoiding its perils.\n\nAbout Eli Collins:\nEli is Cloudera’s Chief Technologist, currently focused on new technology introduction and strategy. He previously lead the team responsible for Cloudera’s Hadoop distribution (CDH), and is an Apache Hadoop committer and PMC member.
