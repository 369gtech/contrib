description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nElise Russell is about sticking her neck out to win. In 2012, she quit her job as an award-winning worker bee to be an entrepreneur. It wasn’t a soft transition; she didn’t have a plan. She just wanted to have more fun and work when she felt inspired, not force her own creative hand. Elise’s only safety net is her ability to produce under pressure. She can’t tell you where ideas come from, because she doesn’t know. Elise believes in trusting creative intuition, growing ideas like wildflowers and allowing things to evolve. She sets time aside to let her subconscious percolate, and hands struggles over to her inner muse to resolve and spice up. Elise protects her creative path above all else and feels it’s her duty to share the gains of jumping in with both feet and going it on your own—without a backup plan. To her, there is nothing more sacred than being true to your inner creative and having the courage to chase down your dreams. She dares you to do the same.\n\nElise Russell\nCreative Director/Writer, Pony Friday\nhttps://twitter.com/ponyfriday\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ponyfriday/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
