Either you're pressing buttons on a controller, swiping on a touchscreen or clicking on your laptop's trackpad. But what if you could control things without the use of your hands? What if you could use... your thoughts?\n\nI have been tinkering with a brain sensor and developed an open source JavaScript framework for it to allow me (or anyone else) to control interfaces or robots using facial expressions and mental commands.\n\nCharlie Gerard \nFrom ThoughtWorks\nCharlie is a software developer at ThoughtWorks in Sydney. She is passionate about creative coding and building interactive prototypes mixing science, art and technology. She also spends time giving back to the community by mentoring new developers, contributing to open-source projects and speaking at events."
