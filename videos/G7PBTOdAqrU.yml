We web developers are the ones who can fix that and Iâ€™ll show you how.\n\nChris has been doing all sorts of things to innocent web sites for 17 years and is also responsible for unleashing web forms library Quaid-JS upon the world. He is currently working in the in-house web team at insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson in Perth, Australia Aside from musical distractions and earning frequent flyer points, Chris and his wife Sarah can often be found in the company of their very small human. \n\nThe node community has change tremendously as it has evolved over the last 5 years.
