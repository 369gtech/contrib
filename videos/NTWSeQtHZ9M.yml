Separating data (in independent components) from logic (in independent systems) allows the code to be more reusable and more efficient, alongside additional benefits. Using modern C++11 and C++14 features, it is possible to design an efficient and user-friendly component-based entity system library, with intuitive syntax and convenient cost-free abstractions.\n— \nVittorio Romeo is an Italian 20 year old Computer Science student at \"Università degli Studi di Messina\".  He began programming at a very young age and soon became a C++ enthusiast. While following the evolution of the C++ standard and embracing the newest features, he worked on several open-source projects, including modern general-purpose libraries and free cross-platform indie games.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
