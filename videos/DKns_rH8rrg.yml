description: "\"How to write a JIT compiler in 30 minutes\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - MongoDB]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Antonio Cuni\n\nReal-world JIT compilers like PyPy and Numba are complex and advanced. However, the basic ideas behind JIT compilers are easy to understand, as this talk aim to show.\n\nThis is a live-coding exercise: we will start from a blank page and write a working (albeit simple and limited) JIT compiler from scratch.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
