With v4, developers can set frozen rows, add cell formatting, adjust column sizes, apply formulas, build pivot tables, create charts, and MORE! In fact, you can do almost everything w/the API that you can do with the Sheets user interface. In this introductory DevByte from Google engineer Wesley Chun, you'll see just how easy it is to populate the contents of a SQLite database into a Google Sheet!\n\nRelated links for this episode:\n- Google Sheets API v4 launch announcement: http://goo.gl/ikttYs\n- Deeper dive code review of script used in this DevByte: http://goo.gl/qr1BI6\n- Google Sheets API v4 Node.js codelab: http://g.co/codelabs/sheets\n- “Setting up new Google API projects” DevByte: http://goo.gl/RbyTFD\n- Google APIs Client Libraries: http://goo.gl/1OXEj7\n- “Common Python code walkthrough” DevByte: http://goo.gl/KMfbeK\n- Google Sheets API documentation: http://goo.gl/0BiEQe\n- Common operations & Sheets API sample usage: http://goo.gl/4Dr5cJ\n- Google Sheets API Python Quickstart: http://goo.gl/O9xVvu\n\nWatch all Launchpad Online videos at https://goo.gl/rb69Ge\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L -\nSubscribe to the brand new Firebase Channel: https://goo.gl/9giPHG"
