title: 'Energy From Thorium: A Nuclear Waste Burning Liquid Salt Thorium Reactor'
recordingDate: 1248394671
description: "Kirk Sorensen's Tech Talk, delivered at Google on July 20, 2009.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully developing a liquid-fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR) would essentially solve our planets energy problems for thousands of years, because it would allow us to fully utilize the energy in natural thorium, which makes up 0.0012% of the Earths crust. Most of the research and development work for this technology was done by Oak Ridge National Labs back in the 50s and 60s. They were working to a different set of overall objectives, nevertheless, there are many lessons to be gleaned from their work that can help us to avoid pitfalls and develop LFTR into a high-performance, high-reliability power supply."
