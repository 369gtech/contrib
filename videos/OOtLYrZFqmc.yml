description: "He will talk about his work as a researcher, focusing on the parts related to the development of the pyParticleEst framework. It is an LGPL licensed software to assist in applying so called particle methods for solving nonlinear estimation problems, which is a form of signal processing/machine learning. I will give a quick background to why this is interesting and which type of problems you can solve using these methods. I will discuss which parts of Python that have been useful for me in this work (mainly Numpy/Scipy), and give a very brief introduction to what those are/do. I will also give my very subjective opinions about the benefits and drawbacks of using Python for this type of work.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
