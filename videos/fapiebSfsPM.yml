description: "Starting in November, we’ve asked for Google Developer Groups from all around the world to host their own Polymer events, which we’re calling “Polytechnics”.\n\nGenerally, a Polytechnic will include a tech talk, self-guided code labs, and free time for hacking. We want attendees to come away feeling like they know the basics of working with Polymer, and excited to start experimenting with it in their own projects. All of the necessary materials to run your own Polytechnic (speaker deck, training video, code labs, graphic assets, etc) are available now at the official site: itshackademic.com.\n\nWeb Components are still a very new thing, so it’s up to all of us, as a community, to grow this ecosystem, and help others get started. To find a Polytechnic near you, take a look at the event map, where new events are being added every day. If you don’t see an event in your area, reach our to your local GDG lead to see if they can help you get one up and running. Also, be sure to spread the word with the #itshackademic hashtag!\n\nMore info:\nhttps://blog.polymer-project.org/events/2014/10/09/polymer-polytechnics/\n\nhttp://itshackademic.com/\n\nLearn more about Polymer by watching our new Polycasts series here!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsII5c3Mgw6fNYCzaWrsM3sMN"
