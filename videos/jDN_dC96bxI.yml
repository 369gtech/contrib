description: "Pivotal runs a publicly accessible, multi-tenant Cloud Foundry, called Pivotal Web Services, or PWS. It's often the first system to be updated with new open-source Cloud Foundry code. What we learn from PWS informs development of both open source Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Cloud Foundry's Elastic Runtime.\n\nOur mission at Cloud Operations is to make that feedback as fast and useful as possible. Ideally, developers learn directly from interacting with production, so we facilitate access to prod, and help teams set up continuous delivery pipelines. Not all operations can be done directly by developers, so also deploy updates and experiments ourselves, respond to incidents, design and implement monitoring systems, and manage shared resources.\n\nIn this session, you'll learn how Cloud Operations runs and monitors Cloud Foundry with the goal of delivering information about its behavior, not just keeping the service up. You'll learn how we decide what operations work needs to be done by operators and what can be done by developers. We'll discuss how we've moved work from one team to the other, and challenges we've discovered to close collaboration across disciplines. And you'll find out how we've adapted the Google Service Level Indicator concept to clusters of infrastructure services.\n\n\nSlides: TBA\n\nNatalie Bennett, Software Engineer, Pivotal"
