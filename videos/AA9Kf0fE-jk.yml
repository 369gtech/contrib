description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Kai Koenig, Ventego Creative.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=ZNT-7569\n\nSo, you’ve built an app. It'd be nice to make some money with it and instead of only charging a one-off purchase price you’re maybe considering a free app with extra features. Or you might think about a subscription model to create an ongoing cashflow by selling a service.\n\nDepending on your actual occupation in the Android-ecosystem you might never had the need to look into monetisation of an app. In a nutshell, it’s a Google Play service - implementation should be smooth and easy and super-straight-forward, right? RIGHT?\n\nIn this talk we're going to cover:\n- Google's various in-app billing offerings and their differences\n- Play Billing and how to implement a working billing flow\n- Dealing with subscriptions in your app and the backend\n- Testing and 3rd party support libraries like Register and BillingX\n- Managing your products in Google Play and Firebase Analytics\n\nAlex Karp Production"
