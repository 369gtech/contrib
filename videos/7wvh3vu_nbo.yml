description: "LISA16 - What I Learned from Science-ing Four Years of DevOps\n\nNicole Forsgren, DORA\n\nFour years, over 20,000 DevOps professionals, and some science... What did we find? Well, the headline is that IT does matter if you do it right. In this fun interactive session, Nicole will discuss ways to make your data better, some surprises the team has seen over the years, and then some highlights from the research: With a mix of technology, processes, and a great culture, IT contributes to organizations' profitability, productivity, and market share. We also found that using continuous delivery and lean management practices not only makes IT better—giving you throughput and stability without tradeoffs—but it also makes your work feel better—making your organizational culture better and decreasing burnout.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
