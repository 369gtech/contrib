description: "What if you take the digital business organization of a global fashion brand, merge it with all the technical functions it needs to evolve and operate, then you create cross functional teams and flatten all the hierarchies around them, finally, you target a software architecture that is enabled by just such a flat delivery organization. What does it look like? Also, any suggestions? \n\nAbout:\n\nCarlo Bottiglieri, Global Digital Development Director, GUCCI\n\nI'm a long time XP developer, passionate about software design and radical agile organizations. Source of potentially productive chaos in the search of excellence. Before joining Gucci I was in charge of software delivery in senseFly, so, working mostly on autonomous flying wings; before that I was writing static code analyzers in SonarSource; before that I was enterprise architect in Nestl√®; before that I built the omnichannel software architecture of Nespresso and its development organization. In other words, your classic engineering manager."
