recordingDate: 1563163297
description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nData is a core part of our infrastructure here at Yelp, with tens of billions of messages per day flowing across our streaming pipelines, empowering us to solve core business problems. To reliably connect and route this massive amount of data across a variety of data-stores, we have built Flink based data-connectors that have either exactly once or at-most-once semantics.\n\nIn this talk I will introduce the various kinds of data connectors we have built and how they assist us in solving various business problems. I’ll focus on how these data-connectors integrate with our infrastructure, discuss the technical tradeoff between stateless and stateful connectors, and general guidelines and specifications we have for developers building such connectors. I’ll also touch briefly on how we audit, to ensure end to end data integrity. In the end I will talk about how we ensure these connectors run at scale and integrate with our home grown flink supervisor solution.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
