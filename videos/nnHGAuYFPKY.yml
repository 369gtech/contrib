description: "Evan Kohilas\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/102/\n\nHave you ever clicked the *FREE GEMS* button and been served an ad, only to find you're now trialing a game?\r\n\r\nWhat are they? Are they running code? \r\nIf they are, can we hijack them?\r\nIf we can't, can we bypass, or even replace them?\r\n\r\nAnd more importantly, what are they actually doing?\r\nAre you really playing a game? Or are they bitcoin miners in disguise?\r\n\r\nCome along and join my adventurous curiosity as we learn to man in the middle and reverse engineer these ads and discover what they're really about!\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
