description: "Agile in Lithuania -- Innovation or a Well Going Train? What is Waiting For the Ones That are Late For It?\nWhen we introduced Scrum (one of Agile project management methods) in Lavasoft (Sweden), it allowed to put order to chaotic development process. The released version was with much better quality and more features compared to previous ones. When I was describing this project management method to my cousin, IT project manager in Lithuania, he was smiling. \"It will never work in Lithuania, with our people\" -- was his conclusion. I never believed this. I came back to Lithuania. In 2009 we implemented and we are successfully using Scrum in Adform since. It was clear evidence -- employees in Lithuania do not differ from the rest of the world. Project management methods that work abroad are well applicable in Lithuania as well. \nIn 2010, while organizing first Agile conference in Lithuania -- Agile Tour Vilnius 2010 (http://2010.agileturas.lt) -- we had trouble finding Lithuanian speakers who would have Agile experience in Lithuania. Nevertheless, we found few, and this conference became the birth for community of Agile practitioners. This community actively promotes Agile in Lithuania by sharing their experiences in different events. \nSo what is Agile project management? Why some project managers, managers or CEOs still think that these methods are not applicable in Lithuania, in their projects, companies? Which companies are using Agile and what benefits they claim to get (or not to get)? In this presentation I will share my experience implementing and using Scrum. I will also share my insights how, where, and why Agile project management methods are spreading in Lithuania."
