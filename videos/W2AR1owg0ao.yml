One of linux.conf.au\r\n2017’s four keynote speakers, Nadia Eghbal will help you find out!\r\n\r\nlinux.conf.au’s focus in 2017 is The Future of Open Source, so we’re\r\ndelighted to welcome Nadia, a noted researcher on sustainability in\r\nOpen Source.\r\n\r\nNadia's talk examines the inherent tension\r\nbetween keeping code free, and better supporting the people who\r\nmaintain that code. She'll focus on why the future of Open Source requires turning our attention from freedom of the user to freedom of the maintainer.\r\n\r\nOriginally from a venture capital background, in January 2016, Nadia\r\nstarted investigating Open Source as the “digital infrastructure” upon\r\nwhich the tech industry is built.\r\n\r\nHer initial reports painted a worrying view of the sustainability of\r\nOpen Source software: Many Open Source projects – ones that form the\r\ndigital infrastructure that many big organisations in tech and\r\ngovernment rely upon – aren’t in very good shape. Most of Open Source\r\nis not well-funded, and depends heavily on the contribution of free\r\ntime on the part of a small pool of maintainers.\r\n\r\nShe also highlighted that despite building their success on this\r\ninfrastructure, much of the leadership in the tech industry was\r\nlargely unaware of these issues.\r\n\r\nThis research culminated in Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind\r\nOur Digital Infrastructure, a 142-page report published by the Ford\r\nFoundation, that highlights the scale of the problem:\r\n\r\n› Everybody relies on shared code to write software, including\r\nFortune 500 companies, government, major software companies and\r\nstartups. In a world driven by technology, we are putting increased\r\ndemand on those who maintain our digital infrastructure. Yet because\r\nthese communities are not highly visible, the rest of the world has\r\nbeen slow to notice.\r\n\r\n› In the face of unprecedented demand, the costs of not supporting our\r\ndigital infrastructure are numerous. No individual company or\r\norganisation is incentivised to address the public good problem alone.\r\n'''\r\n\r\nMore recently, Nadia has joined GitHub, focusing on finding ways that\r\nGitHub can empower open source maintainers to create and nurture\r\nthriving, healthy open source projects."
