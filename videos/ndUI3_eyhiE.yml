description: "\"The front-end moves faster than Drupal, whether Drupal likes it or not\" This reference from \"The state of the Front-end\" session at DrupalCon Amsterdam explains that we need different ways to retrieve content from a Drupal site for an easy integration with new front-end frameworks and other 3rd-party applications. This allows non-experienced front-end developers to start theming Drupal using the tools they are used to, providing at the same time multiple integrations with other platforms through APIs.\nCurrently there is a debate about how to achieve this and what direction Drupal will take in the future. In this session there will be explained different approaches to solve common problems and what possible solutions are provided by Drupal and its contributed modules. You can join this discussion, share your thoughts and experiences with others, and help Drupal to go on the right track."
