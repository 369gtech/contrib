title: '"Injecting Security at the Cloud Edge" by Susan Hinrichs'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634409291
description: "With the increase in public/private hybrid cloud deployments, there is an increased need to ensure and enforce security policies between clouds. A “Secure Edge” proxy layer is a good place to inject and enforce privacy and authentication security protocols. In this talk, I will present how Yahoo uses three open source solutions: Apache Traffic Server, Athenz and Waflz, to implement such a Secure Edge to enable a secure and dynamic hybrid cloud strategy.\n\n\nSpecifically, I will present multiple options for Secure Edge integration that range from basic routing with low edge visibility to more explicit delegation allowing for the Secure Edge to perform policy enforcement. I will also discuss lessons we learned along the way and how those issues are being addressed in the standards world. From this talk, participants will gain an understanding of the options available to secure applications deployed across multiple cloud locations, so they can make informed and secure deployment decisions.\n\n\nSusan Hinrichs\nAviatrix\n\n\nSusan Hinrichs is a computer engineer, specializing in networking, security, and system development.
