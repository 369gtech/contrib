description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nTwo of the main software architectural trends in software development this decade has been the move to streaming data processing, and the move to microservice architecture.\n\nBoth of these architectures are driven by the needs of managing and mining knowledge from ever increasing volumes of data in a close to real-time fashion—all while being reactive: responsive under failure, and responsive under load. I'm here to tell you that these two trends are converging, and a fusion of the two is both logical and inevitable. In this session we will talk about what a fused approach to stream processing and microservices could look like, what opportunities exist—what software development for business software can look like in the following decade.\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
