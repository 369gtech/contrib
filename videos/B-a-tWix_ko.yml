description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nThe Building Blocks of DX: K8s Evolution From CLI to GitOps - Katie Gamanji, Cloud Native Computing Foundation \n\nIn the past years, Kubernetes has become the default container orchestrator framework, setting the standards for application deployment in a distributed architecture. Wider adaptability of the tool prompted the diversification of the end-user base, and a consistent DX for cluster interaction became essential for Kubernetes. The community channeled herculean efforts towards the enhancement of developer experience by extending the cluster CLI, building portals, and highly-responsive UIs. This talk will focus on the cluster DX chronicles, showcasing tools which contributed to wider adoption for Kubernetes. An emphasis will be placed on cluster CLI and how it can be extended using kubectl plugins and wrappers. This will be followed by an introduction of widespread cluster state managers, covering mechanisms such as GitOps, ClickOps, and even SheetOps. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ek9l"
