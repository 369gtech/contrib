description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nThe new GraalVM from Oracle supports multiple language including JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, C++ as well as Java and other JVM languages. This opens up interesting possibilities for polygot enterprise applications. Now you can use a Node library in a Java application or call an R statistical function from an EJB. Previously, this type of integration was extremely challenging. This session will provide recipes to get up and running along with best practices and some cool demos."
