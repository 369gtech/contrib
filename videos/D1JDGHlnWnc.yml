description: "Since its first release more than 20 years ago, Python has gone from being an obscure language from the Netherlands to one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Python combines a powerful, expressive language with an extensive standard library, a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, and an active open-source community. Its approachability means that almost anyone - from casual programmers to professional developers - can engage with the language at the level they need, creating everything from simple scripts to complex applications.\n\nIn this talk we’ll take a high-level tour of the language, and we’ll try to get a sense of how it feels to use Python. Rather than focus on the technical details of the language, we’ll go through actual Python programs to see how they work in practice. If you’re thinking of using Python, or are just curious, this talk will help you understand what Python can do and how it might work for you."
