title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: How to Boost Web Performance Using API Monitoring'
recordingDate: 1382986233
description: "Maybe your approach to web application monitoring is out of balance. Often the focus is on synthetics, log monitoring, and even browser instrumentation -- which is enough for end user monitoring but often misses an important angle -- APIs. Just not enough attention is given to API, REST and SOAP -- especially as companies expand web application partner channels and mobile applications.\n\nIn this live 45 min. webcast, join Dell product expert John Spirko, Dell software engineer manager Rob Dickinson and Dell software development senior consultant Andy Wahrenberger in an exclusive webcast with O'Reilly. John discusses the attributes of a SOAP request/response pair, why URL identification isn't enough to pinpoint SOAP API issues and the two main perspectives to consider for SOAP API monitoring.\n\nSee how you can maximize website performance. \n\nAbout John Spirko\n\nFoglight product manager, joined Dell Software in 2001.
