title: 'GeeCON 2019: Randy Shoup - Scaling yout Architecture with Services and Events'
recordingDate: 1563984048
description: 'This session is a deep dive into the modern best practices around asynchronous decoupling, resilience, and scalability that allow us to implement a large-scale software system from the building blocks of events and services, based on the speaker''s experiences implementing such systems at Google, eBay, and other high-performing technology organizations. We will outline the various options for handling event delivery and event ordering in a distributed system. We will cover data and persistence in an event-driven architecture. Finally, we will describe how to combine events, services, and so-called ''serverless'' functions into a powerful overall architecture. You will leave with practical suggestions to help you accelerate your development velocity and drive business results.'
