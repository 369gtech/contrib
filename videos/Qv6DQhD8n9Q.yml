description: 'I''ll show and demonstrate how I use my 9 RFID & RFID/NFC tag implants to interact with different RFID readers in door locks and other electronics. How I''ve used cloning devices to clone different RFID cards/keyfobs to my implants. I''ll demonstrate the newest prototype implant (VivoKey) which I use for PGP encryption/decryption/signing and for 2-factor authentication. Also answers to common questions like "what if you have to go through security at an airport? can the implants break? what if you need an MRI?"'
