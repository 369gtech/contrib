description: "by Lionel Montrieux\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.118/nakadi.webm\n\n\nAt Zalando, a small team of 9 engineers develops, maintains, and operates an internal deployment of Nakadi, the open source event streaming platform. Nakadi handles dozens of terabytes of data every day, produced and consumed by hundreds of teams, with use cases from big data to service-to-service communication. Nakadi also feeds data into Zalandoâ€™s data lake for batch analysis. In this talk, we will show how a small team can serve so many customers while still finding the time to work on new features and fixing bugs. Serving users at scale requires a completely self-service offering. Nakadi provides self-service stream creation, administration, schema validation and evolution, monitoring, authorization, SQL over streams, and a great UI so that even less technical users can use Nakadi. \n\nRoom: UA2.118 (Henriot)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 12:15:00+01"
