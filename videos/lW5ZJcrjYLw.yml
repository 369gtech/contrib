description: "Mars Geldard\n\nEntropy theory is usually thought of as something that applies to matter and energy, but it turns out that we can apply the same techniques of analysis to social media sites. Join me as we study the thermodynamic behaviour of users on Twitter, and learn how to analyse it better.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/insights-into-social-media-data-using-entropy-theory\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nSun Aug  4 11:10:00 2019 at C3.4 & C3.5"
