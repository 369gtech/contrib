description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/pdubroy/parsing-compiling-and-static-metaprogramming\nLearn how to use compilers and parser generators to remove boilerplate, build DSLs, and generally do the impossible.\n\nI'll explain the basics of how compilers work, and give an overview of some popular JS tools & libraries. I'll demonstrate how they can help you do all kinds of useful things, like:\n\npresubmit checks for style guide violations\nextracting strings requiring translation in your code\nautomatically inserting logging statements around certain function calls\nFinally, for the budding language designers, I'll explain how to create your own compiled-to-JS language in five minutes using a parser generator.\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
