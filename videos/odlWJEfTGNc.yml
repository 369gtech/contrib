description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nWhat happens when things break? What happens when software fails? We regard it as a normal and personal inconvenience when apps crash or servers become unavailable, but what are the implications beyond the individual user? Is software reliability simply a business decision or does it have economic, social and cultural consequences? What are the moral and practical implications for software developers? And when we talk of 'systems', are we part of the 'system'? What about the bugs on our side of the keyboard? In this talk, we will explore examples of failures in software and its application, and how they affect us at different scales, from user to society."
