description: 'Javassist makes Java bytecode manipulation simple. At ZeroTurnaround we use Javassist a lot to implement the integrations for our tools. In this talk we will go through the examples of how Javassist can be applied to alter the applications behaviour and do all kind of fun stuff with it. Why is it interesting? Because while trying to do unusual things in Java, you learn much more about the language and the platform itself and learning about Javassist will actually make you a better Java developer!'
