title: 'CNCF Member Webinar: MicroK8s HA under the hood: Kubernetes with Dqlite'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605218603
description: 'High availability (HA) is the cornerstone of any production-grade Kubernetes. MicroK8s, already popular for IoT and developer workstations, can, as of release 1.19, withstand the loss of any node and still provide reliable services for production workloads in cloud and server deployments. Its HA design delivers a zero-ops experience with no discounts in functionality. In this webinar, you will learn how the team in Canonical has made the most widely used database on the planet (SQLite) distributed. We will also discuss how automated devops over such a distributed database delivers seamless HA.'
