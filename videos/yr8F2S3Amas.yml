description: "Watch Andrew and Filip building an app from scratch in Flutter, including all the dead ends, blunders, and runtime errors.\n\nThis is a test. We hypothesize that a show like this might help people learn about the odds and ends of Flutter development that they wouldn’t see elsewhere. Please let us know in the comments if that hypothesis is correct. And if so, what would you like to see next?\n\nGet started with Flutter → https://flutter.io\nTry a Flutter codelab → https://goo.gl/d3fHPo \nJoin the conversation → https://goo.gl/68oUnb \n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel → http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
