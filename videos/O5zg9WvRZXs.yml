description: "Chrissy Brimmage (http://www.chrissybrimmage.com/) is a self-taught, multi-disciplinary artist from Atlanta, GA, currently living and working out of Brooklyn, NY. Her work explores her everyday emotions and feelings in reaction to sociopolitical issues and current events. Utilizing technologies such as 3D printing, generative code, and virtual reality, alongside contour line illustrations and animations, allows her to interactively enhance and highlight her own human experience, as well as others. Through this exploration she aims to illustrate how the human experience varies between social groups, and explore the potential to bridge those variations in perceptions through art and technology.\n\n0:00 Live Stream Start\n6:08 Introduction\n12:08 The Tender Foundation Fundraiser\n18:04 Introducing Chrissy Brimmage\n29:52 Starting on Blender\n30:14 Adding Reference Image\n34:48 Adding Views and First Steps\n1:08:22 Creating Mew\n2:13:46 Exporting the File\n2:16:27 Adding a Camera and Lights\n2:20:09 Rendering and Sharing\n2:30:55 #MewTrain and Community Contributions\n2:35:41 Goodbye!\n\n🔗 http://www.chrissybrimmage.com/\n🎨 https://www.instagram.com/chrissybrimmage/\n💻 https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-80/ (Download Blender to follow along!)\n🖼 mew image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ubHcRnNKfWPaH57lzNOj3HNyUZ13_0de/view?usp=sharing\n\nThe Tender Foundation (https://www.thetenderfoundation.com/) is driven by the desire to cultivate a community of care. We aim to help the mothers we serve shift out of “crisis mode”. Our stabilization program alleviates some of the financial burdens many mothers in our city face and connects them with long-term resources to help achieve sustainable financial independence. Our courageous mothers come to us in times of crises and they emerge empowered and secure. We believe a little tender loving care can go a long way in changing the lives of our mamas and their children.  \n\n🔗 https://www.thetenderfoundation.com\n🎨 https://www.instagram.com/tender/\n---------------\n\n🚂 Website: http://thecodingtrain.com/ \n💬Discord: https://discord.gg/hPuGy2g\n💖 Membership: http://youtube.com/thecodingtrain/join\n🛒 Store: https://standard.tv/codingtrain\n📚 Books: https://www.amazon.com/shop/thecodingtrain\n\n🎥 Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\n🎥 Intro to Programming: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA\n\n🔗 p5.js: https://p5js.org\n🔗 Processing: https://processing.org"
