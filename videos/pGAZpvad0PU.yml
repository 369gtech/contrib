description: "The Automotive industry is one of the most important drivers (pun intended) of the Czech economy. With more than 1,4 million cars produced per year, 800 companies involved and 160 000 direct employees, Automotive is considered the largest industry in the Czech Republic accounting for more than 9 % of GDP.\n\nWith constant flood of buzzwords (IIoT, Industry 4.0, Digital factory 2.0, Autonomous Driving just to name a few), the aim of this talk is to present a more realistic and data-driven perspective of the industry as well as look at the advantages and challenges of Data Science projects within this environment.\n\nhttps://pydata.cz/\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
