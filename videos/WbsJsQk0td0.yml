description: "by Lorna Mitchell\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.120/python_markup_to_pdf.webm\n\n\nPython is brilliant at many things, but did you know it could also create beautiful documents from simple markup? Discover rst2pdf in this session. Introducing: rst2pdf. This open source python project enables you to write simple, text-based markup and generate beautiful PDF documents with a single command. Using text-based content makes collaboration simple as source control tools can be used; it also allows content to be easily repurposed to different documents without reformatting. The styling can be changed independently and different formats produced from the same content source - it also supports syntax highlighting. This talk will also cover a bit about the state of the open source project itself and how people can get involved as users or contributors. \n\nRoom: UD2.120 (Chavanne)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:00:00+01"
