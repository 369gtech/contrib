In this session you’ll get introduced to Nashorn and will get answers to the following questions:\n\n - What does it bring to the Java world?\n - What capabilities does it provide for the server and the client sides?\n - How can you leverage Nashorn in the real-life projects?\n\nYou’ll also learn how can we use it today, even before Nashorn is integrated into public JDK8 builds."
