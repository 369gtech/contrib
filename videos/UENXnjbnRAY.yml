title: 'Java MapReduce Programming on Apache Hadoop: A Whirlwind Tour'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433516671
description: "In this session, take a whirlwind tour of MapReduce programming in Java for Apache Hadoop. MapReduce is a powerful paradigm and implementation that enables developers to write massively parallel programs while abstracting away the gory details of distributed systems. MapReduce acts as the main processing framework behind Hadoop, a platform that leverages clusters of commodity machines to store and churn through huge data sets. The session starts with the basics of how to write and submit a simple MapReduce job and then delves into advanced features such as combiners, custom partitioners, counters, serialization with custom writables and Apache Avro, unit testing with Apache MRUnit, and the distributed cache.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSandy Ryza\nSandy Ryza is a software engineer on the scheduling team at Cloudera, working on MapReduce and resource management.  He graduated from Brown University, where he conducted research on vehicle routing and logistics optimization using MapReduce.\nView more trainings by Sandy Ryza at https://www.parleys.com/author/sandy-ryza\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
