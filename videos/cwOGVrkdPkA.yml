We will cover the tools used for interacting with containerd, such as ctr and crictl. We’ll also show you how to monitor pods and containers using Prometheus and go over containerd’s plugin model to show how containerd was built to support new custom extensions. You’ll learn about Kubernetes’ Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and how to configure containerd’s CRI plugin to enable using containerd as the container runtime for Kubernetes. By the end you will understand how to get started using containerd as a developer, contributor, or system administrator for a wide variety of use cases.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuL6"
