The scaling property of stable laws allows for dimensionless reduction approach when designing the model. The family of stable laws includes Gaussian distribution as well as Cauchy or Levy distribution. When we relax the assumptions on tail decay in the central limit theorem, limiting distribution will be from the class of stable laws with stability parameter less than two. The distributions have been well explored for many decades, especially favourited by Benoit Mandelbrot or physicists modelling anomalous diffusion. The numerical obstacles with computing the density of stable laws have been an active field of research. In this talk we give a Stable Laws 101 tutorial, describe the troubles with numerical implementations in the majority of statistical packages and provide an overview of possible remedies. We also show how the stable laws can be modified and used in modelling of the financial products as established in Karlova & Hagan: [On Beyond Black](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303498076_On_Beyond_Black)\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
