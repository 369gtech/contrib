description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMichael T. Nygard - Author of \"Release It!\"\n\nABSTRACT\nIn operations, it is conventional wisdom that most incidents (read: failures) occur immediately after someone makes changes to the system. Hence, elaborate change management systems are supposed to reduce this risk. On the other hand, both lean and agile disciplines say, \"When something is painful, do it more often,\" because we improve at that which we practice. How can we resolve these opposing perspectives?\n\nIt turns out that conventional wisdom deals more with perceived risk than true risk. Conventional wisdom is dangerous. This session will examine the true origins of risk, starting with an economic foundation, and developing ideas about how to reduce real risk.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
