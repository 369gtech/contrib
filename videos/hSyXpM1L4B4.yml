description: "Filmed at http://js-kongress.de on November 28-29 in Munich\n\nWhy microcontrollers are awesome, why existing cross-compilation can be painful (especially when thereâ€™s no debugging), and how putting a JS Interpreter on the microcontroller itself can make it fast and easy to develop and debug your code. With some live-coding of hardware!"
