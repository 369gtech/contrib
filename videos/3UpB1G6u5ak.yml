The faster I learn the domain I am working in, the faster I will add value to that product. I always start by looking at the tests; they should reflect what the software is built for and how it needs to behave. \n\nHowever, the tests seldom reflect the same language as the code, the documentation and the communication. Inconsistent language usually is one of the reasons testing slows down the software delivery process. A lot of ‘ping-pong’ going on between several disciplines and even though the product is rigorously tested, there are still a lot of bugs found in production. It is hard, or even impossible to build the right product if there is inconsistency in the language used to communicate.\n\nJoin me in this talk where I will show you how to leverage Domain-Driven Design throughout testing. You will learn how to make the language of your tests consistent with the communication used, and create tests that can serve as living documentation.\n\nBiography\n\nKenny Baas is a Software Engineer and Consultant focusing on software quality at Xebia. He mentors and coaches teams by using practices and techniques from Domain Driven Design, Behaviour Driven Development, Test Driven Development, and Continuous Delivery. \n\nHe is an advocate for multidisciplinary collaboration in open spaces. By using techniques such as Event Storming, and Example Mapping, he helps engineer requirements to design and model software. With these methods, he aims to create a transparent, collaborative domain space with constant and instant feedback when delivering software.\n\nBesides his daily work, he also helps organise meetups for Behaviour Driven Development NL and Domain Driven Design Nederland."
