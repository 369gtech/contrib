title: 'Decoding Satellites with SatNOGS'
recordingDate: 1485477937
description: "Scott Bragg\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/185/\nThe past few months at our local amateur radio club we have been experimenting with working Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites using handheld equipment. That's where I stumbled into the SatNOGS project. While my rotator has not finished being built this talk will partly be about building the rotator, how the client and network API fits together and different ways you can get involved in the project."
