description: "It's (post) Java 11 time now. (Just in case your boss didn't notice ;-)\n\nIn this talk, I'd like to tell you how I managed to migrate two real Java server apps to Java 11 and show some demos.\n\nWhy was it done?\n\nHow to convince the business?\n\nWhat and how was done?\n\nWhat wasn't required?\n\nDoes anyone read licenses, manuals, and talks' descriptions?\n\nWhere did I fail in the first approach?\n\nWas it worth it?\n\nSome hints for you.\n\nPiotr Przybyl:\nNotorious engineer at work and after hours, tracing meanders of the art of software engineering. Software Gardener, mostly working in web-oriented Java gardens. Fan of agility, seen mostly as choosing the right tools and approaches. Lead developer, trainer and conference speaker."
