description: "From the 2014 Solid Conference, Alec Saunders announces Project Ion in his Keynote talk, \"Time to Get Personal: Enabling a Human-centric Approach to IoT\".\n\nData is important, but customers matter. Until IoT can deepen customer relationships and enrich user experiences, it won't live up to its true potential. The challenges, of course, are many when businesses need to tap into massive amounts of data and extract meaningful information, without compromising security. In this keynote, Alec Saunders looks at the current state of IoT and demonstrates how it can move beyond its operational focus to become a far more powerful and human-centric approach to growing your business.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by BlackBerry.\n\nAbout Alec Saunders (QNX Software Systems):\nAs vice president of QNX Software Systems' new cloud business, Alec Saunders is responsible for developing strategies that will grow market share and revenue for the company's cloud products and services.
