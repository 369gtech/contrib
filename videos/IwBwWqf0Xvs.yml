description: "by Martijn Kaijser\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/media_kodi.webm\n\n\nKodi v18 has been in development for over two and finally it is released. During this presentation we go through the most important parts that were added or changed and what this actually means for the future. During past two years developers in and outside of the Kodi Team have been steadily refactoring and working on new features that will be included in Kodi v18. Although we initially thought about doing a RERO release it ended up being quite the opposite.  In this presentation we will go through the most important parts that are actually included and why it took so long to come to a final release. Additionally we will briefly cover some parts that we already know will go into v19 at the moment we branched of the current v18 release. \n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 11:00:00+01"
