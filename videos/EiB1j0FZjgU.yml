description: "Join us as we are taking a look at the latest device in the NVIDIA Jetson line of GPU-accelerated IoT devices, the Jetson Xavier NX.  A device which brings supercomputer-class performance to Edge applications in an ultra-compact form-factor.  To demonstrate this, we configure the device with Azure IoT Edge and deploy the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK Module from the Azure Marketplace to produce object detection telemetry with Azure Stream Analytics then push those results into Time Series Insights and Power BI.  Come see how the pairing of NVIDIA devices and Azure IoT Services make for a first-class solution of AI at the Edge!\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA DeepStream on IoT Edge: https://aka.ms/iotshow/NVIDIADeepStream"
