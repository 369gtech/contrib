description: "The biggest barrier to good experiences (as well as the largest problem for most UX designers) is in getting well-intended, well-designed systems executed as the business owners and design teams intend. I present the problem, and a series of philosophical changes and specific tactics to alleviate this, and to work with implementation teams to get design executed correctly.\n\nAbout Steven Hoober:\n\nSteven Hoober has been documenting design process for all of his 15 years in interactive design, and entered mobile full time in 2007 when he joined Little Springs Design. His work includes the design process book Designing by Drawing, frequent blog entries on design, and a collection of well-used drawing tools and templates. Steven has led projects on security, account management, content distribution, and communications services for products from construction supplies to hospital recordkeeping.
