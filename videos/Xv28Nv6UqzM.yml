description: "Deploying apps to Function as a Service (FaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) on cloud have become very popular due to ease of use and scaling on demand without having to care about managing any infrastructure. But just because there is no infrastructure to patch and manage doesnâ€™t mean that they are secure by default, the app developer is still responsible for security of the application.\n\nThis talk will provide practical tips to secure your Azure functions and App Service apps. It will include integrating with other services like azure storage, service bus, Cosmos Db and virtual network that are frequently used together in a microservices architecture.\n\n(This talk will assume some knowledge of Azure Functions and Azure App Services)\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
