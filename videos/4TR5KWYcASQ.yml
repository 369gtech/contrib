recordingDate: 1579728573
description: "In the pre-Kubernetes, pre-container world, backup and recovery solutions were generally implemented at the virtual machine (VM) level. This system works for traditional applications when an application runs on a single VM, but when applications are containerized and managed with an orchestrator like Kubernetes, this system falls apart. Because of this, effective disaster recovery for Kubernetes must be designed for containerized architectures and natively understand the way Kubernetes functions in order to work.\n\nIn this webinar, we will:\n\n– Explain key disaster recovery concepts including zero recovery point objective (RPO) and near-zero recovery time objective (RTO)\n– Discuss how modern architectures are changing the disaster recovery game and why you may want to consider making a disaster recovery plan for your team\n– Dive into five key traits for effective disaster recovery on Kubernetes, including container granularity and ability to backup data and configurations"
