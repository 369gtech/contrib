description: "How does an autoencoder work? Autoencoders are a type of neural network that reconstructs the input data its given. But we don't care about the output, we care about the hidden representation its learned. Its a lower dimensional compression of the input that preserves its features. We can use this learned representation for tasks like image colorization, dialogue generation, and anomaly detection. \n\nCode for this video (with Coding Challenge):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/autoencoder_explained\n\nPlease Subscribe!
