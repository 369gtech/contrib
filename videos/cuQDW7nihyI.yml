description: 'Virtual Reality (VR) is nothing new. @ the Mesdag in the Hague you can step into a 360° degree painting for over a 100 years. These museums where all over Europe and exchanged paintings with each other. In the late 80s and 90s virtual reality gained popularity but not enough to break through. Now fast-forward in 2016 we use our smartphones to experience virtual reality. We can immerse ourselves into 360° movies & VR games. But VR can also be used for serious means like product marketing and for health & safety trainings. Adriaan Rijkens will dive into these topics and share practical examples.'
