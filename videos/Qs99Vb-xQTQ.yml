language: English
recordingDate: 1574371564
description: "Presented at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh.\n\nProperty based types (PBT) is a theory of reasoning in the human mind that overcomes known limitations of digital computing, artificial intelligence. and formal logic. This session points out capabilities and limitations of classical logic, formal methods, and automated theorem proving especially in comparison to conventional digital computing, artificial intelligence methods, and reasoning in the human mind.\n\nThis presentation is part of a series on various aspects of property based types. Lectures are held on the second Thursday of each month. Previous sessions discussed the capabilities and limitations of digital computers and artificial intelligence, respectively. The July session will address the deductive logic of the human mind and the August session will address how PBT is able to emulate the logic of the mind.\n\nDavid A. Fisher is the founder and chief technologist at Reasoning Technology LLC and an emeritus professor at Carnegie Mellon University. He has had an eclectic career as an engineer, scientist, inventor, teacher, Government executive, corporate officer, entrepreneur, and venture capitalist. He has a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon with earlier degrees in mathematics and electrical engineering."
