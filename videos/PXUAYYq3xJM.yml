description: "In 2010 I came across a strange, new (to me!) architecture that the LMAX team used for their Foreign Exchange system. You might have heard about the Disruptor, it came out of this project.\n\nThe core of our system is a clustered service which uses the Raft consensus algorithm to reliably replicate state between the different nodes and hosts our application logic. We will take a quick look at Raft and then at the benefits of this design compared to more “mainstream” architectures. This architecture offers a clean separation of concerns between the infrastructure – which takes care of the concurrency, I/O and high availability aspects – and the application logic. The clean architecture is a great fit for domain-driven design.\nIf you fancy building fast, resilient services without a database you should come to this talk!\n\nOLIVIER:\nOlivier is one of the co-founders of Adaptive, a consulting firm based in London, New York, Barcelona and Montreal and delivering trading systems for the financial and commodities industries. He is working as a developer and technical architect with 15+ years experience building large scale event driven systems. He also contributed to several open source projects, including the Disruptor, Aeron and SBE.\n\nJAMES:\nJames is a developer at Adaptive. He spends most of his time building large event driven systems in Java and C#. When he's not doing that, he is the maintainer of the Aeron.NET project, a library to enable efficient and reliable message transport.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
