description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2019. #gotocon #gotochgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nStephen Magill - World-recognized Expert on Program Analysis\n\nABSTRACT\nMachine learning is permeating every facet of our lives, from learning our preferences to self-driving cars, but what happens when you apply neural networks to code? How do you even view code as data? The key ideas are easy to summarize and fun to play with.\nThis talk will provide an overview of fundamental concepts of machine learning, and then delve into how learning can be used to analyze and improve code.\nThe talk will also provide pointers to available commercial and open source tools and discuss what’s been achieved so far (coding in English, context-aware code completion, automated Stack Overflow).\nThe talk will close with speculation on where the field is going [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/874\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#AI #automation #programming #ML"
