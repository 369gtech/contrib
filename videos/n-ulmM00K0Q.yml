title: 'Building a Front end Pipeline with Nathaniel Schutta'

recordingDate: 1526467524
description: 'Back in the day, it used to be so simple. Our projects had a main.js file that contained a few hundred lines and every so often the corporate communication department would ship out some new CSS files. But now things are not quite so easy. With more and more single page apps containing thousands or hundreds of thousands of lines of JavaScript, we''re going to need a bigger boat. In this talk I will explore various options you can deploy on your projects to tame the mass of code that lives on the front end of our applications. From NPM to Gulp to Webpack, this talk will help you establish a front end pipeline.'
