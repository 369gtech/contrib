recordingDate: 1588100332
description: "Service mesh is the future of application connectivity. It delivers immediate value to any architecture by increasing the security, reliability and observability of our application traffic. However, understanding and deploying service meshes in production is a daunting undertaking. This session will focus on understanding service mesh from the basic concepts to the most advanced topics and talk practically about how we can implement service mesh in production.\n\nIn this webinar, Marco dives into how service mesh can be easily used to solve common challenges in your application architecture from day one. He will cover:\n\nService mesh explained: concepts, benefits and pitfalls.\nAdding security, reliability, and observability of service traffic with a mesh.\nLive demo of deploying a service mesh in production in minutes on Kubernetes.\n\nThese concepts will be demoed live using Kuma, an open-source control plane built on top of Envoy."
