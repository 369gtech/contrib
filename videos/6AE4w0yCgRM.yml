description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nThe entranceways to the dorms at Hogwarts were guarded by paintings that talked and asked for passwords. What if that were real?! The recent availability of machine learning as an API opens up the door to an exponential growth in the possibilities for 'smart' devices. In this talk, we explore a Harry Potter style 'security' system that can both see and hear."
