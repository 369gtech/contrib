description: "The talk from JS Fest conference 2019 Autumn\nin Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/2K9FpY4\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/JSFestua/\nWebsite: https://jsfest.com.ua\n\n\nBlockchain and decentralized applications are getting used more and more often. Many big enterprises like IBM, Walmart, Alibaba, FedX, British Airways, and others are already integrating blockchain into their ecosystems.\nAs most of the applications on the web, decentralized applications require a client to make interaction with them user-friendly. I would like to share how to connect/integrate JavaScript applications with decentralized, blockchain services. Take a look at what are the differences between decentralized and standard backends, what challenges and issues developers might meet."
