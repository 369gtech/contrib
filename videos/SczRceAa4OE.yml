description: "by Marcin Kolny\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/profiling_low_end_platforms_hawktracer.webm\n\n\nHawkTracer is low-overhead instrumentation-based profiler built at Amazon Video for platforms with limited capabilities. It's highly extensible (at compile time) and portable so it can be run on almost any embedded device. In this talk I'll briefly talk about history of the profiler (why did I start it, and how did I manage to publish it to open source world), introduce the architecture of the profiler, present it's advantages and limitations, show how can you instrument the code and demonstrate the profiler in action by running it with an example project. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 16:30:00+01"
