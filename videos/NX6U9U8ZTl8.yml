description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nReimagining the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid on Kubernetes - Lukas Heinrich, CERN & Alessandra Forti, University of Manchester \n\nAt CERN, the home of the web, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN hosts some of the largest physics experiments ever constructed. The distributed infrastructure built over the last 20 years -- the World-wide LHC computing grid (WLCG) would today be described a federated, multi-cloud and multi-cluster deployment, mostly made up of a diverse set of research institute batch systems deployed on bare-metal or VMs. The rise of containers is an opportunity to reimagine the WLCG deployed on Kubernetes. In this talk we will cover how we leverage CNCF tools in this transition. Using e.g. containerd snapshotters for worldwide image distribution, Helm GitOps for reproducible configuration of multi-cluster setups and our deployment of services and batch workloads in that system. In a demo, we will deploy a member of the federation which will then receive workloads to analyze subatomic collision data.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zetd"
