description: "From Velocity Amsterdam 2015: As software deployments and related infrastructure changes become more frequent than ever, we should also ensure “continuous performance” of our application, the underlying infrastructure, and ultimately the business that they serve. Continuous performance monitoring should not only help to keep our systems and applications fast and available, but also help us understand the performance and business impact of deployments and other changes.\n\nIn this talk we discuss the different components of continuous performance monitoring:\n\nStart with the business impact \nAs continuous deployments aim to deliver business value in faster incremental steps, it becomes equally important to monitor business metrics alongside performance metrics. This helps us to quantify the business value of new deployments, and prioritize performance problems based on business impact.\n\nMeaningful technical metrics\nWhen there is business impact, we want to understand which technical components are causing it, if any. Therefore we need to collect detailed and meaningful performance metrics, both front-end, as our users are experiencing performance; and back-end, to understand the impact of system performance on application performance.\n\nMonitor changes and their impact\nContinuous performance monitoring should not only monitor individual metrics at the application, infrastructure, and business level. It should also track each change itself, which means basically any event that has an impact on performance at an application, infrastructure, and business level. Such events add context to the metrics we collect, and serve as milestones to perform before-after analysis.\n\nMaking sense of the data\nNext to collecting the right metrics and events, continuous performance monitoring should also bring valuable insights from the data, in light of our continuous deployment efforts. This can be done through a combination of dashboards, intelligent alerting, and analytics, in which business impact again serves as a top level metric.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by CoScale.\nAbout Stijn Polfliet (CoScale):\nStijn Polfliet is the CTO of CoScale, a provider of web performance analytics software. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Ghent University in Belgium, after which he co-founded CoScale, where he leads product management and strategy. His interests focus on web application technologies and performance aspects.\n\nWatch more from Velocity Amsterdam 2015: https://goo.gl/RjGAuw\nVisit the Velocity website: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
