The best part is live instruction, with playback. You get all the presentations and labs. Great instructions. But my favorite feature is viewing a previous class. They provide a set of videos from a previous session, so you can watch the course before you participate. This way you can get the most out of the course. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! I have taken so many courses and then not really gotten to work with a technology until I forgot most of what was taught. Edureka lets you go back later, when your boss says \"I want this ASAP!\" ~ This is the killer education app... I've take two courses, and I'm taking two more. Love these guys.\""
