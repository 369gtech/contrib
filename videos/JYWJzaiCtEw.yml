description: "Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) are types composed of other types. There are two classes of them - product and sum types. Although there is a better support in JavaScript for product types, we can also use sum types as well. In this lightning talk, Marius, briefly explains what these different ADTs are and how can we use them to better model and think about our data.\n\nSlides: https://slides.com/mariusju/adts#/"
