description: "Can generative software systems be used to create entities that take on a life of their own? How do we relate to and interact with these entities? What is their emotional range, and where does it exist? Can we use art as a testing ground for theories of artificial intelligence?\n\nThis talk explores the speakerâ€™s personal art practice in the creation of organisms that live in code and express themselves as light inside interactive sculptures. Concepts involved range from NLP, generative design, digital fabrication, micro-controllers, physical computing, particle systems, animation, addressable lighting systems, evolutionary algorithms, and neural networks. Includes installation demo."
