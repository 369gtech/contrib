description: "Matthias Friedrich, Android Developer Beginner Cross-Plattform Development, Jimdo\n\nPRODUCTION FLUTTER'ING\nBeginner / Cross-Plattform Development / Talk\n\nEnd of 2017 we were about to start work on a completely new app that should lay ground for our whole companies mobile app strategy for the years to come. We decided to join forces of our two existing native mobile app developer teams and use Flutter Google’s new cross-platform framework for Android and iOS. Advantages like really well working hot-reload complete code sharing for both platforms and a modern reactive ui framework are just too good to be ignored. But Flutter is still in an early state and with that has its teething troubles and also very own shortcomings. In the first part of this talk I want to share the overall experience we made building our very first Flutter app and running it in production for over 3 months. The second half then goes full into live coding mode to show one of Flutter’s strengths: the easiness to build a fully customized animated graph the visual highlight of our still small but beautiful app. After the talk you hopefully have a better picture of what Flutter is capable of its state of maturity and which use-cases it’s already great to be taken for."
