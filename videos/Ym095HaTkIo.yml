description: "Service Meshes: The Production Readiness Checklist for the Rest of Us - Zachary Arnold & Austin Adams, Ygrene Energy Fund \n\nAt KubeCon Austin in 2017 during the Keynote sessions it was declared: \"2018 is the Year of the Service Mesh.\" At Ygrene, this has been a true statement. SM's have been a great evolution in service-to-service communication. However, the long and short of it is, these tools are not straightforward to simply drop into our clusters and watch them magically work for us. Because of this, we evaluated several service mesh tools using a rubric of our company's needs, and developed a production readiness checklist that would be relevant for any service mesh. We'll share with you our evaluation rubric and production readiness checklist which will hopefully aid you on your journey to better service-to-service communication. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grag"
