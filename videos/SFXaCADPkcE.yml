Authentication is already a big, scary subject and so is NgRx. When you put them together, things get confusing fast. In this talk, we’ll do a comparison of how authentication in a vanilla Angular app differs from auth in an NgRx app. We’ll then see how the central nervous system of authentication shifts from a service in regular Angular to Effects in NgRx.\n\nThis talk will be practical and code-driven, leaving you equipped to tackle adding this feature to your NgRx application at work on Monday. You’ll learn how Effects can handle loading authentication state, navigate users to protected routes, and process tokens received from an identity provider. By the end, you’ll feel way better about tackling auth in NgRx!\nWatch all the ng-conf: Hardwired presentations/videos at https://videos.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nng-conf: Hardwired is brought to you by:\n- https://thinkster.io/ The best Angular and JavaScript tutorials on the web\n- https://herodevs.com/ Engineering and consulting by web development experts\n- https://xlts.dev/  Extended support for AngularJS\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
