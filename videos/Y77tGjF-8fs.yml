description: "Google Tech Talk, 9/22/2015, Presented by Megan Prelinger\n\nABSTRACT: Cultural historian Megan Prelinger presents her book Inside the Machine, a visual history of the electronic age that captures the collision of technology and artâ€”and our collective visions of the future. A rich historical account of electronic technology in the twentieth century, Inside the Machine journeys from the very origins of electronics, vacuum tubes, through the invention of cathode-ray tubes and transistors to the bold frontier of digital computing in the 1960s. But the history of electronics in the twentieth century is not only a history of scientific discoveries carried out in laboratories across America. It is also a story shaped by a generation of artists, designers, and creative thinkers who gave imaginative form to the most elusive matter of all: electrons and their revolutionary powers.\n\nAbout Megan Prelinger: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Prelinger"
