description: "Collaboration from people located around the globe to a same project is now a common thing. In this episode of Hello World Frank is welcoming #GitHub expert to help us working faster and smarter.\n\nJoin the conversation live at https://aka.ms/HelloWorld    \n\n\nProject Management in GitHub\n----------------------------\nIn this demo, we learn how we can boost team productivity with new features from GitHub Issues. We'll transform task lists into issues, create standardized issue templates with YAML, and plan upcoming work on the new beta Project board.\n\nReach out to Rizel Scarlett on Twitter and GitHub: @blackgirlbytes\n\n- Issue Templates: https://docs.github.com/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository\n- Planning at Scale with Issues: https://youtu.be/ha1KHcPMAEk\n- Issues tutorial: https://youtu.be/MvyGcLg6AvI\n\n\nWorks on my machine\n-------------------\nGone are the days of asserting, \"It works on my machine\". With GitHub CodeSpaces, you can spin up a working environment in a matter of seconds with your preferences and needs in place. In this demo, we will quickly run a React app on CodeSpaces.\n\nReach out to Rizel Scarlett on Twitter and GitHub: @blackgirlbytes\n\nMaking #CodeSpaces work for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Z-rUixnzk\n\n\nMulti-stage deployments with GitHub Actions\n----------------------\nLearn more about multi-stage deployments. We'll show a deployment #workflow that builds, then deploys to staging with approvals for production.\n\nReach out to Damian Brady @damovisa\n\n- https://github.com/features/actions\n- https://docs.github.com/actions/deployment/about-deployments/deploying-with-github-actions\n\n\nDiego's Wall - The Real Reason\n------------------------------\nReach out to Diego Rejtman on https://linkedin.com/in/diegorejtman \n\n\nReusable workflows in GitHub Actions\n------------------------------------\nLearn more about reusable workflows.
