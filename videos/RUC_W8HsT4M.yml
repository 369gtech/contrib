description: "The journey of a craftsperson is difficult and never-ending, full of hard work, sweat, and tears but it is also a journey of joy, discovery, knowledge acquisition, and professional growth. Weâ€™ve created Novoda Craftsmanship University (NCU) so that employee's can take this journey together.\n\nIn this talk Paul Blundell will show how you can apply principles of craftsmanship to complex & iterative mobile Android & iOS products and how mobile craftspeople develop together and share knowledge at Novoda.\n\n// This talk was given by Paul Blundell at SC London 2017, a conference dedicated to Craftsmanship values, XP practices & clean code.
