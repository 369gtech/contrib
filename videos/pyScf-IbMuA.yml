description: "Relax! I'm not here to break your software. But I am here to show you how you can break the software you develop without changing the actual code!\nNow, I hear you thinking: \"Why on Earth should I do this? I have unit/integration/... tests\"\n\nAh, yes, you have tests. Tell me, do you test what happens if a third-party service goes down? Or takes a lot longer to respond when that service hits its busiest time of the day?\nOr what would happen if you tried to write data into a SQL database that has no more disk space?\n\nAll of these - and more! - cases can be discovered early, during development time. And I'll gladly show you how.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
