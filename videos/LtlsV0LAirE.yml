recordingDate: 1612991061
description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nCOMPOSE BY EXAMPLE\nNick Butcher, Android Designer & Developer, Google\n\nJetpack Compose is a new reactive UI toolkit built for the demands of creating modern user interfaces. Get started with Compose and learn about the new APIs and Material components that make up the toolkit by examining concrete UIs we’ve created with it. We’ll walk through examples of theming, animation, gestures, layout and more, demonstrating how to customise and combine components to build real UIs. We’ll show how the new toolkit simplifies your development experience and enables new possibilities.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro...​...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/...​\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
