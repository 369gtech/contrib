description: "James Lowey - CIO, TGen\n\nThe Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) is a non-profit organization dedicated to using genomic and other -omic generated information to provide a greater understanding of the underlying biological defects that cause diseases and disorders. The human genome has over 3 billion nucleotide base pairs residing in our 23 pairs of chromosomes, each of which has up to thousands of genes. Talk about looking into The Matrix! The bioinformatics industry is undergoing a sea change, driven by advances in biological research and gains in computational power that accelerates the ability to find treatments and cures. While inexpensive compute infrastructure made this work possible, managing those enormous workloads was a massive headache, until science found a cure: Docker! This talk will describe how TGen uses Docker and the Docker storage plugins API to run a large-scale, big data compute cluster to push the limits of biological science. You will learn: - How TGen uses bioinformatics to predict disease behavior and hypothesize a cure - How to package bioinformatics workloads into Docker containers How to orchestrate elastic compute clusters at scale - How to manage big data workloads using the Docker plugins API v2"
