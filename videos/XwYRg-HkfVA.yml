description: "How Big is Too Big? Problems with Scale at T-Mobile - Brendan Aye & James Webb, T-Mobile\n\nOver the last three years, T-Mobile has leaned in heavily on Cloud Foundry and the boost it brought to developer productivity. As the platform popularity \"hockey-sticked\", so did problems with operating large foundations.\n\nThrough it all, we struggled to find answers to two important questions:\nHow big is too big for a foundation?\nHow many foundations is too many?\n\nWithout clear answers, we stumbled in to the limit for both for our environment. Running entirely on-premise, hardware constraints underpinned most of the problems faced, as well as the possible solutions. We'll walk through some of the issues that came up in our larger foundations and what we did about them.\n\nAbout Brendan Aye\nCloud Foundry Platform Architect, T-Mobile\nBrendan Aye is the Principal Cloud Foundry architect at T-Mobile, where he has been working with Cloud Foundry for four years.\n\nAbout James Webb\nMember of Technical Staff, Platform Architecture, T-Mobile\nTechnical leader with 20+ years of infrastructure background currently focused on bringing on-premise Cloud Foundry & Kubernetes goodness to the enterprise.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
