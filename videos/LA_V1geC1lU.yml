description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nMetrics @UBER is a first class citizen. My talk will cover metrics collection, presentation and alerting based on metrics. It’s all about how we deal with the scale in incredibly fast growing company. I will include details on the tools we currently use, as well as our painful migration path from graphite based solution. I’ll show our build-in-house query language based on tags we’re using to query metrics and share my experience building, migrating and supporting metrics system at the fastest growing startup in the history."
