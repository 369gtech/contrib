description: "Connecting the dots - building and structuring a functional application in Scala\n\nFunctional programming relies on building programs from orthogonal, composable blocks. That's likely one of the reasons why full-blown application frameworks haven't gained much traction in the functional ecosystem.\nHowever, we still need to structure our code and wire up our applications in a way that lets us keep them modular, testable and simply pleasant to work with - in this talk, we will learn how to do just that!\nIn this talk, we will walk through the architecture design and testing setup for a functional app on the Typelevel stack that integrates with several third-party services to process data in a streaming fashion, and expose its results to downstream clients.\n\nJakub is a Senior Software Engineer who specializes in functional programming in Scala. He spends his free time learning about tech, experimenting with new libraries, skating and catching up on sleep.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit, www.yowconference.com.au"
