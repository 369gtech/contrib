title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Crazy Tricks with Views'
recordingDate: 1523570460
description: "Dive into the more complex ways the Views module can be used to create content lists with robust functionality. We’ll walk you through a year’s worth of Drupal 8 projects that had their own unique quirks and desires, and show you the little intricacies, roadblocks, and landmines we came across, and solutions not found in documentation. Come learn the creative ways we used to blow through (and beyond) the limitations of Drupal 8 Views and its integrations with other modules.\n\nThrough case studies and examples, this presentation will highlight how to:\n\nCreate faceted search views that go beyond the out-of-the-box widgets\nManipulate results using pre and post-execute view hooks\nCreate exposed dropdown filters and custom fields using the Views Plugin architecture\nCreate a “switcher” that allows visitors to display one view in many different ways"
