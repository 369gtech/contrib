description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nDenise Yu - Senior software engineer at GitHub\n\nABSTRACT\nDistributed systems are known for being notoriously difficult to wrangle. But why?\nThis talk will cover a brief history of distributed computing, clear up some common myths about the CAP theorem, dig into why network partitions are inevitable and close out by highlighting how a few popular consensus algorithms mitigate the risks of operating in a distributed fashion. We'll also take a look at how to design systems that take into account human factors, which can help reduce the impact of programmatic uncertainty [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:30 A long time ago, in a datacenter not too far away\n04:44 What does it mean to run a distributed system?\n06:40 8 fallacies of distributed computing\n08:03 CAP Theorem\n13:35 Hardware will fail, software will behave weirdly\n16:56 Humans\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1318/why-are-distributed-systems-so-hard\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#SoftwareArchitecture #DistributedSystems #Programming #Backend #CAPTheorem\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
