Our model is explainable by design as it explicitly shows how different compartments evolve and it uses interpretable encoders to incorporate covariates and improve performance. Explainability is valuable to ensure that the model's forecasts are credible to epidemiologists and to instill confidence in end-users such as policy makers and healthcare institutions. Our model can be applied at different geographic resolutions, and we demonstrate it for states and counties in the United States. We show that our model provides more accurate forecasts compared to the alternatives, and that it provides qualitatively meaningful explanatory insights.\n\nBio:\nVik has worked as a software engineer for 12 years in various capacities. A common theme across all his roles has been large data.\n\nIn his current role he solves Google's cloud customers AI problems particularly focussed in the public sector space. His last project involved building a novel ML augmented compartmental model for predicting the spread of Covid-19 in the US and Japan.\n\nHe spends most of his time hunting bugs in code and inconsistencies in data. In his spare time you will likely find him obsessing over weightlifting or riding a bike while listening to podcasts\n\nPresenter: Nisarg Raval\n\nTitle: Protecting Secrets using Adversarial Nets\n\nPresentation Overview:\nPersonal data collected from various smart devices are often offloaded to the cloud for analytics. This leads to a potential risk of disclosing private user information. On the other hand preventing apps from using user data hinders their functionality. In this talk, I present Olympus, a privacy framework that helps users balance privacy-utility trade-offs, and allow them to make an informed decision about sharing their data to apps in order to obtain services in return. Olympus achieves privacy by designing a utility aware obfuscation mechanism, where privacy and utility requirements are modeled as adversarial networks. Through experimentation on a real world app and on benchmark datasets, we show that Olympus successfully limits the disclosure of private information without significantly affecting functionality of the application.\n\nBio:\nNisarg earned his PhD in computer science at Duke University in 2019. After graduation, I joined LinkedIn as a machine learning engineer. Currently, he is a senior software engineer at Emerald Innovations.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
