description: "A talk about the architecture of the Spotify Desktop application, which is currently based on Web technologies. How we organize our teams, war stories and lessons learned during our development process.\n\nThis is not a talk about one specific framework or tool, but about how we work with JavaScript in an environment that is a bit different from most web-based apps, the experiences we've had and some ideas that can be useful and applicable in different contexts."
