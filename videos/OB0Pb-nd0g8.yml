description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Berlin 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOber\r\nhttp://gotober.com\r\n\r\nMichele Angioni - Senior Software Engineer at Lieferando\nMatt Fewer - Senior Software Engineer at Lieferando\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nTakeaway.com has been in business for 20 years. We support 150M orders every year and we operate in more than 10 countries. Over time, business requirements change, new technologies arise and certain processes become outdated. Combined with having development teams in offices all over the world, you can imagine the difficulties that a business can face while scaling their software architecture.\nThis talk provides general guidelines and strategies to plan and implement future-proof generations of APIs. It tells the story of how the development teams at Takeaway.com are tackling these challenges.\nIn the first part of the talk, Michele will speak about the Logistics team and how they approach the complexity of handling more than 10.000 drivers worldwide. He will discuss the principles behind building their APIs such as Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Microservices.\nThen, Matt will talk about the current migration project for rebuilding the front end application at Takeaway.com. He will walk through the evolution of their 20 year old codebase, and why the front end team decided to migrate to a more modern stack while implementing best practices for scaling the front end, such as Backend for Frontend (BFF) and Server Side Rendering (SSR) [...]\r\n\r\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\r\nhttps://gotober.com/2019/sessions/1136/designing-apis-for-150-million-orders\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOber\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\r\n#APIs #API #DDD #Microservices #Frontend #BFF #SSR\r\n\r\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\r\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
