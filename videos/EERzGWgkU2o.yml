description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotjs.io on November 9th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nIt goes without saying that one of the largest challenges in JavaScipt is handling asynchronicity. Along come Async / Await, a language feature made popular by C#. Developers can now use the keyword await to write code in a synchronous fashion without blocking the main thread. The only catch is that the await keyword needs to be used in an async function.\n\nWhat if that were not the case? What if await could be used anywhere inside a JavaScript module? Myles follows the adventure of implementing the Top-Level await feature in the JavaScript language. From deep dives into module loading to a high level overview of socializing standards changes, he covers the process of what it takes to change the JavaScript language."
