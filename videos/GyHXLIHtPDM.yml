description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nErlang provides an excellent framework for programming concurrent systems on multi and manycore CPUs.  In this talk we will discuss the work we have done at Concurix in enhancing Erlang and the underlying operating system to take advantage of manycore systems.  We will cover both real world benchmark results as well as detail some of the underlying technology improvements such as parametric memory configuration, automatic memoization, reducing locks, and so forth."
