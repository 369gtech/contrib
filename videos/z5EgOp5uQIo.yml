description: "How can we better collaborate on creating useful APIs? How to reduce the testing time of your application? How can the team build API backwards compatibility verification into their deployment process?\n\nIn this talk, Olga will discuss how to leverage the Consumer-Driven Contracts approach to solve these and other issues and present one of CDC implementations - Spring Cloud Contract. Olga will discuss practical use-cases and look at code examples.\n\nOlga will also point out some of the possible issues and ways of handling them, as well as some good practices I have learned while working both as a CDC tools end-user and their developer.\n\n====\n\nOlga Maciaszek-Sharma is a software engineer in Spring Cloud Team at VMware, where she works primarily on Spring Cloud LoadBalancer, Spring Cloud Contract (of which she was the first user and one of the first contributors), Spring Cloud OpenFeign and Spring Cloud Netflix projects."
