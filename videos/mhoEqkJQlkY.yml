description: "WebAssembly has huge implications for the web— it provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldn’t have done so Jerome Laban, CTO at nventive, will discuss (or - will share our real-project experiences to date on) how to build rich business apps with WebAssembly. \r\n\r\nYou will learn, in this talk, how to reuse .NET Standard application and C# code to make your applications run across all modern browsers and all OS with WASM. In this session, not only you will be able to see the magic happen in front of your very eyes - build and deploy a fully functional cross-platform app right before your eyes, you will also learn how to create cross-platform apps with maximum code reuse using C# and XAML that can work on WebAssembly but also on iOS, Android, Windows."
