description: 'Docker is not just a new container technology, it is a completely different approach to how we see software. The basic approach is to think about Docker containers as normal containers that are being used in the real world to ship goods. The talk will cover both the part where these containers are being shipped (Docker) and managed (Kubernetes). Starting with what made Docker possible in the first place and finishing with where it is being used right now and the potential use cases.'
