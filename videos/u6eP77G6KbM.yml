description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2017\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nImagine you’re a potter making your bowls on a wheel in your studio. Now imagine that your craft has a different workflow: you make your bowls by writing scripts that are executed by a bowl-making machine on the other side of the world without your participation. That’s the difference between a tightly coupled craft (your hands on the working material) and a loosely coupled craft (feedback too weak or too late to guide the process).\n\nThe craft of the potter involves a tightly coupled feedback loop. Our craft as programmers at best involves loose coupling.\n\nTest-Driven Development is a step toward tightening up the feedback loop that guides coding. Now imagine what might be different if our craft were so tightly coupled that our relationship with our software were more like the potter’s hands-on relationship with the clay.\n\nMy research examines how we can make application development a tightly coupled craft by exploiting the human’s tight hand-eye-brain feedback loop. I’ll report a set of design principles, demonstrate a proof-of-concept “hands-on” application-construction tool, and show how building with live data using such a tool can alter the dynamics of the construction process. Then I’ll suggest how adopting processes built on these ideas can further draw domain experts into the application-development process."
