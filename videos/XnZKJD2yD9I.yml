recordingDate: 1557269117
description: "C# has come a long way during its two decades of existence and is one of the world’s most popular programming languages. We continue to evolve it eagerly, with the aid of a vibrant open source community.\r\n \r\nC# 8.0 is right around the corner, and addresses core software development challenges: Tired of null reference exceptions? Find and fix risky code using “Nullable Reference Types”. Working with data in real time? “Asynchronous Streams” can help with that. Can’t evolve your interfaces? Give new members a “Default Implementation”.\r\n \r\nWe’ll conclude by peeking beyond C# 8.0 to problems we’ll try to tackle next."
