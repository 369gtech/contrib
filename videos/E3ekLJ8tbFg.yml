We wish him a speedy recovery.❮/em❯\nKotlin coroutines is a Framework inspired by Go channels and C# await features.\nIt introduces the principle of supending functions and enhances it with powerful tools like Channels and Flows.\n\n\nIn this talk I will present the Framework and its best practices, with code examples to show how to leverage it.\nThis is a feedback of VLC-Android migration to coroutines which helped to improve threading capabilities, performances and helped suppress callback hells.\n\nRoom: UA2.118 (Henriot)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 10:30:00"
