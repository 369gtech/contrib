description: "This talk took place at CukenFest London 2019, our annual conference for BDD enthusiasts. More info here - http://cukenfest.cucumber.io\n\nHow do you come to a common understanding of requirements? How can the implementation of the requirements be designed together with the department, the developers and the testers, so that it is transparent for everyone involved at every stage? How can Gherkin be used as a common language and lead to \"living documentation\"? Christine Groebel, Senior Business Analyst and Product Owner at BNP Paribas SA, will share her experiences of the specific challenges you face while implementing BDD in a highly regulated environment like a bank.\n\nSlides - https://speakerdeck.com/cucumberbdd/between-quality-and-time-to-market-how-to-specify-and-test-an-application-in-an-agile-context-with-a-bdd-approach-christine-groebel"
