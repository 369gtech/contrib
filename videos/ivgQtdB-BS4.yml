Current Market Situation\n2. Hadoop Map-Reduce vs Apache Spark \n    a. Performance\n    b. Ease of Use\n    c. Cost\n    d. Data Processing\n    e. Security\n    f. Fault Tolerance\n3. Real-time example of Map-Reduce\n4. Real-time example of Spark\n\nCheck our complete Apache Spark and Scala playlist here: https://goo.gl/ViRJ2K\n\nDo subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future.\n\n#HadoopVSSpark #MapReduceVS Spark #Edureka\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHow it Works?\n\n1. This is a 4 Week Instructor-led Online Course, 32 hours of assignment and 20 hours of project work\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n3. At the end of the training, you will have to work on a project, based on which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nAbout the Course\n\nThis Spark training will enable learners to understand how Spark executes in-memory data processing and runs much faster than Hadoop MapReduce. Learners will master Scala programming and will get trained on different APIs which Spark offers such as Spark Streaming, Spark SQL, Spark RDD, Spark MLlib and Spark GraphX. This Edureka course is an integral part of Big Data developer's learning path.\n\nAfter completing the Apache Spark and Scala training, you will be able to:\n\n1) Understand Scala and its implementation\n2) Master the concepts of Traits and OOPS in Scala programming\n3) Install Spark and implement Spark operations on Spark Shell \n4) Understand the role of Spark RDD\n5) Implement Spark applications on YARN (Hadoop) \n6) Learn Spark Streaming API \n7) Implement machine learning algorithms in Spark MLlib API \n8) Analyze Hive and Spark SQL architecture \n9) Understand Spark GraphX API and implement graph algorithms \n10) Implement Broadcast variable and Accumulators for performance tuning\n11) Spark Real-time Projects\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nWho should go for this Course?\n\nThis course is a must for anyone who aspires to embark into the field of big data and keep abreast of the latest developments around the fast and efficient processing of ever-growing data using Spark and related projects. The course is ideal for:\n\n1. Big Data enthusiasts \n2. Software Architects, Engineers, and Developers \n3. Data Scientists and Analytics professionals\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nWhy learn Apache Spark?\n\nIn this era of ever-growing data, the need for analyzing it for meaningful business insights is paramount. There are different big data processing alternatives like Hadoop, Spark, Storm and many more. Spark, however, is unique in providing batch as well as streaming capabilities, thus making it a preferred choice for lightning fast big data analysis platforms.\nThe following Edureka blogs will help you understand the significance of Spark training:\n\n5 Reasons to Learn Spark: https://goo.gl/7nMcS0\nApache Spark with Hadoop, Why it matters: https://goo.gl/I2MCeP\n \nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: +18336900808 (Toll Free) or India: +918861301699"
