description: "Yo ninjas, what's going on? In this CSS tutorial for beginner's we'll be mixing it up with some awesome attribute selectors - which, quite honestly, are one of the coolest types of selectors in CSS, full stop. Attribute selectors can help us target those elements which do not have a class, ID, or any way of finding it via child or descendant selectors. Swot up on you attribute selectors to become a true CSS ninja! Keep coding, and have fun :).\n\nLink to HTML video with information about HTML attributes - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJWcX2EDAKg&index=3&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n========== HTML Basics Course ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
