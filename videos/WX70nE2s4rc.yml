Real-time event-based systems process millions of messages per second by defining and combining small flows to create processing graphs. This session talks about a reactive approach to your application design, and how to account for handling events in near real time employing the Functional Reactive Programming paradigm, which is used to implement complex reactive system with simple and composable semantic.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/riccardo-terrell\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - RICCARDO TERRELL\nA functional guy living in an imperative world \n\nRiccardo Terrell is a seasoned software engineer and Microsoft MVP who is passionate about functional programming. He is active in the .NET community and believes in polyglot programming as a mechanism for finding the right tool for the job.\n\nwww.rickyterrell.com\n\nMore on Riccardo Terrell: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/riccardo-terrell\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
