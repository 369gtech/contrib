title: 'Real Time Is Coming To Linux: What Does That Mean To You'
language: English
recordingDate: 1541264505
description: "The Real Time patch (what makes Linux into a true Real Time operating system) has been developed out of the kernel since 2004. 14 years later, there is a real effort to finally make it into the mainline kernel, within the next year. All the major road blocks that have kept it from being merged have now been solved. But once it is in mainline, all kernel developers will now be responsible for not breaking it. Being real-time friendly is not hard, and in fact, it forces you to write cleaner and more maintainable code. This talk will focus on what kernel developers will need to understand about PREEMPT_RT, whether they are writing core kernel code, or some fringe kernel driver. Even if you do not care about PREEMPT_RT, come and learn about some programming tips for keeping your code maintainable. \n\nEVENT:\n\nEmbedded Linux Conference 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSteven Rostedt, VMware\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxJm-Ujipcg"
