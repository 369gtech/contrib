description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nMutual TLS Adoption Made Simple, Safe and Secure - Lizan Zhou, Tetrate & Jianfei Hu, Google \n\nRolling out mutual TLS to service meshes is challenging. In the real world, service mesh adoptions are incremental. Services deployment are heterogenous, consisting of workloads with or without sidecar, able or unable to speak mutual TLS, on both client and server side. Coordinating the mutual TLS rolling out with service mesh adoption is hard.  In this talk, Jianfei and Lizan will explain the lessons learned from the last several years experience. Specifically, we walk through Envoy innovations to address the problem on both client and server side: TLS sniffing on the server side and per endpoint mutual TLS labeling mechanism on the client side. In the end, we show how these techniques combined together to offer a frictionless user journey to adopt mutual TLS safely.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zesi"
