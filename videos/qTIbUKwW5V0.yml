There are more speakers talking about web accessibility, and this is a very good fact! Standards like WCAG and applications like ARIA are doing good work.

It doesn’t matter if you are an iOS, Android, Swift, Java, C#, Windows,.. developer, all the design techniques we are describing are universal idea’s that you can implement in each language or system!"
