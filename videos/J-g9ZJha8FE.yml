title: 'Custom Hooks in React: The Ultimate UI Abstraction Layer - Tanner Linsley | JSConf Hawaii 2020'
language: English

description: "Custom Hooks in React are useful for much more than just managing the local state and one-dimensional side-effects you see in almost every React Hooks example.\n\nThey can be used to build sophisticated memoization pipelines and chained-effects that automatically manage local and network resources.\n\nBut most importantly, they provide a new new layer of abstraction to accomplish new and amazing patterns that we couldn't have just over a year ago.\n\nOn the surface, this abstraction layer is simply collection of custom hooks, but when unlocked, it can be the most powerful piece of your application architecture.\n\nJSConf Hawaii will return soon\nhttps://www.jsconfhi.com/"
