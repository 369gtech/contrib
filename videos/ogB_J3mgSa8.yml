description: "RubyConf 2019 -  Speeding up NMatrix by 100x by Udit Gulati 1\n\nWith the growing need for fast numerical computing tools, there is a need for a library in Ruby which can perform at the level of NumPy in Python and can provide as much rich API. In this talk, we'll explore how NMatrix is being re-implemented to match this need and how it ended up getting renamed as NumRuby. We'll further explore the progress so far on NumRuby and potential future work.\n\r\n\nWe'll further explore how one can make the best use of Ruby C extensions for fast number crunching and not end up messing things up.\n\n#rubyconf2019 #confreaks"
