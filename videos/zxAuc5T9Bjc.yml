title: 'Stateful Functions: Flexible like a Microservice, Consistent like a Monolith'
recordingDate: 1635787805
description: "Microservice architectures have taken the world by storm, allowing teams to develop, deploy, and manage components independently. Modern infrastructure has accelerated this trend as tools like Kubernetes and AWS Lambda make it easier than ever to deploy multiple services. However, organizations have found this flexibility comes at a cost; it is difficult to reason about correctness and consistency. \nStateful Functions is the newest addition to Apache Flink. It brings broad support for building event-driven applications by bridging the monolith/microservice divide. As a result, organizations no longer have to sacrifice flexibility for correctness by using an SDK that allows developers to build and maintain components independently, with a runtime that provides consistency between services automatically. This talk introduces Stateful Functions, explores core concepts, and shows how it simplifies common operational challenges through real-world examples of event-driven applications."
