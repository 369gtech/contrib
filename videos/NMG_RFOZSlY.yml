description: "React v16 brings with it a very exciting update known as React Fibre. Fibre is a re-implementation of Reacts core which brings with it a heap of performance improvements, an official renderer API and fixes many long standing issues without changing the public API of React.\n\nIn this session we will briefly cover how React works, it's basic concepts, what makes up React's core and the features that Fibre will open up like error boundaries, returning multiple components from render, building custom renderers and more.\n\nAfter this session you will have a solid understanding of the fundamental patterns that React is built on so you can take advantage of the more advanced Fibre features like time slicing when it's released."
