description: "JavaFX offers a lot of awesome features for creating modern, interactive user interfaces. But in addition to a shiny UI, there are other important issues that must be considered when youâ€™re creating business applications with JavaFX. This presentation gives an overview of various best practices for solving problems such as the communication between server and client, async background tasks, MVC approaches, and the designing of complex dialogue flows. The Java EE platform already defines a lot of good solutions that can be converted to JavaFX application development. In addition, frameworks such as DataFX, ControlsFX, and Open Dolphin provide some useful features and techniques that can be used here.\n\n\nAuthor:\nHendrik Ebbers\nHendrik Ebbers is Java Architect at Canoo Engineering AG and lives in Dortmund, Germany.
