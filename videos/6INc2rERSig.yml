description: "It is such an amazing thing to get involved in Computer Science. There is so much happening around various topics like machine learning, privacy, virtual reality, and cloud computing just to name a few. As exciting as those topics are, they can be extremely intimidating if you are not familiar with the fundamentals. In this session, we will review some of the foundational concepts that are important for every computer science student to understand. We'll be using the Python programming language to help drive some examples, but these ideas are all applicable across most programming languages.\n\nTake Your First Steps with Python: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/python-first-steps/?WT.mc_id=SDC-8397-cephilli"
