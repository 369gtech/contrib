description: "Organizations recognize that data is what fuels digital transformation and are looking for new ways to unlock the value of their data and accelerate their journey to AI. Thatâ€™s why 80 percent of business leaders view AI as a strategic opportunity. Yet only 19 percent understand the data required for AI. Further, only 1 in 20 AI models make it to production and deliver any ROI. Simply put: There is no AI without information architecture (IA). Dinesh Nirmal examines how, with a unified, prescriptive information architecture, organizations can successfully unlock the value of their data for AI, as well as trust and control the business impact and risks of AI while coexisting in a multicloud world.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
