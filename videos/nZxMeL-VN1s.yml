description: "Tutorial:  https://gist.github.com/sleepynate/c32505a3fb49292f7967\n\nNathan focuses on how developers can code better by defining in a provable way how code should function before it is written. Test-driving code reduces the penchant for writing code developers don't need while increasing productivity on the code they do need, and provides a working model of how each part of the system works, deterring regressions. Don't believe him? Come follow along with Nathan as he walks through testing a simple game before writing a lick of production code."
