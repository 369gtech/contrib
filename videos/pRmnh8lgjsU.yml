description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nDoing Things Prometheus Can’t Do with Prometheus - Tim Simmons, DigitalOcean\n\nThe current Cloud Native Observability dogma is that metrics (and logs and traces) are “not good enough” and that this brave new world needs brave new Observability tools. This is false.\n\nThis session will focus on how to utilize Prometheus and friends to solve problems that are typically cited as limitations. This talk is for anyone interested in learning how Prometheus can solve the majority of your Observability problems, no vendor required.\n\nAn outline of this talk is:\n- How to thoughtfully utilize existing Observability tools\n- Deploying High Availability Prometheus\n- Effectively interacting with high-cardinality data\n- Long-term metrics storage\n- Doing “machine learning” on metrics\n- Handling thousands of alerts in a sane way (https://twitter.com/timsimlol/status/1145790451129167872)\n- How to measure *everything* with Prometheus\n- Fostering a healthy Observability culture with SLOs\n\nhttps://sched.co/UaXp"
