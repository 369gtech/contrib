description: "Containers, microservices, cloud read applications â€“ every developer heard about them. We know how to build services to be container ready, how to manage Docker/Kubernetes and so on.\n\nWhat is often being missed is a composability aspect of containers. There are thousands of ready to use images which, when properly composed, can solve the problems that are usually solved by writing code.\n\nIn this talk Serhiy discuss few design patterns based on containers, that allow to reduce the complexity and time to market for your services."
