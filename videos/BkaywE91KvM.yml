description: "There are many tools out there for data scientists. While you've made interesting findings using big data tools, don't you still have to justify those results to management at the end of the day? Lots of numbers on paper or in a database is hardly presentable to key stakeholders. In this video, learn not only how to access Google Cloud Platform's BigQuery from G Suite, but also how to code that final mile and go from big data analysis all the way to a slide presentation, all in a single G Suite serverless app! \n\nCodelab & source code → http://bit.ly/2Igajfe\nSample app source code GitHub repo → http://bit.ly/2IfdeF2\nG Suite + GCP: building serverless solutions with all of Google Cloud Cloud NEXT '18 session → http://bit.ly/2QWANq6\nApps Script-BigQuery sample → http://bit.ly/2xz1pFq\nGenerating slides from spreadsheet data DevByte video → http://bit.ly/2Icg5OF\nGoogle Slides API codelab → http://bit.ly/2Ie3pXJ\nGoogle Sheets data connector for BigQuery announcements → http://bit.ly/2OapMmc and http://bit.ly/2xI9BCk\nApply for Sheets data connector for BigQuery EAP/TT program →\nhttp://bit.ly/2DDzwld\nGoogle BigQuery → http://bit.ly/2DnTMH8\nGoogle Apps Script → http://bit.ly/2zrw6hh\nApps Script built-in services → http://bit.ly/2QUX8nK\nApps Script advanced services → http://bit.ly/2O5VyRj\nG Suite Dev Show video series playlist → http://bit.ly/2tEjGz7\nLaunchpad Online developer video series playlist → http://bit.ly/2QVZ3bx\nGoogle Developers YouTube channel → http://bit.ly/2zs0esU\n\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel → http://bit.ly/googledevs\nWatch more G-Suite Developer Show → http://bit.ly/2ORZZg1\n\n\n#AppsScript #BigQuery #GoogleSheets #GoogleSlides #GSuite #GCP"
