description: "Have you always been curious about what machine learning can do for your business problem, but could never find the time to learn the practical necessary skills? Do you wish to learn what Classification, Regression, Clustering and Feature Extraction techniques do, and how to apply them using the Oracle Machine Learning family of products?\n\nJoin us for this special series “Oracle Machine Learning Office Hours – Machine Learning 101”, where we will go through the main steps of solving a Business Problem from beginning to end, using the different components available in Oracle Machine Learning: programming languages and interfaces, including Notebooks with SQL, UI, and languages like R and Python.\n\nOur fifth session in the series will cover Clustering 101, where we will learn the terminology around Clustering or Segmentation, how to get the data prepared for clustering, how to measure cluster separation, identify potential pitfalls and see use cases.\n\nWe will continue to make use of the Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) interface for the Autonomous Database.\n\nVideo Highlights\n01:47 Machine Learning 101 - Clustering\n02:45 What is Clustering?\n04:40 Clustering Algorithms and Methods\n07:49 Types of data needed for Clustering\n09:30 Workflow and Data Preparation\n14:05 Data used in the Demo\n14:50 Clustering Model Intuition for k-Means\n22:24 k-Means properties\n25:53 Features of the Oracle Machine Learning clustering algorithms\n28:22 Demo of Machine Learning 101: Clustering\n30:24 Demo: selecting subset of data and filtering outliers\n32:35 Demo: k-Means model with k=2\n36:10 Demo: k-Means model prediction\n38:45 Demo: Create a function for building, scoring and plotting k-Means\n40:10 Demo: k-Means testing from k=2 to k=7\n42:00 Demo: Expectation-Maximization\n46:42 Demo: Create a function for building, scoring and plotting Expectation-Maximization\n48:00 Demo: Expectation-Maximization testing with max clusters from 2 to 7\n51:40 Q&A"
