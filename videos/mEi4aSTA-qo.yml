title: 'The Emerging Languages Bowl: The Quest to Be in the Big Leagues'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784746
description: "Scripting languages that are emerging and not yet mainstream vie with each other to stake a claim that they have the potential to become mainstream and be considered to be in the big leagues. Donâ€™t miss this panel discussion, in which these emerging languages are portrayed by their respective champions, who explain how they may help your everyday life as a Java developer. To present a complete picture, the session includes some languages that may not run on the JVM. Afterward you will have a better grasp of the emerging languages and the ecosystem. One or more of the languages may catch your fancy for doing development alongside Java.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAndrey Breslav\nAndrey is the lead language designer for Project Kotlin, he joined the JetBrains team in 2010.\nView more trainings by Andrey Breslav at https://www.parleys.com/author/andrey-breslav\n\nStephane Epardaud\nundefined\nView more trainings by Stephane Epardaud at https://www.parleys.com/author/stephane-epardaud-2\n\nCharles Nutter\nCharles has been programming most of his life, as a Java developer for the past decade and as a JRuby developer for over six years. He co-leads the JRuby project, an effort to bring the beauty of Ruby and the power of the JVM together. Charles believes in open source and open standards and hopes his efforts on JRuby and other languages will ensure the JVM remains the preferred open-source managed runtime for many years to come.\nView more trainings by Charles Nutter at https://www.parleys.com/author/charles-nutter-4\n\nRaghavan \"Rags\" Srinivas\nRaghavan \nView more trainings by Raghavan \"Rags\" Srinivas at https://www.parleys.com/author/raghavan-rags-srinivas\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
