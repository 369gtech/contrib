description: "Firebug was initially written in 2006, and since then, it has transformed the way we create web pages. Before Firebug, debugging consisted mainly of inserting alert statements. Now we have an interactive console, breakpoints, DOM inspector, and live CSS editing. It seems a lot comparing to nothing, yet I think it’s only an inception.\n\nMy talk will shed light on how primitive our current tools are and how we can improve them. In addition, I’ll introduce new tools such as WebKit Timelapse, and share other tools used in different industries (like Game Development and VFX). I’ll highlight what we, web developers, can learn from them.\n\nTranscript: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/nikita-vasilyev-future-of-web-tooling.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
