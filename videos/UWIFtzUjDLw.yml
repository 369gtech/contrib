description: "Get the finished code: http://goo.gl/sCL6A\n\nIn this part of my Java video tutorial I turn the SpaceShip UML class diagram I designed in the last video into a real class.\n This class will allow you to fly the space ship around the screen at any angle. You'll be able to rotate it while maintaining the ships current direction. It is considered to be a pretty complicated technique that is squeezed into a few lines :)\n\nAll of the code follows the video below to improve your learning experience."
