Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nApplication Autoscaling Made Easy With Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling - Tom Kerkhove, Codit\n\nDeploying applications to Kubernetes is one thing, but how do you scale them? Horizontal Pod Autoscalers to the rescue! But when you want to scale on external providers such as Kafka, Redis or another dependency it is not a walk in the park anymore. Enter Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) which allows you to take your existing apps and easily configure how it should scale without having to worry about the magic! Using Kafka, Azure, AWS, GCP, Prometheus, etc? Don't worry, we've got your back! Join this talk to learn what KEDA is, how simple it is to get started and why it makes application autoscaling so easy!"
