description: "Speaker(s):\nJohnny Lee; Larry Yang\n\nDescription:\nUnderstanding where we are and what is around us shapes our behavior and our interactions with people and objects. Yet most mobile devices today assume that the boundaries of the world end at the boundaries of the screen. Project Tango is a platform integrating custom sensors and software that allow developers to explore new user experiences enabled by 3D tracking and perception. Applications include navigating through indoors spaces, measuring your environment, playing 3D games around your home, and being able to walk through immersive experiences. Come join us on this journey.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
