description: "Andrew Ruthven\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/76/\nThis talk will review the Open Compute Project, where it came from, where\r\nthings are now and where things are headed. We will cover benefits that Open\r\nCompute Project provide over the typical server hardware that we're used to.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss how it works for the large scale operators, and the issues\r\nthat affect the small scale operators from the perspective of a small scale\r\noperator."
