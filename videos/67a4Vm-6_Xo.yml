recordingDate: 1531818442
description: "What does it take to automatically assign a category to a news article? In this talk I go through how the recommendation team at NRK use a range of machine learning techniques to classify all news articles into a set of categories. We will look into our strategy using word embeddings, clustering and supervised learning - as well as some practicalities concerning how this all fits into our production pipeline.\nIf you are interested in seeing machine learning applied to a real life problem in a production environment — this is the talk for you!"
