description: "Filmed at https://2020.dotswift.io on February 3, 2020 in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nIt's a delight to discover new language features that enhance your Swift programming experience. Many of Swift's features adopt a style that \"reads\" as if they're native constructs but are actually created and maintained by third parties. Erica shows you Swift 5's new property wrappers (added in Swift 5.2), how they fit into this paradigm and why they're an exciting avenue for developers looking to create reusable property enhancements."
