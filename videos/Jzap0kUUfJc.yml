description: "Cloud functions have been taking the industry by storm. Always available, scale transparently, only pay for the compute you use (100% utilization) and deploy instantly with zero downtime. However, getting started is fraught with complexity and configuration. \n\nIn this workshop you will quickly learn all the angles of 'serverless' technology using Amazon Web Services: \n- A Brief Introduction to Amazon Web Services \n- Introduction to JSF Architect \n- Intro Web Dev: HTML and JSON with API Gateway \n- Intro Web Dev: Custom Domains with Route53 DNS \n- Test Driven Intro to DynamoDB: Setup and DB Design \n- Test Driven Intro to DynamoDB: Reads \n- Test Driven Intro to DynamoDB: Writes \n- Scheduled Functions \n- Build and deploy a JSON API \n- Build a Slackbot: Slash and Mentions \n- Build a Slackbot; Buttons and Menus \n- Closing Thoughts and Next Steps \n\nJSF Architect tames AWS complexity and gets you immediately productive deploying live to isolated staging and production environments. We will set up a CRON function that runs on an interval completely in the cloud. We'll create a website on a brand new domain and be deploying to in seconds complete with user auth and state. We'll create a stateless restful JSON API. We'll close the workshop by building a completely functional bot for Slack.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode+JS Interactive 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBrian LeRoux\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN7sYL974NY"
