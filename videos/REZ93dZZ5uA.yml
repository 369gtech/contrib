title: 'Graham Crowe, Anders Danne - Embedded Erlang Development - Erlang User Conference 2015'
recordingDate: 1438349437
description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015/anders-danne\n\nWe describe the properties of a new Ericsson product, the Baseband R503 [ref1]. The R503 is a baseband volume product used to build mobile communications networks. It comprises a data plane processor for fast-path processing and a control plane for controlling the operation of the data plane. \n\nThe control plane software is implemented mainly in Erlang, and is used to control data plane software implemented in C and FPGA's. This system runs on a small memory-footprint embedded system, and is expected to run autonomously for many years without manual maintenance. It will run in challenging remote environments so all operations must be controlled remotely and there is a great emphasis on security, remote maintenance and controlled upgrade procedures. \n\nBuilding an \"Embedded Erlang System\" requires the integration of many components. With that in mind the talk will discuss the relevance of Autotools and the Yocto project to the Erlang community. We will walk through a simple \"Embedded Erlang System\" example, and discuss possible solutions to the problems encountered.\n\nAnders has been working for Ericsson a long time in various positions as expert in software technology, manager, project manager, HW designer and programmer in assembler, Erlang etc.\n\nHe was member of the CSLAB board and financed part of the lab where Erlang was born. He was an early user of  Erlang in several prototyping projects at Ericsson Research including the EU project Codit which later became the 3G mobile telephony system.\n\n\n\nGraham has been working for Ericsson since the mid 90s, mainly testing Mobile Telecommunication Systems, including GSM, WCDMA and LTE. In recent years he has been splitting his time between developing machine learning infrastructure and improving the integration and deployment of embedded linux systems."
