description: "Video series on Design Patterns for Object Oriented Languages. This time we compare a few structural patterns.\n\nCORRECTION: At 2:10 I draw a has-a arrow from the concrete decorators to the abstract decorator. This is a mistake. The arrow should be drawn from the abstract decorator to the component. Otherwise the pattern doesn't work. Sorry about that, and thanks Naman Saxena for pointing it out! Later in the video I put letters in the boxes. Expressed in letters the arrow should go from D to C. Mea culpa.\n\nMore specifically: \n\nAdapter Pattern\nvs\nProxy Pattern\nvs\nFacade Pattern\nvs\nDecorator Pattern\nvs\nBridge Pattern\n\n...and then we throw in Strategy Pattern in the end :)\n\n?
