title: 'Containers Were Never Your End State'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538634186
description: "You have containers and a Kubernetes cluster; what's next? When you dig into this pervasive ecosystem, you quickly realize that k8s and containers are just the beginning; it's not your end state. How do you know your running docker images don't contain known vulnerabilities? Have you defined a sensible governance policy for the different image layers? Are you still running your containers as root? Do you need a dedicated cluster? What about user authentication? What happens if your entire cluster fails?\n\nThis talk removes subjective opinion and objectively delves into the technical details, components, deployment patterns and usage of Kubernetes. As more of your workloads embark on their cloud native journey, this talk unpacks the journey path to production.\n\nSpeakers:\nWill Arroyo\nSenior Platform Architect, Pivotal\nDuncan Winn\nVP of Platform Architecture, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
