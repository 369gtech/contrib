description: "DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is an international standard for retrieve, transfer, storage and communication in imaging modalities. It is used in imaging modalities like CT, MR etc.\n\nInitially, interfaces between imaging medical devices were custom designed & posed a huge challenge as far as interoperability was concerned. DICOM standards has come to the rescue by providing interoperability to store, manage & exchange information among one or more devices, product, systems etc. DICOM is supported by majority of vendors and hospitals however secure implementation of DICOM is still a concern as security risks were given less importance.\n\nThis presentation will be primarily focused on DICOM messages, their implementation, the sensitivity of the information and how to attack these messages. The talk will cover how to pentest medical devices / systems in the hospital network and the approach that needs to be taken to pentest the medical systems. The talk will be concluded by sharing insights on the proper implementation of DICOM standard to better defend healthcare devices & systems against cyber-attacks.\n\n=== \n\nAjay Pratap Singh has 5+ years of experience in security & research. He is working as a Product security engineer in Philips healthcare where his responsibility is to make Philips medical devices hack proof. His interest lies in breaking the secured medical devices & infrastructure. Speaker at c0c0n & Nullcon international conference."
