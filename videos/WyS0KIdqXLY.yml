title: 'Pragmatic Big Data Architectures in the Cloud: A Developer’s Perspective'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433517327
description: "Crunching, analyzing, scaling, innovating… The life of a software architect dealing with big data can be both exciting and a nightmare. Although there is unpredicted processing power in the cloud and tools that can turn the craziest ideas into disruptive applications, it is also possible to rapidly reach architecture bottlenecks and prohibitive scaling costs. Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Crunch, HBase, and similar tools made Java the driving force behind the big data revolution, but it is also easy to get lost in the myriad of options available. This session presents pragmatic architectures for building efficient big data applications while keeping the cloud hosting costs at a minimum by combining well-known open source tools and a few tricks.\n\n\nAuthors:\nFabiane Nardon\nFabiane is a computer scientist who is passionate about creating software that will positively change the world we live in.
