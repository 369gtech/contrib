description: 'Apple''s free iCloud service replaces MobileMe and provides a way for people to instantly synchronize contacts, calendars, photos, documents, music, and other kinds of data among their digital devices-especially Macs and iOS devices. It''s designed to be so easy to use that it''s practically invisible, but as many people have discovered, a great deal of complexity lies beneath the friendly surface. In this webcast, veteran Mac author Joe Kissell explains what iCloud can do for you, how to deal with configuration puzzles and compatibility issues, and how best to manage the transition from MobileMe.'
