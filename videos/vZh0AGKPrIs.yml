description: "Docker is awesome, but how to use it in production?\n\nYou've got your app built. You've dockerized it so it is self-contained and is running in Docker off your laptop. It's tested and everything looks good, so time to ship it.\n\nWait! Not so fast! Transitioning to a Docker production environment isn't quite as easy as it sounds. How do you start your docker hosts? How do you integrate with AWS services like ELB and RDS? How do you orchestrate containers on multiple hosts? How do you deploy updates? How do you integrate monitoring and do log management?\n\nCome to this talk to see get an overview of different tool options you have in the AWS cloud to tackle these problem.\n\nOliver Geisser\nMSc Computer Science, Developer, Architect, IT Manager, Nerd\n\n[EBI-8705]"
