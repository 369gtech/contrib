description: "Who did it? Attributing computer network intrusions is commonly seen as one of the most intractable technical problems, solvable (or not) depending mainly on the available forensic evidence. But is it? Is this a productive understanding of attribution?\n\nBen Buchanan shows that attribution is what companies—and governments—make of it. Matching an intruder to an intrusion is an exercise in minimizing uncertainty on three levels: technically, attribution is an art as well as a science; operationally, attribution is a nuanced process, not a black-and-white problem; and strategically, attribution is a function of what is at stake in terms of loss, reputation, or politics. Benjamin explains why successful attribution requires a range of skills on all levels—careful management, time, leadership, stress testing, prudent communication, and recognizing limitations and challenges."
