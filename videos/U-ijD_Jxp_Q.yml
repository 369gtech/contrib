description: "Erin Zimmer\n\nWeb browsers are a bit like digestive systems - we all have one, but we're not really sure how it works, and sometimes it makes funny smells. So let's have a look at what's going on under the hood when your browser turns a bunch of characters into a delightful picture of a cat.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/anatomy-of-a-browser\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nSat Aug  3 13:30:00 2019 at Cockle Bay"
