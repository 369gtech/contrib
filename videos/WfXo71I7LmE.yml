title: 'Olaf Alders and Mark Fowler - Getting Started with GitHub Actions'
language: English
recordingDate: 1593121022
description: "Continuous Integration systems such as GitHub Actions and CircleCI allow you to automate tasks such as building, testing and linting your code. After this talk youâ€™ll be equipped to use these tools to:\n\nBuild and test your code on Linux, macOS and Windows using GitHub Actions and CircleCI\nSpeed up your build time\nSet up code coverage\nUse build artifacts\n\nI will be using some Perl-specific examples, but much of the content will be useful across different languages.  This talk will get you up and running quickly and will provide you with sample configurations you can use right now. In particular, we will talk about lightning fast testing for Dist::Zilla modules, installing your Perl prerequisites faster and a strategy to build once and then test many times.\n\nSlides at https://github.com/oalders/presentations/blob/master/slides/4-github-actions/marp.pdf\n\nSee also https://github.com/Perl/docker-perl-tester"
