recordingDate: 1433508088
description: "Meshes, materials, and lights are three of the new 3-D features in JavaFX 8.0. This session covers these three new features in depth, starting with modeling meshes with Java code and then discussing the use of free as well as commercial modeling tools to model mesh geometry. Besides modeling the mesh, you need to create proper UV maps for textures to properly texture the mesh. After the presentation explains the UV mapping process, it demonstrates the process of creating diffuse and normal maps. Finally, it discusses lighting techniques with regard to lighting the mesh with key, fill, and rim lighting.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJohn Yoon\nundefined\nView more trainings by John Yoon at https://www.parleys.com/author/john-yoon\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
