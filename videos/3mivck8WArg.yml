recordingDate: 1597523540
description: 'AI is a 2020 buzzword. There is an ever-growing need for the Software Engineer to understand how these models work. This talk I explain AI/ML basics in the context of Go dev. It is a hands-on demo using the go-learn library to explain of classing ML techniques. As the industry explodes with potential, there is an ever-growing need for Software Engineers to understand how Machine Learning models work. For most people, Machine Learning seems complex, academic, and even unreachable, but with some detailed explanation, it can become a valuable tool on the Software Engineer''s tool belt.'
