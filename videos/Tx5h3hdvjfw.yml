description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/the-journey-from-monolith-to-microservices-a-guided-adventure\n\nAre you starting a new application and wondering whether to go with a monolith or take the microservices path? Do you have an existing application that is getting too big to deliver business value with a predictable velocity? Ever wonder how to regain the agility you had when an application was smaller? \n\nThe current discussions around application architecture with microservices seem like an all or nothing journey without any stops along the way to catch your breath. This talk outlines questions to ask yourself to drive decisions along the way. It also demonstrates one possible path for future growth, complete with intermediate stops along the way where you can pause to evaluate your next step. This path avoids implementing too much complexity early in the process. \n\nAt the end of the journey you will not only have ideas to guide your own path, but tools that you can use to make the journey easier and less costly.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeaker: Mike Gehard; Senior Software Engineer, Pivotal"
