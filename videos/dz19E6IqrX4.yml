description: "A note on this interview’s audio quality\nThis was one of the first Unscripted interviews we recorded in a busy live conference setting and without our usual recording setup, which is reflected in the somewhat low audio quality you’ll hear in this episode. This is not reflective of the audio quality featured in most of our videos, and we hope you’ll find that the fantastic content more than makes up for it.\n\nThis interview was recorded at GOTO Berlin 2019 for GOTO Unscripted. #GOTOcon #GOTOUnscripted #GOTOber\nhttps://gotopia.tech\n\nRead the full transcription of this interview here:\nhttps://gotopia.tech/articles/what-is-data-science-and-where-is-it-heading\n\nEm Grasmeder - Code Witch at ThoughtWorks\nEvelina Gabasova - Principal Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute\nPreben Thorø - CTO of Trifork Switzerland\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:20 What is data science?\n03:12 How does data science handle the data volumes?\n04:33 What will we need more: SW devs or data scientists?\n05:27 Are we focusing too much on machine learning?\n08:12 Will quantum computing change things?\n09:27 Outro\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#DataScience #AI #ML #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #QuantumComputing #Quantum #AlanTuringInstitute #ThoughtWorks\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
