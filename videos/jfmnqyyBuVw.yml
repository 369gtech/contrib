description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nService Mesh Patterns by the Book- Lee Calcote, Layer5 & Nic Jackson, HashiCorp\n\nInfrastructure diversity is a reality for many organizations. It’s predicted that by 2022, 90% of all apps will feature microservices architectures. A huge range of microservice patterns drives a world of multiple service meshes. As various service meshes have proliferated infrastructures, service mesh patterns and abstractions have emerged. We will break down 60 service mesh patterns into different categories of use, demonstrating and examining a select few using Meshery for deeper review of their problems they solve, discussing caveats, and highlighting anti-patterns. The patterns discussed are being published in Service Mesh Patterns (O’Reilly) by Lee Calcote and Nic Jackson."
