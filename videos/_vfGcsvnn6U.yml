title: 'In-depth technical story: Fixing I/O performance for Windows guests in OpenStack Ceph clouds'
recordingDate: 1579160338
description: "Trent Lloyd\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/98/\n\nA rapidly scaling private OpenStack + Hybrid HDD/SSD Ceph cloud began to experience very slow I/O performance for their Windows guests - making them practically un-usable.\r\n\r\nThis is the in-depth technical story of how the issue was found and fixed including the surprising outcome that this I/O was always going to be slow on an OpenStack Ceph cloud with a large Windows guest footprint - until the fixes that were since developed are deployed at both the storage, host and guest image layer.\r\n\r\nSpoiler Alert: The underlying reason is related to Windows guests by default aligning I/O to 512-byte boundaries but Linux and Ceph generally work best with (and usually only submit, this is key) I/O aligned to 4096-byte boundaries. The story doesn't end there though. I will go in-depth on the fixes and changes needed to Ceph, Nova, Cinder and the Windows VirtIO drivers to get everything working smoothly.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
