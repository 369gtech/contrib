title: 'WPF Controls with MVVM: ComboBox'
language: English
recordingDate: 1537185609
description: "Designing WPF controls, especially with MVVM, can be tricky so I decided to create a mini-series on the various controls we have access to in WPF and how you can wire them up properly. Even if a video covers a control you are familiar with, you will probably see an advanced use case or two that will be of benefit. In this first video, we are going to cover the combo box including how to get the data about the selected item and how to cascade dropdowns.\n\nFull courses: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=WPFComboBox\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nNewsletter signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
