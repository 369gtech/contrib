description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks \n\nQuviq developed an open sourced Erlang implementation of the WebDriver protocol. \n\nThis implementation allows an Erlang programmer to fully interact with a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Opera and Firefox. Testing web services in different browsers is made possible via test cases written in Erlang. This in its turn allows us to use QuickCheck for testing web services. Many random scenario's are tested and when the website differs from the intended behaviour we automatically find the shortest user interaction bringing us to that unintended behaviour. We can demonstrate this in any web browser supporting WebDriver.\n\nAnother use case is that we can record test cases using Selenium and translate them into EUnit test cases, which can be used by learning algorithms to create QuickCheck models from. \n\nThe development also brought forward a number of software errors in for example Erlang's httpc module, Chrome driver and Selenium server."
