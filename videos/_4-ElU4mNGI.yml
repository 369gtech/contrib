description: "DevOpsDays Baltimore 2019 - Holidays & Happy Hour: Unexpected Signals of Auditable Federal DevOps by Melinda Solomon & Ken Moser\n\nAs with most federal agencies, The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) must construct OIT processes to comply with regulatory oversight entities. This oversight is necessary to maintain trust between the American public and the public servants creating and maintaining public systems. In an effort to bridge the new DevOps landscape in government with the need for auditability, the Delivery Assurance Branch at USCIS has created a series of Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) to help tie suggested measurements to positive system outcomes.\n\nOver the course of three years, the DAB Quality Analysts began to see some surprising signals of system health, team collaboration, and sustainable work environment. As analysts poured over regularly generated health measurements to prove due-diligence to regulatory authorities, they identified note-worthy trends. There were simple and sometimes unusual measurable signals that revealed devops maturity and health. For example, when commits did not occur after “happy hour,” there was a correlation to a healthy work environment and a reliable pipeline in place.\n\n#confreaks #devopsdaysbmore"
