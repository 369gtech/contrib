title: 'React Native EU 2020: Ram N - React Native Performance - Take 2'
recordingDate: 1603291610
description: "Abstract:\nAs React Native is being used to build many large scale mobile apps. It is important to profile performance to ensure a smooth user experience. Previously, Ram had written and spoken about adding instrumentation to understand the performance characteristics of the app.\nAs the next step, he will explore the various optimizations that can be done in this talk. He will focus on the Javascript section, something where there are many more low hanging fruits to optimizie.\nStarting from React Dev Tools, he will look at how developers can leverage their existing knowledge of web performance to attack mobile perf. He will talk about understanding SysTrace and Sampling Profilers. He will also debunk common myths like the problems with measuring app performance using Chrome JS profiler, debug versions of the app, etc. \nIn this talk, he will plan to outline a holistic approach that can be used to dive deeper into React Native performance."
