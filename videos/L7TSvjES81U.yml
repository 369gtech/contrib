title: 'GopherCon 2018: Kris Brandow - Designing Software Within Constraints Building to a Specification'
language: English
recordingDate: 1536936362
description: 'Designing software within a specific set of constraints is difficult. Balancing the requirements of language agonistic specifications with the strong opinions of Go requires care and creativity. Kris’s tutorial session is about doing exactly that. He will use MongoDB’s Go driver as an example, but the lessons are generally applicable. To lay the groundwork, Kris will start with a brief introduction to the Go driver and MongoDB and then dive into the basic design, performance implications, and usage patterns. He will discuss the tradeoffs between strict adherence to the specifications and embodying the idioms of Go. Additionally, he will discuss the design of the BSON library, a performant serialization library built from scratch to meet the needs of the driver and users.'
