recordingDate: 1213042422
description: "HTML5, Brought to You by Gears\r\nAaron Boodman (Google)\r\n\r\nHTML5 is a new set of proposed extensions to HTML that radically improve the capabilities of web applications. However, without implementations in a majority of browsers, these proposals remain just that, and out of reach for developers.\r\n\r\nThe Gears mission is to begin implementing these APIs today, across as many browsers as possible, as quickly as possible. In this talk, I'll explain why we are doing this, what our motives are, and show how implementing web standards is good for Google and good for the web.\r\n\r\nWe'll also loook at some examples of standards the Gears team has participated in to various levels, as well as talk about what's next for Gears and standards."
