title: 'Oracle Database as Document Store & SODA QBEs'
language: English
recordingDate: 1534984053
description: "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has become the dominant data exchange format of the 21st century. As of version 12.1, Oracle Database offers powerful, flexible features for storing and querying JSON documents. In this video we show how the Oracle Database can be operated as a document store and documents can be searched by 'Query by Example' expressions, where the query itself is written in JSON. QBE's are provided by the SODA (Simple Oracle Document Access) Api which is available for REST and Java.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n\nmusic: bensound.com"
