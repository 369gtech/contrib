description: "See more at - https://springonetour.io/\n\nIt seems like a new cloud native technology or project is launched every week, and though there are technical changes required for building and operating cloud native applications, technology alone isn’t a silver bullet. It turns out that how you build your applications is critical to enable seamless scaling and resiliency to failures. What do you have to do to ensure your applications can fully leverage the power and flexibility the cloud offers?\n\nThe 12-Factor principles have been around for a decade and have proven to be core, foundational principles for cloud native applications. But they require changes to how you design your applications, the way teams collaborate on code, and more. Understanding the 12-Factor principles is a strong foundation for adopting cloud native patterns and practices.\n\nStarting with an architectural kata, Nate and Jakub will event storm a possible solution stopping along the way to identify key quality attributes, fitness functions, and architectural patterns required to deliver a solution. Distributed architectures have similar problems and rather than “roll our own solutions,” we’ll leverage Spring Cloud to solve common challenges while lessening technical complexity.\n\n===\n\nJakub Pilimon\n@jakubpilimon\n\nPassionate programmer with 7 years of experience. DDD, TDD and architecture are my main areas of interest. When I don’t program I run a DDD/architecture training, ride motorbike, ski or grow my beard. Also, here is my DZone MVB awarded blog: pillopl.github.io\n\n\n\nNate Schutta\n@ntschutta\n\nNate Schutta is a solution architect focussed on making usable applications. A proponent of polyglot programming, Nate has written two books on Ajax and speaks regularly at various worldwide conferences, No Fluff Just Stuff symposia, universities, and Java user groups. In addition to his day job, Nate is an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota where he teaches students to embrace dynamic languages. Most recently, Nate coauthored the book Presentation Patterns with Neal Ford and Matthew McCullough."
