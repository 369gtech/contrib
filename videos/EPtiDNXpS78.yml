Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe Argo Ecosystem: Tailoring Your Installation Through Community Add-ons - Jesse Suen, Akuity & Alexander Matyushentsev, Intuit\n\nYou are probably already familiar with the core set of Argo projects such as Workflows, CD, Rollouts, and Events. But did you know there is also an entire suite of ecosystem projects which complement these core offerings? These operators unlock support for additional features including notifications, docker registry integration, git writeback, cluster bootstrapping/add-on management, all in a composable way. In this talk, we showcase many of the Argo community projects which will supercharge your Argo installation by providing features outside of the base functionality. Discover ways to custom tailor your setup according to your organization’s needs. Learn about new and upcoming enhancements to make Argo CD even more extensible, including a redesigned config management plugin system, UI component library, and UI/API extensions. Finally, learn how you can even leverage Argo engines and building blocks in your own operators to gain new capabilities, completely independent of Argo!"
