title: 'Webinar: Getting Started with Containers and Kubernetes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1583275618
description: "In the past decade, containerized applications and container clusters have rapidly replaced the old paradigm of scaling applications using virtual machines. Containers offer the same process isolation, but are generally more lightweight, portable, and performant than full virtualization. Container clusters, which can be used to manage thousands of running containers across a set of physical machines, abstract away much of the work of rolling out new versions of applications, scaling them, and efficiently scheduling workloads. Out of these, Kubernetes has emerged as a mature, production-ready system. It provides a rich set of features like rolling deployments, health checking, self-monitoring, workload autoscaling, and much, much more.\n\nThis webinar will show you how to harness these technologies and deploy the “Hello World” Flask app onto a DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster."
