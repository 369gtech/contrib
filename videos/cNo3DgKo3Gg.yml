description: "Google Glass is finally reaching the hands of a programmer near you. Are you ready to start developing for it? Kunal Modi and Han Kang, of Thristlabs, give an insightful and informative foundation to a bunch of awesome aspects inside Google Glass. While they come from a Rails perspective, this is an excellent general intro to this new paradigm in developing.\n\nThe talk includes an introduction to the Google Glass hardware, the Mirror API, as well as the successes and pain points the duo confronted while designing their first app for Glass. How can we even troubleshoot for Glass without owning a pair? Prepare to dive into Google Glass, and discover why these guys predict the future of Glass to be like \"Twitter on steroids,\" in this talk for SF Android.\n\n**For more free Android developer resources: http://marakana.com/s/tags/android"
