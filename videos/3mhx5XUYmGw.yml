description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeakers: - Ted Tollefson, Shawn Sherwood, Kroger\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/easy-consumption-of-microservices\n\nCloud Foundry makes it easy to deploy and run microservices. Now that you have your microservice running, how do you make it easy for other teams to consume it? Spring Initializr, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Netflix and Cloud Foundry can be used together to make the consumption side easy and efficient. Client libraries can be offered in Spring Initializr. The generated Spring Boot application can be deployed to Cloud Foundry. Service discovery can be provided with Spring Cloud Netflix. The consuming project team can simply write their business logic. This talk will cover the steps to extend Initializr to accomplish easy microservice consumption."
