title: '"The Story of PulseAudio and Compress Offload" - Arun Raghavan (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579213100
description: "Arun Raghavan\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/14/\n\nWhile PulseAudio has been a standard component in desktop and embedded Linux for a decade now, it was always written with uncompressed audio data in mind.\r\n\r\nTo save power. modern SoCs often support \"compress offload\", where an efficient DSP can receive compressed MP3/AAC/... data, decode and render it to be played out.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll describe how this was implemented in PulseAudio, what challenges and tradeoffs were involved, and what the future might hold for this work.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nWed Jan 15 16:40:00 2020 at Room 7"
