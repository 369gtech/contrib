description: "What are the challenges of the Perl ecosystem, and how can we make it flourish? Come along to see how the The Perl Foundation is addressing these questions, and what we know so far.\n\nThe Perl Foundation is running a survey to identify the shared values of the Perl community, and their vision of the Perl ecosystem in years to come.\n\nThe goal is to provide information on which The Perl Foundation, community groups, and individuals can make informed decisions and plans for the future.\n\nIn this talk we’ll explain why this research is needed, how we’re collecting the data, and what we have learned so far."
