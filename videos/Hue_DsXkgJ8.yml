title: 'Infoshare 2019 - Ram Dušić Hren (IBM): What is Quantum Computing Anyways?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1585049877
description: "Computers have become so powerful that they can crunch mind-boggling amounts of data. However, there are a lot of computational problems that will forever remain impossible to solve on any classical computer, no matter how advanced it is. \nThe answer to those problems may lie in the science that describes Nature at the microscopic level - Quantum Physics. The extraordinary but very subtle features of atoms and subatomic particles have the potential to solve previously unimaginable computations. We now have the technology that allows us to tame those subtle features and use them to build a Quantum Computer. How? You will learn about it in this talk.\n\nThe speech took on 8th May 2019 on DevTrends Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n\n#quantumcomputing #deeptech #IBM"
