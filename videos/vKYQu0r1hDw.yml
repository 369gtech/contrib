title: 'Webinar: Multi-cluster & multi-cloud service mesh with CNCF’s Kuma and Envoy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1602012912
description: "Learn how to run a distributed Envoy-based service mesh on multiple Kubernetes clusters and multiple clouds in just a few steps with Kuma, a CNCF project. In this hands-on webinar, Marco Palladino - Kong’s CTO and Kuma maintainer - will be firing up Kubernetes clusters in multiple regions to demonstrate how we can secure, route, connect and observe service connectivity in a distributed service mesh.\n\nWith native Envoy support, Kuma provides a unique set of features in the service mesh landscape to reliably - yet easily - create a multi-mesh deployment across a complex network topology to address mission-critical production use cases on both containerized and VM-based workloads.\n\nIn this session, we will learn to:\n\nUse Kuma’s multi-zone deployment to spin up a multi-cluster and multi-region service mesh.\nLeverage the global/remote control separation to scale reliability with HA.\nUse the built-in service discovery and ingress capability for out of the box service connectivity across multiple zones, clusters and regions.\nUse Kuma’s policy to determine the behavior of traffic across different clusters, like Traffic Route, mTLS, Traffic Permission and so on\n﻿\nPresenter:\n\nMarco Palladino, CTO & Co-Founder @Kong"
