At Carnegie Mellon, the Department of Statistics & Data Science teaches thousands of students with future degrees ranging from Pre-Med to Rhetoric to Chemistry to Business to Statistics & Machine Learning and partners with a wide range of industries and non-profits on data-centric problems of varying complexity. While the term “data science” is often associated with the need for high level technical skills and specific programming languages, in our experience, the struggle to fully leverage and incorporate data science is far more related to understanding how to think and talk about data, interpret data, make decisions with data - that is, data literacy and data acumen.\nTo empower a broader audience of savvy data consumers, our research group developed ISLE (Interactive Statistics Learning Environment), an interactive platform with delivered functionality enabling students and professionals engaged in re-training or upskilling to easily explore Statistics & Data Science concepts through both self-directed, asynchronous materials or instructor-led, synchronous lessons [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:37 Interacting with data science\n04:46 Early definitions\n08:11 Data science, a view\n10:18 The science of data science\n25:48 Carnegie Mellon University\n27:47 Integrated statistics learning environment (ISLE)\n33:03 What are we learning/researching?\n36:38 Takeaways\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1385/data-science-for-everyone-with-isle-leveraging-web-technologies-to-increase-data-acumen\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#DataScience #AI #ML #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #Programming #ISLE #DataAcumen\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
