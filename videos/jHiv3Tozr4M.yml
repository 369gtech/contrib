title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Simplementation and the MVP: Starting Small to Go Big!'
recordingDate: 1523471629
description: "Whether they call it the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Minimum Loveable Experience (MLE) or something else, many product owners and managers struggle to prioritize a strategic set of features that will support the achievement of their most critical business goals in the shortest term. They may feel that every feature is a high priority or \"must have\" for launch, or may struggle with stakeholders who cannot work together to prioritize. They can take an\_approach to defining the “MVP”\_that can derail or doom the project.\n\nAs experts and consultants, it is our job to help them be successful. We can achieve this by connecting to them and their vision first, in order to clearly understand their needs and challenges. Then, we can employ specific strategies to help them better understand their own priorities, and the opportunities Drupal presents in helping them achieve their goals, while helping them avoid\_failure or struggle down the road.\n\nIn this session, you will learn some strategies for approaching the MVP conversation and frame the work ahead for best results. We will model how to strategically pare\_down an example project's full set requirements to the most critical, while demonstrating some techniques you can use to get better results when you do this yourself.\_\n\nBring your own project's requirements, or a project from your haunted past to think about as we dive into this topic."
