description: "One of the primary goals for testing software is to have confidence that your software works as intended, but this doesn't give much insight into the quality of the software. Is it performant? How about accessible? Are we sending too much code? Answering these questions in an automated fashion today is hard, but that will be changing in the future.\n\nIn this talk, Trent explores how recent changes in technology give us a foundation to start answering the questions posed above and so much more. He looks at a near future where we have confidence that our software is functional and works well.\n\nEVENT:\n\ndotJS 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nTrent Willis\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrKUbaCJ938"
