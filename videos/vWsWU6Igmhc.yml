How do you create it? How do you manage it? How do you publish it? What about versions?\n\nDespite there being countless site generators to choose from, few are well-suited for large-scale documentation sites, and none designed exclusively for AsciiDoc. Writers need the ability to create and manage documentation sites without needing deep knowledge of the web stack. Software teams need a workflow to collaborate on multiple versions of documentation that span departments. By creating Antora, we set out to fill these gaps. I’ll explain how we architected Antora and how it changes the way we think about producing documentation.\n\nAntora aggregates versioned content from a variety of repositories and branches that adhere to a standard project structure. It then converts that content and feeds it to a UI, which is provided by a separate software component. Out comes an offline-first site that can be published and viewed anywhere, even locally.\n\nThis talk will give you an understanding of how Antora enables software teams to effectively create, manage, and publish multi-version documentation sites.\n\n \nDan Allen \nFrom OpenDevise\nDan is a software developer, thinker, creative, published author (Seam in Action), and internationally-recognized speaker. Dan builds movements behind software by bringing together communities of creatives to pursue ideas and solve big problems. His goal is to foster software projects that default to open and thrive on transparency.\n\nDan leads the Asciidoctor project, co-leads the Antora project, and promotes the JVM as a polyglot Java Champion. As one of two founders of OpenDevise, Dan works with software projects to help organizations produce documentation their users adore.\n\nAfter a long conference day, you’ll find Dan chatting about tech, docs, and open source with fellow community members over a Trappist beer or Kentucky bourbon."
