description: "Building HA Multi-Cloud Clusters Using WireGuard as a Network Overlay - Lucas Servén Marín, Red Hat \n\nKubernetes abstracts away infrastructure, enabling the community to leverage a single, powerful interface anywhere we like, from bare-metal to public clouds like AWS or GCP. However, not all infrastructure is alike: some clouds do not provide GPUs, while others do not offer data-centers in certain regions. As a result, users often have to choose between running their entire workload on a single cloud provider or region, and managing multiple clusters in different clouds. In this presentation, Lucas Servén explains how to solve this issue at the network level and create a single cluster that spans cloud providers and regions, facilitating high availability and avoiding lock-in, by using WireGuard as a network overlay. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPbF"
