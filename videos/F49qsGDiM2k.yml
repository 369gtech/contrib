description: "Microservices may be small in size, but they have huge potential, especially when you pair them with the idea of event-driven architecture (EDA). Today developers are using microservices as the building blocks behind all kinds of cloud and enterprise applications, but most still think microservices = REST, which limits you to polling/reactive interactions.\n\nUsing a demo featuring Spring and Pivotal Cloud Foundry (and whiskey), this session will explain why a microservices architecture could be further enhanced by becoming event-driven and how using asynchronous messaging allows easy and flexible scaling and independent deployment.\n\nAfter all, life is event-driven. And your microservices should be as well.\n\nSlides: TBA\n \nJonathan Schabowsky, Sr. Architect, Office of the CTO, Solace\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
