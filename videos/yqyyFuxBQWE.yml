description: "by Gratien D'haese\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2215/ota_support_program.webm\n\nThe Open Technology Assembly (OTA), formerly known as Belgian Unix Users Group, is a non-profit organisation  which main goal was to promote and organise meetings around Unix and Open Source in general (mainly more than a decade ago).\nOver the years the Internet took over so that the interest in our meetings declined and finally we stopped organise meetings altogether. However, as a non-profit organisation we would like to do something useful such as supporting and funding new open source related projects.\nThe Open Technology Assembly (OTA) will open an Open Source Support program to apply for funding. It would be nice that the chosen Open Source projects owners submit a (lightning) talk for next year's FOSDEM, however, it is not obliged.\nWe will also organise an independent jury to go over the submitted projects and make a list of the projects which will get funding. Before FOSDEM starts we will have web pages explaining most of the details.\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 14:40:00"
