description: "Get the Code Here: http://goo.gl/EI3WO\n\nIn my previous tutorial I walked you threw the process of solving a generic programming problem. We made a method that printed out a tree structure in the console.\n\nIn this tutorial, I'll walk through the process of finding bugs in the code and talk about how we can fix those bugs. I think this topic may be the hardest to teach. I hope the video and the code that follows can help you better grasp how to solve most any programming problem."
