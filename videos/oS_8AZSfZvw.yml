description: "Don Christie\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/183/\n\nThe question is no longer \"how does free and open source software make money?\" That case was proven long ago by many individuals and companies. Produce and support something people love and money will follow. \r\n\r\nOf more interest and perhaps importance for our communities and future is the question -  who is paying who for what? \r\n\r\nWhat are the models of making sure that the contributors to FOSS: conference organisers; artists; testers; documenters; security experts and even developers are able to survive and thrive not simply doing what the love, but making the world a better place. Financial models matter.\r\n\r\nI, Don Christie, am Managing Director of successful Kiwi free and open source company Catalyst IT. The last 21 years has seen Catalyst grow from a Wellington start up to a multinational group of businesses with a thriving presence across NZ, Australia and the UK. Our company exists for these reasons: https://www.catalyst.net.nz/blog/7-themes-catalyst\r\n\r\nOver these 21 years we have seen, participated in and led free software projects and ventures. We have seen financial models that promote, strengthen and enhance our communities and others that have not. We have tried different versions ourselves with varying degrees of \"success\", however that might be defined.\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on pure play FOSS (as defined by the OSI) based models and licensing regimes. It will have examples, bias and will challenge both Catalyst's approach to contributing to FOSS and maybe many in the audience as well. \r\n\r\nMost of all, the talk will be fun. Because life is too short for pain.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
