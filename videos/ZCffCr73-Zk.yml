description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nMLPerf Meets Kubernetes - Xinyuan Huang & Elvira Dzhuraeva, Cisco \n\nKubeflow is maturing as a cloud native Machine Learning (ML) platform that simplifies the journey of development, deployment, and management of ML on Kubernetes. As Kubeflow gets increasingly adopted, practitioners are looking beyond functions and starting to explore its performance and cost efficiency in the real world. MLPerf is a state-of-the-art benchmark suite that aims to set an industry standard for end-to-end performance evaluation of ML systems with real-world workloads covering both training and inference phases of ML lifecycle. This talk will provide a brief overview about MLPerf, followed by detailed discussions about how MLPerf can be adapted to evaluate ML performance on Kubeflow and Kubernetes, as well as how the performance results can be leveraged to guide the future design and optimization of cloud native ML platforms based on Kubeflow and Kubernetes.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zepu"
