Is there room for Rust? Yes! This talk covers my journey of discovery integrating Rust into a large existing software ecosystem while trying to preserve all of Rust’s nice properties. Writing, building, testing, third-party code, foreign bindings, debugging, deployment, monitoring all need to be re-examined in the light of this new environment. How did we go from nothing to a core production service in Rust?\n\nNo two orgs are alike - you’ll walk away with a practical set of questions you’ll need to consider for your org (and maybe some answers)."
