description: "by Alexander Boettcher\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.121/microkernel_virtualization.webm\n\n\nToday's off-the-shell virtualization solution is ridden with complexity. Application of virtualization call for trustworthy solutions. Complexity defeats trust. \n\nMicrokernels with virtualization extensions and user-level VMMs on top are a approach to mitigate complexity. Modern microkernels like seL4, the NOVA microhypervisor, Genode's -hw- kernel or Fiasco.OC are such promising candidates. Fortunately and unfortunately, the diversity come with fragmentation of the small microkernel community. There are several VMMs for each platform tight to a specific microkernel, rendering it unusable across various kernels. \n\nGenode supports several kernels already, so that unification of virtualization interfaces for VMMs across kernels seem to come into reach. Does it ? The talk will cover the venture and current state of harmonization hardware-assisted virtualization interfaces to fit into the Genode OS framework. \n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:55:00+01"
