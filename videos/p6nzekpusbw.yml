description: "The talk from Embedded Fest 2019 in Kyiv, Ukraine. \r\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/2Y65Svi\n Fb: https://www.facebook.com/EmbeddedFest/\r\nWebsite: http://www.embeddedfest.com\r\n\n\nEducation is the most important tool you can receive. But what if formal education does not really meet the requirements of modern IT industry and can't fully cover set of skills and practical experience required for the embedded software engineer? Yocto, Virtualization, SoC hands-on experience. ... Following the trends and finding new ways to learn things faster and more effective is the key to success.\nWe will be talking about PoC open source education, collaboration with universities and involving mentors and student for better results. We will share our success stories and show examples of our best solutions."
