description: "In this talk Kendra will speak about why you should only use ML when you really need to, some techniques that have been used successfully at Xero to help cut through the noise/analysis paralysis, and why it might help to consider approaching the build of an ML inside the system the same way you might decide what car to buy.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\nDr Kendra Vant is an industry leader in building data-driven products to solve problems for businesses and their customers around the world, by harnessing emerging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.\n\nWith a career spanning four countries, and eight industries, she has led technology teams at Xero, SEEK, Telstra and Deloitte. At Xero Kendra heads a global team of developers, machine learning specialists and data practitioners using emerging practices and technologies to make data work harder to deliver valuable insights to small businesses.  \n\nAfter doctoral studies in experimental quantum physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Kendra completed her postdoctoral work in applied quantum computing at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
