recordingDate: 1447308041
description: "AWS Lambda is the new PaaS from Amazon AWS. It let's you run your code (Java and JavaScript) in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources for you. AWS Lambda runs your code in response to events such as image uploads, in-app activity, website clicks, or outputs from connected devices.\n\nThis talk will give you an overview of existing event sources, an introduction to the high level architecture and programming model and a real world example."
