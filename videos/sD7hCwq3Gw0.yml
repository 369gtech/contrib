Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nOpenFaaS Cloud + Linkerd: A Secure, Multi-Tenant Serverless Platform - Charles Pretzer, Buoyant & Alex Ellis, OpenFaaS, LTD \n\nIn this talk, maintainers of the OSS projects OpenFaaS and Linkerd discuss and demonstrate combining the features of each to build a scalable and secure multitenant serverless platform.  OpenFaaS is a lightweight serverless platform built on Docker and k8s. Linkerd is an ultralight service mesh for k8s. The projects share philosophy around simplicity, ease of use, speed, and low resource impact. OpenFaaS was designed for small teams and tackled multitenancy by creating OpenFaaS Cloud to layer on top. Scaling for multitenancy requires more robust networking, encryption, detailed metrics, and load-balancing strategies than Kubernetes L4 can offer.   Linkerd fits because it provides the features listed above required for scaling multitenancy while remaining focused on simplicity, security, and performance as a part of a modular platform built around OpenFaaS. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uabn"
