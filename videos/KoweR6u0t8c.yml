In this case study Christian Hüning and Lutz Behnke will review the decision making process that led to selecting Linkerd for the task of securing traffic for the Finleap application infrastructure. Christian will also provide insights into the integration process with the application teams and how Linkerd positively affected observability and reliability of the application services. Lutz will present learnings of operating workloads with Linkerd for more than a year, including how to establish secure communication through the service mesh. He will discuss the required operations work to continuously run the cluster despite updates, more than 2500 injected pods or root CA rotations, using cert-manager."
