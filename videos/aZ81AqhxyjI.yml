description: "An Introduction to Database as a Service with an Emphasis on OpenStack Using Trove, and Exploration of the Architecture and Internals\n\nAmrith Kumar, Tesora\n\nThis presentation provides a high level introduction to Database as a Service, and focuses on DBaaS with OpenStack Trove. It also presents an in depth exploration of the Trove architecture.\n\nIt helps answer such questions as “What are some major problems faced by IT and database users in the organization,” “What are the benefits of DBaaS,” “What is OpenStack Trove,” “How does Trove relate to such things as Amazon RDS, MongoHQ, Heroku, DynamoDB, HP Cloud Relational Database and Rackspace Cloud Databases,” “Should I offer DBaaS to my organization,” and “Practical considerations in migrating to DBaaS.”\n\nIt also explores such concepts as “How does Trove interact with other OpenStack services,” “What are the various components of Trove,” “What are guest agents,” “How are requests to Trove processed,” “How does Trove handle such activities as Backup and Restore, Clustering and Replication,” and “How does Trove support multiple database types.”\n \nIt presents some practical examples of benefits achieved in adopting DBaaS, shares learnings from the adoption process, and highlights some potential pitfalls. It helps the participant understand the internals and architecture of Trove and provides the participant with knowledge that would be useful in assessing, deploying and managing Trove in the enterprise. It concludes with a view of the road map of features for upcoming releases.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
