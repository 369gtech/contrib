description: "Speaker: Li Hau Tan\nhttps://github.com/tanhauhau\nhttps://twitter.com/lihautan\n\nHi, I'm Li Hau. Frontend Engineer at Shopee. I like to create bugs and fix them. Recently I am trying to make YouTube video tutorials. Also, I am currently a maintainer of Svelte, hopefully it meant less bug for Svelte.\n\nAbout the talk:\nI understand that not everyone has tried Svelte, not everyone knows about Svelte. Instead of giving a high-level overview of everything Svelte, I am going to share 1 Svelte feature, and hope that gives everyone a glimpse of Svelte.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/275699538/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael Yiin"
