description: "This is the era of unstructured data. More than 80% of data is unstructured in nature (considering social media, email, phone conversations, photos, videos, etc.). They can be a potential gold mine of information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is that set of algorithms, techniques and tools to process and understand natural language-based data. We will be looking at tried and tested strategies, workflows and techniques which can be leveraged by practitioners and data scientist to extract information from text data.\n\nSpeaker: Elena Gagliardoni, Deep Learning Scientist (NLP) , HARMAN International"
