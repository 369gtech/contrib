description: "Have you always been curious about what machine learning can do for your business problem, but could never find the time to learn the practical necessary skills? Do you wish to learn what Classification, Regression, Clustering and Feature Extraction techniques do, and how to apply them using the Oracle Machine Learning family of products?\n\nJoin us for this special series “Oracle Machine Learning Office Hours – Machine Learning 101”, where we will go through the main steps of solving a Business Problem from beginning to end, using the different components available in Oracle Machine Learning: programming languages and interfaces, including Notebooks with SQL, UI, and languages like R and Python.\n\nThis seventh session in the series will cover Feature Extraction 101, and we will learn about the methods to extract meaningful attributes from  a large number of columns in datasets, explore Dimensionality Reduction and how it can be beneficial as a pre-processing for Machine Learning models.\n\nHighlights\n\n00:53 Oracle Machine Learning Office Hours - next Session\n01:59 Machine Learning 101 - Feature Extraction\n02:20 Feature Extraction 101 - Introduction\n04:20 Feature Selection\n06:28 Feature Extraction algorithms\n08:25 Attribute Importance\n10:05 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\n11:24 Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)\n12:30 Intuition on NMF\n15:10 Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA)\n15:47 Feature Extraction 101 Demo\n19:32 Explore the data\n18:18 Data used for the Demo\n20:03 Basic visualization on the data\n21:05 Build Attribute Importance (AI) model\n23:30 Logistic Regression: Full Model vs. Feature Selection via AI\n26:43 Build Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) model\n30:00 Relationship between SVD feature vectors and attributes\n33:16 Logistic Regression: Full Model vs. Feature Selection via SVD\n34:55 Create Principal Components (PCA) projections for test data using the SVD model\n35:55 Plot 3-D of top 3 attributes on original data vs. Projected PCA components\n39:50 Build Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) model via PL/SQL\n41:45 Relationship between SVD feature vectors and attributes\n43:20 Logistic Regression: Full Model vs. Feature Selection via NMF\n44:44 Create NMF projections for test data using the NMF model\n45:10 Plot 3-D of top 3 attributes on original data vs. Projected NMF features\n46:54 Comparison with Build Logistic Regression using the built-in Feature Selection\n49:20 Comparison with AutoML: Auto Algorithm Selection, Auto Feature Selection and Auto Tune for Logistic Regression\n51:15 Q&A"
