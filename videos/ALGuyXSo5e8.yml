description: "DOES18 Las Vegas — Transformation is not a discrete event but a progressive accumulation of new behaviors. This presentation will take a hard look at human motivation, in individuals and organizations, to acquire new capabilities mapped onto progressions of CALMS (Culture, Automation, Lean, Metrics, Sharing) as a model. We’ll start with the concept of progressions, define what these progressions mean with respect to devops in our context, then look at factors that may improve or impede progress. The goal is to improve our future outcomes by understanding how we can apply devops in theory with a more holistic understanding of human behavior and institutionalization theory together with reflections on the last decade of devops in practice.\n\nDevOps Progressions: Teaching Old DevOps New Tricks\n\nAndrew Shafer, Senior Director of Technology, Pivotal\n\nAndrew Clay Shafer spent the last decade helping people deliver software by improving their process and technology. He evangelized DevOps practices and tools before DevOps was a word. Some claim without Andrew, DevOps wouldn't be a word, but he mostly gets embarrassed and changes the subject. His worldview crystallized at the intersection of startups, Agile and web infrastructure, but now he spends most of his time working alongside the biggest and oldest enterprises at Pivotal. Often insightful and always provoking, DevOps has been very good to Andrew and he considers himself fortunate to be involved. An old dog always learning new tricks, Andrew hopes he solved more problems than he caused.\n\nDOES18 Las Vegas\nDOES 2018 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
