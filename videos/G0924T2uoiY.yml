description: "By Raja Rao DV, Cloud Foundry Developer Advocate\n\nSignup for a free Cloud Foundry account https://my.cloudfoundry.com/signup\n\nHave you wanted to learn the basics of Node.js, but haven't had the right resources or opportunity? With Node.js skyrocketing in popularity, now is the time and we are here to help. Join Raja Rao, Developer Advocate at Cloud Foundry, as he takes you through an introductory training in Node. First, we will define Node.js and what you can use it for. Then we will show how to create a basic Node application and quickly deploy your app to the cloud with CloudFoundry.com. After mastering the basics, we will review aspects of Node.js asynchronous code, callbacks, asynch exception handling and event emitters. Finally, we will demonstrate building a Node.js app by using three different apps: MongoDB, ExpressJS/RESTful and Socket.io real-time chat app."
