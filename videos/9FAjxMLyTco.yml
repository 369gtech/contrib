description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nKarl Krukow - CTO, LessPainful\n\nABSTRACT\nCalabash is an open-source technology for automated acceptance testing of Android and iOS apps. Calabash consists of libraries providing advanced automation technology to iOS and Android; it also supports behavior-driven development by supporting the Cucumber tool. Developers or QA staff can write executable tests that closely match the use cases for the app. Tests are written in a natural language close to the application business domain, and the cucumber tool can execute those tests on Android or iOS devices or simulators.\n\nThis talk will introduce Calabash (focusing mostly on iOS), and we'll look at the features that distinguishes it the most from other automation technologies (like advanced gesture synthesis and support for hybrid app/web views). We'll also introduce LessPainful, which \n\nprovides test execution as a cloud service. The LessPainful test service runs Calabash tests in parallel on many physical, non-jailbroken devices running various languages and operating system versions. In a live demo, we'll show how easy it is to get started with Calabash, and we'll also demo the LessPainful device cloud service.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
