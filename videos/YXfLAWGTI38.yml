You will also get to know the boundaries of Kubernetes â€“ what it does and what is it not supposed to do. \n\nYou will also understand the inherent architecture of Kubernetes â€“ master components, node components and the addons provided by it. The course will start off with learning the basic components of Kubernetes like Node, Pod, Deployment, Services, APIs etc and then teach you to create a local cluster using Ubuntu VMs. \n\nYou will also learn to deploy stateful and stateless apps on the cluster. Finally, you will learn, how to expose these app outside of the kubernetes cluster and will also get to know how to scale their apps either manually or using auto scaling. Learn the best security practices that must be followed during this container and cluster orchestration.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nFor Online Training and Certification, Please write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free) for more information"
