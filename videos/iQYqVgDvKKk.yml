Worse, because our concerns are often esoteric (in the eyes of application developers) we have to fix our own pipes too.  Often this leads to the \"homeowners dilemma\"... Making the call of when to patch things up, when to rip out the pipes, and when to abandon gas lamps for electricity.\n\nWe outline a number of aging pipes, proposed (and implemented) solutions, and ideas for dragging our systems into the future. \n\n\n\nBrian 'redbeard' Harrington"
