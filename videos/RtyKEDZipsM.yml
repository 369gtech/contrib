description: "Intro: gRPC-Web - Stanley Cheung & Wenbo Zhu, Google \n\nConnect from Browsers using gRPC-Web We are delighted to introduce gRPC-Web, a cross-browser javascript library which allows developers to write web applications that connect to gRPC servers. In this intro talk, we will briefly talk about the gRPC-Web protocol and deployment model. We will also show a quick demo on how easy it is to start writing a browser application with gRPC-Web, Protobuf and Envoy. With gRPC-Web, you get a very familiar gRPC-style API compared to other languages supported by gRPC. We will also talk about how future holds and what we have planned in the roadmap. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrcH"
