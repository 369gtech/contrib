recordingDate: 1461657563
description: "One of Swift’s most distinct feature is the Optional type. Despite it being new to most iOS developers, some functional programming languages have been dealing with optionals for a long time. In this talk we will explore techniques from the functional world that make working with Swift Optional a real pleasure.\n\nGio is an iOS testing and automation consultant based in Melbourne. He and writes on such topics on http://mokacoding.com, and he is looking forward to hear how teams are approaching unit testing and which infrastructure they are using. Gio is always researching something new to learn, from functional programming, to cosmology and solving the Rubik’s cube. He also is a big Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan.\n\nFor more on YOW!
