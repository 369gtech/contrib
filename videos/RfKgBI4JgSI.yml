description: 'Code generation is ultimately the fifth stage of grief over Go''s lack of generics. We''ve come to accept that Go doesn''t have generics (yet!) but we still want to avoid the tedious task of writing duplicate code. With go generate we have a powerful tool to avoid writing boilerplate code. Using the Abstract Syntax Tree (ast) package we can extract sufficient information from an API file to generate middlewares (logging, instrumentation, etc.) and even documentation.'
