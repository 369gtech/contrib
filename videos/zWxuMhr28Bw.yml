title: 'Game of Streams: How to Tame and Get the Most from Your Messaging Platforms'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027601
description: "Most mission-critical systems have distributed elements or are entirely distributed, resulting in a number of challenges: performance, scalability, reliability, resilience...the eight fallacies of distributed computing are alive and well!\n\nMessaging platforms are often used to solve these problems and increase the “ilities,” but they don’t come without a few complexities of their own. Come to this session to learn not only how to use open source solutions like Spring Cloud Stream, RabbitMQ, and Apache Kafka to maximize your distributed systems’ capabilities while minimizing complexity...but also how to *really* use them! There be dragons when dealing with messaging platforms; the presenter will show you several ways to tame and harness them for maximum fire, maximum altitude. All examples will be coded *live and in real time!*\n\nMark Heckler: Spring Developer & Advocate at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/game-of-streams-how-to-tame-and-get-the-most-from-your-messaging-platforms"
