title: 'CNCF end user technology radar, September 2021 - DevSecOps'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631635924
description: "In September 2021, the 155+ companies in the CNCF End User Community were asked to describe what their companies recommended for DevSecOps' different solutions: Hold, Assess, Trial, or Adopt. They could also give more detailed comments. As the answers were submitted via a Google Spreadsheet, they were neither private nor anonymized within the group.\n\nTwenty-four companies, including Discover Financial Service, Allianz Direct, Intuit, Squarespace, Spotify, and Shopify, submitted 252 data points. These were sorted to determine the final positions. The Radar Team then curated the responses, chose outcomes, and described any patterns or themes they saw in the data or from their own experience."
