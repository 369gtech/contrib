recordingDate: 1433262520
description: "JCache (JSR 107), just released in March 2014, standardizes caching for Java applications. Caching is a primary technique for application performance and scale. Open source projects and commercial implementations have just released their first implementations. It is now possible to add caching to your applications in a standards-based way and choose the implementation best suited to your needs. This session shows you\n \n&bull; How to take an existing application and add caching to it\n\n&bull; How to use the Java and annotations APIs\n\n&bull; How to install multiple caching providers and swap between them\n\nFinally, the presentation walks you through some best practices for using JCache.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBrian Oliver\nBrian Oliver is an Architect at Oracle.
