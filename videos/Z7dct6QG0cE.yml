description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nMay 4, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the main features of Newspeak, a dynamic programming language focused on software engineering. All names in Newspeak are late bound - including class names.  Hence all classes in Newspeak are virtual, every class declaration defines a mixin, and class hierarchy inheritance comes for free.\r\n\r\nNewspeak has no global namespace and no static state. Top level classes act as module definitions. These have no external dependencies. Each instance of a top level class is a module that runs in its own sandbox in accordance with the object capability security model.\r\n\r\nGilad Bracha is the creator of the Newspeak programming language. Previously, he was a Distinguished Engineer at Cadence, and a Computational Theologist and Distinguished Engineer at Sun. He is co-author of the Java Language Specification, and a researcher in the area of object-oriented programming languages. Prior to joining Sun, he worked on Strongtalk, the Animorphic Smalltalk System. He received his B.Sc in Mathematics and Computer Science from Ben Gurion\r\nUniversity in Israel and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Utah."
