description: "This video was recorded at virtual Lambda Days conference, which took place on 16-19th February 2021 - https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2021\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global​ \n\n---\n\nProofViz  An Interactive Visual Proof Explorer \nby Daniel Melcer\n\n\nABSTRACT\nAUTHORS: Daniel Melcer and Stephen Chang:\n\nProofViz: An Interactive Visual Proof Explorer. We introduce ProofViz, an extension to the Cur proof assistant ecosystem that enables interactive visualization and exploration of in-progress proofs. The tool displays a representation of the underlying proof tree, information about each node in the tree, and the values of partially-completed proof terms. Users can interact with the proof by executing tactics, changing the focus to any hole, and undoing or redoing their previous interactions.\n\nWe anticipate that ProofViz will be useful both as a tool to introduce tactic proofs to learners of dependent type systems,  and as a mechanism for advanced users looking for insight into the effects of their custom tactics.  \n\nOBJECTIVE: Demonstrate the need for a tool that exposes how tactics interact with the internal tree structure of a proof, and introduce a tool that does so.  \n\nAUDIENCE: People interested in tactic-based proof systems and dependent types.\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Daniel Melcer\nStudent at Northeastern University \nDaniel Melcer is a computer science undergraduate at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, USA. As a prospective PhD student, he would like to do research that uses programming languages to push boundaries in machine learning. In his free time, he enjoys biking, reading science fiction, and listening to weird music.\n\n\n---\n\nLambda Days\nWebsite: https://www.lambdadays.org​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LambdaDays​"
