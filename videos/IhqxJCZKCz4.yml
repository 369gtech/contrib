description: "Beauty in Code 2019 was a single-track full day IT-conference organized by Living IT, featuring six amazing speakers from three continents. It was hosted at the Malmö Live conference center on March 2, 2019.\n\nSession 2 of 6 by Kjell Ljøstad (@kljostad)\n\"How to Become Agile Without Scrum or Kanban\"\nThis is NOT a talk about Scrum or Kanban. The Agile Manifesto is all about communication, interaction, collaboration and building trust.\nYet when most companies decide to go agile, they focus on implementing some rigid process that they don't yet fully understand, and they have a hard time getting it to work.\nWe go back to the core of the Agile ideology. We will talk about how you can use relational skills to improve communication, get team members engaged and build trust.\nAgile initiatives tend to become a matter limited to the developers, and it is often hard to engage other parts of the organisation.\nIn this workshop you will learn what make teams work efficiently and the basics of how you can get the whole organisation to cooperate better.\nBy building relations and trust between people, working on how they communicate and how they interact with each other, you will build the foundation of a truly agile organisation."
