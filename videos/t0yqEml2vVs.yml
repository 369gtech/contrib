title: 'Alex Karp - DEAR INTERVIEWEE: WHAT YOUR INTERVIEWER WOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW, BUT CAN’T TELL YOU'
recordingDate: 1554768889
description: "“Interviews are stressful. The questions are tricky. You don’t immediately know the answers, so you nervously rush to figure something (…anything) out. It’s almost like the interviewer is rooting for you to fail… or are they? Do you wish you knew what your interviewer was thinking? What they were looking for?\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time on both sides of the interviewing table, so not only do I know exactly how you feel, I know exactly what is going on in your interviewer’s head. All too often, it feels like potentially good candidates get turned away because they don’t know how to set themselves up for success. Similarly, it seems like all of the interviewing related talks focus on what to study, instead of how to approach the interview.\n\nThe goal of this talk is for people to learn what their interviewer is thinking during their interviews, and pick up tips and tricks for really impressing, and how to use all of that to give them the biggest advantage during their next interview.”"
