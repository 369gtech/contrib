description: "Project Avatar - Telepresence robotics with Nao and Kinect\nThomas Endres & Martin Förtsch \nUsing humanoid robots, virtual reality glasses and 3D camera sensors you can experience the world through the eyes of a robot and control it via gestures. The hardware hacking team of TNG Technology Consulting has built a telepresence robotics system based on a Nao robot, an Oculus Rift and a Kinect One. Using these components you can realize an immersive \"out-of-body experience\" - similar to that of the film \"Avatar\". This talk shows how easy it is to program the robot using Python or Java. We will do this by some live coding examples. Following a live demonstration of the showcase we will guide you through the complete program flow of the telepresence system. The speakers will share some insights about the challenges they faced during its implementation. The history of telepresence robotics, current trends and examples for real world fields of application will also be focused."
