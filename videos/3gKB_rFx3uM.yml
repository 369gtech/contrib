description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nLet me guess - your company is all in on “the Cloud” but no one can really agree what that means. You’ve got one group Dockering all the things while another group just rearchitected the Wombat system as a set of functions…as a service. It is enough to make a busy developer’s head spin - how do we make sense of all the options we have? I hate to burst your bubble, but there are no silver bullets, just a set of tools that we can leverage to solve problems. And just as a master carpenter knows when to use their favorite framing hammer and when they need to reach for the finish hammer, we need to use the right tool at the right time to solve our problems."
