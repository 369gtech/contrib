description: "More than just a TodoMVC, this is a real-world story of how we've created over 220 components, by 22 developers, shared across 10 teams, working on 5 brands, within one company called Domain.\n\nHear how we've succeeded (and failed) in tackling the sharing/re-use of components, consistent build tooling, theming, CI, Server Side Rendering (in 5 languages), and the processes we've put in place to manage all those components.\n\nNo matter your team size, big or small, this talk will leave you with practical knowledge you can take back to your team today!"
