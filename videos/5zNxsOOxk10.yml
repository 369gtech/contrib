In order for the next wave of innovation around connected devices to happen, people must be able understand the technology, relate it to their lives, and be able to envision and prototype solutions to real-world problems, even when these problems are relevant only for the few. This, in turn, will only happen when the Internet becomes a Material, accessible to non-engineers and non-experts that can grasp and deploy interactions with the Internet in the physical world, as easily as they can with physical materials.\n\nAyah Bdeir is an MIT Media Lab alum, TED Senior Fellow and the founder and CEO of littleBits, an open source library of electronics that snap together with magnets, for learning, prototyping and fun. In 2008, Bdeir coined the term \"Electronics as Material\" and since then littleBits has won over 20 awards and been heralded as the most extensive, most easy to use modular hardware platform out there, making electronics accessible to everyone without any engineering, soldering or programming necessary. In this talk, Bdeir will talk about how we can democratize the Internet of Things and enable 8 year old kids, corporate executives and professional engineers alike to understand, recreate and most importantly innovate in their connected world.\n\nAbout Ayah Bdeir (littleBits):\nAyah Bdeir is the founder and CEO of littleBits, an award-winning library of electronics dubbed \"LEGOs for the iPad generation.\" Bdeir is an engineer, interactive artist, and one of the leaders of the open source hardware movement.
