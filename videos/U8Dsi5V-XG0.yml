description: 'The next phase of container maturity is being able to take any application, whether its a database, key:value store, or a random java app your company built, containerize it and persist its data. This session will cover the current state of storage and container volumes with Docker Swarm Mode along with a demo of high-availability using automated recovery of persistent data in stateful application.'
