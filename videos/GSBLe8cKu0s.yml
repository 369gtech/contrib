They have varying widths and heights, but their bottom edges are collinear, so that they look like buildings on a skyline. For each rectangle, youâ€™re given the x position of the left edge, the x position of the right edge, and the height. Your task is to draw an outline around the set of rectangles so that you can see what the skyline would look like when silhouetted at night."
