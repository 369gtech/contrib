title: 'A Debuggers Guide to Apache Flink Streaming Applications'
recordingDate: 1635787802
description: 'This talk provides an overview of the first steps to debug a misbehaving or poorly performing Flink application. We present typical obstacles that most Apache Flink application developers will eventually stumble on. We also give an overview of the new tooling that recently became available in Apache Flink. Together with the already existing functionality, Flinkâ€™s web UI can be considered a Swiss Army Knife for troubleshooting issues with backpressure, checkpointing, and more. We present how to use these tools so that you can quickly find, understand, and fix common problems with your Flink applications (or the underlying infrastructure).'
