description: "Effective Java Reloaded\r\nJosh Bloch (Google)\r\n\r\nThe long-awaited second edition of Effective Java is here! It covers the latest in best practices for the Java platform. This presentation will concentrate on three areas where new material has been added to the book: enum types, generics, and concurrency. Do you want to know how to combine the safety and richness of collections with the performance of bit fields? Have you ever been confused by wildcard types? Do you want to know when and how to use lazy initialization? Then come to this talk. The patterns and idioms you learn will be directly applicable to your programs and designs."
