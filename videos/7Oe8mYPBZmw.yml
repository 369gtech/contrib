description: 'We''ve all heard about DEVOPS and companies adopting DEVOPS tactics and strategies. But how can we limit the inherent tension and resulting conflicts between DEV and OPS side? That is bad for effectiveness, the work environment, and attrition. But we want to have an organization that people love to work at, keeps "the site" reliable and moves systems forward at a high pace. In its 13 year history, SRE have learned what happens when you live by ground rules, such as automation, launching fast and often, having well defined SLAs and in case of outages, writing blameless postmortems.'
