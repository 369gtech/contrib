description: "Talk \nThe explosive growth of the data science community provides a hurdle for traditional time-series analysis methods, as many practitioners lack experience in advanced mathematical and statistical principles. To make time-series data mining more approachable, we have developed a novel Matrix Profile-based suite of libraries for novices and advanced practitioners.\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
