description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nThis talk will describe the Grisp Project the port of Erlang to RTEMS. RTEMS is a open-source hard-realtime operating system for small embedded systems. It is used in the aerospace industry flying on satellites and planetary probes - currently its also driving around on Mars and on the Gallileo Satellites. Porting Erlang to RTEMS opens the way to new application areas, like in the current use case a intelligent RFID system for Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things applications."
