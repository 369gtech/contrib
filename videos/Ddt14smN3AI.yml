Instead of parsing the guitar chord data using a regular expression, we will use a proper parser and show that it's not as hard as it sounds. We will then proceed to implement some more advanced features for our parser and check out some edge cases of our implementation. By the end of the talk, you should be prepared to write your first parser and unleash it into the world!\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/ju-liu\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JU LIU\nMaster of the Useless\n\nJu was born in China, moved to Italy as a kid, grew up eating a lot of pasta, and started messing around with computers. He now lives in London and works for NoRedInk. He loves to solve hard problems and build amazing products. When he’s not doing that, he’s probably rock climbing.\n\nMore on Ju Liu: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/ju-liu\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
