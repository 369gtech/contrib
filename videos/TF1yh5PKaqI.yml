description: "Hey everyone! In this video, I’ll walk you through using Weka - The very first machine learning library I’ve ever tried. What’s great is that Weka comes with a GUI that makes it easy to visualize your datasets, and train and evaluate different classifiers. I’ll give you a quick walkthrough of the tool, from installation all the way to running experiments, and show you some of what it can do. This is a helpful library to have while you’re learning ML, and I still find it useful today to experiment with new datasets. Note: In the video, I quickly went through testing. This is an important topic in ML, and how you design and evaluate your experiments is even more important than the classifier you use. Although I publish these videos at turtle speed, I’ve started working on an experimental design one, and that’ll be next! Also, we will soon publish some testing tips and best practices on tensorflow.org (https://goo.gl/nZcS5R).\n\n\nLinks from the video: \nWeka → https://goo.gl/2TYjGZ\nReady to use datasets → https://goo.gl/PM8DtH\nMore on evaluating classifiers, particularly in the medical domain → https://goo.gl/TwTYyk\n\n\nCheck out the Machine Learning Recipes playlist → https://goo.gl/KewA03\nFollow Josh on Twitter → https://twitter.com/random_forests\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel → http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
