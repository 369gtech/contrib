title: 'Back To Basics: Overload Resolution - CppCon 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1640026950
description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nDuring this talk we will explain the definition of a function overload and what rules the compiler follows to decipher which overload to call. The rules can be complex and may not always do what you expect. We will condense the C++ standard to the essential rules every programmer should be aware of in order to reason through overload resolution.\n\nKnowing how overload resolution works will improve your ability to debug compiler errors and this is vital to write correct code. We will provide simple and concise explanations for various buzzwords like template argument deduction, implicit conversion, standard conversions, and tie-breakers.\n\nThis talk is part of the Back to Basics track and the material will be targeted to include all skill levels. Familiarity with C++ is recommended however no prior knowledge of function overloads is required.\n\n---\nBarbara Geller\nI am an independent consultant with over twenty-five years of experience as a programmer and software developer.
