However, the results of indie mobile game developers' case study uncover the techniques which can be used by solo developers and small teams, and which help the game to get noticed and succeed on the platform. The techniques cover the following aspects: Developing the game to achieve the playable build within the minimum timeframe Pre-launch tactics and beta testing Spreading the information on the game to drive the public attention Building the community and receiving extra free human resources for the game development Game monetization tactics Working with android platfroms The case study data was gathered from: Over 6000 mobile developers who use Enhance(TM) platfrom Russian-speaking game development communities Facebook Indie Game Dev group Google Play Indie Corner gamesâ€™ creators To avoid the survivor bias both the successful and not-so-successful cases were analyzed. The developers were asked to describe, how did they achieve first 100, 1k, 10k, 100k, 1M and 10M installs. The common good and bad practices were analyzed and will be presented in this talk. The questions covered: When to start telling possible players about your project. How to make your game stand out. What is the optimal balance between money and time input into your project?
