The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nWIGM and Why You Want an Operator - Carson Anderson, Weave  \n\nOperators are amazing! At least that is what what they say. But what is the actual value they provide? Are they really better than just managing things with yaml? Yes, this is yet another presentation about operators. But with a twist: this presentation takes a new service from yaml, to templates, to two different operators.  The presentation will introduce WIGM. A very simple piece of software deployed in Kubernetes that has one job: download and serve a single GIF. But even the simplest software comes with operational concerns: How to deploy many copies with different configurations? How to update them reliably? How to change configuration without breaking everything?  This is a different kind of operator talk: One that covers the why of operators instead of just the how. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaeS"
