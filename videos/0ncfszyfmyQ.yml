title: 'React Native EU 2020: Brent Vante - React Native Or Expo? Both.'
recordingDate: 1603290892
description: "Abstract:\nMost people attending the conference use React Native, but not necessarily with any of the Expo libraries, tools, or services. I'll talk about what we have built, what we're working on, and what we're thinking about next to help everyone level up their React Native iOS, Android, and web app development experience."
