As we get closer to a\n0.1 release that we'll recommend as \"production ready\", we'll look at the last\nremaining features that we're aiming to land by then. We'll explain and demo the\nimport and module system, classes, and native functions. \n\nWe'll also show some exciting real-time demos that include scheduling, finite state machines, and remote execution.
