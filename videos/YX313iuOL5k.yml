description: "Cloudant, a managed database service powered by Apache CouchDB, is one of the foundational services offered in the IBM Cloud.\n\nIn this talk we'll explain why CouchDB makes so much sense as a cloud service, and how the decision to use Erlang has paid dividends across Cloudant's development and Ops lifecycle.\n\nWe'll close with a preview of some of the new capabilities that are landing in CouchDB 2.0, and share some lessons we've learned growing and maintaining a vibrant open source community.\n\n \n\nSpeaker:\n\nAdam Kocoloski\n@kocolosk\n\nIBM Distinguished Engineer and CTO Cloud Data Services. CouchDB developer, IBM Cloudant co-founder, erstwhile particle physicist."
