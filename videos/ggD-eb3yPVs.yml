title: '"Designing Syscalls for Extensibility" - Aleksa Sarai (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579047107
description: "Aleksa Sarai\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/133/\n\nDue to the nature of Linux's ABI guarantee, the problem of how to safely extend the functionality of syscalls has been a long-standing one. Several different approaches have been attempted over the decades, but many have had unavoidable downsides that have resulted in the introduction of newer syscalls. However, several recent syscalls have taken an alternative approach to syscall extensibility -- and in this talk we will discuss the trade-offs and possible future extensions available thanks to this newer design.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nTue Jan 14 16:35:00 2020 at Arena"
