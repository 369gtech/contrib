description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nOpen Standards: Anchoring Extensibility for Cloud-Native Tooling - Katie Gamanji, CNCF\n\nWithin its 7 years of existence, Kubernetes has been the centerpiece of the Cloud Native landscape, elevating a pluggable system that contributed to the diversification of the entire ecosystem. As a result, multiple areas have developed in the industry, galvanizing solutions for components such as runtime, tracing, metrics, service mesh, and many more. However, to accommodate the expanding space of cloud-native tooling, it was necessary to introduce standardization and guidelines to simplify the interoperability and consumption of these tools. This talk will focus on the evolution of open standards and manifestos within the cloud-native landscape, including OCI, OpenTelemetry, Open Service Mesh, Open Application Model, and many more. Attendees will acquire an understanding of why open standards are pivotal in the path towards the extensibility of cloud-native tooling."
