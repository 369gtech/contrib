description: "Speed up your Python and link it with C\nNick Murdoch\n\nSunday 16th, 16:30 (Ferrier Hall)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nCython is a tool that can convert regular Python modules, or Python with some additional syntax, into C extension modules that can be imported from regular Python code.\n\nThis provides a significant speed improvement on most code, and additionally allows the direct use of C functions within your code.\n\nIn this talk I plan to run through three use cases for Cython and how these have helped me in projects that are either speed-sensitive or need to intermix with external C projects.\n\nThe talk should be suitable for anyone with good basic knowledge of regular Python or better -- cursory knowledge of C is useful but not needed."
