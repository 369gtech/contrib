description: "AGILE team from 0s to Heroes\n\nIt was quite a challenging project, as we started with no source code, the requirements were pretty fluid and the managers changed more often than the months in calendar, but we’ve managed to get on a successful route and I’d love to share it.\nA series of mentions from this journey:\r\n* the importance of hiring people with the right mentality\r\n* making the most out of Agile methodology, always having in mind its’ first point of the manifesto ( Individual and interactions over processes and tools)\r\n~adjusting ceremonies from the process\r\n~ delivering in a CD pipeline\r\n* rewrite the software a few times\r\n* missing some customer deliveries\r\n* continuous feedback from all parts involved in the application\r\n\nAfter all the hustle and bustle of 0s period, we managed to come with a innovative solution for the company, tackling the customers’ direct pain points.\r\n\nWhat have I learned during this process is that AGILE should be modeled after the project and instead of going to a cooking book, we should constantly go back to the spirit of the manifesto."
