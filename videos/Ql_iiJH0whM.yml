description: "Workshop is led by our guest from Portugal, Sara Vieira\n\nCode and exercises – https://github.com/SaraVieira/graphql-workshop\n\nLearn GraphQL by doing! We will have a workshop where we will create a bsic graphql backend with prisma and then connect to the frontend with react Apollo. Don’t worry if you don’t have any experience with GraphQL , all of that will be covered here and you will leave with a simple app that allows for querying the database, adding records to it and even pagination and searching.\n\nJoin us on meetup.com: https://www.meetup.com/ru-RU/Kyiv-ReactJS-Meetup/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/reactkyiv\nTelegram chat: https://telegram.me/reactkyiv"
