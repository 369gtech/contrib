title: 'YOW! 2012 Jafar Husain - APIs that don''t Break'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513432455
description: "Which APIs stand the test of time, and which ones are breaking changes waiting to happen? It's an important question, because although APIs  only account for a tiny portion of your code base, poorly-designed APIs  can cost you massive amounts of money, delay your projects, and even hurt your application's user experience.\n\nNetflix uses Javascript to cost-effectively target a wide range of devices from mobile phones to gaming platforms. We recently redesigned our client-server interaction model, and set out to create a framework that made it easy for developers to create enduring APIs. Along the way we appropriated a UI design pattern for use on the server, embraced reactive programming, and learned to love JSON.\n\nJafar Husain has been working as a software developer for 15 years. He's developed software for companies like GE, Microsoft, and Netflix. Most recently he designed a data access framework that powers Netflix's PS3 and Windows 8 clients. His interests include programming languages, functional reactive programming, and user interface design patterns.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
