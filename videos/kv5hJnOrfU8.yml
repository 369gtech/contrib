recordingDate: 1472814575
description: 'Special Agent Franz will speak about the very real threat of computer and mobile device compromise facing Wisconsin’s businesses, colleges, and government agencies. Recent cases such as the OMB, Anthem, and Sony computer intrusions and the indictment of five Chinese military hackers has shown why the U.S. may be losing up to $400 billion dollars a year from economic espionage. Special Agent Franz will discuss these threats, suggest possible mitigations, and describe the role of the FBI in investigating attempts to steal Wisconsin’s business secrets.'
