description: "Google Gears for Mobile: Power Up your Mobile Web App\r\nAndrei Popescu and Charles Wiles (Google)\r\n\r\nIf you've ever tried coding up a mobile client application, you've probably noticed that the huge variety of mobile operating systems makes it tough to build rich applications that work on every device. But what if developers could deploy applications directly to mobile browsers rather than develop native applications? Google Gears for Mobile is a mobile browser extension for creating rich web applications for mobile devices. This session will show you how Gears for Mobile can be used to develop offline capability into your mobile web apps and how to create slick and responsive applications by hiding latency issues through controlled data caching and storage between sessions."
