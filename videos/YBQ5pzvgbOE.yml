description: "With the advent of the Web Audio API, processing audio signals is now possible in realtime within browsers. Let's take a look into what raw audio data actually is, the signal processing theory behind it, and practical implementations of analyzing audio using the Web Audio API. We'll see how effects processing, audio analysis tools, and DSP algorithms can be constructed, used, and shared all in JavaScript.\n\nhttp://2014.jsconf.us/"
