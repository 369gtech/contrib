title: 'Displaying Users and Groups/Roles - A TimCo Retail Manager Video'
language: English
recordingDate: 1570449611
description: "In this video, we are going to ask Entity Framework for a list of users and roles, we are going to combine those objects into one list of objects and send it to the front-end, where we are going to display it in an administrative view.\n\nPatreon ($5/month or more gets source code for this course as it comes out): https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts, giveaways, and more):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nOne-off tutorials are awesome but they aren't the only thing you should be doing to learn C#. Another vital part of learning is learning how to put it all together. This interactive course is all about putting the pieces together. You can watch each video on its own or you can watch them in order and see a bigger picture. The choice is yours.\n\nThis course focuses on real-world development. As such, we are simulating that we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions on a brand new product, the TimCo Retail Manager. Just like in the real world, we are starting out with one set of requirements but know that over time they will change."
