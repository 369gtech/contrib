title: 'It’s a Trap! Vendor Lock-in and the Cloud (Sam Newman, 2019)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636121080
description: 'The growth of the public cloud market is obvious to everyone. But what’s less well known is that enterprises are still growing the infrastructure and services they run for themselves. A common reason cited for the continual growth in private cloud rather than adopting public cloud offerings are concerns about being locked in to a specific vendor. This talk analyses the concerns about vendor lock-in with respect to the adoption of public cloud. Sam will share with you not only whether or not the concerns of lock-in have merit in the real world, but will also present some tools you can use to help your own thinking in this regard. From traditional risk management techniques and Type 1 vs Type 2 decisions, to real option theory and understanding opportunity cost, hopefully Sam can help shine a light on this often difficult discussion.'
