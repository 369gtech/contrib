description: "Improving Observability in Your Observability: Simple Tips for SREs\n\nDan Shoop\n\nWould it surprise you to know that time-series data dates back hundreds of years to the early days of science, statistics, and data collection? It shouldn't when you think about it and there's plenty of good lessons learned we can re-apply to our dashboards and other engineering presentations today.\n\n\"Improving Observability In Your Observability\" will present practical takeaway lessons that engineers can immediately utilize across various practices and at all levels to improve the visual understanding and credibility of their informational presentations of metrics and observability data.\n\nAs SREs interested in better presenting our telemetry we'll explore what practical lessons we can learn from the works of Galileo, Charles Joesph Minard, and Edward Tufte as well as simple pitfalls to avoid and what we can do to improve the transfer and content density of our dashboards and other engineering graphics.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
