Many of these signals are loud, or strong, a production outage, an angry customer, or a missed deadline. But there’s more to signals than just the ones we see or hear when something goes bang. Actively searching for and understanding Weak Signals is the key to creating the most productive Chaos Experiments. Weak Signals are small, barely noticeable, indications of new emergent behavior in the system. They’re the “tea leaves”, they trigger our gut feelings, and our hunches.\nIn this talk I will dig into the area of Chaos Engineering that I find most interesting, how do you decide [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:19 Signs vs signals\n03:19 What is a weak signal?\n05:04 Why care about weak signals?\n08:29 Signals in the wild\n12:44 Weak signals are a critical source of insights\n13:52 Insights that came from weak signals\n14:05 On-call shifts should end on Fridays\n14:32 The designated \"ops-support\" person\n16:49 \"I don't know anything about this\"\n17:48 takeaway\n19:08 Outro\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.us/chaos-day-2021/sessions/1722/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-chaos-signs-signs-everywhere-a-sign-what-five-man-electrical-band-and-todd-conklin-taught-me-about-chaos-engineering\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ChaosEngineering #SRE #SoftwareReliabilityEngineering #Programming #GameDay #Signals #Signs #WeakSignals \n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
