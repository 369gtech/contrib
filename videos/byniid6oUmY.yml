description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJanne Jul Jensen - Interaction Designer & Usability Specialist\n\nABSTRACT\nThe focus in usability is often on guidelines, do's and don'ts etc., the reason being, that if these guidelines are broken, the user usually has difficulties using the system. And then the explanation stops there. Rarely/never is it discussed, why this makes it hard for the user. Why are some things just so darn hard for the user? What exactly is it, that makes it so hard?\n\nThis talk will go into the psychological theories and explanations, that lie behind the difficulties the user experiences when guidelines are broken. By understanding these psychological explanations, we in turn become better at understanding what to strive for and what to avoid, when designing interfaces, because we understand why. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
