title: 'Functional-first programming with F# - Tomas Petricek'
recordingDate: 1553523649
description: "The F# language is nowadays described as \"functional-first\" programming language. Is this just a marketing trick to make you think that F# is special, or does the F# style of programming really different from other functional languages enough that it is worth using a new \"functional-first\" label? Are C# and TypeScript becoming functional-first programming languages too?\nI will try to give you the answers in this talk! Expect a mix of practical hands-on code samples that illustrate the F# style of programming, ramblings on the philosophy behind F# and extracts from case studies based on large projects completed using the F# language.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndcporto.com"
