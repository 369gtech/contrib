recordingDate: 1598465774
description: "Join us on www.wearedevelopers.com/live for the full experience. Video on the internet is hard. Live video is even harder. Mux exists to make live, or on-demand video streaming accessible to any developer. In this talk, Phil Cluff will start by walking through the challenges and complexities of how video streaming on the internet works today, as well as a deep technical dive into how one of the most common video streaming protocols, HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), works. Finally, Phil will walk through the components required, and process of setting up our own live stream using Mux, and some Open Source components including OBS and HLS.js, while touching on the elements of great API design, and the challenges and solutions to enabling video streaming from within from the browser.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers\n\n#WeAreDevelopers #WeAreDevs \n#WeAreDevelopersLive #WeAreDevsLive #videostreaming #streaming #api #obs #HLS #MUX"
