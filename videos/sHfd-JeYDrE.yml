description: "The world is moving more and more into real time or fast data, and real time analytics. A world that is dominated by open source technologies. Kafka, Flink, Storm, Beam, Nifi, many cool technologies that that deliver great value, and are embraced by engineers and data scientists alike.\nBut as a bank how do you stay in control of this world? Our answer is to embrace open source, and get involved in open source ourselves to build the missing components. This presentation will talk about the need for control, and the way ING gets involved in building open source components that help to bring some law enforcements into the open source wild west."
