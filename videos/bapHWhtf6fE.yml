Rarely does one single technology suit for all requirements, and frequently many different teams are involved which drives solutions with varying levels of [dis-]integration.\n\nApache Kafka is a streaming platform that acts as the 'data backbone' for the enterprise. By streaming events into Kafka as they occur, they can be used in any dependent system, in real time or batch. Search replicas, NoSQL stores, caches, graph databases - these all have their place in solving specific requirements, and all need to be fed with data! Kafka is the enabling platform that supports the event-driven, high performance, scalable integration of data throughout the enterprise, whilst also providing the messaging capabilities to drive applications directly.\n\nThis talk will discuss the role and benefits of Kafka in an architecture, the Kafka ecosystem, and several design patterns used to address specific challenges that organisations face with managing their flows and availability of data.\n\n \nRobin Moffatt \nFrom Confluent\nRobin is a Developer Advocate at Confluent, the company founded by the creators of Apache Kafka, as well as an Oracle ACE Director and Developer Champion. His career has always involved data, from the old worlds of COBOL and DB2, through the worlds of Oracle and Hadoop, and into the current world with Kafka. His particular interests are analytics, systems architecture, performance testing and optimization. He blogs at http://cnfl.io/rmoff and http://rmoff.net/ (and previously http://ritt.md/rmoff) and can be found tweeting grumpy geek thoughts as @rmoff. Outside of work he enjoys drinking good beer and eating fried breakfasts, although generally not at the same time."
