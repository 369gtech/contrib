In this session you'll learn the basics of using buildpacks, why they make a great choice over the alternatives, and what new features the project has to offer. Cloud Native Buildpacks embrace modern container standards, such as the OCI image format. They take advantage of the latest capabilities of these standards, such as cross-repository blob mounting and image layer \"rebasing\" on Docker API v2 registries."
