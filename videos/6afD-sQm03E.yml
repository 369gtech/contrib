description: "When Ops Swallows Dev\n\nScott Prugh, Chief Architect & VP Software Development & Operations, CSG International\nErica Morrison, Director, Software Development, CSG International\n\nCSG has been on an Agile and Lean journey to continually shorten feedback loops in its SDLC and Operations Processes. This began with moving from waterfall to agile and deploying cross functional dev teams. Today, we have taken this transformation further by deploying cross functional product delivery teams that Design, Build, Test and Run their products. Join us to discover the things that went as expected and the surprises we discovered in this journey.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
