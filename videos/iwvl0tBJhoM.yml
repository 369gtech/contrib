title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2019 - Ken Scambler - Applied Category Theory'
recordingDate: 1564434004
description: "Applied Category Theory - The Emerging Science of Compositionality\n\nWhat do programming, quantum physics, chemistry, neuroscience, systems biology, natural language parsing, causality, network theory, game theory, dynamical systems and database theory have in common?\n\nAs functional programmers, we know how useful category theory can be for our work - or perhaps how abstruse and distant it can seem. What is less well known is that applying category theory to the real world is an exciting field of study that has really taken off in just the last few years. It turns out that we share something big with other fields and industries - we want to make big things out of little things without everything going to hell! The key is compositionality, the central idea of category theory.\n\nThis talk will introduce the emerging field of applied category theory, with the aims of:\n\nGiving attendees a broad overview of cutting-edge applications of category theory\nBuilding an understanding of a small number of the most important core concepts\nGetting attendees excited, inspired to learn more, and equipped to apply some basic concepts to their work\n\nKen is a Melbourne-based software developer, who keeps the 1s pointy, the 0s round, and the data structures immutable at MYOB. He is an outspoken advocate of functional programming, an FP community builder in Melbourne, a co-organiser of the Compose :: Melbourne FP Conference and Melbourne Scala User Group, and previously ran the weekly \"FP Guild\" at REA Group.\n\nFor more on YOW!
