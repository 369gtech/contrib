description: "Many security practitioners are still focusing on ISO27001, the quarterly pen test, and the once a year end user training, while their own business’ engineering organizations have traveled to another galaxy, and security researchers have spent a year of their lunch money on bug bounties.\n\n\n\nIn a world where everyone is telling security that we have to keep “moving to the left” to be ahead of adversaries and security research, is there a way to run a security program that really keeps us from being left behind?\n\n\nThis session presents a brief overview of the problems with current approaches to product security, security by design, and secops, and offers a case study and template for implementing DevSecOps and Chaos Security Engineering successfully – where the business teams, developers and engineers, and security researchers all work together in an integrated and supportive approach.\n\n\n=== \n\n\nEddie Schwartz is block.one’s Chief Security Officer (CSO) responsible for the strategy and day-to-day direction of the firm’s global cyber and physical security programs.\n\n\n\nEddie has held numerous executive leadership positions, including Chief Operating Officer for pioneering advertising fraud firm WhiteOps, Inc., VP/Global Leader for Cyber Security Solutions at Verizon; VP/Chief Security Officer for RSA Security; Co-Founder and Chief Security Officer of NetWitness (acquired by EMC); Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ManTech International; EVP/General Manager of Global Integrity (acquired by INS); and Senior Vice President of Operations of Guardent (acquired by VeriSign). He has also served as Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer at Nationwide Insurance.\n\n\nEddie served on the Board of Advisors for multiple early stage / start-ups companies, including Observable Networks and My Digital Shield and has also led global security industry working groups as a member of the International Board of Directors of ISACA and Chairman of ISACA’s Global Cyber Security Taskforce, and a former member of the Executive Committee of the U.S. Financial Services Roundtable"
