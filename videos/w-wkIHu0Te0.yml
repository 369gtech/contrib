title: 'DAVE SNOWDEN: From enlightenment to entaglement'
recordingDate: 1634643178
description: "Full talk title is: From enlightenment to entaglement how do we make sense in a world of accelerating uncertainties?\n\nWe live in a world that is inherently uncertain and the only thing we can know with any certainty is that any action we take will trigger unexpected consequences. Globalisation and hyper-localisation means that everything and everybody are entangled in ways that cannot be understood in terms of simple cause and effect relationships, or managed by just trying to make people more rational. In this presentation, Prof Snowden will look at ways in which we can manage this uncertainty through engagement with networks (including our own staff and country populations) in distributed decision support and micro-interventions. By starting journeys with a sense of direction we remain open to necessary and novel discoveries that allow us to shape the complex eco-system of which are a part."
