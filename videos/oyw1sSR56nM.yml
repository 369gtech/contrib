description: 'If you know HTML and CSS, you''re ready to begin learning JavaScript. But you might be surprised, because JavaScript looks quite different from both HTML and CSS. In part four of Head First JavaScript Programming Teasers, Eric shows you how JavaScript is different from HTML and CSS, and why. He also steps you through a simple example of JavaScript code, so you can get a taste of how it works.'
