description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nOne of the most powerful features of the C++ standard library is the collection of basic algorithms. Everyone knows about sort and copy, but there are is a lot of powerful capabilities in the other algorithms as well. In this talk, I will explore some of the algorithms in the library, and give a rationale for writing your own, along with examples. \n\nThe motivation for writing your own algorithms is that you can create generic building blocks that can be used over and over again in your library or application, and which will allow your to program at a higher level of abstraction. Instead of thinking, \"how do I sort this vector\", you just call std::sort. The same should apply to the algorithms that are specific to your domain - once you write them. \n— \nMarshall Clow\nPrincipal Engineer, Qualcomm, Inc.\nMarshall is a long-time LLVM and Boost participant. He is a principal engineer at Qualcomm, Inc. in San Diego, and the code owner for libc++, the LLVM standard library implementation. He is the author of the Boost.Algorithm library and maintains several other Boost libraries.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
