title: 'Andon manufacturing methodology modernized with Azure IoT'
language: English
recordingDate: 1583780403
description: "Andon is a methodology originally designed by Toyota in the 80's to allow responding faster and more efficiently to issues on manufacturing lines. Skoda is modernizing the methodology to allow operators to respond more quickly to production problems, as well as automatically notify supervisors, leveraging Azure IoT Hub and Office 365. Stepan Bechynsky joins us on the IoT Show to show how the solution implemented at Skoda works using the \"hello world\" of IoT demos: a simple button that operators can press to signal problems on a piece of equipment and that integrates into business applications such as Microsoft Teams.\n\nYou can learn more about Andon at https://aka.ms/iotshow/andon\n\n#iot #azureiot #andonmanufacturing"
