description: "Hardening Envoy - Alyssa Wilk, Google\_\n\nAs Envoy picks up momentum both as a standalone proxy and the signature proxy of CNCF it becomes more and more important to improve Envoy's reliability and stability without reducing developer momentum.\n\nThis talk will cover some of the recent enhancements made both to the Envoy binary to improve reliability and decrease attack surface, work done to fuzz both Envoy and Envoy's third party dependencies to reduce the likelihood of queries of death sneaking into the code base, and committed and planned changes to the Envoy test framework to improve end to end coverage and better test production-like scenarios."
