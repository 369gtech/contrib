description: "\"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life\" - Confusius\n\nWhat would you say if I told you that I told my complete company of nearly 100\_people to do whatever they liked, and the owner of the company fully agreed and supported me? What if I told you that we had a week of great fun, even so much fun that people brought in their kids on their day off because they didn't want to miss it?\_\n\n\nI like to tell stories, and this is the story on how I hacked my way into Agility. With a couple of weeks of preparation, we pulled of a Hackathon of a complete WEEK and all the non-ICT departments joined. I would like to share with you how I made it possible and give some tips and tricks on how to make people want to move and benefit from it.\n\nI will also give you an insight on the renewed Scrum Values and how I put them into practice.\n\nMy company started the Agile journey in the fall of 2015, when development department formed 3 Scrum teams, and started working with the Scrum framework with the help of an Agile Coach.\n\nThe biggest part of our 100 people company is non-technical. With the use of Hackathons we are supporting the transformation from an old fashioned department centered company to a more holistic organization with roles rather than functions, and multi disciplinairy teams so we can increase our agility in a continuously transforming sector.\n\nWith this presentation I will bring insights on the process prior to the Hackathon, what we pulled off in one week of total autonomy and what our plans for the future are.\n\nI would also like to explain what the parallels to the Drupal Comunity are, and try to give you some practical tips since a lot of people really liked that in my prior DrupalCon sessions :)"
