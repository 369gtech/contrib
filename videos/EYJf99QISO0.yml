title: 'Jeffrey Goff - "The Seven Habits of Highly Defective Programmers"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1561176098
description: 'Let''s face it, we''re all defective. Or at least we write defective code. Even TeX, the most scrutinized program in the world, had a bug filed against it in 2014. I may not be able to help you write less bugs, but I can help you write less code. Somewhere between Chihuly, Escher, black holes, origami and Mannheim Steamroller, I''ll share some of my habits that help me write less code, but with more impact.'
