title: 'Power your .NET application with the new generation of diagnostics - Raffaele Rialdi'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624439756
description: "Starting from .NET Core 3, a new set of tools and libraries are available to analyze dumps and live processes.\nDuring this session we will first see the available stand-alone tools and then use the libraries to programmatically access the dump or process data to diagnose faults and memory problems.\nFinally we will see an example of an application making self-diagnostic as an advanced form of telemetry."
