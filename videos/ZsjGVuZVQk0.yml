description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/stephenhay/mobilism2012\n\nIn our industry, everything changes quickly, usually for the better. We have more and better tools for creating websites and applications that work across multiple platforms. Oddly enough, design workflow hasn't changed much, and what has changed is often for worse. Through the years, increasing focus on bloated client deliverables has hurt both content and design, often reducing these disciplines to fill-in-the-blank and color-by-numbers exercises, respectively. Old-school workflow is simply not effective on our multiplatform Web.\n\nIn this session, Stephen explores at a content-based approach to design workflow which is grounded in our multiplatform reality, not fixed-width Photoshop comps and overproduced wireframes. You'll learn how to avoid being surprised by the realities of multiplatform websites. You'll learn how to better manage client expectations and development requirements. You've probably heard of designing in the browser; in this session you'll learn a practical approach for actually doing it.\n\nAbout Stephen: https://www.the-haystack.com\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
