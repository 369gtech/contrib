language: English
recordingDate: 1433784711
description: "Parleys.com has released a brand-new version resulting from the efforts of this sessionâ€™s speaker and his colleagues. They migrated the Flex client to HTML5 and the Spring/JPA/MySQL back end to a very lightweight JAX-RS/MongoDB server side. They also completely moved Parleys to a complete AWS infrastructure with GlassFish. This presentation gives you an overview of the new Parleys platform and some bleeding-edge HTML5 features being used to get the job done. It should be a very informative talk with lots of practical and interesting information.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJo Voordeckers\nundefined\nView more trainings by Jo Voordeckers at https://www.parleys.com/author/jo-voordeckers\n\nStephan Janssen\nStephan Janssen is a serial entrepreneur that has founded several successful organizations such as the Belgian Java User Group (BeJUG) in 1996, JCS Int. in 1998, JavaPolis in 2001 and now Parleys.com in 2006.
