I'll briefly explain three reasons why you might end up in that situation. I'll give some hints to find your way out.\n-------\nSandor Dargo\nSandor is a passionate software craftsman focusing on reducing the maintenance costs by developing, applying and enforcing clean code standards. His other core activity is knowledge sharing both oral and written, within and outside of his employer. When not reading or writing, he spends most of his free time with his two children and his wife baking at home or travelling to new places.\n-------\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2021 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
