description: "DOES18 Las Vegas — Transformational leadership is a critical competency for successful organizational change. Research has shown that these leader behaviors can be learned. In this session Dr. Steve Mayner puts that claim to the test by providing attendees with the opportunity to practice key skills in each of the four transformational leadership quadrants. DevOps is rapidly maturing as a set of practices being adopted by companies of all sizes in a broad spectrum of industries around the world. Common patterns are emerging for embracing DevOps that include technology, software architecture, process models, and proven practices. Amazing tools to fully automate the continuous delivery pipeline dazzle conference goers each year as do the awe-inspiring field reports of Fortune 500 companies who have paved the way to this brave new world. Every question about DevOps seems to have a well-rehearsed and ready answer. Could it be that there’s nothing left other than to “just do it?” Of course, the answer is that while DevOps stories continue to mature with each successive conference, for many organizations the promise of high-performance described in the State of DevOps Report is still little more than a pipe dream.

He has shared the research that supports what many already know: organizational change is difficult and prone to failure, especially when it involves cultural change. Given that transitioning to DevOps inevitably challenges existing organizational culture, practices, and policies, it is no wonder that DevOps is still a future horizon in many enterprises. The good news is that research has also provided a way forward. More than any particular change methodology, science shows that leadership is the essential ingredient to success in organizational change initiatives. Among various leadership models, study after study indicates that the behaviors defined by transformational leadership have a strong positive influence on the variables that contribute to successful organizational change. In the 2017 State of DevOps report, Gene Kim and Dr. Nicole Forsgren published research showing that transformational leadership is actually predictive of the high performing teams and practices that are required to transition to DevOps. The final good news is that research also shows that transformational leadership.\n\nLearning to be a Transformational Leader\n\nSteve Mayner, SAFe Fellow and Principal Consultant, Scaled Agile\n\nDr. Steve Mayner is an executive coach and Lean-Agile evangelist with a passion for cultivating transformational leaders and high performing teams.
