description: "For those who are attending Google I/O 2009(http://code.google.com/io/), these video are an opportunity to hear from some of the speakers in advance. The speakers introduce their topic and provide a preview of one or more topics that will be covered in their talks.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll show you how OpenSocial's REST and RPC protocols allow access to social data from mobile devices - both as mobile-targeted web applications and as native applications. We'll demonstrate a mobile application and dive into code that uses the OpenSocial Java client library on the Android platform."
