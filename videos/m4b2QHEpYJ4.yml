description: "What if form inputs were representative of our modern society, and operated in spectrums rather than binaries? It’s time we re-think this age-old input pattern.\n\nAs developers, product designers, and digital creators of all kinds, we’re making products for people across the globe. This scope of influence is vast and expansive; geographically and socially. What if form inputs were representative of our modern society, and operated in spectrums rather than binaries? It’s time we get a form-ative lesson in inclusive form design; we need to make sure we’re not excluding swaths of our the population in a traditional form’s narrow view of identity.\n\nAndréa Crofts\nProduct Design Manager, League\nhttps://twitter.com/andreacrofts\nhttps://www.instagram.com/andreacroftsstudio/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
