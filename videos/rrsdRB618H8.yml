description: "Lightning Talk: Multi-Datacenter Strategies for Data Services - Julian Fischer, anynines\n\nAs multi-datacenter setups with Cloud Foundry become more popular it’s worth looking at the most common multi-DC and multi-region scenarios. See how these common scenarios can be classified and how the resulting architectures affect the build pipeline, infrastructure platform and most importantly data service automation.\n\nA walkthrough common data services in the context of different multi-DC scenarios will illustrate do’s and don’ts during the automation for the use at large scale. From data services with inherent multi-DC capabilities to those without, an outline of specific and more generic integration strategies will be presented.\n\nAt the end of this talk you will consider multi-datacenter automation of data services more differentiated and have gained a basic understanding of problems and potential solutions.\n\nAbout Julian Fischer\nJulian Fischer is CEO of anynines.
