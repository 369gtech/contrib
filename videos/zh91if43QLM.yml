description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nFrequent toolchain updates allow C++ developers at Google to take advantage of the latest and greatest optimizations, tooling updates, bug fixes, and security mitigations. They also allow our compiler developers to work directly upstream without needing to maintain internal patches or forks, and still make our changes available internally in a timely way.\n\nIn this presentation, we talk about the steps we take to stay up to date and (usually) release a compiler every week, including:\n- How we test for correctness and performance\n- Tools we use to triage problems\n- Various issues that regularly come up, and how we deal with them\n— \nJorge Gorbe Moya\nGoogle\nSoftware Engineer\nSan Francisco Bay Area\nJorge is a Software Engineer in the C++ Production Toolchain team at Google. Former game developer, he enjoys learning about all things computing, making music (with or without a computer), playing basketball, and crafting ridiculously small executable files that produce cool visuals and sound.\n\nJordan Rupprecht\nSoftware Engineer, Google\nJordan works on the C++ Production Toolchain Team and Google, making sure that we can upgrade the compiler without breaking billions of lines of code. He also contributes to the LLVM project, especially on the binary utilities.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
