title: 'Security for Modern Webapps: New Web Platform Security Features to Protect your Application'
language: English
recordingDate: 1564333201
description: "Web applications have historically been plagued by vulnerabilities which allow attackers to compromise the session of a logged-in user: XSS, CSRF, clickjacking and related issues. Luckily, new security mechanisms available in web browsers in 2019 offer exciting features which allow developers to protect their applications. In this talk, we'll introduce these features and explain how to most effectively use them.\nWe'll start by reviewing major threats based on an analysis of thousands of vulnerability reports Google receives each year under our Vulnerability Reward Program. We will find common themes between bugs which appear unrelated and focus our attention on the most frequent high-risk problems.\nWe'll then turn our attention to protective mechanisms implemented in modern browsers, which address entire classes of security problems. This includes CSP3 and Trusted Types to prevent XSS, Fetch Metadata Request Headers to protect from CSRF, and CORP/COOP to mitigate the threat of Spectre.\n\nEVENT:\n\nOWASP Global AppSec Tel Aviv 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nLukas Weichselbaum\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqXwa8Np2Ko"
