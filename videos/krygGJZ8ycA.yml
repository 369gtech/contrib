description: "DeFi is getting more and more attention lately. There are 1000s of DeFi apps that are being built by developers all around the world to provide the underserved to access to financial applications like lending, insurance, and earning. In this tutorial video, I'll show you how to build your own simple DeFi lending app that lets a user deposit Eth as collateral, and get stablecoin in return. They can also repay the stablecoin and get their collateral back. This is an ethereum application, but to avoid high gas fees and slow transaction times, we'll use the Polygon blockchain. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/lending_dapp\n\nCoding challenge (Due Date: 12 December 2021):\nPost your simple DeFi app to Twitter, Instagram, or facebook with the hashtag #BuiltWithPolygon\n\nLearn more about Polygon:\nhttps://docs.polygon.technology/\n\nWeb 3.0 Explained:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPVmd7SyKfQ&t=949s\n\nEthereum Explained:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Qs0XdPpw8&t=1037s\n\nFollow me:\n\nINSTAGRAM:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/\n\nTWITTER:\nhttps://twitter.com/sirajraval\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sirajologyyy\n\nLINKEDIN:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/sirajraval/\n\nPlease subscribe for more programming videos!
