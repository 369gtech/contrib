description: "Erlang User Group May 28, 2013 http://www.meetup.com/erlangusergroup/\nLondon\n\nAbstract:\n\nErlang/OTP has been in use at EE and its ancestors for the past 12 years. Even though there are very few full time Erlang developers, systems developed using Erlang/OTP underpin the entire data revenue stream. This talk will be about the journey, the lessons learned, and a completely biased view about why Erlang/OTP is awesome.\n\nAbout Chandru:\n\nChandrashekhar Mullaparthi a.k.a Chandru is the Head of Service Development at EE, the first and only 4G operator in the UK. He has been working in the Telecoms domain for the past 18 years, of which he has spent the last 12+ years at EE having way too much fun writing Erlang code, and upsetting vendors of telecoms equipment. In his copious spare time, he is studying for an MBA at Cranfield University."
