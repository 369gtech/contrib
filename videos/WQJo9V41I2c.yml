description: 'This presentation is about asynchronous programming in Java, where the streams of data are handled in a non-blocking fashion. We’ll talk about Reactive Streams and specifically about the recently released RxJava2 library that may change the way you design Java applications. You’ll see how to consume streams of events, deal with backpressure, and apply a variety of operators offered by this library, which requires a different way of thinking about writing code. This presentation can be considered as a part 2 of my presentation at JEEConf 2016.'
