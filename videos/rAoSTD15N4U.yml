description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks \n\nIn order to get the control of our websites, at Spilgames we decided to create a platform to ease the development process. The platform contains versioned widgets that get combined for building webpages. It also includes simple web tools for deploying and rolling them back and a native support for A/B testing. Our mission is keeping full control of what happens in our portals while being able to just increase the number of developers for getting more traction in our web projects."
