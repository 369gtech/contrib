description: "Sustaining FOSS Projects By Democratizing The Sponsorship Process How we run and manage our FOSS Sustainability Fund\nby Duane O'Brien\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB5.132/community_sustaining_foss_projects_democratizing_sponsorship.webm\n\n\nWithin a given company, there are typically only a few people involved in deciding which FOSS projects and initiatives to support financially. This year we decided to change all that and democratize the decision making process. We set up an internal FOSS Sustainability Fund, and invited everyone to participate in the process. This talk will examine how we got executive buy in for the fund, how the fund was set up, how we encouraged participation, and what the impact has been so far.
