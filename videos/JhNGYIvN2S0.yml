description: "The web has been good to us and it is more amazing than ever – from a technical perspective. The problem is that it has become a given – not the space-age cool new technology. Time to look at what we do and concentrate on things that matter for our users. CSS isn’t broken, JavaScript isn’t the enemy. How we use them and basic, decent and sensible approaches to creating user interfaces we forgot about are the problem. We need you to take pride in your work, take care of your end users and make sure that the “let’s fix this later” of now isn’t the “oops, that got us hacked” of tomorrow. Join us in unleashing a better, more reliable web that helps users do the tasks they came for – not cater to the needs of advertisers and our corporate goals.\n\nChristian Heilmann\nSenior Program Manager, Microsoft\nhttps://twitter.com/codepo8\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
