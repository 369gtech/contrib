recordingDate: 1534256249
description: "Do you try to keep up with all the new frameworks, patterns and trends in IT? Good luck, it's an endless stream of things to learn. The good news: software development isn't the only profession with this problem. Doctors face the same challenges and must keep the safety of patients in mind while working as cost-effective as possible. With much higher stakes, it's no surprise that medicine is a highly regulated field with explicit rules on the lifelong training - rules that we can use as a source of inspiration for our training.\nIn this session we will look how doctors organise their continuing medical education, debunk some myths about learning and figure out how we can use our daily work as a jumpstart for improvement."
