description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/surviving-120-team-churn\n\nIs your team disruption proof? What would happen if your key developer went on medical leave or left the company? \n\nI’ll explain one way to enable your team to not only survive, but thrive through abrupt changes in team composition. By following the practices of sustainable software development your team can dramatically improve its bus count. \n\nI’ll recount a story about how my team continued to deliver through chaotic times. This ten person team slowly lost most of its developers yet still delivered the product successfully. In the end, 22 developers worked on the 43 week project. \n\nI’ll dig into the reasons that enabled this team to continue to turn the development crank, week after week, and month after month. \n\nBy implementing practices that removed knowledge silos and technical debt, your team can succeeded in the face of disruption.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeaker: Todd Sedano; Engineering Manager, Pivotal."
