description: "*NOTE: Not HD version.\n\nIn this interactive webcast presented by Jonathan Stark author of Building Android Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 2nd Edition, and Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we will discuss mobile app development still being in its infancy and because of this, the tools available for troubleshooting are quite limited. Debugging apps - especially cross- and multi-platform - can be extremely difficult. Fortunately there are a few cutting edge technologies and techniques that can ease the pain while we wait for more mainstream solutions.\n\nWhat will be covered in this webcast?\n\n    Webkit developer tools\n    Remote JavaScript console with JS Console\n    Remote DOM inspection with WEINRE\n    Web debugging proxy with Charles\n    Remote hardware access with DeviceAnywhere\n\nWho is this webcast for?\n\nThis webcast is for front-end designers and developers who are interested in creating web or hybrid mobile apps. A working familiarity with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is recommended.\n\nAbout Jonathan Stark\n\nJonathan Stark is a mobile consultant, web evangelist, and confessed techno-utopian who believes that wireless computing will transform every aspect of human society.\n\nJonathan is the author of three books on mobile and web development, most notably O'Reilly's Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which is available in seven languages.\n\nHis Jonathan's Card experiment made international headlines by combining mobile payments with social giving to create a \"pay it forward\" coffee movement at Starbucks locations all over the U.S.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/jonathanstark\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
