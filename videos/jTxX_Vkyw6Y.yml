description: "Over ten years ago -- in the pre-iPhone days -- many companies questioned the need for a mobile-friendly website. Last year, mobile internet traffic surpassed desktop traffic, and many of those same companies are still struggling to catch up.\r\n\r\nWhat does this have to do with Accessibility (\"a11y\" for short)? The World Wide Web Consortium says, \"Accessibility overlaps with other best practices such as mobile web design, device independence, multi-modal interaction, usability, design for older users, and search engine optimization (SEO).\" They go on to say, \"Users of mobile devices and people with disabilities experience similar barriers when interacting with web content.\"\r\n\r\nWhat if you could increase your website's SEO, improve your mobile web design, and get a head start on the coming Conversational UI revolution (\"Hello Alexa, Siri, Google, and Cortana\") through a renewed focus on Accessibility? And what if, while you did it, you increased your user base by 20% by making it more accessible to disabled users (1.1 billion people worldwide; 18% of the US population)?\r\n\r\nCome hear Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) explain how Accessibility today should be just as important to you as a mobile design strategy was ten years ago. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf3"
