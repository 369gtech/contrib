description: "Boris Smus\n\nOne of the great features of the modern web is that sites work on any device with a browser. This session will focus on creating UIs for the cross-device web. We will cover building web sites that support multiple device form factors (responsive and non-responsive approaches), discuss single page sites and some of the layout features in modern mobile browsers, and do a deep dive into multi-touch input on the web. Finally, we'll show some of the awesome new mobile debugging tools in Chrome and Chrome for Android.\n\nFor all I/O 2012 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/io/"
