description: "Ближайшая конференция — Mobius 2020 Piter\n22-25 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/mobius2020piter\n\n. Fragments. Some hate them, others love them. They spoiled our codebases for years. They help us solve problems they were meant to solve — having an ability to split our UI code into smaller, reusable pieces. They do have many drawbacks though — their lifecycle may get you mad from time to time, the way FragmentManager works is often hard to predict and despite being there for years already, same bugs appear and appear again.\n\nDuring my talk I want to take you for a trip to the past. To 2007, when all tablets out there were just phones with bigger screens and apps looked exactly the same as on phones, but streched. We'll try to build a completely new solution that could solve the issues Fragment do, trying to avoid supportlib's mistakes at the same time. We'll also analyze what kind of open source alternatives we already have and how they work."
