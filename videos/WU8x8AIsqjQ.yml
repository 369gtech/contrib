title: 'MicroProfile Reactive Streams: Control the Stream'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540420006
description: "Gordon Hutchison, Software Developer, IBM\n\nThe Java 9 Flow API provides Reactive Streams providers a common interface, but manipulating and controlling streams still requires use of the underlying Flow implementation library, such as Akka Streams, RxJava, or Reactor. This session introduces the MicroProfile Reactive Streams specification, which provides application developers the standardized APIs to manipulate and control streams. It then shows by example the refactoring of a monolith application to create microservices that use MicroProfile Reactive Streams, demonstrating how the specification makes it easy to write code independent of the specific streams library."
