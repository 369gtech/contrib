description: "One single mistake and the attacker is inside the organization. But don't be frustrated. Attackers make mistakes, too. And YOU can exploit them.\n\nThis talk walks through the most hilarious bugs in real-world malware:\n\n- Simple typos that ruin otherwise stealthy attack campaigns.\n- Thoroughly planned command & control architectures that fall apart because of overlooked crypto dependencies.\n- Bugs in malware that render the functionality useless.\n\nHilarious, scary, and a lot of face palms.\n\nSpeaker: Felix Leder"
