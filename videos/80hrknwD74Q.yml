description: "Spend any time working with designers and you'll be exposed to their specialized vocabulary: keylines, jank, bleeds, affordances and more. To collaborate successfully, you first have to be able to speak a common language. This talk, tailored to non-designers, will cover foundational design principles, explain their importance, and define essential terminology for each.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
