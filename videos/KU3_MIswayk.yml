title: 'Hands-On Lab using Oracle Machine Learning for Python on Autonomous Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614195429
description: "In this Hands on Lab, join us to experience Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) on Oracle Autonomous Database. \n\nOML4Py supports scalable, in-database data exploration and preparation using native Python syntax, invocation of in-database algorithms for model building and scoring, and embedded execution of user-defined Python functions from Python or REST APIs. \n\nOML4Py also includes the AutoML interface for automated algorithms, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. \n\nSign up for this tour of OML4Py, and we will distribute credentials for you to do the Live exercises using the environment during the Session.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
