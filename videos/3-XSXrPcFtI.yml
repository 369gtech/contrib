description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Storing WebAssembly Modules with Bindle - Matt Butcher & Taylor Thomas, Microsoft\n\nIn this presentation we introduce Bindle, a technology for distributing collections of WebAssembly modules. We will talk about supply chain security, distributing nanoprocess-based applications (including wasmCloud), secure proxying, and dynamically assembling applications based on host capabilities. Bindle is designed to move beyond plain object storage. It can describe applications as graphs, where the application can be assembled at runtime based on the constraints and capabilities of the host. An embedded device may favor performance and speed of thoroughness. A server may run an application with a web frontend, while a phone may render it using a native windowing solution. Bindle provides a way to describe these characteristics so that the client can assemble the right collection of WebAssembly binaries to execute optimally."
