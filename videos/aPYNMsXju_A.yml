The current stable version, 3.8, supports Rails  = 3.0, and Ruby  = 1.8.7, that's a lot of versions to support! With RSpec Rails 4, we're fundamentally changing how RSpec is versioned.\n\nIn this talk you'll see a pragmatic comparison of ways to version open source. You'll see how we ended up with RSpec's new strategy. You'll learn what's coming next : Rails 6.0 parallel testing and ActionCable tests. This talk focuses heavily on open source process, and is less technical, so should be accessible to folks of all levels."
