description: "Talk \nTransitioning analysis from familiar Python data manipulation tools to unfamiliar JavaScript visualization tools - for visualization that’s interactive, effective & aesthetic - can be a barrier for many data scientists. This talk will inspire you to use Altair to make professional looking statistical charts (like The NYT & The Economist etc) rapidly, for effective visualization in Python.\n\nSpeaker\nI write Code when the sun’s high, and Poetry when the moon’s nigh.\n\nA curious, driven and experienced Python developer, Data Scientist and Machine Learning enthusiast. I wish to apply data driven insights to solve meaningful challenges - social equality, sustainable growth and climate change. I am always ready for collaborations on designing hardware, products and solutions for a sustainable future and for social good.\n\nCurrently, I am open to remote, full time work opportunities. Did I mention I am a published poet and I love to write poetry and stories?\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
