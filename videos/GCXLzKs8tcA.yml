description: "Your New Customer has no clue what Agile is, however they have lots of assumptions about how they will \"get the product done.\" Do they know how to work effectively with you? Do they know all of the business and user issues that the product will need to solve and how to solve them? Have they built a product like this one before? Are the 100% committed to being the product owner or do they have other jobs too?\r\nWe'll discuss how turn a customer into a Product Owner, from the first meeting to creating the first backlog, through to one year into development. We'll go through key learning points that your new Product Owners and teams will have to transition through, and techniques you can use to make your life and theirs easier. Come prepared to learn tested hands on techniques you can apply in working with your customers."
