description: "The talk from QA Fest 2019 conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/2opqhh8\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/QAFest/\nWebsite: http://qafest.com/\n\n\nOur daily work is comprised of testing a product and improve its quality. However, here and there, we can come to a state where we find a need to build a tool, that can make our work easierbetter.\nI will share from my experience when I found myself in a situation where building a tool was needed.\_\nWe will start with a web application that allows you to know when a food delivery you ordered arrives to the office, and then we will focus on a tool that test the performance of an app from the UI side. We will do a live demo for both of them."
