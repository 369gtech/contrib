title: 'Lambda Jam 2015 - Michael Ficarra - Getting Started With Purescript'
recordingDate: 1445129454
description: "PureScript is a small, modern pure functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It is written in and inspired by Haskell, with an expressive static type system designed for natural, effortless interaction with existing JavaScript programs. In this gentle introduction to the PureScript programming language, we will examine its type system, syntax, idioms, and current best practices. If we have time, we will look at PureScript implementations of familiar JavaScript tasks and analyse the advantages/disadvantages of their PureScript counterparts. Finally, we will take a look at how PureScript is evolving and how it is being used.\n\nMichael is best known for his significant contributions to the CoffeeScript programming language. He spends his days daydreaming about the future of programming languages while working on JavaScript static analysis tooling at Shape Security in Mountain View, California. In the evenings, he is involved with the design of many compile-to-JavaScript programming languages, and contributes to FOSS tools for JavaScript program analysis and transformation.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
