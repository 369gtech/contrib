It’s about motivations, expectations, behaviours and attitudes, and that’s hard to quantify. In order to know whether something is working, a signal or an indication of progress is needed, and progress cannot be measured without a clear sense of what success looks like. Metrics are the signals that show whether a UX strategy is working or not. But signals can be ambiguous.\n\nThis presentation will focus on going beyond basic metrics for evaluating the impact of UX changes, and identifying effective KPIs for measuring the quality of UX.\n\nHira Javed\nUsability Specialist, CBC\nhttps://twitter.com/hirajaved10\nhttps://ca.linkedin.com/in/hirajaved\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
