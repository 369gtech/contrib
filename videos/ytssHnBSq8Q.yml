description: "Github and Google recently released a huge dataset on BigQuery about all the Open Source code contained on Github, thanks to the data from the Github Archive project.\n\nWhat can you learn from such a dataset? What about learning about the most frequently used dependencies and imports? What are the most common Exceptions being handled or thrown? Are there common programming mistakes that we can spot? Guillaume will show you some concrete examples from the dataset, with examples applied to the Apache Groovy language, to learn more about our programming habits and pitfalls.\n\nAnd figure out on your own about your favorite language or framework usage patterns!\n\nGuillaume Laforge is Developer Advocate at Google, in the Google Cloud Platform team. He's well-known for his decade-long work on the Apache Groovy programming language project, for which he serves as Chair of the Project Management Committee at the Apache Software Foundation. Guillaume is also a co-founder of the French tech podcast \"Les Cast Codeurs\".\n\n[PPK-6316]"
