title: 'YOW! Connected 2015 Voon Siong Wong - DIY IoT Backend Platform'
language: English

description: "Internet connected devices must occasionally phone-home to report measurements, receive new instructions, or generally respond to control. Often, it does this unattended, on unreliable low-bandwidth connections.\n\nToday, there are readily available public online services that can play the role of the phone-home server for a modest fee. Yet, we still find ourselves building our own; perhaps for unique technical requirements, data sovereignty, cost savings, or just for “reasons”.\n\nDrawing from experience of rewriting a legacy custom IoT backend platform, this talk discusses some dos and dont’s should you want to DIY. It covers security, authentication, API versioning and deprecation, device relationships (eg, hierarchies and grouping), live notifications, and more.\n\nVoon has the true full stack experience! He’s designed error correction codes for satellite radio communications, pushed and popped registers for embedded systems, developed backend Rails and Node.js applications, and finished it off with frontend javascript. Spread amongst the stack layers, he’s had the opportunity to develop custom IoT devices and the backend platform that serves them. He draws further experience from integrating third party offerings, particulary in electricity and water metering.\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
