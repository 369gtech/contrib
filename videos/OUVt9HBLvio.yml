description: "Cross-platformxWRO #3 Meetup 05.03.2019 Part 2\nKrzysztof Sroka\nWhen it comes to writing apps using Flutter, you will eventually want to bridge some gaps between its libraries and whatever’s being provided by your favourite native OS. Krzysztof gave a talk on how to do that!\n\nKrzysztof Sroka is a cross-platform developer and a Flutter aficionado from Wrocław. He is also member of the local Google Developers Group, where he leads the Flutter initiative. Stay in touch with him via Twitter: https://twitter.com/kpsroka.\n\nThe code presented in this video is available on GitHub: https://github.com/kpsroka/flutter-platform-channels-talk.
