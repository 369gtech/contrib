title: 'Using Vector Projection to Bounce Off a Wall'
recordingDate: 1376571610
description: 'We use dot products and vector projection all over in game programming. This video shows how to reflect a vector (a velocity vector in this case) around a wall normal. We will use this vector reflection trick again when we get to computer graphics and the lighting equations.'
