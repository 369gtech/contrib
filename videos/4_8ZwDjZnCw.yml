We will cover each flaw thoroughly and then talk about how to design software in a way that avoids them entirely. At the end, we will have a Q&A session for questions about the presentation and also any general software design issues you may want to ask about.\n\nAbout Max Kanat-Alexander\n\nMax Kanat-Alexander, Chief Architect of the open-source Bugzilla Project, Google Software Engineer, and writer, has been fixing computers since he was eight years old and writing software since he was fourteen.
