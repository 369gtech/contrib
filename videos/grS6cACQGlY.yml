recordingDate: 1537104617
description: "Ever since the arrest of the Silk Road administrator in 2013, the internet has been buzzing around the terms deep and dark web yet as time passes by, more and more articles, reports and publications by researchers, professionals and even journalists have classified the deep and dark web as the same thing. An image search on the term dark web and you get mostly pictures of an iceberg classifying the internet as having three layers – the surface, the deep and the dark web. But what exactly are they? How are they similar and differ? And what about other terms that are used interchangeably – invisible web, clear net, hidden web, dark net, deep net?\n\nThis talk aims to illustrate the definitions of these terms, how they differ and will offer a theory that could potentially change how we look at the internet.\n\n===\n\nFadli is a cybersecurity enthusiast, a bookworm and a researcher with interests in various domains including cybercrime and hacktivism. He co-founded Division Zero (Div0), a platform that aims to enhance the passion and showcase the talents of the local cybersecurity community. He has also spoken at various international cybersecurity conferences and been featured in various media promoting Singapore’s cybersecurity field."
