description: "Get the Code Here: http://goo.gl/Z1Csh\n\nIn this part of the code refactoring tutorial I will answer another challenge I recently received. This tutorial is all about the Visitor Design Pattern.\n\nYou use the visitor design pattern when you want to perform a similar calculation on many different objects. It seems to confuse people, but I hope to solve that here. If you understand the concept of method overloading and the passing of objects back and forth for data access I don't think you'll have a problem."
