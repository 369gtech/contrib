description: 'The Griffon framework has reinvented itself in order to reach new heights! Version 2.0 brings along a better modular design, dependency injection, JDK8 Lambdas support, and much more. The reduced memory footprint of the Griffon runtime allows applications to be installed on platforms where resources are scarcer, such as Raspberry Pi and other embedded platforms. Turning to the build time, applications can participate effortlessly on multi-project builds, no matter if those builds are driven by Gradle or Maven. There are of course other features that will popup in the near future. Come learn what''s new and what''s next for Griffon; one thing is for sure, it''s future looks very bright.'
