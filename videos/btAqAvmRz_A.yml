description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\n3factor app: An Accessible Design Pattern for Serverless - Tirumarai Selvan, Hasura \n\nIn this talk, I will showcase a pattern involving realtime graphQL, event-driven programming and serverless, called the 3factor app, to build a complex application end-to-end. The 3factor pattern is a super accessible pattern for every level of developer to start developing modern apps on serverless. We will see where traditional monolithic architectures fall short and how to build scalable and reliable apps using this pattern.  Specifically, we will build a food ordering application: a complex application with multiple steps & intricate workflows in the 3factor style. We will especially look at the advantages of using 3factor: from infinite scalability to uninterrupted disaster recovery. We will talk about the stateful aspects of serverless as well. Finally, we will load our application with 10k requests and witness serverless in its full glory. \n\nhttps://sched.co/aYq9"
