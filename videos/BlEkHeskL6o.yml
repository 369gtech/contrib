recordingDate: 1477327885
description: "We are moving towards the reality of self-driving cars, but we are still years away from fully autonomous vehicles. In the meantime, however, there are a number of things we can do to make cars smarter in order to improve the lives of drivers. We can use data and analytics, for example, to prevent breakdowns and predict problems before they occur. Technology can also help cars achieve better performance in extreme situations like hydroplaning. \n\nThe reality is that data collected by car sensors is underused today. \n\nIn this webinar, we will examine: \n\nHow to detect patterns in massive amounts of connected car data \nUse cases for connected car applications, such as predicting failure of parts and subsystems before they occur \nHow to apply analytics in real time to help drivers avoid dangerous situations \nHow to leverage independent data sources to increase predictive value \nDeep Dive: In the second half of the webinar we will give an actual example of how we apply big data technology to this problem.\n\nSpeakers:\nKaushik Kunal Das, Head of Data Science, Pivotal\nEsther Vasiete, Data Scientist, Pivotal\nJeff Kelly, Data Evangelist, Pivotal"
