description: "Apache Pulsar is an open-source distributed pub-sub messaging system, developed under the stewardship of the Apache Software Foundation.\nThis talk will show how its unique architecture enables Pulsar to seamlessly support both streaming and messaging use cases in a single unified platform.\nWe will also show where Pulsar fits with the broader ecosystem of data streaming technologies and all the interoperability that is available out of the box, making it a particularly good choice for supporting any kind of data platform, where versatility, interoperability and scalability are the key requirements.\n\nMatteo  is the CTO at StreamNative. He was one of the original co-creators of Pulsar while at Yahoo!, co-founder of Streamlio, architect and lead developer at Splunk, committer, and PMC of Apache Pulsar and Apache BookKeeper.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
