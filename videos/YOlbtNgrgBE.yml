description: "Today, more than ever, technologists need to be aware of the basics of intellectual property law and the broad effects this area of law has on decisions you make every day. There is a prevalent myth that if something is available on the Internet, it must be free to copy and use as we please. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nIn this session, we will cover some of the core principles of IP, including a look at the major areas of IP legal protection—copyright, trademark, and patent. Become a better informed technologist and gain the confidence to discuss these topics with your professional advisors and with your own team.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
