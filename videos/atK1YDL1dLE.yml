description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nSpeakers: Gunnar Hillert, Michael Minella\nData / Integration Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/who-needs-batch\nStream processing gets quite a bit of the press these days. Projects like Spark, Samza/Kafka, Google Cloud Dataflow, Apache Flink, and Amazon Kinesis bring the question of can we accomplish what we need without a batch component. This talk will take a hard look at if we still need batch these days, what that might look like in a modern development platform, and where Spring fits into it all."
