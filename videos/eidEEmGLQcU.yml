description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nThis will be an entertaining trip through the STL algorithms, where we will view many of them in their natural habitats, going about their natural algorithm business. Then we will take some of them out of their native environments and make them do tricks that are entirely unexpected. In the end, you will gain a new appreciation for what the algorithms are and how pervasively they can be used throughout your code.\n— \nI have been developing software for over 30 years. Yes, I started before I was born. I have been doing C++ for over 20 years, not very well at first, and slightly better now.\n\nI work at F5 Networks, and have worked at Disney, VMware, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, among many others. I have benefited from a wide range of experience and personalities.\n\nI have a personal grudge against code that does not strive to reach a high standard. I am dismayed at code that does not reach its potential. And I firmly believe that writing code well creates a better, more stable, more maintainable product.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
