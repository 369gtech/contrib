description: "There are 7 math problems that each have a 1 million dollar prize attached to them by the Clay Mathematics Institute. Only 1 of these problems have been solved so far, meaning the other 6 are open to anyone in the world with the proper motivation to solve. In this episode, I'm going to explain how recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence can help an individual solve these problems and possibly win the prize money. There are 2 specific techniques I have in mind, the newly released \"Ramanujan Machine\" which can automatically generate conjectures, and the \"Neural Reasoning\" model by DeepMind. Both are relatively new papers, and I believe that we're beginning to see the building blocks of an entirely new frontier of mathematical discovery, where machines can help us discover mathematical principles in ways we couldn't alone. I'll explain it all here, enjoy! \n\nSpots are almost filled in my new Machine Learning course! Learn more here:\nhttps://bit.ly/2YRnb7a\n\nCoding Challenge!\nUse the Ramanujan machine to create a conjecture for \"pi\" i.e 3.14. Here is the code, submit your github link in the comment section, I'll announce the winner in my next episode. Bonus points for great documentation. Good luck!\nhttps://bit.ly/2KGKAy2\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/312pLUb\nFACEBOOK: https://bit.ly/2OqOhx1\nTWITTER: https://bit.ly/2OHYLbB\nWEBSITE: https://bit.ly/2OoVPQF\n\nI love this paper 2019 DeepMind on Neural Reasoning:\nhttps://deepmind.com/research/publications/analysing-mathematical-reasoning-abilities-neural-models\n\nMore on the Ramanujan Machine:\nhttp://www.ramanujanmachine.com/\n\nMy video on Transformer Networks applied to NLP:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDxFvr1gpSU\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nHit the Join button above to sign up to become a member of my channel for access to exclusive live streams!\n\nJoin us at the School of AI:\nhttps://theschool.ai/\n\nSignup for my newsletter for exciting updates in the field of AI:\nhttps://goo.gl/FZzJ5w\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693"
