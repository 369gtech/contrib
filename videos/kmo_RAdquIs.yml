description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nKyle Simpson - Open Web Evangelist at Getify Solutions\n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk is a linter for your code.\n\nI bet you've been writing JS for years and you think you're pretty good at it. I bet you think you know all about how functions create closured scope, and how `this` gets bound, and even how `.prototype` works. Or, rather, you probably don't care because your framework or library takes care of all that for you.\n\nWe'll revisit many of the difficult and commonly-misunderstood parts of JS and see how our code stacks up against these \"new linting rules\". This talk is going to be hard-core on coding and expects a solid understanding of the language.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
