description: "Speaker: Omer Iqbal\r\n\r\nSo you’re running your amazing iOS app, written 100% in Swift 4.2, following the latest and greatest architectural patterns. Everything runs “buttery smooth”. You’re happy to call it a day, and celebrate your incredible engineering feats.\r\nBut oh woe! A pesky bug appears. No matter. You take less than a second to fix the offending line. But crap, your massive project needs 10 minutes to recompile. And now you have to stare at the screen (or join the latest hacker news flame war) for 10 long minutes to try your patch.\r\n\r\nOr you could use LLDB and inject your fix immediately..\r\n\r\nLLDB is an incredibly powerful debugger that’s also incredibly underused. This talk will demo several features of LLDB that can help you boost your debugging powers, and even reverse engineer 3rd party binaries (UIKit, Y u EXC_BAD_ACCESS!). It will also cover some low level aspects of the Swift/Objective C runtimes, like calling conventions, library loading etc.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-iOS-Dev-Scout-Meetup/events/252670315/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Yeo Kheng Meng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/k2io/"
