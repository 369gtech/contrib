description: "Deep Dive: CNI - Bryan Boreham, Weaveworks & Dan Williams, Red Hat \n\nCNI, the Container Network Interface, is a small but critical piece of infrastructure linking runtimes such as Kubernetes and CloudFoundry to dozens of different container network implementations.\n\nThis session is aimed at implementers of network plugins and runtimes using CNI, as well as anyone interested in contributing to the project or becoming a maintainer. We will recap recent changes, look at the roadmap to 1.0, and have plenty of time for discussion and Q&A. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/IxvK"
