description: "Speaker(s): Ecaterina Moraru (Iasi)\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nEvery open source project will tell you that they want more design contributions and that they want their project to be easy to use, beautiful, modern, etc. Still there are lots of complains that is hard to have a designer integrated inside the community. So, is this true? Is there a mismatch between the designer and the community? Are there differences in participants' expectations?- Should the designer be involved in the project from the beginning to the end?\_- Should the designer be also a technical person?\_- Should the designer be responsible for the implementation of his proposals?\_- What we request in a design work is realistic and according to designer's specialty?\_- How can we evaluate a designer's proposals inside our community?\_- Can we have more than one designer involved in the community?\_- Do we know our target and provide full specifications when requesting design work?\_- Who should have the final decision on design proposals?\_- Is the designer responsible for all the usability problems of the project?- Why it is so easy to provide design feedback?- etc.All the above are valid questions when interacting with designers in open source communities and some times the answers don't match. Stating very clear what the expectations are can be helpful in having long term design contributions. In this presentation we will go over the common questions and expectations designers and open source communities have and try to provide a base for design work interactions.\r\n\r\n(Type: Talk | Track: Design, Art, Community | Room: Planck (Floor 3))\r\n\r\nEvent Page: http://2017.fossasia.org\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/5L1g/"
