description: "Big Data can become an unmanageable business burden if you're not careful. As your company's analytics initiatives rapidly grow, you're going to max out your IT budget if you don't keep the data as compact, compressed, and storage-efficient as possible. Just as critical, your users will find all the information far too massive to wade through if you don't deliver targeted subsets to their tablets, smartphones, and other devices for speedy consumption. In this session, Forrester senior analyst James Kobielus will help you understand how to keep your company's data as small and nimble as practical while scaling it out into the petabytes.\n\nJames Kobielus\n\nForrester Research, Inc.\n\nJames Kobielus is a leading expert on Big Data, as well as on such enabling technologies as enterprise data warehousing, advanced analytics, Hadoop, cloud services, database management systems business process management, business intelligence, and complex-event processing."
