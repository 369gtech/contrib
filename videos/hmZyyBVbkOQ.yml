description: "Open Source is Magic\r\nChris DiBona (Google)\r\n\r\nGoogle Open Source Programs Manager Chris DiBona will discuss how, in fact, Open Source is too good to be true and thus must be magic. He will talk about how open source came into being, what it is, what it is not, and how Google uses it to write its software, release software to you and maybe make life a little more magical for you, too."
