description: 'DevOps is the new black. You need DevOps. Right now. What? You’re not doing DevOps yet? Hurry! You’re going to miss the boat! But wait. There’s a catch. Getting DevOps right isn’t easy. It’s downright hard. This session doesn’t explain how to “do” DevOps in your organization, because there is not just one “right” way to do it. What the presentation can show you, however, is how not to do DevOps. The session shares 15 common misconceptions—call them antipatterns—of DevOps. The speaker draws from his own experiences in getting things wrong and explains why they are wrong, to save you from making the same mistakes. You’ll leave this session with a basic understanding of how (not) to fail at DevOps and, hopefully, a smile on your face.'
