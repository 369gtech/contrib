title: 'The Top 10 Hadoop Patterns and Antipatterns'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433254218
description: "Hadoop is a complex system, and much of the ramp-up time is split between learning patterns for efficiently working with data and discovering antipatterns that should be avoided. This session covers patterns such as using bloom filters to speed up your MapReduce jobs and using real-time processing systems such as Storm and Spark for aggregating systems. It also looks at some common antipatterns such as using MapReduce to implement graph processing algorithms and using unstructured text files to store your data. You will walk away from this session with a solid grasp of which Hadoop technologies are the best fit for various use cases and an appreciation of which pitfalls to avoid when working with Hadoop.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAlex Holmes\nAlex Holmes is a software engineer, author, speaker and blogger.
