description: "The complexity of web applications grows exponentially with time. Managing so much state in a modern single-page web application is challenging and difficult to reason about. Frameworks such as AngularJS and Backbone take some of that pain away at the expense of better abstractions and tight coupling between templates and display logic.\n\nFacebook created React in an effort to mitigate this issue. It recognises how powerful the abstractions in functional programming are and let's you write components which are simply functions from state to DOM sub-trees.\n\nIn this talk we'll look at React through Om, a Clojurescript binding that further improves React's performance by leveraging immutable data structures.\n\nFor more on YOW!
