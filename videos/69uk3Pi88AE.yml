title: 'KotlinConf 2019: Kotless - Kotlin Serverless Framework by Vladislav Tankov'
language: English
recordingDate: 1576488360
description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\n\n#Kotless is a Kotlin Serverless Framework, which eliminates the need for a deployment DSL (like Terraform, SAM, CloudFormation or CDK) and makes serverless computations easily understandable for anyone familiar with event-based architectures.\n\nFor example, a developer only needs to be familiar with \"JAX-RS\"-like annotations to create and deploy serverless REST API application based on Kotless.\n\nAt this session I will make an overview of Kotless Client API (with a simple demo) and will touch upon things behind it - the whole code-to-deployment pipeline, its architecture and design concepts. \n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nFor the last two years Software Developer at JetBrains. Interests vary from IntelliJ IDEA proofreading plugins to technologies for DevOps (Kotless and others). Big enthusiast of Kotlin, have created numerous libraries for it. Believe that KTS is the future of Gradle :)"
