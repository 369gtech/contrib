description: "There and Back Again: The BOSH Windows Story [I] - Matthew Horan & Natalie Arellano, Pivotal    \n\nPivotal's Windows Experience team has been working hard to improve the Windows Operator Experience. The early days of Windows Diego cell installation involved a series of MSI installers, command line install generator utilities, and PowerShell scripts. Automation was difficult and error prone. We learned a lot from our experience in decomposing BOSH releases into their component parts, and distributing MSI installers. Just over a year ago, we embarked on an effort to port the BOSH agent to Windows. In this talk, we'll discuss what we learned when porting the BOSH agent to Windows, and the choices we made when designing the interface for Windows BOSH releases. We'll also discuss the benefits we found in moving to BOSH, instead of maintaining an alternative installation mechanism like MSI installers.\n\nMatthew Horan\nPivotal\nManager, Software Engineering\nNew York, New York\nWebsitehttps://matthoran.com/\nMatthew Horan has spent over a decade developing Web applications. Before becoming a developer, he worked as a systems administrator at various startups and hosting providers. Having worked with just about every configuration management tool, and being a developer by trade, he was naturally drawn to Cloud Foundry. He has focused on .NET due to a desire to bring the best practices of Pivotal's Cloud Foundry platform to a wider audience."
