description: "Smart things around the house are nice, but let’s face it, most of these devices are rather dumb. An application can typically control the machines, but they can’t make decisions independently. To do so, you need to add some sensors and find a way to have your controllers communicate with each other. To manage all the information coming from these sensors, you will need an application, and this is where Node-RED comes into play. This low-code programming tool lets the user build flows for event-driven applications. It makes it easy to process events, manipulate data and trigger other events. Once all of the flows are detailed, the runtime can be deployed locally or in the cloud quickly with a container. In this presentation, the attendees will see how to use Node-RED and low-code technology to make smart devices smarter with additional sensors.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
