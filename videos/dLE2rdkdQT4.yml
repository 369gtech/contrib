description: "One Year after the Launch of the U.S. Digital Service: What’s Changed?\n\nMikey Dickerson, U.S. Digital Service\n\nEach year, the Federal Government spends more than $80 billion on information technology. Too often, these projects are over budget, behind schedule, or on-track to fail. But the stakes couldn’t be higher. Millions rely on the basic services these systems support—like care to disabled veterans, health insurance to those who have never had it, and loans to first-generation college students.\n\nThe U.S. Digital Service is partnering the best talent from the private sector with dedicated professionals already in public service to transform the way government works for the people it serves. Mikey will talk about how this work is going and how you can help.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
