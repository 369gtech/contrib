description: "Time has a profound impact on the complexity of the systems we build.\nA significant amount of this software complexity comes from either an inability to recall previous states or the inability to understand\nhow a state was arrived at.\n\nFrom the foundations of AI, LISP and functional programming [1], to\ncausality in distributed systems [2], to the more grungy practices of\nimmutable infrastructure, or the unreasonable effectiveness of\nfact-based approaches to large scale data systems; the ability to\nadequately cope with time, and the change and conflict it inevitable\ncreates, is a common thread to being able to build and reason about\nthese systems.\n\nThis talk looks at the impact of time on system design. We will walk\nthrough examples of large-scale systems and their battles with\ncomplexity. At the end of the talk, the audience should start to see\nthe common spectre of time and have an appreciation of how\nunderstanding time is fundamental to maintaining clarity, correctness\nand reliability in systems.\n\n[1] Situations, Actions, and Causal Laws\nJohn McCarthy\nhttp://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/785031.pdf\n[2] Times, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System\nLeslie Lamport\nhttps://amturing.acm.org/p558-lamport.pdf\n\nMark Hibberd spends his time working on data and sustainability problems for Kinesis. Mark takes software development seriously. Valuing correctness and reliability, he is constantly looking to learn tools and techniques to support these goals. This approach has led to a history of building teams that utilise purely -functional programming techniques to help deliver robust products.\n\nFor more on YOW!
