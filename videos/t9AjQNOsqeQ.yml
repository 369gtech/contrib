description: "While often considered a dirty word in the world of application development and deployment, infrastructure is as important as the code that runs on it.\r\n\r\nIt is time to bring our infrastructure management into our world of continuous integration, delivery, and deployment. Together, we'll learn how to integrate infrastructure management into your CI/CD pipelines.\r\n\r\nYou'll be introduced to tooling like Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Terraform, Ansible, and Inspec. The patterns we'll explore can be applied with most infrastructure management tooling, so we've got you covered! Once you are able to integrate infrastructure management into your CI/CD pipelines, you'll experience a new level of control, stability, and recoverability!"
