recordingDate: 1592080737
description: "This talk gives an overview of the Flair Framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It's two main features are that (1) it is very easy to use and (2) that it gets state-of-the-art accuracies on many NLP tasks. I'll give an introduction from the practitioner's side and show how Flair can be used for tasks such as Named Entity Recognition or Sentiment Analysis on your data, and show how you can train your own models. I'll also briefly cover research aspects of the framework, such as learning word and sentence representations with neural language modeling, and discuss future directions.\n\nSPEAKER:\nAlan Akbik\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish PyData talks"
