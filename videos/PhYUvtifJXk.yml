description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nCamille Fournier - Head of Engineering, Rent the Runway\n\nABSTRACT\nWe've all dealt with systems that were less than ideal, that just barely worked, that we desperately wanted to rip out and replace. But what is the cost of doing this? From the standpoint both of the small company outgrowing its work, and the big company moving a major system, I'll discuss the real technical and cultural implications of replatforming, as well as some best and worst practices. \n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
