recordingDate: 1581364804
description: "In the StackOverflow developer survey, Rust has been the \"most loved\" programming language for three years in a row (2016-2018). Time to see why Mozilla's creation is so popular. In this talk, you'll encounter examples of Rust that show its core features. As someone who has worked in a number of programming languages, Erik will also highlight where Rust is different and what that means for concrete applications. You'll also get a glimpse of the growing ecosystem around Rust.\n\nErik Dörnenburg is a software developer, consultant, and Head of Technology at ThoughtWorks, where he helps clients with writing custom software. Over the years Erik has worked with many different technologies and technology platforms, always curious to understand the potential they offer to solve real-world problems. Having seen a fair share of overly complex architectures he became interested in exploring simplicity in design and software visualisation as a way to make architecture more understandable.\n\nErik's career began in the early nineties and throughout he has been an advocate of agile values and open source software. Over the past ten years he has spoken at many international conferences, contributed to a few books, and maintained several open source projects. He holds a degree in Informatics from the University of Dortmund and has studied Computer Science and Linguistics at University College Dublin.\n\nFor more on YOW!
