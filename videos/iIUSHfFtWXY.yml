title: 'Upgrading to .NET Core: From WebAPI to ASP.NET Core API - A TimCo Retail Manager video'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573059611
description: "Next up in the .NET Core upgrade is our WebAPI. We will upgrade our API to .NET Core 3.0. Part of this process will include using the new dependency injection system. We will also replace our dependencies and work through authentication.\n\nFull Course: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/timco-retail-manager/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List Signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nOne-off tutorials are awesome but they aren't the only thing you should be doing to learn C#. Another vital part of learning is learning how to put it all together. This interactive course is all about putting the pieces together. You can watch each video on its own or you can watch them in order and see a bigger picture. The choice is yours.\n\nThis course focuses on real-world development. As such, we are simulating that we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions on a brand new product, the TimCo Retail Manager. Just like in the real world, we are starting out with one set of requirements but know that over time they will change."
