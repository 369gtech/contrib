description: "Speaker: \nGiang Nguyen, Grab\nDickson Tan\n\nAs developers, we take great pride and responsibility in ensuring a safe and seamless experience for visitors. However, this isn't very much the case for 39 Million blind and visually-impaired people. While America & the EU pledge efforts to make all governmental service websites accessible, there are no systems in place in the APAC region. \nJoin us to find out what it takes to make a web experience truly seamless for those living with blindness and visual impairment, complete with challenge tasks and some prize swag. \n\nRequirements: Participants should come prepared with an Apple Laptop (Macbook, Macbook Air) running El Capitan 10.11 minimally, a laptop charger & a pair of headphones/earphones, a mouse if your trackpad is not working and Firefox browser installed.\n\nGiang earned himself a computer science scholarship in Vietnam, interned at Intel and Captcha before joining Grab as the companies first fully blind coder. Today he manages accessibility at Grab and co-leads (these)abilities’ Web & Mobile Accessibility Initiative. \n\nA true lifehacker at heart, Dickson is pursuing a degree in Computer Science in the NUS School of Computing and represents Singapore at accessibility conferences. He interned at Singtel IT and GovTech and is also the co-lead for (these)abilities’ Web & Mobile Accessibility Initiative.\n\nEvent Page: https://2018.jsconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: Zion Ng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/eoMT/"
