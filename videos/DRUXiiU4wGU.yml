description: "Many applications are built with the same architectural style: a layered architecture with (more often than not) an anaemic domain model.\nWhile easy to set up, this architectural style doesn't help us deal with growing complexity or heavy non-functional requirements.\n\nIn this presentation, we will introduce CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Segregation) architectural pattern. It helps build scalable and maintainable software, by applying a few very simple, yet powerful, principles. During presentation we will see few possible options/frameworks\nthat simplifies the implementation of CQRS based architectures on the JVM."
