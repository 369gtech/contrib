description: "Video sponsor: United States Digital Service (https://usds.gov)\n\nAs engineering managers, we're used to managing the Sprint Burndown chart. Even in non-agile projects, the idea still applies. Over time, the amount of work that remains to be done should go down, and good engineering managers carefully guide the team towards this goal.\n\nHowever, engineering managers have to manage more than backlogs of user stories. They have to stay current with an ever-changing technology landscape, manage the professional and personal concerns of their team members, navigate office politics, and solve the challenges of their own lives. These competing responsibilities often result in burnout and a reduction in the capacity of engineering managers as well as the teams that rely on them for direction.\n\nThis talk will provide insights and tools to help engineering managers reduce burnout and keep their stress levels in a managed state.\n\nAbout Anjuan Simmons\nAnjuan Simmons is a technologist with a successful track record of delivering technology solutions from the user interface to the database.
