description: 'Everybody knows the theory, or at least thatâ€™s what we hope, but not everybody has got the chance to work in an environment that allows code to be deployed automatically. Numerous continuous integration servers, deployment tools, and pipelines are continuously appearing, so loads of different implementations are possible. Which are the correct tooling for each case? How do we orchestrate them? In this presentation we will discover the path that took a young team with a very manual release process, from a not very common combination of Travis, Jenkins, and Cloud Formation, to a one click release with Travis and Spinnaker. Spoiler: it has a happy ending.'
