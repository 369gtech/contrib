description: "Velocity at scale - principles to live by\n\nLike most of you, I've been a student and practitioner of improving the velocity of product / service teams for my 20 years in the industry. We'd all agree velocity is important, but there are many ways to define and improve it. Is it story points? Is it successful feedback or metrics? Is it the popular developer vote? How does it scale to a cross functional team and a growing organisation?\nThis session will be practical. I'll share anecdotes, principles and practices on team velocity that I've picked up over years of hard lessons and different contexts. We will look at velocity from the angles of technology, process and culture. We will consider how velocity changes in environments of significant architectural change, organisational change and team growth. Ultimately we'll define a balanced view of velocity as it relates to customer value and summarise principles for effective and sustainable improvement.\n\nAn experienced software builder and leader, Ben has created collaboration solutions in specialised markets such as Defence and Industry and now every team with Altassian.
