description: "JSLA Thursday July 26, 2012 - Michael Anthony @_activetheory\nOne of the more cringe-inducing terms for any JS developer is \"web page\". We've now reached the point where any meaningful experience needs to be an application. It also needs to be thoughtfully crafted to work on phones and tablets all the while having the level of animation and polish users have come to expect from the technology they use regardless of platform.\nStatic pages with responsive layouts aren't going to cut it in this new universe, so we'll look at using only JavaScript to structure applications, create and style markup, and also be platform aware in order to present users with an interactive experience suited for each device.\n\nThis talk will be a general theory overview accompanied by plenty of examples and very brief code demonstrations. It will cover interesting points along the way such as best practices for smooth UI and animation, content management, SEO, and even how to use these exact techniques to create native mobile applications."
