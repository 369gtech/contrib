description: "Good user experience (UX) is essential in modern software, be it a web application based on Java EE, Spring, Play, or a similar framework or a rich client developed with JavaFX/Swing. It is a must-have in consumer-oriented applications, and even in business applications, good user experience becomes increasingly important. Therefore, proper UX design should be embedded in the development of any user-facing software. Unfortunately, only few teams are equipped with a UX expert and it is up to the developers to incorporate good usability. This presentation, which covers the basics of UX design, takes a look at several concrete and simple techniques that every team can use and that will enable you to increase the usability of your software tremendously.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMichael Heinrichs\nMichael is a user interface creator by passion. He is convinced: no matter which technology and which device, if it has a screen, one can build a truly amazing experience. And pure magic.\n\nHe works at Canoo as a software engineer on next generation user interfaces.
