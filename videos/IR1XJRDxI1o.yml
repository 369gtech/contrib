description: "We hear it’s common to create a minimum viable product (MVP) in a language that facilitates rapid prototyping and then migrate to the JVM when the application requires better stability and performance. In this session, the speaker uses Java to create a web application in less than hour. The JVM is a polyglot platform, and you’ll learn how to use the correct tools for this application, including AngularJS, Bootstrap, HTML5, web services, Java, MongoDB, and Groovy—it’s fully buzzword-compliant. The presentation doesn’t go into every technology in depth but demonstrates the role of each tool and how the tools interact. The session will result in a fully working mobile/browser-friendly app without compromise of design or good practice. It’s even going to have tests.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTrisha Gee\nTrisha has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing and non-profit, for companies of all sizes. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and right now is getting to grips with working in an Open Source fashion as a developer for MongoDB Inc, where she contributes to the Java driver and Morphia. Trisha blogs on subjects that she thinks developers and other humans should care about, she’s a leader of the Sevilla Java & MongoDB User Groups, a key member of the London Java Community and a Java Champion - she believes we shouldn't all have to make the same mistakes again and again.\nView more trainings by Trisha Gee at https://www.parleys.com/author/trisha-gee-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
