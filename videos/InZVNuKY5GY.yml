description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nTutorial: Communication Is Key -- Understanding Kubernetes Networking - Jeff Poole, Vivint Smart Home \n\nNetworking in Kubernetes has several aspects, including DNS, iptables, routing, software bridges, IP assignment, network policies, etc. While the practices for understanding the network were fairly easy to translate from physical servers to virtual machines, the level of complexity increases greatly when moving to containers in Kubernetes.  This tutorial will explain several of the networking concepts used in Kubernetes with accompanying lab exercises in a virtualized environment so that participants will become comfortable looking under the hood at how a Kubernetes cluster is working (or not working, as the case may be).  The material will be designed for people comfortable with SSH, bash, kubectl, and basic networking concepts, and will fill in the more advanced networking knowledge as the tutorial progresses. Please have Vagrant + VirtualBox installed to run the labs locally.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zej8"
