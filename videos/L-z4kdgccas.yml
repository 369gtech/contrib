title: 'Despagghetifying code with NDepend - Jim Pelletier'
recordingDate: 1533199248
description: "So you’ve been left with a huge bowl of spaghetti bolognese, also known as legacy code. You know you need to break it up to make it more maintainable and more workable. You’re sure there are some good places to make your cuts, but every time you pull on a code thread you end up with more spaghetti code!\nNDepend can help with this.\n\nIn this talk I will show you how to use NDepend to effectively visualise your code, find the seams and break down that giant monolith into manageable pieces. And I will show you the kind of improvements my team at Page Up have been able to make with these techniques"
