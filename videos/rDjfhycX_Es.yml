description: "Titel: \"Quarkus: Supersonic Subatomic Java\"\n\nJava web application ready to serve requests 20 milliseconds after start and occupying 20 MB of memory? With Hibernate ORM connected to PostgreSQL, RESTEasy, CDI and transactions? \n\nCome and see how Quarkus makes all the above possible on top of GraalVM using a new technique called Compile Time Boot. Learn how it eliminates reflection and other runtime costs.\n\nThis may sound geeky, but Quarkus still offers the first class developer experience: it shields you perfectly from the complexity of GraalVM, there is development mode with instant reload, it is easy for the 80% most common use cases and flexible for the remaining 20%. You do not need to learn new technologies, because Quarkus supports existing best of breed libs and standards, such as Hibernate/JPA, JTA, CDI, JAX-RS, Eclipse MicroProfile and much more! \n\nSpeaker: Peter Palaga - Senior engineer - Red Hat Middleware.\nSenior engineer at Red Hat Middleware working on WildFly Camel and Fuse on EAP. The author of srcdeps and contributor to several Maven and Gradle plugins."
