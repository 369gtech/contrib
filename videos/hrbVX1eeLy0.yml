title: 'What happens when you search for a kitten on the Internet by Olena Kutsenko | JSCAMP 2021'

description: "In this talk I’d like to give appreciation to something we do almost unconsciously hundreds of times per day, rarely admiring the complexity which happens behind the scenes. Or, should I say, behind the screen? I’m talking about what happens when you use your browser to search or open a URL.\n\nAs engineers, we’re on both sides of this story: on one hand, we're the ones who are responsible to 'set up' our web applications and create secure infrastructure for them.\n\nOn the other hand, the rest of the time we are in the shoes of the users, relying on other engineers to care about our best interests to make the experience fast and secure.\n\nWe’ll focus on speed and security while diving into what happens behind the scenes when you click on a link to check the weather forecast, pay your bills, or ...search for a kitten on the Internet!"
