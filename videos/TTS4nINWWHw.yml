Compact syntax, parameterized tests or flexibility to mention just a few advantages. Over 10 years after JUnit 4.0, the brand new, written from scratch, Java 8 optimized Junit 5 has been released. Is it still worth to write tests in Spock?\n\nDuring my presentation I will compare selected areas of Spock and JUnit 5 to give you an overview how the situation looks like in 2018. I will try to answer the question if its time for Spock to fade into oblivion or maybe quite the opposite it is still light years ahead of JUnit 5.\n#Spock #JUnit #JUnit5\n\nPresented by Marcin Zajączkowski\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
