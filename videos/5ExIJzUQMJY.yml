title: 'The Webb Telescope: We''re about to see our Universe in a whole new light!'
recordingDate: 1607070014
description: "## We're about to see our Universe in a whole new light!\n\nThe James Webb telescope, due to launch in 2021, has 18 foldable hexagonal segments that make up the 6.5m primary mirror. The instruments will be looking at the infrared light from distant and ancient objects along with peering through nebulae (dust clouds) to observe the formation of stars and planets. Spectrometers will measure the atmosphere on exoplanets to increase our understanding of these mysterious worlds orbiting distant stars.\n\nThe Norwich Astronomical Society are going to become the Norfolk representatives for the \"AstroBoost\" project, which aims to increase public awareness of Webb, its objectives and the technologies involved. The UK played a major role in development of the telescope.\n\nWe'll discuss:\n\n- What is Astroboost?\n- A short introduction to the science driving the Webb.\n- The design, construction and launch of the largest space telescope yet built.\n\nCheck out the Webb Site to read more about the project - https://jwst.org.uk/\n\n## About Roger\n\nRoger Preece is Chairman of the Norwich Astronomical Society (NAS), NAS Seething observatory group visits coordinator, Former research institute head of computing and food composition database researcher. His interests: night sky observing, planetary sciences, spacecraft missions.\n\n## Agenda\n\n18:45 ~~Doors~~ Zoom Call Open\n19:00 nor(DEV): Introduction - Begin streaming to YouTube Live.\n19:05 Speaker Slot\n19:50 Q&A\n20:00 Close...
