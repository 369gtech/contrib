title: 'Teach Your Bundler The Users'' Habits - Minko Gechev | Render Conf 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1523529600
description: "Bundlers provide an efficient method of combining resources from our application in order to prevent redundant network requests by the browser. The statically resolvable ES2015 modules allow tree-shaking so in the end, we can deliver to our users only the code they need to run the entire application. Combining bundling and lazy-loading we provide to the users only the piece of the application they need at given point.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss how different machine learning techniques can help us to improve the traditional static, pre-defined bundling and pre-fetching methods. We’ll describe how, using webpack and SystemJS, we can personalize the bundling based on the user’s behaviour."
