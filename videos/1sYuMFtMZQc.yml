description: "PyData LA 2018 \n\nIn this tutorial, attendees will learn how to use Ray to scale their new and existing Python code. It will cover the Ray system architecture, example applications, GPU support, and best practices. It will also include material for more comprehensive exercises. Attendees will also receive a tutorial on Modin, and how Pandas workflows can be scaled by changing a single line of code.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
