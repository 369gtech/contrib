description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nMarch 2, 2006\r\n\r\nPresented by Chuni Lobsang Jinpa Rinpoche and Lama Phuntsho, Gaden Shartse Monastery\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nA group of monks from the Gaden Shartse Monastery on US tour ( http://gadenshartsetour.org ) visited Google on March 2 2006. In addition to touring the campus, they led a meditation session and their master, Chuni Lobsang Jinpa Rinpoche, talked about \"Generating a Tranquil Mind in the Midst of Daily Life Problems.\"\r\n\r\nRinpoche is one of a triplet of brothers born on July 7, 1936. The King of Tibet granted each the title of \"Tulku\", meaning recincarnated High Lama. He studied at the Great Gaden Monastery until 1959 and fled to asylum in India after the Chinese invasion of Tibet.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of H. H. Dalai Lama, Rinpoche continued to train in Buddhist studies and Tibetan literature, and helping to restore the lost sacred scriptures. He was asked to run the Phuntsok Ling school in Orissa and achieved the Geshe degree of Lharampa (PhD).\r\n\r\nSince his retirement, Rinpoche has dedicated most of his time to austere spiritual practice. He is fully devoted to guiding and training young monks and masters on spiritual and ritual performance at Gaden Shartse Monastery.\r\n\r\nVen Lama Phuntsho, translator, became a monk in Bhutan in 1987. He enrolled in the Gaden Shartse Monastery and became assistant to H. E. Khensure Rinpoche Jampa Yeshe, with whom he traveled to Europe, Singapore, Malaysia, and the US.\r\n\r\nPhuntsho also helped coordinate and acted as translator on the 8th world tour \"Sacred Earth and Healing Arts of Tibet\". He is currently involved in the development of the Pokang Khangtsen."
