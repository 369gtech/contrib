Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt\n\nThe craft of Agile testing is maturing, and we have plenty of skilled and gifted testers in the industry, honing their skills, sharing experiences and techniques, and advancing the state of the art. But too many organisations have trouble making the success of individual testers scale up, as the great testing of the few gets diluted by the mediocrity of average testing in the organisation."
