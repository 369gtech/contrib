description: "Surviving a Disk Apocalypse with Single Overlap Declustered Parity\n\nHuan Ke, The University of Chicago\n\nMassive storage systems composed of tens of thousands of disks are increasingly common in high-performance computing data centers. With such an enormous number of components integrated within the storage system the probability for correlated failures across a large number of components becomes a critical concern in preventing data loss. To better protect against correlated failures we introduce Single-Overlap Declustered Parity (SODP), a novel declustered parity design that tolerates large numbers of disk failures and minimizes rebuild time. Our evaluation results show during large failure bursts SODP improves protection against data loss by 20x compared to traditional declustered parity and provides almost identical rebuild times compared to the current state of the art.\n\nView the full Vault '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/vault20/program"
