description: "If you can parallelize your code by harnessing the power of the GPU, I bow to you. GPU code is usually abstracted away by by the popular deep learning frameworks, but knowing how it works is really useful. CUDA is the most popular of the GPU frameworks so we're going to add two arrays together, then optimize that process using it. I love CUDA! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/An_Introduction_to_GPU_Programming\n\nAlberto's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/alberduris/SirajsCodingChallenges/tree/master/Stock%20Market%20Prediction\n\nHutauf's runner-up code:\nhttps://github.com/hutauf/Stock_Market_Prediction\n\nPlease Subscribe!
