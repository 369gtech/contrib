title: 'DEF CON 29 Aerospace Village - Brandon Bailey - Unboxing the Spacecraft Software BlackBox   Hunting'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630569830
description: 'As the commercialization of space increases or access to source code is not feasible, it is getting more common that spacecraft/embedded binaries are a black box. There needs to be a way automate code inspection in a cost effective, fast, repeatable manner which can be constantly enhanced to have the latest capability to build secure spacecraft SW. Synthetic vulnerabilities were created and analyzed with varying results.'
