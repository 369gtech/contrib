title: 'Philipp Hofmann - Faster builds on Android: from 2 minutes to 2 seconds'
recordingDate: 1555661835
description: "What does a developer do when a build takes 2 minutes? He gets bored and his mind starts to wander. Maybe he opens Reddit, Twitter orMedium or checks his emails. \n\nSwitching context and multitasking kills productivity. Every developer needs fast feedback, so he can jump into the flow state. Therefore, fast builds are essential for productive development. \n\nFirst, we take a look into Gradle Build Scans. There is no sense in accelerating your build without measuring and comparing the different outcomes. Gradle Build Scans help you to understand what happens during your build and which parts consume the most time. \n\nThen we continue with basic tips to tweak your build with Gradle. Most of those tips are quick wins, because they only require a simple change in the gradle build settings. \n\nFinally, we take a look into how modularization influences the build speed through an example. By doing it right you can change your business logic and run your tests in 2 seconds instead of 2 minutes."
