description: "Massive IoT becomes reality. IoT devices are anticipated to surpass mobile phones as the largest category of connected devices as early as 2018 and are foreseen to reach 18 billion in 2020. It requires huge amounts of data to be transmitted but what is more important, it also requires a large number of simultaneous connections. This heavy uptake requires a different approach which gives more efficiency and lower energy consumption for every IoT device. To meet these requirements, technology must be revolutionized. It can be achieved with the next generation mobile network technology - 5G. This presentation will show you how 5G will power the Internet of Things!\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
