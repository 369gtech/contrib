description: "Do Docs Better: Practical Tips on Delivering Value to Your Business through Better Documentation\n\nRiona MacNamara, Google\n\nMissing, incomplete, or stale/inaccurate documentation hurts development velocity, software quality, and—critically—service reliability. And the frustration it causes can be a major cause of job unhappiness.\n\nSREs often spend 35% of their time on operational work, which leaves only 65% for development. Time spent on documentation comes out of the development budget, and this is challenging if there's a perception that creating and maintaining docs is grunge work that may not be recognized or rewarded. To convince fellow engineers and leadership to invest time and resources in documentation, it's essential not only to create good docs, but to gather data that communicates their quality, effectiveness, and value.\n\nAttendees will learn:\n\nHow to understand and communicate documentation quality\nFunctional requirements for SRE documentation\nBest practices for creating better, useful documentation\nHow to better communicate the value of documentation work to your business in order to drive change\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
