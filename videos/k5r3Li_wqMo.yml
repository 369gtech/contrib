recordingDate: 1518781222
description: "The story is in the data, you just need to know where to look!\n\nIn this talk, Rob Conery discusses the work done by his fictional aerospace startup, Red:4, to prepare for mankind's return to Saturn in 2020. They built a historical data set using various instrument data from Cassini, in particular the data collected from the mysterious moon, Enceladus. Rob will discuss flyby speed calculation, chemistry analysis and, in brief detail, the machine learning system they plan to send with the next probe, SELFI. Along the way he’ll discuss SQL, database design, and ethics when it comes to analyzing and creating predictive data."
