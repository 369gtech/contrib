language: English
recordingDate: 1632327241
description: "Even the most complex software projects can benefit from the intense collaboration that design thinking brings to your team. Designers have many superpowers aside from designing a user interface. \n \n Providing a team with ideas on how to approach a challenge differently is just one of them. \n \n We’re great at understanding and mapping complex ecosystems in a way that is easy to consume. \n \n We not only do user research, but also system research: understanding how systems play together. \n \n We’re also great workshop facilitators that can help teams articulate pain points and brainstorm solutions.\n\nAntonia Horvath, Delivery Lead & Design Manager at VMware Tanzu Labs\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/why-every-software-team-should-have-a-designer"
