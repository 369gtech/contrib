Instead of rewriting everything at once, this talk shares how we first created a common interface with custom elements, and then upgraded one component at a time to Angular Elements all while expanding the number of teams we integrate with.\n\n \nErin Coughlan \nFrom Google\nErin is Frontend Engineer working on the Google Analytics Suite where she's built a set of common components shared by 13 teams. Erin's core mission is to help others build stunning apps and meet their business needs by contributing best practices, common infrastructure, and components such as the Angular Material data table."
