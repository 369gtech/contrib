recordingDate: 1558517565
description: "Augmented Reality is far more than a Pokémon Go thing now. The hype is real, and many big players (Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, you name it) are pushing AR to become ubiquitous. Hence the abundance of different approaches to AR, a significant need for content creators and creative ways of tackling problems using new techniques.\n\nIs mobile AR superior to HMDs? What's AR Cloud and why it's important? What are real-world cases solved with AR? Is this all still sci-fi or should you start caring? This session presents the current state of AR, showcases its real capabilities, and demonstrates that we are on the verge of a revolution in how humans interact with digital content.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
