title: 'Writing build plugins'
language: English
recordingDate: 1594922804
description: "It's common to use a build tool as part of development, but most folks don't think about writing their own plugins. This is understandable, since it can be pretty daunting. However, knowing how to write plugins gives you insight into how a build tool works, and makes it easier to debug when things go wrong.\nIn this session, we develop the same plugin for both Rollup and webpack, showing the difference between the two systems.\n\nResources:\nCheckout the website → https://goo.gle/3eF2nDv \nrollup → https://goo.gle/3gexEOf \nwebpack → https://goo.gle/3eFLmsT \nCode for the plugins → https://goo.gle/3dDpJrG (click the GitHub icons)\n\nRelated Playlist:\nDay 3 → https://goo.gle/WDL20Day3\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nSpeakers:\nJake Archibald, Jason Miller\n\n#webdevLIVE #webplugins #webpack"
