Within Nationale Nederlanden, a large international insurance company, we offer a compliant and easy to use platform across more than 50 AWS accounts, to be used by over 200 teams worldwide. Providing an enterprise scale, highly regulated, cloud platform and a range of CI/CD tools at this scale is not without challenges. We will take you on our journey that we started 2 years ago. We will share the problems and pitfalls we experienced as a team and explain how we tackled them. We will also teach how we kept ourselves from drowning in operations work and achieved to deliver more, while worrying less. Our journey will include lessons on:\n\nSetting up infrastructure as code in a scalable way\nRunning and deploying many pipelines over numerous AWS accounts\nProviding your customers with tools that they can consume in a self-service way across accounts.\nDuring the talk we hope to inspire you to achieve full automation and leave the session with a unique take on solving CI/CD at scale."
