description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCloud Provider Extraction: What We’ve Done, Where We Are and What's Left! - Walter Fender, Google; Steven Wong, VMware; Nick Turner, Amazon\n\nCloud Provider code allows Kubernetes to run on top of different platforms. Originally, support for all variations was built directly into a K8s release. This brought bloat - a running cluster used only a subset of the code within the release. Also, any cloud specific bug fix or enhancement demanded a new full K8s release as a carrier. This will be a status report on removing the cloud provider code from the main Kubernetes repository. Significant early milestones were recently achieved: the API Server no longer needs the cloud provider library; SSHTunnels have been deleted. For each in-tree cloud provider, we will report on efforts, accomplishments, and roadmap for getting \"out-of-tree\". We’ll also discuss the plans to handle the speed bumps that are left - including interesting topics like multi-repo e2e testing and removing the cluster directory."
