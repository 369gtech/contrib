title: 'Can TypeScript really make infrastructure management easy? - Paul Stack'
language: English
recordingDate: 1581946424
description: "In this talk, Paul will demonstrate why TypeScript is a great language of choice for infrastructure management. Pulumi is an open source tool that allows users to write their infrastructure code in TypeScript, Python or Go.\n\nTypeScript allows infrastructure code to have integrated testing, compile time checks as well as being able to create infrastructure APIs. This will show why a real language is more suited to infrastructure management than DSLs, JSON or YAML. In addition, he will cover how to build infrastructure that manages Serverless, PaaS and IaaS systems across multiple cloud providers.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
