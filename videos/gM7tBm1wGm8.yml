title: 'Extending OTP with custom behaviours - Michał Muskała (Berlin Erlang Factory Lite 2016)'
recordingDate: 1481805451
description: "http://www.erlang-factory.com/berlin2016/michal-muskala\n\nOTP is a wonderful tool that allows us all to develop robust, fault-tolerant applications. The standard behaviours like gen_server or supervisor are bread and butter of Elixir and Erlang programmers. But what's beyond that? This talk will explore the world where we need something more than a plain gen_server and a better abstraction is hiding right behind the corner.\n\nTalk Objectives\n\nThe audience is going to learn about special processes and the concepts of behaviours. Together, we're going to look into how a gen_server works and analyse couple custom OTP behaviours used in popular libraries to finally build one of our own.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nIntermediate Elixir and Erlang users that want to improve their knowledge of OTP"
