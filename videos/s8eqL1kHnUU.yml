recordingDate: 1523512860
description: "OOP the Pokemon Journey is an adventure in discovering object-oriented\_programming in a fun and enthusiastic way. We'll start out as new Pokemon trainers and as we embark on our Pokemon travels, we'll learn OOP concepts along the way.\_\n\nThe inspiration behind this talk comes from how I learned backend concepts in school - pseudo code examples and stories always helped me map concepts to the actual code. This talk will include many of the basic concepts people will encounter while building custom functionality in Drupal 8 - and we'll even look at mirroring D8 core examples to get comfortable.\_\n\nThe following topics will be covered:\n\nWhat is OOP\_\nNamespaces\nClasses\nInheritance\nInterfaces\nTraits\nDependency Injection\nPlugins\nServices\n\_\_ \_\nThis session has a unique format :)\nFor each OOP concept, we'll follow this sequence and then repeat:\_\n\n\_\_ \_1.\_\_ \_Pokemon adventure story\n\_\_ \_2.\_\_ \_concept connection\n\_\_ \_3.\_\_ \_OOP terminology\n\_\_ \_4.\_\_ \_Pokemon code example\n\_\_ \_5.\_\_ \_D8 code example\n\n\nYou should attend this session if you want to learn some OOP concepts, get more familiar with them, need a refresher, or just want to have some fun!"
