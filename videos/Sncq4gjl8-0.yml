description: "LISA16 - Sensu and the Art of Monitoring\n\nSean Porter, Sensu\n\nAs the complexity and scale of our systems increases, our methods of monitoring them must adapt in order to maintain situational awareness. Our newfound ability to produce and deploy software at a high rate demands increased visibility into production.\n\nWe commonly use the term \"monitoring\" to describe a collection of components that make up a system comprised of fault detection, metric collection, analytics, visualization, and notification. Traditional monitoring tools tend to be monolithic in design with their own approach to each of these components. An alternative to the monolith is a composable system, a modular design, combining several best-of-breed tools to fulfill the functions of each component.\n\nSensu is an open source monitoring tool designed for todayâ€™s systems. Sensu is commonly referred to as \"the monitoring framework,\" allowing its users to compose a monitoring system to meet their unique demands. Sensu provides a monitoring agent, transport, event processor, HTTP API, and more!\n\nIn this presentation, I will discuss each component of a modern monitoring system, comparing several approaches to each of them. I will also cover the advantages and disadvantages of specific tool architectures, talk about Sensu's approach to monitoring, and Sensu at scale!\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
