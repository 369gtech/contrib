description: "Speaker: Alejandro Marcu (@AlejandroMarcu)\n\nWhat do you need to be a better programmer? Practice is key, but there are other tricks that will help you. For example, how to work on small steps and have faster feedback. Do pair programming. Avoid manual testing. Balance perfectionism and getting things done.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nAlejandro worked for six years at Facebook using PHP and Hack on projects such as: large data migrations, pages timeline, photos, the ORM system used internally, code generation and the external Ads API. Prior to Facebook, he worked for TopCoder for four years, doing mainly web development in Java. He recently presented at PHP conferences in Argentina, New Zealand and Netherlands. He genuinely enjoys speaking at conferences and contributing his knowledge and expertise in PHP and other technologies.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VGXm/"
