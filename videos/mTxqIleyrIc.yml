description: "When we talk about scalability, we often talk about what happens when we have more product, but we don't always focus on social dynamics and how to scale a data platform in a more team oriented way. What happens when you're company grows from one office to three? How can you ensure that your ability to share data across teams grows with it? \n\nSuch was the problem that Will Larson, VP of Platform Technology, faced at SocialCode, an analytics and optimization startup. This talks outlines their evolution, from monolithic Django/Python and MySQL shop, to a service oriented architecture with an underlying data pipeline for reliably aggregating content built on Kafka. Will discusses the solutions SocialCode discovered as they adapted to exponential growth.\n\nFollow along with Will's slides: http://lethain.github.io/pres_data_pipeline/\n\nMore free Python developer resources: http://crcl.to/jvhzs\nProfession Python training: http://crcl.to/qhsm9\n\nInformation on SF Python: http://sfpython.org"
