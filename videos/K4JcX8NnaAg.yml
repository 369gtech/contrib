description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeakers: Erdem Gunay, Turkcell - Tim Hobson, Intuit - Zach Lendon, Independent\nCore Spring Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-one2gx-2014wideerdemgunay-41125935\nIn this Panel session, each of these presenters will have 20 minutes to respond to the question: tell us about your experiences with Spring Boot? Following that is about 30 minutes of moderated panel discussion. Erdem Gunay from Turkcell will present his experience of re-writing a Mobile BaaS originally written with Spring 3.x. He wrote the service from scratch using Boot in one week, integrating spring security, elasticsearch, mongodb, camel, angular.js, for the win: 40x throughput, 100% availability - zero crashes, 3x the users - used on 300k mobile devices. Tim Hobson from Intuit will present his lessons learned from using with Boot - he will take you through what configuration was necessary, what needed to be built, and how the project leveraged Boot to minimize cross-cutting code and configuration, maximize testability, and focus on the application domain. Zach will present a view of Boot from the hospitality industry, where they are using JAX-RS, DropWizard, and Spring Boot to create micro-service applications. He will help you understand which dropwizard-spring integrations work, and which one's don't, what to watch out for, and how to integrate your Spring applications into dropwizard whether you configure your Spring applications with xml, annotations, and/or java config files.\n\nLearn more about Spring Boot at http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot"
