title: '"Building an ethical data infrastructure" - Marissa Takahashi (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579223832
description: "Marissa Takahashi\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/74/\n\nDigitization of society has resulted in massive amount of digital data that can be collected for various purposes in both industry and academia. The increasing size and complexity of datasets and the increasing sophistication of analytical methods raise ethical questions especially as research agenda move beyond computational and natural sciences to more sensitive social aspects of human lives such as behaviour, interaction and health.\r\n\r\nIt becomes increasingly urgent to strike a balance between the benefits of big data research and the ethical implications on human subjects who generate those digital data. This talk will discuss the issues involved in building a trusted ethical data infrastructure.  These issues will be illustrated in a case study of the Digital Observatory, a data science platform in academic research.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
