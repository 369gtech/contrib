description: "The evolutionary update of the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) specification to CLDC 8 and the introduction of well-defined subsets of the Java SE Platform in Java SE 8 bring a modern set of platform and feature/footprint choices to the embedded target developer. This session provides an overview of these specifications, with a focus on comparing the revisions of the Java language, Java Virtual Machine, and APIs in both draft specifications. The session includes a demonstration of an application that makes use of modern Java SE APIs, deployed on a preview implementation of CLDC 8 that implements these APIs.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAlan Bateman\nAlan Bateman is an engineer in Oracle's JDK team, currently focused on core libraries/APIs and modularity.\nView more trainings by Alan Bateman at https://www.parleys.com/author/alan-bateman\n\nShivakumar Govindarajapuram\ntbd\nView more trainings by Shivakumar Govindarajapuram at https://www.parleys.com/author/shivakumar-govindarajapuram\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
