title: 'Steeltoe: Develop .NET Microservices Without Cloud Platform Lock-In'
language: English
recordingDate: 1571334064
description: "This two part session will start out with an update on what's new in our latest release and what features are coming in Steeltoe 3.0. Next, we will move into a walkthrough on how Steeltoe provides simpler ways to build cloud-native .NET microservice applications without platform lock-in.\n\nThe Steeltoe .NET project, like our peer project Spring Cloud, is all about providing developers with the tools they need to quickly implement some of the common patterns (e.g., configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, distributed sessions, etc.) used in building highly scalable, enterprise-quality microservices.\n\nSteeltoe provides programming abstractions you can leverage to ensure your applications are built using cloud-native principles and are cloud platform agnostic. Part two of this session will go through many of those abstractions and show how you can develop a polyglot-based microservice (e.g., Java and .NET) that can easily be moved from cloud to cloud.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/33Q5geU \n\nSpeaker: Hananiel Sarella, Software Engineer, Pivotal; Tim Hess, Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/steeltoe-develop-net-microservices-without-cloud-platform-lockin"
