description: "This month we invited two very long time CSS Working Group members and editors to come and talk about CSS Media Queries ~Level 4~.  \n\nMedia Queries Level 4 is  a spec that is headed toward Candidate Recommendation status soon and the CSS Working Group would like to use this opportunity to tell you about it and hear as many questions and get as much feedback as possible before this happens.\n\nfantasai is a senior spec-writer in the CSS Working Group and a former Mozilla layout engine QA & dev contributor. Since joining W3C as an Invited Expert in 2004, sheâ€™s worked on a long list of specs including CSS2.1, Backgrounds and Borders, Selectors, Flexbox, Writing Modes, Paged Media, Image Values, and so many others.\n\nFlorian Rivoal has been a CSS-WG Member since 2011 and is a Web Standards & Business Consultant,  formerly with Opera, Gelato Group, Vivliostyle.
