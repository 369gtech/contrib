description: "How dorma+kaba Leverages and Deploys on CloudFoundry - Michael Erne, wölkli gmbh & Adriano Raiano, dorma+kaba\n\nDORMA Group and Kaba Group, merged to form dorma+kaba in September 2015. The merger has created one of the top three companies in the global market for security and access solutions, with pro forma sales of more than CHF 2 billion and around 16,000 employees. dorma+kaba is active in over 50 countries and has a presence, through both production sites and distribution and service offices, in all relevant markets. In this presentation, you will take part of the journey of how dorma+kaba is leveraring Cloud Foundry for their access control as a service \"exivo\" and how they deploy on it.\n\nCloud Foundry makes it exceptionally simple to deploy and manage applications with simple commands like 'cf push'. However, as your application grows in complexity and the number of deployed components explodes it becomes difficult to keep an overview of the required services and bindings. Many organisations, like dorma+kaba, face these challenges sooner or later, especially with microservices architecture.  Starting from the naive idea of automating deployments using shell scripts wrapping the Cloud Foundry cli, the pitfalls encountered with this approach, and the evolution towards sophisticated and reliable tooling. Finally dorma+kaba built their open framework to deploy 80+ applications through multiple deployment stages including production and open sourced it during the CF Summit \n\nAbout Michael Erne\nMichael Erne is the CEO at wölkli gmbh, a swiss-based consultancy focusing on cloud technologies such as Cloud Foundry. He supports the dorma+kaba group in their journey with Cloud Foundry. He is one of the maintainers of the open source deployment framework push2cloud.\n\nAbout Adriano Raiano\nAdriano Raiano is the Lead Platform Software/System Architect at dorma+kaba, the world’s leading provider of groundbreaking solutions in the security industry. He contributes to cloud projects initiatives since late 2012, is a cloud foundry user and the author and maintainer in multiple open source projects such as a cqrs framework for node.js and i18next.com with its \"as a service\" offering locize.com."
