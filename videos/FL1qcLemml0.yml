description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/c...\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nCopy of Realtime Object Detection with Phoenix and Python\nby Alvise Susmel \n\nABSTRACT\nYOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. In this talk Alvise shares how we can bring its functionalities in a Phoenix app, taking advantage of Python's fantastic set of Machine Learning libraries.\n\nAlvise will start by building an Elixir wrapper around a Python library, so he can detect objects on single images. Then we make it real-time on a Phoenix app, detecting objects from a webcam feed.\nLive demo at the end!\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Alvise Susmel\nPassionate Software Engineer, in love with Elixir and windsurfing.\n\nIn the last 5 years, Alvise has been CTO in a London-based hedge fund, developing at the same time a deep interest for teaching.\n\nEager to learn new technologies, paradigms and architectures, he's been contributing to the Elixir community writing articles on poeticoding.com.\n\n---\n\nCode BEAM V 2020 was sponsored by Duffel, PepsiCo, Klarna, WhatsApp, DNSimple, Flyiin, Erlang Solutions, Forza Football, BlockFi, App Unite, Pleroma, Simplabs, Telnyx, Clever Bunny, O'Reilly, Manning Publications\n\nCode BEAM V\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/c...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
