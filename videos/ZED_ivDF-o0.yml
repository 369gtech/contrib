title: 'GeeCON 2018: Marcin Moska≈Ça - Kotlin Coroutines in Action'
recordingDate: 1532330769
description: 'Kotlin Coroutines fascinate from its early beta. They are a new way to write asynchronous and non-blocking code. They can be thought of as light-weight threads without having to deal with all the problems that threads bring to the table. In this talk I will show you how to use Kotlin Coroutines and what makes them so special and so efficient. I will also discuss if they are an alternative to RxJava.'
