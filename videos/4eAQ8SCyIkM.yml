language: English
recordingDate: 1516907062
description: "A nerdy talk introducing the audience to the concept of encoding bits onto a radio wave. Weâ€™ll learn how to pack data tightly to achieve high bandwidth and how to recover from data loss without retransmission. The theories will be put to the test using a Software Defined Radio built using nothing but Node.js and a few radio parts.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeConf EU 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nThomas Watson\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNodeConf EU Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nnearForm Ltd YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp2Tsbjd3P8itnBHUNHi82A\n\nnearForm web-site: https://www.nearform.com/"
