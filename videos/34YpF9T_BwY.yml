description: "We asked the Fortune 500 software delivery leaders what holds them back. This talk is the analysis of their insights on what bottlenecks they encountered in their DevOps journey.\n\nBaruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate at JFrog. For a living he hangs out with JFrog’s tech leaders, writes code around the JFrog Platform and its ecosystem, and then speaks and blogs about it all. He has been doing this for the last dozen years or so, and enjoys every minute of it. Baruch is @jbaruch on twitter and mostly blogs on http://www.jfrog.com/blog/ and http://blog.bintray.com. He is a professional conference speaker on DevOps, Java and Groovy topics, and is a regular at the industry’s most prestigious events including JavaOne (where he was awarded a Rock Star award), Devnexus, DockerCon, Devoxx, DevOps Days, OSCON, Qcon and many others."
