How does a docker work? Is it really a light-weight virtual machine? How does one isolate the processes and manage resources in a container? Can one write their own docker?\n\nIn this talk, we get familiar with the basic building blocks of Linux containers namely chroot, namespaces, and cgroups. We discover syscalls that we can use to manipulate namespace, how to apply resource limits and write our own container in Rust!\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/gargi-sharma/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - GARGI SHARMA\nHopeful systems programming romantic!\n\nGargi is currently a Systems Engineer at Tarides where she works on library Operating Systems.
