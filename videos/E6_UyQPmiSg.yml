title: 'A High-Performance Solution to Microservices UI Composition - Arif Wider & Alexey Gravanov'
recordingDate: 1469110600
description: "So you have decided to go for Microservices and you want to achieve maximum autonomy for your teams. However, at the front end your services still have to be joined into a single page.Here you have two options: Either have a single UI layer which all teams depend on or let each service render its own UI and compose these UI pieces later on.\nIn the course of moving the Autoscout24 platform - one of Europeâ€™s leading internet car portals - to an AWS-hosted Microservice architecture, we favored autonomy and therefore decided for the UI Composition approach. During this process we faced all the challenges of UI Composition, such as performance, consistency, isolation, and testing. Learn how we started off with a rather complex attempt and then managed to greatly improve and simplify our solution."
