recordingDate: 1612095127
description: "Keith Packard\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/63/\n\nWe, at SiFive, are just finishing up building a RISC-V based computer\r\nthat can be used as a full Linux desktop. It's time to take it out for\r\na spin and see what it's made of. This presentation will discuss the\r\nhardware, from the CPU, to the M-2 drives and PCIe support, including\r\ngraphics. Next, we'll explore at the software stack running on the\r\nboard, including the boot system and Linux kernel, drivers for the\r\nhardware and graphical applications.\r\n\r\nA significant portion of the presentation will show free software\r\nrunning on the hardware, along with images and videos of the board in\r\noperation.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSun Jan 24 10:45:00 2021 at Blemings Labs"
