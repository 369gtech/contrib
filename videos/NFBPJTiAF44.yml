Over time, we noticed common patterns and saw how most streaming applications can be reduced to a few core archetypes or “application blueprints”. In this talk we will outline a few of these “stream processing application blueprints” in a practical, hands-on format, and also take a look at operational considerations. \n\nIn the first half of the talk, we will quickly recap the basics of the modern stream processing space and also take a look at the challenges posed by stateful and event-time aware stream processing.\n\nIn the second half, we will look at common application blueprints and see how they can be applied in practice. Among the archetypes we will cover:\n\nAggregating IoT event data, in which event-time aware processing, handling of late data and state are important\nData enrichment, in which a stream of real-time events is “enriched” with data from slowly-changing database of supplemental data points\nDynamic stream processing, in which a stream of control messages and dynamically-updated user logic is used to process a stream of events for use cases such as alerting and fraud detection"
