description: "Beyond the Individual: Exploring Data Protection by Design in Connected Communal Spaces\n\nMartin J. Kraemer, University of Oxford\n\nThere's a gap between the personal focus of data protection legislation and practices, and the communal implications of internet-connected technology. Through our research, we've started to explore how existing design tools and methods can help understand and address communal implications. In this talk, I will highlight opportunities for design in such spaces by discussing two case studies from participatory design workshops. These case studies show potential for our method to inform data protection design that is appropriate to social groups and their dynamics, complementing individual perspectives on data protection.\n\nView the full PEPR '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr20/conference-program"
