description: "This is a series of three webcasts so please be sure to register for series two and three. In this first series of three, Mobile Web browsing is exploding and with it the importance of Mobile Web Performance. Studies show that Mobile users expect equal or better performance than desktop, where they demand 2s load times. This is a hard requirement to fulfill, give the limitations mobile imposes.\n\nIn this webcast presentation, we'll go over the different aspects of mobile: network, hardware & software. We'll review the challenges each presents, understand how they affect web performance, and show ways to overcome those challenges. We'll also show the impact of these optimizations on real world sites, gleaned from manipulating and measuring websites using Blaze technology. We'll summarize with updates on the recent mobile OS releases, followed by Q&A.\n\nAbout Guy Podjarny:\n\nGuy Podjarny, or Guypo, is a Chief Product Architect at Akamai. Guy works on Automated Front-End Optimization, and was the co-founder and CTO of Blaze.io, later acquired by Akamai. Guy has been in the web application field for over a decade, moving from Web Application Security to Web Application Performance, but keeping his focus on deep analysis of web pages. Guy is also a self admitted efficiency fanatic, looking to extract the most out of everything, from a packed suitcase to a complex web 2.0 app."
