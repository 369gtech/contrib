description: "Are you too busy to dedicate 4 years of your life to a traditional Computer Science Major? I've created a 5 month accelerated Computer Science curriculum to help you get a broad overview of the field, covering the most important topics in sequential order using the free resources of the Internet. I've listed learning tips, Computer Scientists to follow, and a path in this video. I hope you find it useful, this is the kind of learning path I'd design for myself but I'm open sourcing it. Enjoy! \n\nCurriculum for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Computer_Science_in_5_Months\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going. \n\nWant more education?
