title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Decoupled Drupal and Angular 2'
recordingDate: 1493190356
description: "With decoupled Drupal gaining more steam by the day and unprecedented\_approaches entering the mainstream, the need to keep abreast of current front-end technologies has never been more paramount. Angular 2, released last year, is a significant leap forward for the Angular ecosystem with TypeScript usage, a built-in command-line interface, and a focus on \"develop once, push everywhere,\" including web, mobile web, and native. Though the framework has evolved drastically away from Angular 1's\_versatile yet sometimes unwieldy developer\_experience, the Angular 2 team has endeavored to ease the transition by providing a graduated transition path from Angular 1 to Angular 2 applications.\n\nAngular has an enthusiastic and large community with ample surrounding tooling. It's an excellent candidate for integration with a decoupled Drupal back end, whether you're using JSON API or Drupal 8's built-in core REST API. Join me as we spelunk into the undiscovered depths of Angular 2 as we dive into the depths of TypeScript (including decorators), observables, Angular 2 components and services, and promise-based communication with Drupal 8.\n\nHere's some of the questions we'll answer together:\n\nWhy Angular 2? Why TypeScript?\nWhy not Angular 1? Why not ES6?\nHow is Angular 2 architected?\nWhat are the key concepts in Angular 2?\nHow do I set up, build, and develop an Angular 2 application?\nHow do I build Angular 2 components and services?\nHow does routing work in Angular 2?\nHow do I set up decoupled Drupal 8?\nHow do I foster communication between Angular 2 and Drupal 8?\nWhat are some of the implications of Drupal-backed Angular 2?"
