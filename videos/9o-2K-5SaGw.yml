description: 'Alert Logic set out to migrate to a micro-services based architecture using Erlang. We wanted to leverage all of the upcoming industry best practices, such as web services, micro-services, data isolation, service discovery, devops, and cloud-based data centers. This talk is a case study on our experience, including the cultural issues that had to be addressed. We primarily use Erlang for our services, but had to consider other technologies as well.'
