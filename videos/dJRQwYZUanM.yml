recordingDate: 1298049880
description: "Paper-based literature is becoming digital, migrating from the page onto screens and the web. James will be talking about book guilt, the Open Bookmarks project, foam-phase literature and how publishers can reclaim reading.\n\nJames Bridle\n\nbooktwo.org\n\nJames Bridle does things with books, mostly. With a background in both computing and traditional publishing, he attempts to bridge the gaps between technology and literature, whether that takes the form of writing about the publishing industry, consulting to leading international publishers, or actually being a publisher. James created Bookkake, a small publisher using new technologies to bring new life to independent publishing, and Bkkeepr, an attention data service for bibliophiles. He writes about books and the publishing industry at booktwo.org and runs a series of websites including Quietube, an accidental anti-censorship proxy for the Middle East. In 2009 he helped launch Enhanced Editions, the first ereading application with integrated audiobooks."
