description: "Luisa Morales - Frontend Developer, Stealthwerk\nJesse White - Principal, Contino\n\nPlanning, building, and running a local, engineering-forward Meetup event is one of the best ways to get involved in the open source community. Luisa and Jesse, Organizers of the Docker NYC Meetup are going to give you a toolset that will show you how to create a group in your area, or build your current group into a powerhouse of knowledge sharing and collaboration. Specifically, we'll focus on building a core team of volunteers to support your organization, how to attract a diverse set of members, and what to focus on with your community."
