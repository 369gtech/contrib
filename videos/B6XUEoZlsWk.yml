description: "Speaker: Sascha-Oliver Prolic, Prolic IT\n\nI've written event sourced applications with prooph for a while now, after some time I realized, that there is some boilerplate I need to write again and again. Boring stuff that leads to errors pretty quickly, because I'm not paying attention that much on repetitive boilerplate code I need to write. Also I realized that I don't need my favourite framework that much anymore and when creating some small microservices (like one for each aggregate), their need really disappears. Let me invite you to yet another journey, from standard application framework scenarios, to microservices and how functional programming and code generators can make a difference to eliminate so much boilerplate, that your applications are getting slimmer and slimmer.\n\nAbout the speaker\nMaintainer of the prooph components, zfc-rbac, zfr-oauth2-server, HumusAmqp and FPP, contributor to zend framework, php-enum, prophecy, phpunit, Doctrine and many many more\n\nEvent Page: https://2018.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/lcAg/"
