description: "Speaker: Prasanna K\n\nJavaScript Obfuscation demystified. Everyone writing JavaScript knows that there are multiple ways of doing the same thing. Developers build filters to catch malicious JavaScript, but a wily attacker can obfuscate JavaScript so that filters can be bypassed.\n\nThis session will teach participants multiple JavaScript implementation details and how these are used to build obfuscated code. We will also discuss how to dissect already obfuscated code. The session is divided into two parts: first part will expose participants to different components of JavaScript internals and how they can be used to create obfuscated code. The second part will help them to decipher obfuscated code.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/1103905549641078/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Hx8b/"
