description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V  2020 - codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nFlamegraph and heatmap profiling | Edmond Begumisa & Roshan Giri\n\nABSTRACT\nTALK LEVEL: INTERMEDIATE / ADVANCED\nProfiling Erlang systems is tricky due to their concurrent nature - many things going on at the same time.\n\nWe introduce a new open-source low-overhead profiler which samples callstacks and graphically categorises them by process status, reductions, memory and message queue length over time making it easy to identify code where time and memory is being spent.\n\nWe illustrate how we used this tool to identify both sequential and concurrency bottlenecks in our Erlang Healthcare HL7 message processing system.\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS\nProfiler\n\nHeatmaps\n\nFlamegraphs\n\nOBJECTIVES\nShow how to effectively use sub-second heatmaps and process status flamegraphs to isolate performance issues during both development and production.\nIllustrate how focusing on locating and eliminating concurrency bottlenecks tends to reap bigger rewards than optimising sequential code.\nImpart why it's critical to profile Erlang systems at different levels of load.\nTARGET AUDIENCE\nThis talk is suitable for intermediate and advanced Erlang developers who are responsible for identifying performance issues and locating their causes.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\n  LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/27159258\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw\n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOwThis video was recorded at Code BEAM V  2020 - codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/"
