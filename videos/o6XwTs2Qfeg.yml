title: 'Vytas SunSpiral: Refactoring Space Exploration with Soft Machines'
recordingDate: 1384386236
description: "Google Tech Talk\nNovember 12, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by Vytas SunSpiral, NASA Ames Research\n\nABSTRACT\nTo understand how we control motion, we need to understand the physical mechanism being moved. Emerging theories of vertebrate physiology are overturning the traditional bone-centric model of the body in favor of a \"\"tensegrity\"\" model, in which the primary load paths are in the continuous tension network of the soft tissues. In this talk, I will discuss research and development at NASA Ames into dynamic tensegrity robots and how these \"\"soft machines\"\" may be controlled through biologically inspired methods. Along the way, I will talk about how the unique properties of tensegrity robots may enable new methods of planetary landing and exploration.\n\nVytas SunSpiral is a Senior Robotics Researcher leading the Dynamic Tensegrity Robotics Lab within the Intelligent Robotics Group at NASA Ames Research Center. Vytas has been developing new robotic technologies and leading start-ups since he graduated from Stanford University in 1998. Prior to his current work at NASA Ames, Vytas was CTO of Apisphere Inc, a Berkeley based startup that built a cloud-based system for location triggered mobile services. His first start-up in 1998 was Mobot Inc., which built fully autonomous robotic tour guides for museums. In parallel with his career in robotics, Vytas has been a life-long student of human motion in many forms, including yoga, dance, martial arts, and physical therapy.\""
