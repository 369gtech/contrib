Now, you can tag/annotate your data factory pipelines to monitor all the pipeline executions with that particular tag. In addition, Data Factory visual tools provide dashboards to monitor your pipelines and an ability to monitor your pipeline execution by the Integration Runtime (IR) upon which the activities execute.\n\nAlert and Monitor data factories using Azure Monitor\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/518/01\n\nAzure Data Factory overview\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/518/02\n\nAzure Data Factory documentation\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/518/03\n\nAzure Data Factory pricing\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/518/04\n\nCreate a free account (Azure)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/518/free"
