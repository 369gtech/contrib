description: "Use Case: RFID-based Baggage Tracking with Cloud Foundry - Elena Travkina, Altoros & Shyam Varan Nath, GE Digital\n\n25 million checked bags get delayed, damaged, or lost every year. Altoros has implemented an end-to-end solution, an RFID sensor-based baggage tracking system for airlines that minimizes the chance of baggage being mishandled. Powered by GE Predix and built in collaboration with mentors from General Electric, the application tracks the flow of bags inside and between airports. Passengers can see the location and status of their bags at every moment of their jorney. Benefits of the solution include:\n\n- reduced costs \n- improved customer experience \n- descreased departure delays\n\nThe presentation includes: a live demo (end-to-end, from a baggage drop point to a baggage claim point) and an overview of architecture, business model, and pricing.\n\n\nAbout Elena Travkina\nElena Travkina is IoT Practice Lead at Altoros. She has over 11 years of experience in delivery and support of business-critical software applications, working closely with business owners and providing strategic and organizational leadership for software development.
