description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nERLANG LOGGING FOR THE 21ST OTP\nby Andrew Thompson\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nModern\nErlang\nLogging\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nIn 2011, Andrew released lager and in 2012 he gave a talk at Erlang Factory SF explaining why he wrote it and comparing it to all the alternatives available at the time. A lot has changed since; most of the old competitors to lager have fallen out of usage, Elixir now exists and has its own logger and now, with OTP 21, Erlang finally has a new logger in the standard library. This talk will revisit the Erlang logging scene and compare all the modern alternatives.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/andrew-thompson54/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ANDREW THOMPSON\nSee other application\n\nAndrew's been writing Erlang for 10 years and is the author of gen_smtp and lager.
