description: "Code is Here: http://goo.gl/Ic9sk\n\nHow to Install Java Libraries: http://goo.gl/Dqco3\n\nBest Java Book : http://goo.gl/FtKp0m\n\nI thought it would be fun to teach Java while I make a video game. This is a simple game, but it will teach a lot of the logic needed to make your own game.\n\nThis tutorial will teach you about arrays, class fields, class methods, how to set a default value for an array, and a ton of logic."
