title: 'Enhanced Metadata in Java SE 8'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784727
description: "Java SE 8 brings a variety of improvements to the  metadata  features of the Java language and libraries. Many of the restrictions on annotations have been lifted, and the ability to obtain parameter names by reflection has been added. This session describes these features and discusses some factors that influenced their design. It also explains how custom type checkers can use annotations to improve code quality and demonstrates checkers for dimensioned units and implicit enum types.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAlexander Buckley\nAlex Buckley is the Specification Lead for the Java Language and the Java Virtual Machine at Oracle. He works on a variety of projects to increase the modularity and productivity of the Java SE platform, and collaborates widely with experts in academia, industry, and standards bodies. He holds a Ph.D. in Computing from Imperial College London.\nView more trainings by Alexander Buckley at https://www.parleys.com/author/alexander-buckley-1\n\nMichael Ernst\nMichael D. Ernst is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of Washington. Ernst's research aims to make software more reliable, more secure, and easier (and more fun!) to produce. His primary technical interests are in software engineering and related areas, including programming languages, type theory, security, program analysis, bug prediction, testing, and verification. Ernst's research combines strong theoretical foundations with realistic experimentation, with an eye to changing the way that software developers work. Dr. Ernst was previously a tenured professor at MIT, and before that a researcher at Microsoft Research.\nView more trainings by Michael Ernst at https://www.parleys.com/author/michael-ernst\n\nJoseph Darcy\nJoe is currently the lead engineer of Project Coin, the effort to select and implement a set of small Java language changes for JDK 7. He also serves as a member of the JDK 7 release team. Concurrently, Joe continues to be the release manager, lead engineer, and quality lead for OpenJDK 6, an open source implementation of the Java SE 6 platform.A longtime member of the JDK engineering group, Joe was previously specification lead for JSR 269, the Pluggable Annotation Processing API, which delivered a standardized annotation processing API and mirror-based language model into JDK 6 to supersede the earlier apt tool from JDK 5. Joe assisted in implementing the JDK 5 language changes with work spanning core reflection, javac hacking, and general library support.\n\nJoe holds a master's degree in computer science from UC Berkeley and a master's degree in applied math from Stanford University.\nView more trainings by Joseph Darcy at https://www.parleys.com/author/joseph-darcy\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
