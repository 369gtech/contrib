The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nComprehensive Performance Benchmark on Various Well-Known CNI Plugins - Giri Kuncoro & Vijay Dhama, GO-JEK\n\nThis session provides comprehensive performance benchmark on various well-known Container Network Interface (CNI) Plugins. Over the past years, there have been plenty of CNI Plugins implemented within the community which comply with CNI specification, enabling standard communication between container runtimes and network resources. However, there appears to be lack of initiative to thoroughly comparing and understanding the performance of each CNI plugin, particularly in a container orchestration system. This research is motivated by a need to identify characteristics of a CNI plugin that might impact container network performance. The studies could inspire further improvement of a particular CNI plugin, and provide insights into it being more accurately selected that adhere with particular system.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKF"
