description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nCRI-O: Under the Hood - Mrunal Patel, Red Hat, Inc. & Sascha Grunert, SUSE \n\nCRI-O is an open-source container runtime created for Kubernetes. The project was recently added to the CNCF incubator and has a very active user and contributor community established around it. In this session, Mrunal Patel and Sascha Grunert will show how CRI-O works under the hood. The talk will cover in-depth how the life cycle of Kubernetes workloads is managed by CRI-O in conjunction with the kubelet. They will demonstrate how CRI-O utilizes lower level runtimes like runc to manage the lifecycle of containers, how networking is setup for pods and how system utilities can be used to get a system view of a node using CRI-O. The talk will also cover recent features added to CRI-O for production use cases such as dual-stack IPv6 support and repository mirroring to be able to run kubernetes clusters in a disconnected environment. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of CRI-O and how to use it for advanced use cases. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uag0"
