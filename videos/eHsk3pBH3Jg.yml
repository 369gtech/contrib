description: "Google Tech Talks\nDecember 13, 2006\n\nABSTRACT\n\nFor 3D global visualization systems, it is important to be able to render city-sized collections of relatively simple building models at fast speeds without losing spatial coherence. Since traditional mesh simplification algorithms are not designed for collections of simple models, we introduce a method of simplification through merging of similar objects. We incorporate the concept of \"urban legibility\" from architecture and city-planning as a guideline for simplifying city models. Our algorithm can be broken down into five steps. Hierarchical clustering, cluster merging, polyline simplification, and hierarchical texturing are performed during..."
