recordingDate: 1506436553
description: "When talking about performance of Drupal,\_personalization and the\_traditional page serving model\_gives a setback to Drupal 7.Even a\_small personalization breaks the cacheability of the entire page.Aditionally it follows the\_the traditional model\_wherein the\_entire page is generated before it is sent to the browser,keeping the browser idle for the given time.\n\nDrupal 8 has solved a lot of its speed issues from previous versions with powerful cache system and\_incredible anonoymous user caching out of the box.But is caching sufficiently working towards making your site fast ? Does your web page loads on one go ? The answer is No.\n\nHere it is where Bigpipe comes into action.Bigpipe is a browser rendering system coined by facebook.The complete feature is called \_BigPipe as it breaks the web pages into logical section of content, called Pagelets, and pipeline the generation and render of these Pagelets. BigPipe not only reduces the load time of pages but also makes them seem even faster to users since seeing partial content earlier feels faster than seeing complete content a little bit later.\n\nIn this session, we will cover:\n\nWhat is BigPipe.\nHow does Bigpipe actually works.\nHow to use BigPipe.\nImplementation of BigPipe module in drupal 8.\nDemo of Bigpipe along with illustration of useful cases where Bigpipe can be used.\nThe session will include demos and\_examples and usability of\_Bigpipes.\n\nWhat level of knowledge should attendees have before walking into your session:\n\nThis session will be easy to understand for people with Beginners level knowledge of Drupal."
