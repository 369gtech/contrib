title: 'JavaScriptSphere: Understanding Types through TypeScript by Artur Skowroński'
recordingDate: 1571743711
description: "Type systems (for most programmers) are associated with something really hard, strongly academic, difficult to understand – not useful in the daily life. I will try to change that a bit, dispelling the myth that it is something difficult and incomprehensible.\n\nIn an accessible and interactive way, I will introduce a little “Computer Science” to explain  why particular programming languages we use are designed so differently and answer the question – how much “Typed” TypeScript really is?"
