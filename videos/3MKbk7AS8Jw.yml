Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLarge-Scale Practice of Persistent Memory in Alibaba Cloud - Junbao Kan & Qingcan Wang, Alibaba\n\nPersistent memory allows programs to access data as memory, directly byte-addressable, while the contents are non-volatile, preserved across power cycles. Alibaba have millions of databases and memory prefered applications which need massive of memory resource and make a huge cost every year. PMEM device provides the high performance and lower price which have been widely used in Alibaba Cloud. We have developed a combined system focus on PMEM resource optimization and capacity scheduler, which is widely used in our Kubernetes platforms. With the system, PMEM device is used as kuberentes volume object, and can be configed in different types: kmem, quotapath, lvm, direct. Also we optimize the scheduler to implement that PMEM device has best match with numa node."
