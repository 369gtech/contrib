description: "How Google Impacts Global Education: Introducing the Google API usages within the computer adaptive formative assessment\n(more info below)\n\nGoogle Tech Talk\nApril 30, 2013\nPresented by Jaehwa Choi\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe purpose of this presentation is introducing the Google APIs applications within the Computer Adaptive Formative AssessmentTM (CAFATM; Choi, Kim, & Yoon, 2012). CAFATM is a technology-based educational assessment and learning system focused on a formative assessment process. This system provides individually tailored diagnostics, feedback, and learning progress information to students, educators, parents, policy makers, and members of the community. This web-based formative assessment system integrates 1) various educational practices (e.g., standards-based curriculum, classroom instruction, and accountability system), 2) learning and cognitive theoretical frameworks (e.g., Cognitive Knowledge Maps), and 3) advanced psychometric models (e.g., Item Response Theory Models, Computer Adaptive Assessments, Diagnostic Assessment Models, Formative Assessment Models, Auto Item Generation Modules, and Multi-level Longitudinal Assessment Models). This presentation illustrates how the Google APIs (e.g., Android, Google Translation, Google Search, YouTube, Google Chart, and Google Image, etc.) have been utilized for various components inside of the CAFA TM system. A math learning application of the CAFA TM system, http://eMathTest.com which provides free computer adaptive math worksheets to K-12 students, will also be introduced to demonstrate the broad and practical impacts of the Google APIs to the global math education.\n\nSpeaker Info:\n\nJaehwa Choi is Associate Professor of educational research methods in the Department of Educational Leadership at The George Washington University. His research interests include structural equation modeling, latent growth models, Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation methods for latent variable models, and formative assessment system applications. He is the chief inventor of Computer Adaptive Formative AssessmentTM (CAFATM; www.eMathTest.com/CAFA) that is the core engine of a web based mathematics learning system, www.eMathTest.com."
