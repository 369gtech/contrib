title: 'Using open source communities to provide uni students an insight into the IT industry.'
recordingDate: 1548372407
description: "Peter Serwylo\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/254/\n\nWhen preparing students for work, it is important that they are able to see how real teams of people interact in order to learn what a real IT project looks like. This is something that can only happen due to the openness that is inherent in our community. At Monash University, final year undergraduate and masters students are frequently directed to various open source communities to explain high quality examples of both technical and non technical skills. The list is never ending, and includes communicating clearly, documenting requirements, peer reviews, user tests, unit tests, CI/CD, infrastructure management, and many more\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we'll walk through some important skills that may not fit easily into a typical university curriculum, but for which many well run open source communities excel at. We will highlight some key insights that students are able to gleam from open source projects that they would be unable to otherwise achieve.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
