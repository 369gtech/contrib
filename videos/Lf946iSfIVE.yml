description: "This hands-on, live-coding session will show you how to use Spring-specific tooling in your favorite IDE to be super productive when working on Spring Boot applications. We’ll demonstrate all the additional help to create, understand, and navigate your Spring code, including super-fast navigation across Spring definitions, deep understanding of your Spring code, and more. We’ll dive into the details of how information from live running Spring Boot apps will appear in your IDE and cover working with Docker and the container image support from Spring Boot for a unique and seamless experience in your day-to-day coding work. The live coding will feature Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio Code—including the most sophisticated Spring tooling available for those IDEs—to make every attendee more productive implementing applications on top of Spring Boot.\n\n Hadi Hariri, Developer Advocacy at JetBrains\n Martin Lippert, Spring Tools Lead at VMware\n Sandra Ahlgrimm, Cloud Advocate at Microsoft\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/bootiful-spring-tooling-for-the-masses"
