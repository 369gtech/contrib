language: English
recordingDate: 1632999622
description: "It's official: As of Angular 15, development of Protractor will end. What does this mean? And what should you do about it?\n\nIn this webinar, we look at the past, present and future of Protractor and end-to-end test automation for Angular projects. In the past, Protractor wasn't just a good tool for test automation of Angular apps, but one of the best tools in JavaScript for browser automation overall. At present, the world of Angular has changed and so has tool choice. Protractor hasn't kept up with the changing world and so has some deficiencies that make it less than ideal to use. In the future, Protractor will be end-of-lifed, but there are ways to transition your tests to a modern tool like Webdriver.io. \n\nJosh Grant, Solutions Architect at Sauce Labs, will discuss the evolution of Protractor and how to transition your tests to prepare for Angular 15.\n\nhttps://saucelabs.com/\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
