And when do you decide to use CSS variables? How do you balance this in relation to scalability and maintainability??\n\nThis is a discussion from the CSS Grid episode with Adam Argyle. Watch the full video!\n\n🎥 Full Video: Trying CSS Grid for the First Time\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ne9-9n5Oq0\n\n🐦 Follow Adam Argyle\nhttps://twitter.com/argyleink\n\n💛 Follow on Twitch and support by becoming a Subscriber\nWe record the show live Mondays 7 AM PT\nhttps://twitch.tv/funfunfunction\n\n💛 Fun Fun Forum\nPrivate discussion forum with other viewers in between shows. https://www.funfunforum.com.

I used CircleCI prior to them becoming a sponsor and I love that their free tier is powerful enough for small personal projects, even if they are private.

Quokka is the answer - use this link when you buy to let them know you came from here:\nhttp://quokka.funfunfunction.com\n\n💛 Wallaby (Show sponsor)\nWallaby.js runs your JavaScript tests immediately as you type and displays execution results in your code editor. It is insanely fast, because it only executes tests affected by your code changes and runs tests in parallel.

Most coding content out there focus on step-by-step tutorials. We think tutorials are too far removed from what everyday development is like. Instead, FFF has created a completely new learning environment where we grow from failure, by solving problems while intensively interacting with a live audience. \n\nTutorials try to solve a problem. Failing Together makes you grow as a developer and coworker.\n\n📹 Each show is recorded live on Twitch in a 2-hour livestream on Mondays. The host, assisted by the audience, is tasked to complete a programming challenge by an expert guest. Like in the real world, we often fail, and learn from it. This, of course, reflects what the audience identifies with, and is one of the most praised aspects of the show. \n\n⏯ On Fridays, an edited version of the show is adapted for and published on YouTube. \n\nContent Topics revolve around: JavaScript, Functional Programming, Software Architecture, Quality Processes, Developer Career and Health, Team Collaboration, Software Development, Project Management"
