description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/JFfh7\n\nIn this part of the Java Video Tutorial, I cover the JEditorPane Swing component. It allows you to both display rich text and HTML documents.\n\nI also cover how to listen for events in JEditorPane, when users click on links for example. These events are handled by HyperlinkEvent and HyperlinkListener.\n\nBecause some people are having trouble with Eclipse, I also show how you can get Eclipse to do some coding for you."
