description: "Growth and learning are the key elements for continuous improvement. By dedicating time and effort for our growth we can increase the value we create in our teams and organizations. I’ll share a personal growth framework created @Typeform that can guide any Agile Coach/Scrum Master or team leader towards finding a path and direction for growth.\n\nAbout the speaker: \nAfter testing the water as a Product Owner in Lithuania I started my journey as an Agile Coach in Barcelona. In the last two years I’ve been helping various teams to find most suitable ways of working by creating an environment of experimentation and growth to deliver value. I’m also interested in habit formation and self-development.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@paulius.tuz"
