recordingDate: 1499244242
description: "The Go programming language from Google has gained a lot of popularity, not at least due to its excellent concurrency facilities.\n\nThis talk however will focus on aspects of Go less talked about such as the benefits of its focus on simplicity and giving developers more control over memory layout, and how that allows developers to optimize CPU cache usage and thus performance.This is an introduction to Go, but wont teach you the language, but rather give you an idea of the features and design choices in Go, which makes it worth checking out."
