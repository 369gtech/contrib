title: 'Oleh Dokuka - The State of Reactive Streams'
recordingDate: 1576710759
description: "The Reactive Streams specification is state of the art for asynchronous, non-blocking data streams with the fine-grained flow control. It brought a breath of fresh air to reactive programming in the Java ecosystem. As a result, we saw the gathering of many reactive libraries and APIs by one specification.\n\nClearly, that was done for a good futureâ€¦ but, does it have any future nowadays? How other programming ecosystems reacted to the appearance of the reactive-streams standard and did they adopted that standard or not? Moreover, will it survive after the introduction of fibers in JVM?"
