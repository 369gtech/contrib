description: "Crafty Requests: Deep Dive Into Kubernetes CVE-2018-1002105 - Ian Coldwater, Heroku \n\nYou may have heard about CVE-2018-1002105, one of the most severe Kubernetes security vulnerabilities of all time. But how does this flaw work? How can it be exploited, and what does it all mean?    This deep dive will walk the audience through the Kubernetes back end, going over relevant concepts like aggregated API servers, the kubelet API, and permissions for namespace-constrained users. We will explain the details of how this flaw works, how a clusterâ€™s moving parts can fit together to create a vulnerable context, and the risks involved in leaving this CVE unpatched in the wild.    A live demonstration will show the audience exactly how easy it is to exploit this vulnerability. After explaining the attack pathways, the audience will leave with practical advice about mitigation and how to protect their clusters. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPdc"
