description: "Pragmatic Java EE 7 applications are lean and fast and come with short turnaround cycles. Java EE 7 on Java 8 becomes the natural choice for microservice architectures, not only in the enterprise but also increasingly for startups. In this session, the presenter builds, discusses, and deploys (on Docker, of course) a microservice application and discusses challenges, communication styles, and best practices. The session might end with a macroservice architecture—and therefore the next hype. Questions are highly appreciated and are going to be immediately answered.\n\nSpeaker:\nAdam Bien, Java Enthusiast, Adam Bien\nConsultant and author Adam Bien is an Expert Group member for the Java EE 6 and 7, EJB 3.X, JAX-RS, and JPA 2.X JSRs. He has worked with Java technology since JDK 1.0 and with Servlets/EJB 1.0 and is now an architect and developer for Java SE and Java EE projects. He has edited several books about JavaFX, J2EE, and Java EE, and he is the author of Real World Java EE Patterns—Rethinking Best Practices and Real World Java EE Night Hacks—Dissecting the Business Tier. Adam is also a Java Champion, Top Java Ambassador 2012, and JavaOne 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 Rock Star.
