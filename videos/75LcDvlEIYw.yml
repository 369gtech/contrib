description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nIn this talk we will share the joy of seeing ordinary C++ concurrent code, doing ordinary concurrent things in 100000 concurrent threads. I’ll analyze how the code is behaving and point out what is similar and different about the execution of that code at this scale. This talk is the code-heavy continuation of last year’s English-heavy “Designing C++ Hardware” about the Volta architecture.\n\nFeaturing:\n\nMultiple compilers.\nGodbolting.\nC++20 concurrency predictions.\nLive demo (attempt).\n— \nOlivier Giroux, NVIDIA\nDistinguished Architect\n\nOlivier Giroux has worked on nine GPU and five SM architecture generations released by NVIDIA. Lately, he works to clarify the forms and semantics of valid GPU programs, present and future. He was the programming model lead for the NVIDIA Volta architecture. He is the chair of SG1, the Concurrency study group of the ISO C++ committee, and is a passionate contributor to C++'s forward progress guarantees and memory model.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
