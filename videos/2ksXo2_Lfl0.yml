description: "From Fluent 2015. \"In 1993, Jakob Nielsen publishes three time thresholds for user experience. 20 years later, these numbers are just as relevant and become very interesting when we apply them to the experience of interacting with the web.\n\nIn this presentation, Paul will show how the Chrome team has repositioned their performance goals in terms of what’s most important to the end-user and how you can do the same.\n\nAbout Paul Irish (Google):\nPaul Irish is a front-end developer who loves the web. Works at Google on Chrome and it’s tools.\""
