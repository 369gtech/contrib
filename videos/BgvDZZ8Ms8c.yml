recordingDate: 1404395475
description: "We've been talking a lot about Web Components as a community. Encapsulation, templating, custom elements, polyfills: it's an exciting time to be a developer! (taco-button, anyone?) Before we create the next generation of soulless div tags, we should consider the role of semantics in shiny, new technologies. In this talk, we'll discuss web accessibility in a bleeding-edge way to illustrate that accessibility conversations don't have to be boring or old-school.\n\nSlides: http://marcysutton.github.io/accessibility-of-web-components/slides.html#/slide1\nhttp://2014.jsconf.us/"
