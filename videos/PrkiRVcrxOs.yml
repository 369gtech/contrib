description: "We'll build a Spam Detector using a machine learning model called a Naive Bayes Classifier! This is our first real dip into probability theory in the series; I'll talk about the types of probability, then we'll use Bayes Theorem to help us build our classifier.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/naive_bayes_classifier/\n\nHammad's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/hammadshaikhha/Math-of-Machine-Learning-Course-by-Siraj/tree/master/Principal%20Component%20Analysis\n\nKristian's Runner up Code:\nhttps://github.com/kwichmann/PCA_and_autoencoders\n\nPlease Subscribe!
