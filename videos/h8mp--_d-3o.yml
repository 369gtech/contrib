title: 'Building an Enterprise-less online bank (Anton Keks, Estonia)'

description: "I am pleased to tell you about the architecture of an online banking platform based on Play Framework and PSJ – Plain Simple Java. I will show why it’s better, faster and cheaper than building on the overused Java Enterprise stack. Online banking solutions on this platform now serve Bank Saint Petersburg and UBRD in Yekaterinburg, both of which have won many awards right after launch.\n\nPlay Framework greatly helped to give a quick start and put architecture on the right track, but of course the real life has made some corrections, especially related to integration with backend systems: online bank is responsible for the overall user experience, so it must work around any flaws of IT systems in the bank and outdated legal requirements. I will talk about what is particularly good about Play Framework and what we had to do differently, as well as how Agile practices help us to fight poorly designed backend-systems."
