title: 'Gophercon 2020: Daisuke Kashiwagi - How to Write a Self-Hosted Go Compiler from Scratch'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608668532
description: 'Daisuke wrote two Go compilers from scratch and achieved self-hosting (Technically, compilers of a subset of the Go language). Everything was handwritten except for the assembler and linker, and he did it without examining the original Go compiler. Daisuke was not an expert in Go or knew anything about compilers in the beginning of this project. The goal of this talk is to show you that writing your own Go compiler can be really fun and easier than you might think!'
