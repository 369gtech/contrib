title: 'Optimizing numerical calculations in Python - Jakub Urban - PyData Prague, January 2019'
language: English
recordingDate: 1551777476
description: "Jakub Urban, a senior Pythonista from Quantlane with rich experience in scientific computing and modelling, will show various possibilities for making your (mostly) numerical calculations in Python fast. He will cover optimization and parallelization using Numpy, Numba, Cython or Dask. You will learn that Python can be as fast as Fortran with a very little effort. In case it cannot, you will see how to seamlessly turn Fortran/C/C++ into a Python module.\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Prague\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
