AWS Lambda's billing model is based on how much memory your code consumes and how fast it completes. That makes C++ an ideal candidate for AWS Lambda.\n\nHowever, C++ programs are compiled with many different compilers and linked against different versions the standard library. This poses a challenge for deployment when the target environment is not something under your control. It can also be too restrictive to require users to build their programs from scratch in that environment and that environment only.\n\nIn this talk, I will walk you through the problems we faced and the techniques we used to solve them in order to make running C++ on AWS Lambda a reality.\n— \nMarco Magdy\nSenior Software Engineer, Amazon\nMarco is a senior software engineer at AWS who works full time on developing & maintaining the C++ SDK for AWS. He is also the author of the C++ runtime for AWS Lambda.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
