description: "Taming the Chaos: Beyond the Quick Wins\n\nJulia Wester, Manager, Customer Education, LeanKit \n\nSo, your team uses visual boards and everyone loves the quick wins gained through increased visibility. But, you’re nowhere near the utopia you read about in the books or hear about at conferences. Even worse, you don’t know why or how to get there!\n\nMany teams hit this same plateau and become stagnant, falling tragically short of the value that can be achieved with a system focused on flow. Come learn tangible steps to transform shallow visual systems into systems focused on getting results through flow and continuous improvement.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
