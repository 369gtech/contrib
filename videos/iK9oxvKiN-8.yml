title: 'Michal Muskala - Optimising for the BEAM - Code Beam STO'
language: English
recordingDate: 1530263885
description: "he BEAM is a wonderful piece of technology that we all love and use daily when writing our programs - no matter the language!\n\nFor the past year, Mikhal has worked on optimising a couple of open source libraries, building performance-focused applications and contributing several optimisations to the Erlang compiler and the BEAM runtime. During this presentation, he'll share his discoveries and what he has learned.\n\nHe'll explore some common techniques for optimising programs running on the BEAM, applicable to Erlang, Elixir and LFE. He'll show us what tools can be used to evaluate performance and discover bottlenecks. He'll then talk both about how these problems can be solved - both by optimising the pure functional parts, leveraging the knowledge of BEAM innards, and by optimising concurrent programs around processes.\n\nMore details: https://codesync.global/speaker/michal-muskala52/"
