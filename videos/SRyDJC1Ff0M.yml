recordingDate: 1524821004
description: "The soon-to-be-released-brand-new Voxxed and VoxxedDays websites are data driven by the existing Devoxx and Voxxed Days CFP websites. During this talk, he will demo and explain how the new websites were designed & developed using technologies like JHipster, Angular 5, PrimeNG and CI/CD using GitLab.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect, the CFP admin orchestration web app has been created which allows event organizers to configure and start a CFP instance on the fly using Docker."
