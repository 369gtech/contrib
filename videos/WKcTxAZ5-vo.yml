description: "\"The best sorting algorithm is quick sort.\" \"Indexes make DB faster.\" \"Data should be sorted using ORDER BY.\" \"Composition - good; inheritance - not good.\" \"Windows is an operating system.\" \"You must have transactions in your DB.\" \"Java is slow.\" \"Don't eat yellow snow.\" \"You shall not self-sign your certificates.\" \"Interrupt in Java is broken.\"\n\nThe IT world is full of mantras/revealed truth, passed (often in oral tradition) among developer tribes. Mindlessly repeated from generation to generation, they cause a reckless usage. At best this results in more harm than good, in the worst case: a total disaster worth whole train of money. The context is indispensable part of each mantra. Right context can help to distinguish proper usage from incoming disaster.\n\nDo you believe in a mantra by any chance? How to find out the context? Can one eat a yellow snow? Come and see."
