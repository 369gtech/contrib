description: "Spring Framework 5.0 provides a choice of two web stack. One is the existing Servlet based Spring MVC and the other is the Reactive Streams (and Reactor) based Spring WebFlux that also supports non-Servlet containers such as Netty and Undertow. To make the choice even more interesting in 5.0 Spring MVC also supports the use of reactive libraries for orchestrating remote HTTP service calls, using reactive data repositories, and so on.\n\nIn this session we'll try and make sense of these options by comparing the execution models of each stack in the context of several common web application scenarios as well as some additional scenarios that have been harder to do on a traditional Servlet stack.\n\nThe session will you help you to understand just how much reactive mileage you can get out of your Servlet stack and what more you can do with a reactive stack. We'll use sample code to demonstrate reactive features and behavior (e.g. back pressure) on each stack.\n\nKnowledge of using reactive libraries such as Reactor or RxJava is very helpful but not required for this session.\n\nRossen Stoyanchev, Spring Framework Developer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
