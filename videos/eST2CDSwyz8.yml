description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2012\n\nerlang-solutions.com\nerlang-factory.com\n\n\"e2 is a light weight library that simplifies development of correct OTP applications. It improves developer productivity by eliminating boilerplate code and clarifying important concepts that are often lost in OTP's complexity.\nMany view OTP as an advanced topic, to be used only after a developer has mastered lower level Erlang concepts. e2 simplifies the use of OTP to the point where it's no longer \"advanced\" or complex.\n\nSome have called e2 \"OTP on rails\".\ne2 was born from the speaker's experience teaching OTP fundamentals at ErlangCamp and his work with new Erlang developers at CloudBees. e2 is running in production in a variety of organizations and is a proven accelerator for learning Erlang and building correct applications.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory ;\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
