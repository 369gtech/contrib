description: "After 20 years of popularity, Perl has established a reputation for reliability and backward compatibility, but it's also still a changing, evolving language. This year's release of Perl 5.20.0 brings some significant and exciting new features, as well as a number of little improvements to keep making easy things easier and harder things possibler.\n\nIn this session, the Perl 5 project lead will walk through these new features, as well as features currently being developed for the next release."
