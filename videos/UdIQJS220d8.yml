description: 'I studied Business Economics and started at Macaw 19 years ago as Manager Finance & Facilities and got thrown in the deep on Human Resources and Recruitment topics. Now, as the CFO of Macaw, I''m responsible for everything that has to do with finance, facilities, HR and recruitment. Most proud of Macaw being the Best Employer in The Netherlands for four years, recently realizing the Most Vital Workplace and being nominated for Vitality Manager of the Year. I''m passionate about the vitality of myself and my colleagues, playing golf & drinking a good glass of good wine. My ambition is to create a workplace where employees leave the office with more energy than they came in with.'
