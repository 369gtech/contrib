description: "GovCloud Foundry - Rowan Jacobs, Pivotal & Bret Mogilefsky, 18F\n\nThis talk will cover government-approved IAAS regions, like AWS GovCloud and Azure Government, and how they're currently being used in the public sector for both classified and unclassified workloads. We'll also show how BOSH and cf-deployment are used on AWS GovCloud, and what special constraints separate government clouds from IAAS regions used by the private sector. Finally, we'll talk about how organizations like 18F (cloud.gov), the Government Digital Service (cloud.service.gov.uk), and the Digital Transformation Agency provide CF foundations to transform the public sector worldwide. \n\nAbout Rowan Jacobs\nCF infrastructure developer at Pivotal, working on IAAS paving tools for open source Cloud Foundry and PCF. | Previously at the Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded R&D company, where his work included building prototypes for government customers using k8s and AWS GovCloud.\n\nAbout Bret Mogilefsky\nBret Mogilefsky is an Innovation Specialist at 18F, the agile design and development consultancy inside government, for government.
