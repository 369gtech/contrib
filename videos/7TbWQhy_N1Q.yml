description: "Stop me if this sounds familiar: clients sign off on designs created in Photoshop. You build a website for them based on these designs. It looks quite like the designs, but not exactly like this. It's not your fault. It's not the client's fault. But wouldn't it be nice if you could build exactly what the client signed off?\n\nIn this session I'll look at lambasting my most hated design tool - Photoshop. In short:\n\n- it's for editing photographs, not designing websites\n- it builds up expectations for clients\n- itâ€™s a static representation of a dynamic object at one specific breakpoint\n- Total crap in an era of responsive design\n\nWhat it does have going for it, though, is that is sucks just slightly less than InVision.\n\nI'll then talk a little about something more modern - SketchApp - built especially for designing user interfaces, but still falls waaaay short when you want to give your clients designs that they can touch and feel and smell and see exactly what they are going to get. I do happen to really like SketchApp, but only for ... (come and hear why!)\n\nFollowing, I'll talk about \"Design for the Browser\" and/or \"Design in the Browser\". Basically, using modern tools such as PatternLab and Component-based design principles to give your clients an interactive prototype of exactly what their final product will look like. Not an approximation of it, the thing itself - so the product they get is the product they sign off on. Or failing PatternLab, why not use the simplest tool - a code editor - to create your designs. Write HTML, CSS, JS - send your client a URL and then, BOOM! - give them what they want. Clients can test this design on phones, tablets, watches - heck, even computers! - and make sure it works before they get you to implement it.\n\nNo compromises. No surprises. We're going back to the future!"
