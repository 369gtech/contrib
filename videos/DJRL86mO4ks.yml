description: 'At SparkMeter we deal with remote IoT devices that may be offline for hours or days. None of the existing messaging protocols met our requirements for low data consumption and visibility into the message queue so we did what any engineers would do and built our own. This talk explores the challenges we had with existing solutions, how our solution addressed our needs, and how the approach has worked so far.'
