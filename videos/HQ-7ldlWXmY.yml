title: 'JavaScriptSphere: How to model your crazy data in TypeScript by Michał Michalczuk'
recordingDate: 1571746724
description: 'Our data models can be crazy. Sometimes you take a quick look and you already see that `if-else` to handle it properly.

I will show you how I’m dealing with strange types cases, how to avoid type-mess in your app, properly use algebraic types and how to benefit from the ​structural type system.'
