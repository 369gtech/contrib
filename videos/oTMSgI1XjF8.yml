description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nEfficient C++ has always been about minimizing copies. This practically-focused\ntalk is about how to do that when working with move semantics, perfect\nforwarding and STL containers, or non-STL containers that present similar\ninterfaces.\n\nIn-place construction is an easily stated goal, but can be really fiddly to get\nright, especially given the foibles of various container interfaces. We'll talk\nabout copy elision; when to use emplace, insert, or other methods; vectors,\nmaps, optionals, variants; and how things change from C++11 through C++20.\nAttendees will learn why in-place construction is beneficial and exactly how to\nachieve optimal efficiency with the various standard container types.\n— \nBen Deane\nBen was a game programmer for over 20 years, working in C++ since the late 90s for companies like EA and Blizzard. In 2018 he left the games industry to join Quantlab, an automated trading firm, where he writes modern, well-performing C++. He likes to play with algorithms, and to make the type system work for him, and he’s always looking for useful new techniques. Ben is the presenter of several previous C++Now and CppCon talks.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
