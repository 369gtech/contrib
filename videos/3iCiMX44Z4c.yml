description: "SREcon16 Europe - Challenges of Machine Learning at Scale\n\nGraham Poulter, Google\n\nMotivated by the problem of predicting whether any given ad would be clicked in response to a query, in this introductory talk we outline the requirements and large-system design challenges that arise when designing a machine learning system that makes millions of predictions per second with low latency, learns quickly from the responses to those predictions, and maintains a consistent level of model quality over time. We present alternatives for meeting those challenges using diagrams of machine learning pipelines.\n\nConcepts used in this talk: machine learning (classification), software pipelines, sharding and replication, map-reduce\n\nGraham is an SRE at Google working on machine learning pipelines for ad click prediction.  \n\nView the full SREcon16 Europe Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program"
