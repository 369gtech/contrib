description: "The prominent trends in software a distributed programs powered by cooperating microservices, each operating independently. These distributed systems are asynchronous by their very nature. You will use asynchronous programming paradigms to build these systesms.\n\nIn this session, you'll see the most common mistakes developers make using async and await in C#. You'll see the practices you should use instead. This session also provides a deep dive into async streams, a new feature introduced in C# 8.\n\nYou're building asynchronous programs now. Make sure you're building them for the future.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
