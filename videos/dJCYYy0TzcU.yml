description: "National Academy of Engineering\n2011 U.S. Frontiers of Engineering Symposium\nSeptember 19-21, 2011\nGoogle, Inc.\nMountain View, California\n\nExpanding Design Spaces\nSeptember 20, 2011\nPresented by Dr. John Haymaker.\n\nABSTRACT: Google hosted 100 attendees of the 2011 Nat'l Academy of Engineering's U.S. Frontiers of Engineering symposium (FOE) at our Mountain View office and Dinah's Garden Hotel in Palo Alto. The symposium is an annual three-day meeting that brings together 100 of the nation's outstanding young engineers (ages 30-45) from industry, academia, and government to discuss pioneering technical and leading-edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors.\n\nAbout the speaker: Dr. John Haymaker is the Founder of Design Process Innovation in California. In his talk Dr. Haymaker first summarizes his evaluation of design exploration in current practice. Next he provides an overview of development and testing of a collaborative platform of tools that assist building designers to generate, evaluate, and develop consensus around far larger and better formulated design spaces than achieved in practice today. The talk concludes with a description of initial design charettes he has performed with this platform."
