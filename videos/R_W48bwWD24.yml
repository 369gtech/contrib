description: "RubyConfBY 2019 - https://rubyconference.by\n\nVideo Partner â€“ iTechArt  https://www.itechart.by \n\nAbout the talk: \nOverview of gRPC, Apache Thrift, Twirp, Finagle frameworks, their main features, and Ruby specific implementation details.\n\nLately, a lot of web developers tend to find out that REST isn't always the ultimate solution for services communication problems. Some people thrift to search for new architectural styles (e.g. GraphQL) and others give a new breath to old-fashioned RPCs. This talk is a brief overview of existing RPC frameworks (e.g. gRPC, Apache Thrift, Twirp) including Ruby specific details."
