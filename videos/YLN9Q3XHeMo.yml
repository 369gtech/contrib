description: "Multi-Architecture Container Images: Why Bother, and How To\n\nLisa Seelye, Red Hat\n\nAll of us, from the hobbyist to the enterprise solutions architects we are faced with downloading software from the Internet and making it work. The first hurdle is getting the new software to run on our computer and that's where we run into so much trouble.\n\nToo often, containers are produced with just a single CPU architecture in mind. As non-traditional architectures become more common, this \"make it work\" problem gets harder. But there's a way to continue to make it work with our beloved containers.\n\nSit in and learn more about how container registries know which container to give you, and what a container even is, how to build container images which support multiple CPU architectures, and why it all even matters.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
