description: "Afraid of concurrency bugs? Fear not, Project Coyote is here to help. \n\nProject Coyote gives the ability to write powerful, expressive tests for exercising the concurrency in your code, without worrying about flakiness. We call these concurrency unit tests. \n\nDuring testing, Project Coyote takes control of the tasks and other sources of nondeterminism in your code and intelligently explores different execution paths quickly to discover bugs. Once a bug is found, Project Coyote allows you to reproduce the same trace that led to the bug, improving the debugging experience.\n\nTo learn more about the latest Dev breakthroughs, visit the Innovation Tech Hub: https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/developer\n\nProject Coyote Research Page: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/coyote/ \n\nProject Coyote GitHub Repository: https://github.com/microsoft/coyote \n\nDiscover all the Innovation Tech Minutes for Developers: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHjNJcVCIktce-wSFZ5svwA3"
