description: "Speaker: Veronika Quek & Angelita Sasmita\r\n\r\nApplying traditional practices when it comes to design and front-end development is no longer viable in this complex world of multichannel interface experience and agile product development. Scalable systems are essential. In order to achieve this, we need to break a couple of rules and come back to others.\r\n\r\nTo begin, we will look at typography scale, components and grids. We will talk about the principles of scalability, the benefit for businesses, design as well as development and how all this translates into code.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be carried out by a developer and designer pair to show you real life examples and answer any questions you might have on our collaboration techniques.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/ThoughtWorks-Talks-Tech/events/263993994/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/qyTX/"
