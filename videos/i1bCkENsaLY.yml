description: "Gaurav Malhotra and Scott Hanselman discuss how you can now share a self-hosted Integration Runtime (IR) across multiple data factories and consolidate on a single, highly available, multi-node (up to 4 nodes) self-hosted IR infrastructure. Doing so removes the need for separate, self-hosted IRs per project/data factory making it more manageable for the IT/DevOps team.\n\nFor more information:\n\nSharing the self-hosted integration runtime with multiple data factories (docs)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/493/01\n\nSharing a self-hosted Integration Runtime infrastructure with multiple Data Factories (blog post)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/493/02\n\nAzure Data Factory overview\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/493/03\n\nAzure Data Factory pricing\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/493/04\n\nCreate a free account (Azure)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/493/free"
