description: "by Heinrich Hartmann\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB2.252A/latency_slos_done_right.webm\n\n\nLatency is a key indicator of service quality, and important to measure and track.\nHowever, measuring latency correctly is not easy.\nIn contrast to familiar metrics like CPU utilization or request counts, the \"latency\" of a service is not easily expressed in numbers.\nPercentile metrics have become a popular means to measure the request latency, but have several shortcomings, especially when it comes to aggregation.\nThe situation is particularly dire if we want to use them to specify Service Level Objectives (SLOs) that quantify the performance over a longer time horizons.\nIn the talk we will explain these pitfalls, and suggest three practical methods how to implement effective Latency SLOs. \n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 12:30:00+01"
