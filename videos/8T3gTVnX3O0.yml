description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nPreventing DMA Attacks from Thunderbolt Devices - Lu Baolu, Intel\n\nThunderbolt, shipped on MacOS and Windows platforms, allows the connection of external peripherals directly through the PCIe bus to a computer. Although silicon vendors have DMA remapping technologies to prevent DMA attacks, systems are still vulnerable to DMA attacks from malicious peripherals connected through the thunderbolt ports. This session will present the security issues we have identified with Linux, and solutions we have developed.\n\nhttps://sched.co/NruQ"
