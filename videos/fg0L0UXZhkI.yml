description: "From Velocity Amsterdam 2015: A theme at Velocity Amsterdam is how the next billion users will come from regions where 2G and 3G mobile connections dominate. It’s important to test performance for these users, but that’s been a challenge for developers in network-rich regions. Simulating those network conditions doesn’t reflect actual mobile network performance. Thanks to a collaboration between Headspin.io and WebPageTest, it’s now possible to test your website from emerging markets like India, Brazil, Indonesia and HongKong over local mobile networks.\n\nAbout Steve Souders (SpeedCurve):\nSteve Steve Souders works at SpeedCurve on the interplay between performance and design. He previously served as Google’s head performance engineer, chief performance Yahoo!, and as chief performance officer at Fastly. Steve has pioneered much of the work in the world of web performance.
