description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/jan-machacek\n\nJan will show the details of the Muvr exercise analysis project, from the code that runs on the wearables; the signal processing, sensor data fusion and classification on the mobile; the server-side code that ingests the classified data; ending up with Spark code that performs deeper analysis and learning.\n\nAlongside the code, Jan will share the data that his team has collected (under the sweat of the brow in the gym), and the insights one might make from the data. \n\nTo close, Jan will outline the experimental & research areas that the Muvr team wants to cover in the near future—for example physiotherapy, injury prevention & detection.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- To show—in code!—how to build a system that ingests streams of data from multiple devices, performing the most appropriate processing in each stage; ultimately delivering something that can improve people's well-being.\n\n- The code will use a vast array of languages and techniques (C & C++, Objective-C++, Swift, Scala, MATLAB—to name a few); the attendees do not need to be experts in any of the technologies used, they will walk away understanding the challenges of implementing similar systems.\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Anyone who wants to see all aspects of a IoT system that performs classification at the appropriate level: small device engineers, mobile developers, CQRS/ES cluster developers, data scientists; all will find something that directly relates to their field, and many other things that connect the pieces to make a complete system\n\n\nJan is a passionate technologist with hands-on experience with the practical aspects of software delivery (architecture, quality, CI, CD); the project management approaches (applying the principles of agile project management); mentoring and motivating the engineering & business teams. He shares his expertise and passion for software as the editor of the Open Source Journal, regularly contributes to open source projects and speaks at conferences in the UK and abroad. Jan is the author of many open source projects (various Typesafe Activators, Reactive Monitor, Akka Patterns, Akka Extras, Scalad, Specs2 Spring and others), books and articles."
