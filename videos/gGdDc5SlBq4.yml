language: English
recordingDate: 1416019624
description: "Ran Snir (HP) and Lior Reuven (HP)\n\nIn the past years we have seen many anomalies that have changed the way we think about the computing world. There are 3d printers that print 3d printers, robots that think by themselves and then we have catjs.\n\ncatjs is an Open Source framework that adds the ability for mobile-web apps to test themselves. Simple annotations in your HTML5 code will be translated to embedded tests scripts within the application’s lifecycle. These mobile-web tests can run on any device, operating system and browser. catjs is a quick and easy way to take care of your application’s testing flow."
