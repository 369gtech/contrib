recordingDate: 1486941492
description: "With more and more users browsing the web on mobile devices, the web community now largely understands how important it is to design and implement our sites with the assumption that it will be viewed on a small screen.\n\nResponsive web design is only one piece of the puzzle, however. A mobile device is more than just a smaller viewport. The technology available to your average mobile device varies considerably to the average desktop or laptop computer.\n\nIn this session, I will show how developers can enhance their web applications to take advantage of hardware features via device APIs, without sacrificing the overall experience for users accessing the application from non-mobile devices.\n\nJessica is a Front End Developer at Holler, where she helps create digital solutions for brands. She is passionate about pushing the mobile web by developing engaging, hardware driven experiences.\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
