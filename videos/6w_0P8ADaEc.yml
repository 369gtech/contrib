description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/achieving-megascale-business-intelligence-through-speed-of-thought-analytics-on-hadoop\n\nApache Hadoop is the most powerful and popular platform for ingesting, storing and processing enormous amounts of “big data”. However, due to its original roots as a batch processing system, doing interactive business analytics with Hadoop has historically suffered from slow response times, or forced business analysts to extract data summaries out of Hadoop into separate data marts. This talk will discuss the different options for implementing speed-of-thought business analytics and machine learning tools directly on top of Hadoop including Apache Hive on Tez, Apache Hive on LLAP, Apache HAWQ and Apache MADlib.\n\nSpeaker: Ian Fyfe, Director of Product Marketing, Hortonworks"
