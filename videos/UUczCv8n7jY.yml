title: '"Curing your event processing blues with Rx" by Donna Malayeri and Matthew Podwysocki'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614439677
description: "Modern applications are highly connected applications, often consuming several asynchronous or stream-based services. This makes users happy, but can easily lead to code that is a nightmare to develop and maintain. Enter Reactive Extensions, also known as Rx. Rx can help tame callback hell and can abstract away the notion of time, turning asynchronous requests into observable sequences. Just as we can query normal sequences such as collections, these observable sequences can be composed through either standard query operators (e.g., filter, project, aggregate) or even temporal ones (e.g., “sample a noisy event stream at 100ms intervals”).\n\nIn this talk, we’ll cover the JavaScript and .NET versions of Rx, as well as related projects, such as Rx.rb and RxCpp. Use Rx wisely, and may your web service never be crashed by the weight of its own popularity!\n\nDonna Malayeri\nMicrosoft\n@lindydonna\n\nDonna Malayeri is a developer on the Rx team at Microsoft and was previously the program manager of the F# team at Microsoft. She has also worked on the Scala team at EPFL on projects such as the Scala Eclipse plugin and scaladoc. In a past life, she lived in an ivory tower and earned a PhD in programming languages from Carnegie Mellon University. In her copious spare time, she sometimes writes provocative and controversial—yet award-winning — papers for CMU’s prestigious SIGBOVIK conference, the de-facto premiere forum for all work in its (somewhat diverse) areas of focus.\n\nMatthew Podwysocki\nMicrosoft\n@mattpodwysocki\nmattpodwysocki\n\n\nMatthew Podwysocki is a developer at Microsoft working with such teams as the Cloud Programmability Team, with a focus on web based technologies. He works on such projects as the Reactive Extensions and is the primary author of the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript. A self-avowed language geek he spends time toiling with Haskell, F#, JavaScript and other languages and ways for democratizing data access.\n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop conference (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Oct 2013."
