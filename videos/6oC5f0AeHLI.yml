title: 'Fireside Chat #3: Delegation'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623965226
description: "In this Fireside Chat, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso and Mashooq Badar and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta talked about delegation. Why is it so difficult to delegate? What are the different types and drivers for delegation? What can we do so that other people feel more comfortable delegating things to us? Do we have the right skills? What kind of trust needs to exist so delegation can happen? Those are just a few topics covered in this episode.\n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have at Codurance outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
