description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeakers: Andy Clement, Martin Lippert\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/developer-tooling-whats-new-and-whats-next\nIn this talk we take a look at the latest changes and new features of the Spring Tool Suite, the Eclipse-based IDE that comes packed with support for Spring, Groovy, Grails, Gradle, AspectJ, and Cloud Foundry. We dive into the new ways the tooling makes it easy and convenient to develop enterprise applications that are based on Spring Boot and how the Spring Tool Suite integrates will all the different parts of Spring IO. In addition to that we will show the Java8 language tooling that comes as part of the Spring Tool Suite and demonstrate how to get the most out of Java8 in your projects. In the second part of this presentation we take a look at our vision for how we are going to move developer tooling itself into the cloud era. We provide a sneak peek under the hood of what we are working on for the next generation of developer tooling. We will demonstrate what future cloud-based developer might look like, how real Java language tooling can look and feel when running in a browser-based code editor, and show how every developer can smoothly migrate into this new world of cloud-based developer tooling. All this is based on Flux, a new project at eclipse.org, that aims at providing new and innovative ways to move towards cloud-based tooling in a smooth, seamless way."
