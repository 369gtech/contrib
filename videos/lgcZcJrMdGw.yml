Omri's team is responsible for Identity & Access, Metering, Monitoring, Management Console, Load Balancing, DNS, Database, Messaging, Application Lifecycle, Developer Experience, and User Experience, and contributes heavily into the OpenStack and Cloud Foundry open source projects.\n\nBefore joining HP, Omri served as the Senior VP of Product Development at Symform, a Seattle-based, venture-backed startup delivering a peer-to-peer cloud storage service, where he managed all aspects of engineering, product management, and operations. Before joining Symform in early 2013, Omri spent a year as the co-founder and CEO of BuiltSteady, which developed a web and mobile personal assistant product for consumers.\n\nPrior to founding BuiltSteady, Omri spent 13 years at Microsoft in roles ranging from Architect to General Manager. Omri spent most of his time at Microsoft working on developer platforms, starting with founding the ADO.NET team upon his arrival in 1998, and eventually becoming the General Manager of the teams responsible for the Application-tier and Data-tier technologies of the Microsoft Application Platform, including Web Services, XML, Communications, Workflow, Transactions, Data Access, and Modeling. Omri also contributed to the initial Azure Platform release, where his team incubated and released the first commercial versions of the Azure Service Bus and Access Control services. As his last Microsoft project, Omri helped deliver the 2011 release of Xbox and Kinect as the Director of Program Management of the Xbox Platform team, as well as driving early planning for the Xbox One.\n\nEarlier in his career, Omri spent 6 years building Enterprise Middleware products Shadow Direct and Enterprise Direct at NEON Systems, from its inception in 1992 until shortly before its IPO in 1999.\n\nOmri earned a Computer Science degree from Rice University, lives with his wife and three daughters in Redmond, WA, and loves rainy winter days in the northwest because they mean fresh powder on the weekends.\n\nFind out more about the convention: http://oscon.com\nDon't miss an upload!
