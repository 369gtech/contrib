description: "Google Tech Talks\nAugust 20, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMany problems in computer vision require the knowledge of potential point correspondences between two images. The usual approach for automatically determining correspondences begins by comparing small neighborhoods of high saliency in both images. Since speed is of the essence, most current approaches for local region matching involve the computation of a feature vector that is invariant to various geometric and photometric transformations, followed by fast distance computations using standard vector norms. These algorithms include many parameters, and choosing an algorithm and setting its parameters for a given problem is more an art than a science...."
