title: 'Distributed Deep Learning Using Java on the Client and in the Cloud'

description: "Johan Vos\nCTO\nGluon\n\nWe demonstrate an end-to-end application where Java-based deep-learning tools are used on a mobile client to analyse and train data. A domain-specific model is maintained by a server, and enhanced by updates being sent from the different clients. In many cases where machine learning can provide benefits, the input data is privacy-sensitive. While more input data will lead to a more accurate model on the backend, it is often not desirable to share the raw input data. In this case, distributed learning helps by analysing the data and retraining the model on the client, and by sending the resulting changes back to the server. We will show how this can be done using the Oracle Cloud and the SkyMind deeplearning4j and Gluon Mobile tools."
