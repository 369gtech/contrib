language: English
recordingDate: 1567588665
description: "Byte-sized talks from CERN engineers\nContinuous practices like Continuous Integration, Deployment, Testing and Delivery play a big role in modern software development life cycles that allow organizations to frequently and reliably release new services and provide updates and CERN users rely on it to a large extent. Because CERNâ€™s current CI infrastructure and design have evolved largely over the last years, this talk aims to describe its evolution and past problems and solutions. This talk reviews our current tools and features that CERN provides to facilitate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, as well as extra components that make it as accessible as possible to most of the organisation use cases, such as Jenkins, Nexus, distributed S3 caching and Docker registry."
