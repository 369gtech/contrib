description: "Machine learning technologies are turning from rocket science into daily engineering life. You no longer have to know the difference between Faster R-CNN and HMM to develop a machine vision system, and even OpenCV has bindings for JavaScript allowing to resolve quite serious tasks all the while remaining in front end. On other hand massive implementation of AI in various areas brings about problems, and security is one of the greatest concerns. In the broader context security is really all about trust.\n\nDo we trust AI? I don’t, personally.\n\nWhat is “state of the art” in AI security? Yesterday it was a PoC, not a product, today becoming a We will fix it later, tomorrow it will be a if it works, don’t touch it. And tomorrow is too late.\n\nBut what we can do for Trustworthy AI? There are just no simple answers.\n\nYou can’t install antivirus or calculate hashes to control integrity of annotated dataset. Traditional firewalls and IDS are almost useless in ML cloud internal SDN Infiniband network. Event C-level Compliance such as PCI DSS and GDPR doesn’t work for massive country-level AI deployments. What about vulnerability management for TensorFlow ML model? How it will impact ROC and AUC?..\n\nTo make it better we should rethink Cyber Resilience for AI process, systems and applications to make sure that they continuously deliver the intended outcome despite adverse cyber events. Make sure that security is genuinely integrated into innovation that AI brings into our lives. To trust AI and earn his trust, perhaps?\n\n=== \n\nSergey Gordeychik, Cybersecurity curriculum supervisor and visiting professor of Harbour Space University for Technology and Design (Barcelona, Spain). Before moving to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Sergey gained a wealth of practical experience in the Cybersecurity Industry. In particular, being Deputy CTO at Kaspersky Lab, he was responsible for establishing the vision and leading the technological development for Threat Intelligence, Cyberthreat Hunting, Pentest, Incident Response, and Vulnerability Research. As CTO at Positive Technologies, he led the development of Gartner recognized enterprise security products such as MaxPatrol, PT Application Inspector, and PT Application Firewall. Sergey used to be a director and scriptwriter of Positive Hack Days (PHDays), the largest and most influential cybersecurity event in Eastern Europe. From 2012, he led the SCADA StrangeLove industrial cybersecurity research team and SD-WAN New Hop project. Sergey has developed a number of training courses, including “Critical Information Infrastructure Cyber Resilience,” “Cybersecurity of Cloud, Big Data and AI,” published several dozens of articles on various subjects and a book called “Wireless Networks Security.” He is a popular speaker on international security conferences such as CCC, Code Blue, Black Hat, Area41, POC, ZeroNights, S4, Australian Cyber Security Centre Conference. MCSE since NT 4.0, MCT, MVP: Enterprise Security R&D, CWNA, CISSP."
