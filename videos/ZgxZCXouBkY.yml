description: "We've seen the same service oriented architecture principles track advancements in technology from the coarse grain services of SOA a decade ago, through microservices that are usually scoped to a more fine grain single area of responsibility, and now functions as a service, serverless architectures where each function is a separately deployed and invoked unit. Large teams would work for months between releases of SOA components. Small teams down to a single developer would release microservices perhaps on a daily basis. One developer may release many functions many times a day. We'll look at the challenges and opportunities that arise as the components of applications get smaller, more ephemeral, and evolve more rapidly.\n\nThe blog post mentioned at the beginning can be found at https://medium.com/@adrianco/evolution-of-business-logic-from-monoliths-through-microservices-to-functions-ff464b95a44d#.e19igf88c"
