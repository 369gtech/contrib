This talk will cover the types of challenges we face and how we address them to successfully support or mission critical e commerce app with millions of daily users.\n\nHow code that would work in smaller scale ends up with server crashes due to load failures and application issues due to Javascript errors that happen only in edge case scenarios.\n\nExamples of tough bugs we squashed –\n\nApplication does not load in IE for certain scenarios. Also it works if the debugger window is open. Making it hard to debug the issue. Our Angular app won’t load on Firefox 50 (yes we need to support it) and what angular builder package was the root cause. SSR causes CPU and memory spikes when legacy libraries are included.\n\nThe process we use to find root cause will be helpful to the audience. And the coding guidelines and architecture choices (micro frontend, feature toggles, metering new UIs, Akamai for caching and security, AEM for content management) could provide useful insights on how to build scalable applications.\nWatch all the ng-conf: Hardwired presentations/videos at https://videos.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nng-conf: Hardwired is brought to you by:\n- https://thinkster.io/ The best Angular and JavaScript tutorials on the web\n- https://herodevs.com/ Engineering and consulting by web development experts\n- https://xlts.dev/  Extended support for AngularJS\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
