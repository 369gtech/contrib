description: "Speaker: Evgeny Lazarenko, Product Manager, Tradegecko\n\nSubtitle: How to manage software development in cross-cultural teams\n\nBlurb: The world is flat, as Thomas Friedman put it. No matter how many walls we build or how hard we try to curb immigration, we are forever bound to work with people who are nothing like us culturally. Cultural homogeneity in product teams is dead, welcome cultural diversity. We are right to celebrate it, but we should also learn how to handle it well.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.productcampsg.com\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/44Yj/"
