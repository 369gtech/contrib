description: 'Go is one of the "up-and-comers" in the programming language world, and it owes its success to a variety of factors. In this presentation, we''re going to take a hard look at the language, go over what it has (and what it lacks!), what makes it interesting, and get comfortable with some of the syntax basics, as a "first steps" towards building non-trivial Go programs in the future. It''s probably not the last programming language you''ll ever learn, but it is definitely on of the few that you should learn.'
