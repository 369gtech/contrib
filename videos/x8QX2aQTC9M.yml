description: 'In an ever changing world, with the ever changing business requirements in the ever changing applications, there''s one thing constantly resisting to change: data warehouse solution, statistics storage or simply "bulk of data for later". This talk is a journey of joy through the constantly evolving business and project requirements of a service architecture, a talk about powers and drawbacks of PHP & Co., drifting through the world of improvement, problem solving and reshape of judgement. We will go from the simplest file storage of statistics data up to the distributed petabyte solutions and back, in a search of the flexible and adaptable application of data processing.'
