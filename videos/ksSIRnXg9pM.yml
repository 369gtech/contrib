description: "Big up front design is discouraged in agile development. However, we know that architecture plays a significant part in software systems. Evolving architecture during the development of an application seems to be a risky business. In this presentation we will discuss the reasons to evolve the architecture, some of the core principles that can help us develop in such a manner, and the ways to minimize the risk and succeed in creating a practical and useful architecture.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
