title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2012: Eric Evans - Castle-enhanced Cassandra'
recordingDate: 1545060607
description: "The Linux storage stack wasnâ€™t designed for large, high throughput datasets, nor is it well-suited to modern hardware: large, slow SATA disks, SSDs, or many cores. Castle is an open-source project that provides an alternative to the lower layers of the storage stack -- RAID and POSIX filesystems -- for big data workloads, and distributed data stores such as Apache Cassandra. This talk will cover Castle, why it's needed, how it works, and how it can be used with Cassandra to significantly improve performance and predictability.\n\nMore info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/castle-enhanced-cassandra\n\nDescription of Eric Evans: \nhttps://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/eric-evans"
