title: 'YOW! Singapore/Hong Kong 2017 Dave Thomas - The Best OO Language is a Functional One'
recordingDate: 1507510803
description: "Object oriented development turns 50 this year. During that time, hundreds of OO languages have come and gone. And yet, with the exception of Smalltalk and a few research languages, none of them were actually object-oriented.\n\nI think we might now be seeing a revival of the spirit of OO, but it is coming from the functional world. I want to show you how to write OO in Elixir, and how liberating this can be.\n\nDave Thomas is a programmer, and now an accidental publisher. Dave Thomas wrote The Pragmatic Programmer with Andy Hunt at the end of the '90s, and that experience opened a new world for them. They discovered a love of writing that complemented their love of learning new things.\n\nDave Thomas is one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, and probably responsible for bringing Ruby to attention of Western developers with the book Programming Ruby. He was one of the first adopters of Rails, and helped spread the word with the book Agile Web Development with Rails.\n\nDave Thomas enjoys speaking at conferences, running public and private training. But most of all, Dave Thomas loves coding.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference, visit,\nhttp://yowconference.sg"
