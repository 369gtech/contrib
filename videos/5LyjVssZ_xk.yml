description: 'In Software Development things are continuously changing. Solutions that were completely fine just a moment ago, can prove to be a source of great pain now. And one of those solutions that worked perfectly just last week, but isn''t that perfect, now is Session. We all now that HTTP is a Stateless protocol, so we (as smart as we are) figured out a way to bypass this limitation by introduction Session cookies. But from Session-related attacks on the client side, to problems with maintaining Session integrity on the server side. We found out that hacking protocols (HTTP) has it''s price. So the smart IT community decided it''s time to take a different approach. Enter JWT (JSON Web Token) - a Stateless solution to a Stateful problem. JavaScript community is already using JWT quite extensively, and now it''s time for us to do the same (we don''t want to be worse than them, do we?). In this lecture we''ll take a look at what JWT actually is and how it can be used in our projects. We''ll also try to summarize what problems JWT solves (and what problems it creates) with regards to the old Session approach.'
