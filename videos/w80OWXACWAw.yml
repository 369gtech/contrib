description: "The cloud is one of those leading paradigm shifts that only happen every 10-15 years. Like other shifts before it (virtualization, offshoring, etc.), the cloud will profoundly impact the IT industry at large. No profession, no sector will remain shielded from the changes brought by the cloud. \n\nSacha Labourey, CEO of CloudBees and former CTO of JBoss, will first discuss how cloud computing is a natural step in the evolution and maturation of IT. He will then dig into what those changes mean for Java developers. Finally, he will discuss what choices Java developers are facing and will demonstrate what the future of Java developers might practically look like.\n\n** Sacha's slides available here: http://mrkn.co/v51qe\n\n** For more free resources on Java development, head to http://marakana.com/s/tags/java"
