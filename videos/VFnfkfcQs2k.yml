language: English
recordingDate: 1576321208
description: 'GraphQL is making a huge splash in modern serverless applications. GraphQL allows you to present custom apis that allow the consumer of the API to decide what information they want and how it should be shaped. It also allows for real time pushes of data using web sockets and subscriptions. In this talk, you will learn how to implement this powerful API in the cloud using serverless functions in Azure. You will learn how the GraphQL query language works and how to shape data to suit your needs. You will see push notifications in action with Subscriptions and understand the different ways to manipulate data. Come learn how to reinvent the way you think about APIs and build realtime serverless APIs with GraphQL'
