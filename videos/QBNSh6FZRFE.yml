recordingDate: 1532612902
description: "Recently, both Airbnb and Udacity have publicly expressed their intention to remove React Native from their mobile app codebases. Does this mean the beginning of the end for React Native? Weâ€™ll dissect the reasons why these companies are moving away from one of the most popular cross-platform frameworks, and discuss the impact this could have on React Native over the coming months.\n\nBio: Tom Spencer is a freelance web and mobile app developer with 12 years experience in the industry. He has built apps for a wide range of local agencies and startups and is currently enjoying working with React and React Native."
