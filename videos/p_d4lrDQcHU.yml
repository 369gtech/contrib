recordingDate: 1608746569
description: "Cloudy with a Chance of Chaos\n\nChristina Yakomin, Vanguard\n\nWeather alert!! Vanguard's Chaos and Resilience Engineering team has implemented a home-grown Chaos Engineering platform, \"\"The Climate of Chaos\"\", featuring self-service experiments with meteorology-themed names like Cyclone, Tornado, and Blizzard. In this session, we'll break down the fundamentals of chaos engineering, the value of the practice, and why we decided to build our own platform from scratch, rather than leveraging a vendor product or an open source library. We'll also get into the details of our architecture, our client engagement model, our risk management strategy, and our integrated observability and reporting tooling. By running targeted experiments with our custom tool suite, we have ensured that our systems are ready to weather any storm, no matter how much chaos is in the forecast!\n\nThis structured technical talk will be geared towards an audience of engineers, and will be especially applicable to those working in large enterprise environments.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
