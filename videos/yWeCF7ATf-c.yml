description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nAutomated signal analysis in multiple reception locations enables a large-scale data analysis opportunity for radio propagation. The accumulated datasets result in millions of reception reports, which is suitable for applying \"big data\" solutions. In this presentation, Kenji describes a problem solution approach with Erlang/OTP and Riak to store and analyze the reception reports from two different amateur radio shortwave reception networks called reversebeacon.net and WSPRnet, and shows how to achieve a good computational performance."
