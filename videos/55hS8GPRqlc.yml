In this talk we will discuss which micro-service IPC design problems we (Wix.com) faced and how we solve them using FP building blocks: monads, semigroups, etc. Obviously, introduction of FP design patterns at our scale (over 500 developers) is a huge effort, so we will also discuss an execution process of such changes.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/viaeslav-pozdniakov\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - VIAČESLAV POZDNIAKOV\nWix.com \n\nI work in Server Framework Team as Scala developer at Wix.
