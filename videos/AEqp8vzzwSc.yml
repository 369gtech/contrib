title: 'What Got Us Here Wonâ€™t Get Us There: A Story of Transformations - Mirco Hering'
recordingDate: 1531288037
description: "Mirco Hering is a Managing Director at Accenture and leads the Agile & DevOps practice in Asia Pacific with focus on Agile transformations, DevOps and Test Automation. He has for over a dozen years worked on accelerating software delivery through innovative approaches (what would now be called DevOps) and 10 years ago started experimenting with Agile methods. He started using Agile as a last resort when one of his projects was faced with ever changing requirements resulting in frequent updates to the project plan. Adopting an Agile methodology turned the project around and he has been promoting Agile principles ever since. He supports major public and private sector companies in Australia and overseas in their search for efficient IT delivery. He shares his experiences on http://notafactoryanymore.com and while speaking at international conferences. He is the author of \"DevOps for the Modern Enterprise\", a book helping companies adopt Agile & DevOps and push through the transformation barriers caused by legacy technology and legacy thinking.\n\nDOES18 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
