description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nPOWERUP THE BEAM WITH KUBERNETES AND RIAK CORE\nby Ricardo Oliveira\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nK8s \nRiak \nHA\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nAt Talkdesk we had the mission of building a high available and fault tolerant system that could scale. We built a system that runs in-memory to maintain low response times and we built it in a way to keep the operational costs low and with the capability of auto-scaling.\n\nRicardo will tell a story about the journey of how we built a critical system using Elixir by merging the power of BEAM with proven and emergent technologies like Riak and Kubernetes.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/ricardo-oliveira/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - RICARDO OLIVEIRA\nSupported the flight control team (FCT), as part of the software support team, in the simulations and launch and early orbit phase (LEOP) of the Herschel and Plank satellite mission.\n\nRicardo loves to interact with computers since he is a little kid. He keeps pushing for progress and into making things better for everyone. He likes to face good challenges. He is also a very positive person that enjoys having fun and spend time with friends.\n\nHe is passionate about music and play the guitar, sports (surfing, football, capoeira, snowboard) and motorbikes.\n\nMore on Ricardo Oliveira: https://codesync.global/speaker/ricardo-oliveira/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
