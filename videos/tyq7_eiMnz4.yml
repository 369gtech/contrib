title: 'How to Build a Unicorn - or Die Trying by Heather Wilde'
language: English
recordingDate: 1640002881
description: "In many developer's lives, there comes a day where they have that dream -- the thought that crosses everyone's mind at least once -- of \"I could do that myself!\" No matter how it starts -- being passed over for a promotion, someone stealing your idea, or seeing other people seemingly having more glamourous lives than you -- you think you can make a go of it as an entrepreneur.\n\nAs a serial entrepreneur, who has contributed as a founding employee to multiple successful startups including the billion-dollar unicorn Evernote, I've literally written the book on what you need to go through to create that type of success. In this talk, you'll get to decide for yourself if it's really worth it."
