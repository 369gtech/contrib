description: "Alpha Go Zero left us with our jaws dropped. The Dota2 agent did so even more. And watching the output of companies like DeepMind leaves us stunned in awe. But how do all these systems work? What is this \"deep reinforcement learning\" magic?\n\nIn this session we will first learn the core ideas of reinforcement learning - a bit of math (not too much, promised!), algorithms, learning strategies and more. Then we will see how to implement a reinforcement learning agent in practice. After that we will extend the approach to deep reinforcement learning by adding deep neural networks. To complete the picture, we will have a look at the current software and service ecosystem.\n\nAfter the session, we will not have built the next Alpha Go Zero, but you will have an idea how you could ... ;) - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf1"
