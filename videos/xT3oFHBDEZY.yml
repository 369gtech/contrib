description: "Our engineering workflow revolves around our code review process. Code reviews are more than just a way to make sure we don’t introduce new bugs into the codebase. They have become pillars of our team’s engineering culture—ensuring code quality, encouraging collaboration and providing valuable teaching and learning opportunities.\n\nWe’ll look at the ways your code review process can define, reflect and reinforce your team's culture. These methods can be useful whether you're building and managing engineering teams at startups, large companies or even open source communities. We’ll then walk through the process with actual Pull Requests and identify best practices for more productive code reviews."
