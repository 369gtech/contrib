description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nZero Downtime Deployments: Controlling Application Rollouts and Rollbacks - Christopher Hanson, RX-M LLC \n\nKubernetes provides several types of automation controllers to deploy and manage applications at scale. Each exposes features that provide for zero downtime upgrades and rollbacks but not all controllers are created equal. Deployments provide the widest application compatibility but work best with stateless applications; the aptly named StatefulSet controller provides guarantees that benefit stateful applications, but how do the features of these controllers behave in practice?  Learn about these and other Kubernetes controller types through a series of demonstrations that will reveal their features, benefits, and drawbacks. The session will also explore the primitives that enable granular control over rollouts so that you can choose the settings that work best for your application.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeoV"
