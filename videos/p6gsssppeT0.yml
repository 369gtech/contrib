Many of our sanity tests require our rider application and driver application communicating/coordinating their actions with each other in order to complete the end-to-end testing scenario. In this talk, we will present our platform agnostic solution, called Octopus, and discuss how it coordinates communication across different apps running on different devices. This solution can be adopted for any tests that require coordination/communication across different apps or devices (e.g. a multi-user game, multi-user messaging/communication app, etc.)"
