language: English
recordingDate: 1633421590
description: "⚔️ Project site and all maps in high definition - https://game-of-codes.mdbgo.io/\n\nOver the years, observing the world of front-end technologies, I could not help but feel that it is a great material for creating a separate universe that could become the basis for an extremely interesting story.\n\nThis project is purely for fun. Using real data, such as the number of NPM downloads, stars on github, I tried to measure the \"power\" of a given technology and visualize it with quasi-historical maps.\n\nIf you have any idea how this story and this universe could become more interesting, or more in line with real statistics related to the front-end - let me know in the comments!\n______________________________\n\n🛡️ Create your own hero or monster card and help enrich the universe - https://game-of-codes.mdbgo.io/#section-heroes-and-monsters\n\n🐦If you create something interesting, post it on twitter with the #GameOfCodes hashtag. I will collect all the cards and then put them in the public collection 😉\n\n#GameOfCodes ⚔️"
