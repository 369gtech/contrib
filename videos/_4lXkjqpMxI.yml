title: 'Enabling Machine Learning with Apache Flink - Sherin Thomas'
recordingDate: 1571151798
description: 'In the world of ride sharing, many decisions such as matching a passenger to the nearest driver, need to be made in realtime. As a result, building and reacting to the current state of the world is imperative. In this presentation I will talk about how we built a Machine Learning platform for realtime feature generation at Lyft using Flink Streaming. I will be covering some of the problems we solved, such as dealing with skew when reading from multiple sources, controlling throughput when talking to micro-services, bootstrapping, as well as other operational aspects of building a production quality ML platform.'
