description: "Sanket Patel, LinkedIn\n\nLet's explore something that we use and rely on every day. The file systems. Typical and distributed.\n\nWe first will look at a typical file system, the architectural components and how they all work together when you perform a read or write. We then will take those components and evolve that into a distributed file system architecture. While the architectures we'll explore will not be of a specific file system, they will be generic enough to be relatable with many file system implementations that exist today.\n\nWe also will then implement a tiny distributed file system in Python to see all those components playing together in action. Please note that this will be a very simple, minimal example, not suitable for real usage. If you are a file system hacker, this session will be too basic for you.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
