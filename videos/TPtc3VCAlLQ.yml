Although he is now CEO of hacker company Zerocopter, his relationship with the hacker community is still the main driving force in his life. His dream to bring the brilliant minds of all hackers he knows together in one room and to hack everything that is brought in is something that he is getting closer to. In addition, together with the “Guild of Grumpy Old Hackers”, he is actively guiding and leading young hackers in the right direction in order to create his ultimate goal - a safe society through a safer internet.\n\nIn this session we catch up with him and find out what's been brewing over at Zerocopter and what he's been up to over the last year"
