description: "\"Achieving velocity is the new normal in software development and release practices. The adoption of DevOps, CI/CD practices and tooling is at the core of these gains. Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are incredibly powerful and companies of all shapes and sizes are finding it very difficult to get started. Often, this can be attributed to the lack of foundational skill sets required to succeed in their Kubernetes journey, including a lack of knowledge and experience with containers.\n\nHaving a deep understanding of containers is paramount to successfully adopting and operating Kubernetes. In this talk, Angel Rivera will discuss the skill sets that individuals and teams must develop prior to getting started with Kubernetes, including the critical aspects of the Docker runtime and containers. Attendees will walk away with a solid grasp of the foundational elements of Docker that will better prepare them for their DevOps and Kubernetes initiatives.\"\n\nAngel Rivera, Developer Advocate at CircleCI\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/you-want-to-kubernetes-you-must-know-containers"
