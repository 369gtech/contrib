description: "OSGi has a long and successful history as technology for providing modularity and manageability in both enterprise and embedded Java systems. Its applicability especially to building gateway software makes it the technology of choice for addressing many Internet of Things requirements. This session presents an Internet of Things architecture based on OSGi and discusses the various aspects of this architecture, such as the integration of edge devices using heterogeneous protocols, the realization of complex automation logic on the gateways, and the connectivity to cloud-based service/management systems. Special attention is paid to the requirements of the underlying JVM and the applicability of the new Java SE Embedded 8 and Java ME 8.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDimitar Valtchev\nDr. Dimitar Valtchev is Chief Technology Officer of ProSyst Software.\nHis main technical interests are in the fields of embedded systems,\ndevice management and distributed computing.\n\nRecently Dimitar has been involved in numerous residential and\nautomotive projects using the OSGi technology. He believes in the power\nof open systems/architectures and actively participates in the work of\norganizations such as OSGiA and HGI.\n\nDimitar is a senior member of IEEE and holds MS in Electronics, MS in\nComputer Science and PhD in Electrical Engineering degrees from the\nTechnical University of Sofia.\nView more trainings by Dimitar Valtchev at https://www.parleys.com/author/dimitar-valtchev-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
