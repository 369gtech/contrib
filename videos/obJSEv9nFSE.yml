title: 'The Robots Won''t Take Away Our Jobs â€” Let''s Reframe the Debate on Artificial Intelligence'
recordingDate: 1548365925
description: "Martin Krafft\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/137/\n\nA trending theme in the Industry 4.0 discourse is that robots and other forms of artificial intelligence are going to take away our jobs. Such predictions are then often accompanied by dystopic scenery of humans commanded by anthropomorphic machines, painting a bleak future for humanity. It goes without doubt that the fourth industrial revolution will effect change upon society, in some ways similar to its three predecessors, and in others different in ways we cannot yet imagine.\r\n\r\nHowever, the robots are not going to replace us, for humans have distinguishing traits, some of which are rooted in millions of years of evolution, and others directly resulting from the way humans interact with their surroundings. While we're likely to see the end of certain lines of work, just like today nobody works shoveling coal on trains, or operating the telephone for others, we will not only adapt to change, but we will be the ones leading it.\r\n\r\nBig data and data science have given us machines capable of identifying correlations in data that were previously invisible to and unfathomable by humans. In what ways can these be considered intelligent? What's missing, and where are the boundaries? Can these be crossed? Ever? Where are the potentials, and how do we better deal with machines making decisions that affect our lives? What are the benefits of asking these questions?\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I explore the nature of intelligence, and what makes humans unique, and robots less so. I would like to take the audience on a \"tour de force\" of 40 years of \"New AI\" research, which I studied and lectured at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Zurich, one of the leading laboratories in this field.\r\n\r\nMy goal is not just to ask questions, or provide simple answers. There are none. Instead, I would like to empower and invite the audience to reframe the debate about artificial intelligence and robots, especially pertaining to the future of work. Progress in the field is accelerating, and we need to shift perspective and ask ourselves: \"what do we want from the robots?\", rather than \"what are they going to do to us?\". Our frame of this debate will inform the way we think about AI and robots, and affect the decisions we make, individually, and as society, about the roles of robots and humans, the potentials of automation, and the ethical and moral challenges associated with the revolution dawning upon us.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
