description: "Two Go programs, three different profiling techniques, all in 40 minutes\n\nGo, being a relatively recent statically typed, compiled, language, is known to produce efficient programs. But writing a program in Go is not sufficient for good performance. In this talk, I'll demonstrate three different methods of profiling Go programs to diagnose, then improve, the performance of several programs. By the end of this talk, the audience will know how to profile the CPU and memory usage of a Go program, understand to examine an execution trace, and come to grips with the reality of Amdahl's Law.\n\n\nAbout Dave Cheney:\n\n\nI am a software engineer and hardware enthusiast from Sydney, Australia. I write, speak, and promote Go around the world."
