description: "What would you do if you had to say everything three times to have people listen? Research shows that no matter the industry, people automatically believe men, but women need three tries.\n\nThat’s the dilemma I was faced with – so I invented my male alter ego, “Allan.”\n\nAs a 20+ year veteran of the startup world, including over 5 years designing and managing online game properties for EA, SOE, Disney, THQ and others, I’ve had an interesting perspective on life, the universe, and everything when it comes to breaking into Bro Culture.\n\nCute, sad, funny and inspirational talk about how to become successful in places where you don’t quite fit in."
