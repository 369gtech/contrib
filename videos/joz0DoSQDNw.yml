SaaS touches every dimension of your design, including how you decompose your system into services, how those services are built, how they are secured, how they store data, and how they are deployed.\nIn this session we’ll dig into each of these areas and outline the common patterns and strategies that you’ll need to factor into the design of your SaaS solution. As part of this dive into architecture and code, we’ll explore the core elements of SaaS application development, including identity, onboarding, tenant isolation, and data partitioning. The goal here is to expose you to the fundamental building blocks associated with designing and coding [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:40 The SaaS architecture landscape\n05:18 Provisioning a new tenant\n07:56 Tenant context everywhere\n09:32 Building multi-tenant microservices\n12:49 Partitioning data\n14:30 A microservices-by-microservices decision\n15:23 Isolating tenant resources\n16:52 The challenge of pool-based isolation\n17:35 Runtime scoped access with policies\n19:14 Takeaways\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1329/saas-deep-dive-designing-and-building-multi-tenant-solutions\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#SaaS #AWS #Cloud #SoftwareArchitecture #Programming #Backend\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
