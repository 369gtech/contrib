title: 'How to Build a Retail Startup'
language: English
recordingDate: 1564465908
description: "I've built a demo app called SmartSneaks that lets a user convert a song or image into a generated shoe design! This is an example of how AI can be used to transform retail by giving users a more personalized experience. The tools I used to build this are the Flutter framework for mobile development and the Flask framework for web development. There are 3 learning objectives in this video including how to build a deep learning API for your mobile app, how to generate images with a generative adversarial network, and how to calculate image similarity with OpenCV.
