title: 'Developing Microservices with Aggregates by Chris Richardson'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492500102
description: "The Domain Model pattern is a great way to develop complex business logic. Unfortunately, a typical domain model is a tangled, birds nest of classes. It can’t be decomposed into microservices. Moreover, business logic often relies on ACID transactions to maintain consistency. Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem: aggregates.\n\nAn aggregate is an often overlooked modeling concept from the must read book Domain Driven Design. In this talk you will learn how aggregates enable you to develop business logic for the modern world of microservices and NoSQL. We will describe how to use aggregates to design modular business logic that can be partitioned into microservices. You will learn how aggregates enable you to use eventual consistency instead of ACID. We will describe the design of a microservice that is built using aggregates, and Spring Cloud.\n\nChris Richardson is a developer and architect. He is the author of POJOs in Action, which describes how to build enterprise Java applications with frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate. Chris was also the founder of the original CloudFoundry.com, an early Java PaaS for Amazon EC2. Today, he is a recognized thought leader in microservices. Chris is the creator of http://microservices.io, a website describing how to develop and deploy microservices. He provides microservices consulting and training and is working on his third startup http://eventuate.io, an application platform for developing microservices."
