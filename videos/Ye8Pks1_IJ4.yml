recordingDate: 1638968838
description: "Become a better leader by understanding yourself. You can be a leader in any context, within your team, your organisation, your life. A true leader is not determined by their title but by their actions and the people who follow them. In this talk, I will dive into self-awareness, what it is, how to develop it, and its power. With self-awareness, you can empower yourself to build on your strengths and lean on the strengths of others. Understand your behaviours and their impacts. Make a positive change and grow your leadership skills. Through understanding yourself, you can be a great leader.\n\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/"
