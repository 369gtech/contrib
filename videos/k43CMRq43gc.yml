description: "Thomas Shaw - Build Engineer, Demonware (Activision)\n\n\"Technologies that are going to affect our lives in the next decade are being tested and developed in the video game sphere.\" In January 2016 Activision approved a pilot project to build a containerised continuous delivery pipeline using Docker. This project spanned multiple devops teams and would culminate in launching a production title \"Skylanders Imaginators\" in October 2016. The Mission Statement : “Our mission is to deliver an amazing build, test and deploy pipeline that aims to be so reliable, effective and easy to use that our product and title departments will end up writing high value gaming services all day long without giving a second thought to how they may reliably deliver these in record time.” This talk will discuss the cultural and technical challenges faced throughout the pilot. Spoiler alert: Not everyone was happy with the decision to use Docker. The talk will cover the concerns and how we handled them. It will cover why it is important, especially in the games industry, to be evaluating and integrating technologies like Docker in order to remain relevant. For the first time in Demonware history developers were responsible for the launch and support of a title. We are also the first studio under Activision to be running Docker in Production."
