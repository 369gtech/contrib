And it gets better, Leap Motion even plans to open source the Java Script API!\n\nA team of Leap Motion evangelists and developers visited SFHTML5 to introduce, and showcase, some of the amazing on the horizon from the Leap Motion controller, for the developer community and beyond. The team also tells you exactly how you can start participating, and contributing, to this growing community on OpenLeap.\n\n**Discover more amazing about HTML5 with our free developer resources: http://marakana.com/s/tags/html5"
