description: "JavaFX is great on the desktop, and it’s also available on embedded devices such as BeagleBoard and Raspberry Pi. It’s hard to find projects—besides  toy  projects—in which this technology is really useful. This session presents a real use case in which JavaFX on the desktop and embedded will be used on a daily basis. In principle, it’s all about a simple temperature monitoring application, but the problem was approached in two very different ways. The first approach is a distributed application using OpenDolphin, JavaFX (with Groovy and GroovyFX), and Raspberry Pi. The second approach is more Java SE–centric, using JavaFX embedded and XMPP. The session also compares and contrasts the architectures, exploring the pros and cons of each approach.\n\n\nAuthors:\nGerrit Grunwald\nGerrit Grunwald is working as a software engineer at Canoo Engineering AG (Basel, Switzerland).
