description: "Speaker: Marcin Grzejszczak\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/MarcinGrzejszczak/consumer-driven-contracts-and-your-microservice-architecture-67641511\n\nTDD introduced many improvements into the development process, but in our opinion the biggest impact relates to code design. Looking at the code from the usage perspective (by first writing an acceptance test) allows us to focus on usability rather than concrete implementation. Unfortunately, we usually rest on our laurels not trying to uplift this practice to the architecture level.\n\nThis presentation will show you how you can use the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier functionality in order to have a fully automated solution to stub your HTTP / Messaging collaborators. Just by adding proper configuration, you’ll surround the microservices you are testing with faked stubs that are tested against their producer, making much more realistic tests.\n\nWe will write a system using the CDC approach together with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud and Spring Cloud Contract Verifier. I’ll show you how easy it is to write applications that have a consumer-driven API, allowing a developer to speed up the time for writing better quality software."
