description: "Using microservice architecture is becoming a popular approach to developing complex solutions based on several small, independently deployable, easily replaceable and manageable microservices. Jersey 2 provides JAX-RS 2.0  implementation for developing RESTful applications in Java. This session demonstrates how to take advantage  of Jersey 2 features that go beyond the standard Java EE API and enable users to develop microservices in Java that are lightweight; do not need a full-fledged Java EE container; and still enable easy development, scalable deployment, and competitive administration and monitoring features. Throughout the session, live code examples demonstrate the discussed features in detail.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJakub Podle코치k\nJakub works on project Jersey, a production quality reference implementation of JAX-RS API (RESTful web services in Java). \nHe regularly speaks at various international conferences (JavaOne, Jazoon, GeeCON, SUN/Oracle TechDays) and is also co-leading the Czech Java User Group.\nView more trainings by Jakub Podle코치k at https://www.parleys.com/author/jakub-podlesak-4\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
