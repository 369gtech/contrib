description: "Are you wasting time analyzing the wrong data?\n \nAs an engineering leader, it can sometimes be hard to pinpoint what measurements are essential to your role. It is natural to be overwhelmed by the amount of data you have collected and having to regularly update what your focus should be on.\n\nWhile it is important as leaders to take a step back from the day-to-day coding, it becomes harder to tell if you and your team are moving in the right direction at a good pace. There are many metrics that can be useful but there are also ones that can be misleading.\n\nIn this panel, we’ll discuss the key things for engineering leaders to get the best out of their systems; thinking about what to measure, how to measure it, and how to interpret your results.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n- Outline the fundamentals of engineering metrics.\n- Learn which measurements are useful and which should be avoided\n- Understand how to interpret your metrics to ensure that you’re not jumping to false conclusions.\n- Develop actions and strategies based on your data.\n\nBrought to you in partnership with Code Climate\nCode Climate builds Engineering Intelligence solutions for software development teams. Their flagship product, Velocity, helps engineering leaders make efficient, unbiased data-driven decisions to ship product faster, build better processes and drive continuous improvement in their department."
