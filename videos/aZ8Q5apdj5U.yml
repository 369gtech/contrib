description: "Matthias Tarasiewicz, Daniel Pichler and Jürgen Hoebarth are focusing on what they call \"coded cultures\", dev cultures based on new technologies, which are disruptive (on the example of \"blockchain\"). These cultures are working outside traditional research and development contexts and reconfigured through interdisciplinary and fringe formats such as \"workshops\", \"meetups\" and other forms of autodidact learning.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
