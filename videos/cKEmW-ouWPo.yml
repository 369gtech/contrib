description: "Hike is a mobile-first, messaging platform that is used by 100 million users to exchange 40 billion messages/month. Hike app is available on Android, iOS and Windows phone. On the back-end, we’ve 100+ macro-services in Java, Python, Ruby, Go and Elixir. While setting up a Continuous Delivery pipeline, we ran into a series of technical challenges. However it was more important to address the organisational/behavioural challenges to ensure a sustainable culture shift in the company.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll explain how we went about:\n\n* Setup a trunk-based development model\n* Decentralised our build & test environments using Docker and Jenkins\n* Segregated and containerised our macro-services\n* Refactored the mobile apps to be more container friendly\n* Setup a mobile device farm using STF\n* Improved the quality of code-reviews using PRBuilder & PRRiskAdvisor\n* Created different kinds of automated tests to align with our CI Pipeline and get rapid feedback\n* Finally how we used C3 to visualise the health of our code-base\n\nGeek…Consultant…Conference Producer…Startup Founder…struggling to stay up-to-date with technology innovation. Null Process Evangelist.\n\nNaresh Jain is an internationally recognised Technology & Product Development Expert.
