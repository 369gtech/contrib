title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays 46 - Turning Kotlin Applications into Secure Native Executables with Eleftheria Stein'
language: English
recordingDate: 1616015007
description: 'In this episode, weâ€™ll take a Kotlin Spring Boot application, secure it and compile it to a native executable. We will start with an insecure application and secure it from the ground up using the Spring Security Kotlin DSL. Then, using Spring Native, we will compile the application to a native executable, creating a lightweight container with reduced memory consumption and near instant startup time.'
