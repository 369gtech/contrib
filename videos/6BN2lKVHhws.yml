description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSimplify Application Deployment at the Edge with Harbor - MICHAEL MICHAEL, Harbor Don’t miss out! \n\nHarbor offers a lot of capabilities as a registry in the datacenter. Recently, we have focused our energy on better image distribution and Edge scenarios. You can't operate Kubernetes at the Edge without a registry and Harbor is making it easier and simpler to co-locate your workloads with your cloud native artifacts. Integrations with P2P providers like Uber’s Kraken and Alibaba’s Dragonfly and Proxy Cache capabilities are key features that make image distribution at the Edge possible.\n\nhttps://sched.co/fGWK"
