description: "A Native Kube Operator Tailored for Cloud Foundry - Troy Topnik, SUSE & Enrique Encalada, IBM\n\nIn this talk the audience will learn about the cf-operator, a project that's part of the CF Containerization proposal.\nWe'll show what this operator can do and how Cloud Foundry deployments can be managed with it.\n\nWe'll also delve deeper, and talk about implementation techniques, Kubernetes Controllers and Custom Resources.\n\nThis will be a great opportunity to learn about how Cloud Foundry can work flawlessly on top of Kube.\n\nAbout Troy Topnik\nTroy is a Senior Product Manager responsible for SUSE Cloud Application Platform. He began working with Cloud Foundry shortly after its open source debut in 2011, and has been a technical writer, instructor, and product manager with the ActiveState and HPE Helion Stackato teams.\n\nAbout Enrique Encalada\nEnrique is a software developer at IBM Germany, who likes to work with different technologies, try to understand them and build something upon that.
