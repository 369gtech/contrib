description: "Over the last 18 months REA and Hooroo have used cloud computing and continuous delivery to deliver new products to the market faster than any previous launch for their organisations. Come and learn from the real world experience of two Aussie success stories.  Hear from a green field business and an established legacy high traffic organisation -  two contrasting starting points moving towards a common goal. Learn about how they adopted cloud computing, continuous delivery, build pipelines and more.  \n\nLearn about:\n- adopting continuous delivery in a green field business\n- retrofitting continuous delivery into a complex legacy environment\n- experiences adopting IaaS with AWS and PaaS with Engine Yard\n- the challenges faced\n- the tools and techniques used and developed\n\nOver the last 18 months Ben worked as an iteration manager at REA Group where he lead REA's program to implement continuous delivery of testing and production environments both in the cloud and in our production data centers. Ben works as a consultant, coach and trainer with many organizations seeking to adopt Lean, Kanban, Agile, Scrum and XP.\n\nPeter Moran is Development Manager at Hooroo (and before that Jetstar), where he has helped build the technology team delivering new travel websites for the Qantas Group. At Hooroo, he has helped lead the path towards agile development, continuous delivery and cloud computing. Over the last decade, Peter has consulted, architected and developed with many of Australia's leading technology teams, including a year with REA. Peter still loves writing Ruby code.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
