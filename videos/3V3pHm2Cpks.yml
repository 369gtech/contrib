description: "Event-driven architecture and design have been getting a lot of attention in recent years. It’s an old concept that has been around for decades, so why this sudden peak of interest?\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the nature of events, what it means to be event-driven, and how we can unleash the power of events. The goal is to arm you with a solid theoretical understanding of how to design an event-driven system, what tools and techniques you can use to reap the most benefit from its design, and perhaps most importantly, what to avoid.\n\nWe'll discuss how an event-driven design can help: - drive autonomy - reduce risk - increase certainty - increase loose coupling - increase scalability - increase resilience - increase traceability\n\nSkeptics should definitely attend.\n\nJonas Bonér is Founder and CTO of Lightbend, inventor of the Akka project, initiator and co-author of the Reactive Manifesto and a Java Champion.
