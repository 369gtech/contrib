description: "The What and Why of Documenting Your Infrastructure\n\nKevin Metcalf, Foothill-De Anza Community College District\n\nWhen our only Linux admin for 70+ physical and virtual machines announced his retirement, the job of managing this undocumented mess fell to me. This talk is a humorous look at how I ended up over my head, and what I did about it. Folks should come away thinking about documentation in terms of respect and equity.\n\nView the full LISA21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa21/program"
