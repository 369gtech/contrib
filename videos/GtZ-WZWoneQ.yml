description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Nicola Corti, Yelp.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=ODA-3499\n\nDo you exactly know what's your app doing when you deliver it to your users? Are you 100% sure? Would you bet on this? You're probably confident with the code you wrote and you know what is doing. \n\nBut what about the code that others wrote? \n\nWe pull dependencies from the online repositories every day. Our applications strongly rely on external libraries that are hosted on public Maven repositories. What if one of those library contains some malicious code? Imagine a library that starts harvesting your user data without you knowing it.\n\nIn this talk we will see how to monitor and protect your application from malicious dependency on the web that might end up in your final compiled App.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
