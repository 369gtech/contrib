title: 'Creating event-driven microservices: the why, how and what by Andrew Schofield'

description: 'Any team that has made the jump from building monoliths to building microservices knows the complexities you must overcome to build a system that is functional and maintainable. Building a microservice architecture that is low latency and only communicates using REST APIs is even more tricky, with high latency for requests being a common concern. This talk will explain how you can use events as the backbone of your microservice architecture and build an efficient, event-driven system. It will cover how to get started with designing your microservice architecture and the key requirements any system needs to fulfil. It will also introduce the different patterns you will encounter in event-driven architectures and the advantages and disadvantages of these choices. Finally it will explain why Apache Kafka is a great choice for event-driven microservices.'
