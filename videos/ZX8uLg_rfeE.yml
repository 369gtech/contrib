description: "Delivering TV Everywhere with Cloud Native Solutions - Arnaud Caron & Jerome Champetier, Mediakind \n\nTraditional TV players are facing huge challenges from the rapid growth of emerging video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube TV.    TV service providers must modernize and accelerate their operations, moving from dedicated hardware in datacenter to embracing hybrid cloud technologies, DevOps and orchestration, while considering cloud frameworks constraints which arenâ€™t natively designed for real-time media - and issues such as high processing & storage performance, network (latency, bandwidth, multicast), high availability and reliability.    We will present our journey since 2015, showcasing how our architecture migration to microservices / containers / Kubernetes & Helm helped to lay the foundations for our global development team. We will share our architectural designs and explain how we overcame challenges such as K8s deployments, CNI, monitoring and packaging with Helm. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYR"
