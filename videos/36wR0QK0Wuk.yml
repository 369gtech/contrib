description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay, 20 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nRudy Rucker's latest novel, Postsingular, describes an Earth blanketed with a light mesh of nanomachines, about one per square millimeter. The mesh makes everything \"visible\" on the Web. What happens then? Rudy will read a bit from the novel, describe the underlying ideas, and answer questions about his science-fictional visions of what's next.\n\nSpeaker: Rudy Rucker\nRudy Rucker is a writer who spent twenty years as a computer science professor at San Jose State University. He is regarded as contemporary master of science-fiction, and received the Philip K. Dick award twice. His thirty published books include both novels and non-fiction books, including The Lifebox, the Seashell and the Soul, which argues that everything is a gnarly computation. He's currently writing a trilogy of novels in which nanotechnology changes everything. The first, Postsingular, appeared from Tor Books in Fall, 2007, and is also available for free download on the web. The second, Hylozoic, will appear from Tor in 2009."
