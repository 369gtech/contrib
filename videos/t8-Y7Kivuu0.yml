description: "Quart a asyncio alternative to Flask\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-27 - Smarkets]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Philip Jones\n\nFlask is a great web mirco-framework, that is best utilised with\nevent-loop concurrency. Sadly with Flask the event-loop framework\ncan't be asyncio, although some extensions (Flask-Aiohttp) have\ntried. Quart is the solution as it shares the Flask API and is\nbased on asyncio. In addition Quart goes beyond Flask adding\nHTTP/2 and websockets.\n\nThis talk will outline why event-loop concurrency is a good\nchoice for web servers, why asyncio is a good choice and then\ngive an overview of Quart, demonstrating features that go beyond\nthe Flask framework.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
