description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nWhen you write a library, you want people to use it. (Otherwise, why write it as a library?). But to attract and keep users, you need to provide more than \"a bunch of code\". In this talk, I'll discuss some of those things. \n\nI'll talk about: \n* Code quality and portability \n* Testing \n* Documentation \n* Static and dynamic analysis \n* Fuzzing \n* Managing change in your library \n\nas well as tools that you can use for providing these things. Examples will be taken from Boost and libc++, the C++ standard library implementation for LLVM. \n— \n\nMarshall Clow\nQualcomm\nMarshall has been programming professionally for 35 yearsHe is the author of Boost.Algorithm, and has been a contributor to Boost for more than 15 years. He is the chairman of the Library working group of the C++ standard committee. He is the lead developer for libc++, the C++ standard library for LLVM.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
