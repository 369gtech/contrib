description: "Reject.JS 2014 – Berlin, September 11, 2014\n\nMove over Number 5: Artificial Intelligence is a relic of 1986. It’s 2014: the era of Machine Learning + Big Data.\n\nMachine learning helps power everything from Google Now to the lovely OS X Preview app — but you don’t have to be a Prolog or eCommerce geek to harness its power!\n\nWe’ll take a whirlwind tour through the fundamental concepts and algorithms in machine learning, then explore a frontend application: selecting the “best” photos to feature on our photo sharing site.\n\nDon’t expect mathematically laborious derivations of SVM kernels or the infinite VC dimension of Neural Nets, but we will gain enough intuition to make informed compromises (thanks to the No Free Lunch theorem, everything is a compromise) in our pursuit of aesthetically-intelligent machines!\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
