description: "Gotta train 'em all! Let's generate some new pokemon using the power of Generative Adversarial Networks. This is a newer deep learning technique invented by a researcher & friend of mine named Ian Goodfellow. Yann LeCunn called it the coolest idea in the past 2 decades. I'll explain how it works, some more recent improvements, then we'll go through the code. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Pokemon_GAN\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like.
