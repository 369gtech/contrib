description: "In this session we focused on Kerberos authentication. We started with some basic background on Kerberos and demonstrated the use of Kerberos in an Oracle Database environment. Then we discussed the implementation of Kerberos with the Oracle Database including the different files and components involved in the configuration of the service. We moved from implementation to troubleshooting, discussing techniques for locating issues in a Kerberos setup. We finished with a demonstration of troubleshooting a typical Kerberos configuration issue.\n\nHere is a guide to the recording;\n01:40 Product Announcements\n05:50 Support corner\n07:00 Kerberos terms, definitions, concept, and history\n12:45 Demonstration of database authentication with Kerberos\n16:30 Kerberos Implementation\n40:00 Kerberos Troubleshooting\n49:30 Demonstration of Kerberos troubleshooting\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/ \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
