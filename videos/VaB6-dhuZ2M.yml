recordingDate: 1575188243
description: "Wix is mostly famous for its amazing drag & drop site building experience. While the Wix product & offerings has evolved a lot during the years, the site building capabilities remained our bread and butter. One of the core applications in Wix is the site renderer: a generic renderer for all Wix websites.\n\nIn this talk, Gil introduces us to the challenges of building a world class site rendering platform. We start from scratch, build our first basic site renderer, and gradually complicate things (AKA “platformize it”). Prepare yourself for an intense live coding session!"
