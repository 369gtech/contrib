description: "This presentation provides an analysis of the advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks that have occurred during the past two years on the semiconductor industry. Our research shows that the majority of these attacks were concentrated on the Taiwan semiconductor sector. This is worthy of concern, as Taiwan’s semiconductor industry plays a very crucial role in the world. Even a small disruption in the supply chain could have a serious ripple effect throughout the entire industry. Surprisingly, up until now, there has been less coverage on these attacks. In this presentation, we seek to shed light on the threat actors and campaigns of these attacks, where they are collectively referred to as Operation SemiChimera (a.k.a. Skeleton). Additionally, we provide a brief overview of the current information security status of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, we discovered several attacks on various semiconductor vendors located at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in Taiwan. As these attacks employed similar attack techniques and tactics, a pattern could be discerned from the malicious activities. From this pattern, we deduced that these attacks, which we dubbed Operation SemiChimera, were actually conducted by the same threat actor. The main objective of these attacks appeared to be stealing intelligence, specifically documents about IC chips, software development kits (SDKs), IC designs, the source code, etc. If such documents are successfully stolen, the impact can be devastating. The motive behind these attacks likely stems from competitors or even countries seeking to gain a competitive advantage over rivals. Since the similar techniques and tactics to previous attack activities, we suspect the attacker is China-based hacker group.\n\nWe thus hope that this presentation will help semiconductor companies gain a better understanding of the dangers from such attacks. Additionally, as we have worked with several of the semiconductor vendors to improve their cyber security, we wish to share this valuable experience, and highlight the current challenges facing the entire industry.\n\n\n=== \n\nChung-Kuan Chen is currently a senior researcher in Cycraft, and responses for organizing their research team. He earned his PHD degree of Computer Science and Engineering from National Chiao-Tung University (NCTU). His research focuses on network attack and defense, machine learning, software vulnerability, malware and program analysis. He tries to utilize machine learning to assist malware analysis and vulnerability discovery, and build automatic attack and defense systems. He has published several academic journal and conference papers, and has involved in many large research projects from digital forensic, incident response and malware analysis. He also dedicates to security education. Founding of NCTU hacker research clubs, he trains students to participate world-class security contests, and has experience of participating DEFCON CTF (2016 in HITCON Team and 2018 as coach in BFS team). Besides, he has presented technical presentations in non-academic technique conferences, such as HITCON, RootCon, CodeBlue OpenTalk, FIRST and VXCON. As an active member in Taiwan security community, he is in the review committee of HITCON conference, and ex-chief of CHROOT – the top private hacker group in Taiwan. He organized BambooFox Team to join some bug bounty projects and discover some CVEs in COTS software and several vulnerabilities in campus websites.\n\n--- \n\nInndy Lin is a cyber security researcher in CyCarrier, mainly focuses on malware reversing and supporting advanced Windows research. He loves exploring cyber security technologies and open source culture.\n\n--- \n\nSHANG-DE Jiang is a researcher of the Research Team of CyCarrier. Currently, he focuses on research about Incident Response and Endpoint Security."
