description: "In the past few years, animations on the web have evolved dramatically. We are able to build animations that generate and manipulate complex geometry, react to user input and tell captivating stories. Varun finds himself looking at all this amazing work and asking, “How did they do that?” \n\nFor web developers, going from working with the DOM to directly manipulating geometry and graphics requires a bit of a mental shift. This talk will explore some basic mathematical concepts that are often encountered when creating animations. Focusing on 2D geometry, Varun will cover topics such as trigonometry, co-ordinate systems, curves and vectors. Making these sometimes intimidating concepts accessible to everyone.\n\nEVENT:\n\nFITC Toronto 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nVarun Vachhar\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nfitevents Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish fitevents talks.\n\nNever been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!"
