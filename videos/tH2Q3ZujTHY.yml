title: 'Enable SQL/JDBC Access to Apache Geode/GemFire Using Apache Calcite - Christian Tzolov'
language: English
recordingDate: 1519190497
description: "When working with BigData & IoT systems we often feel the need for an established, Common Query Language.\n\nTo fill this gap some NoSql vendors are building SQL access to their systems. Building SQL engine from scratch is a daunting job and frameworks like Apache Calcite can help you with the heavy lifting. It allows you to integrate SQL parser, Cost-Based Optimizer, and JDBC with your NoSql system. Calcite has been used to empower many BigData platforms such as Hive, Spark, Flink, Drill, HBase/Phoenix to name some.\n\nIn this session I will walk you through the process of building a SQL access layer for Apache Geode (GemFire). I will share my experience, pitfalls and technical consideration like balancing between the SQL/RDBMS semantics and the design choices and limitations of In-Memory-Data-Grid systems like Geode.\n\nHopefully this will enable you to add SQL capabilities to your preferred NoSQL data system.\n\nChristian Tzolov, Software Craftsman, Pivotal\nRecorded at SpringOne Platform 2017."
