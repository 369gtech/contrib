description: "# When Did We Become Afraid to Try? (Closing Keynote)\n\nJennifer Wadella - Lead Angular Developer\n\nWe live in a world where we never hear about failures in a positive light, only the success stories. Our education system, work performance metrics, even social media glamorizes getting the “correct” answer the first time, completely discounting the trial & error before that leads to the eventual success.\n\nWhile technology is as “cheap” as the hours it takes to write code and the bar is low, we are still terrified to fail and it keeps many of us from trying anything at all. This fear of trying stifles any chance of innovation we may have. How can we become unafraid to try again?\n\n## About nor(DEV):con\n\nThe eastern region's biggest tech conference runs annually in February with a fantastic line-up of speakers and workshops. In our fifth year we joined 41 speakers, over 5 tracks, speaking on a wide range of subjects. Day 1 kicked off with technical deep dives into popular and important languages, frameworks and process. Our key theme for 2020 was wellbeing, with plenty of talks on the main stage around the subject on Day 2, alongside Workshops and plenty of tech talk too.\n\nYou can read more about the line up for 2020 at https://2020.nordevcon.com/ or watch 2021 shape up on our main site https://nordevcon.com/\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes.
