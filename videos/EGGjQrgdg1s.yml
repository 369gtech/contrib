title: 'Rails Online Conf: Rack in Rails 3'
recordingDate: 1268596274
description: 'One of the largest general architectural enhancements in Rails 3 is a steep increase in modularity. Nowhere is this more evident than the refactoring of ActionController into a series of Rack middleware components. In this talk, we''ll take a look at Rack: why it was created, how it caught fire across Ruby web frameworks, and how to build Rack components that further extend Rails 3''s HTTP pipeline.'
