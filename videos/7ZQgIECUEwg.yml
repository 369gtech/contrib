description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nCoreDNS for Hybrid and Multi-cloud - Yong Tang, MobileIron \n\nThis session will cover CoreDNS configurations in hybrid and multi-cloud environments, including serving DNS record provided by cloud vendors such as AWS (Route53) and GCP (Cloud DNS), supporting DNS over TLS and DNS over gRPC for securing DNS data communications, managing zone data with records shuffling and reordering for service workload rebalancing, and finally deploying CoreDNS in multiple Kubernetes clusters across multi-cloud for service discovery. This session is intended for people familiar with basic CoreDNS configurations but wishing to extend CoreDNS’s functionality in complicated scenarios. It is important to mention that the flexibility and ease of use allow CoreDNS to solve many real-world problems with brevity.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeib"
