description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nYou've added #coroutines to your app and everything is fine while your users are on the happy path. But what happens if you cancel a coroutine, you get a timeout or other type of error? Where do you handle it?\n\nKotlin added structured concurrency to scope the lifetime of a coroutine. But what kind of scopes should you use? How do scopes affect error handling? Does the way you start a coroutine, using launch or async have any effect on the type of errors or the way you handle them?\n\nIn this talk we'll go over all of these use cases and show how they can be implemented to ensure robust error handling and a good user experience, even when you're thrown off the happy path.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenters:\nFlorina is working as an Android Developer Advocate at Google, helping developers architect clean, testable apps using the Architecture Components libraries.
