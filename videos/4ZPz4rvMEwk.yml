title: 'An introduction to Vircadia - an Open Source desktop and VR metaverse'
recordingDate: 1612099347
description: "Vadim Troshchinskiy\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/36/\n\nVircadia is a somewhat unusual type of software. We use the word \"metaverse\" to describe it --  a collective virtual shared space, without a fixed purpose. It's a similar idea to Second Life or to a lesser extent, VR Chat. Vircadia is a fork of the now dead High Fidelity in its original incarnation. A simple way of looking at it the 3D equivalent of Apache.\r\n\r\nWhat it does is providing a 3D environment (with optional VR support) where to socialize, script, make games, hold meetings, or do most anything that could be done in a 3D setting. It was made to be flexible and can serve many purposes.\r\n\r\nThis talk is made in response to the question \"How can open source play a role in creating, helping and adapting to this ongoing change? What new developments in software and coding can we look forward to in 2021 and beyond?\" made in the call for submissions by Linux Conf AU, and we think we have a good answer.\r\n\r\nThe talk will be mostly a high level overview -- who we are, where this all came from, what is it good for and how we think it can be of great help in current times, as well as what are our plans for the future.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
