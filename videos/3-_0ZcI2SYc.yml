description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nA bounded context is a safe place for models to evolve freely. There are no conflicts or contradictions within a bounded context. So, how does one convey important and meaningful changes that happen within the context that can impact the overall system? Messaging can be useful as an integration mechanism between bounded contexts. Learn how you can combine the principles of DDD with event-driven architecture to build truly autonomous services, a.k.a microservices.\n\nIndu Alagarsamy has been programming for over 15 years. She is currently part of the development team at Particular Software, the makers of NServiceBus, practicing her passion. Indu is also passionate about diversity and inclusiveness in the tech industry. When not programming, she is either rock climbing in sunny Southern California or spending time with her kids!"
