language: English
recordingDate: 1410616645
description: "Idris is a cool new language for writing verified programs. In Idris, types are a first-class language construct and can have predicates which use ordinary values. By allowing values to be used to determine types, it’s possible to enforce many more static properties about programs. It’s trivial to define a safe list of heterogenous data or even a variadic printf function without any use of macros. This workshop will give a small look into the world of verified programming and dependent types by using Idris.\n\nThe intended audience of this workshop are users of Haskell, ML or Scala and who are interested in formal verification of programs. Idris can be very similar to Haskell so some familiarity will help."
