title: 'Maps Live: Visualizing Maps Engine Data on JavaScript Maps'
recordingDate: 1372714862
description: 'Using Maps Engine layers, developers can visualize and interact with data hosted in Maps Engine on a Javascript map. These classes can compute the tiles augmented with Maps Engine data server-side or perform client-side rendering of the vector data, allowing the developer to dynamically restyle the vector layer in response to user interactions like hover and click. In this hangout, Josh Livni demonstrates this with a map of watershed data in Northern California from the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy.'
