title: '"Shen: A Sufficiently Advanced Lisp" by Aditya Siram'
language: English
recordingDate: 1411352829
description: "Shen is an hosted Lisp that comes with a full-featured macro system, a Prolog, an optional type system more powerful than Haskell's, and does it all in under 5000 lines of code. It has been ported to many platforms including Java, JavaScript and Ruby.\nIn the true Lisp spirit it gives complete freedom to the programmer. And this talk will introduce the language by demoing a complete web-application written in Shen that transitions effortlessly between functional, logic, and imperative styles, seamlessly intermixing macros, statically verified and dynamic code.\n\nby Aditya Siram (@deech)\n\nI am currently a web developer at Intoximeters, Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri. I do Ruby and JavaScript by day and Haskell and C by candlelight."
