title: 'David McQueen: Encouraging diversity vs. Positive discrimination'
recordingDate: 1535496048
description: "Across the business world organisations are being encouraged to take a more diverse approach to how they recruit and retain staff. As companies serve increasingly global audiences which bring their own challenges around customer service and satisfaction, people want to see themselves in the companies they buy from. \n\nThe challenge in recruiting employees from more diverse backgrounds is finding that balance between positive action as opposed to positive discrimination, and looking at diversity as a solution rather an as a problem to be solved. \n\nIn this keynote David uses cases studies to show how diversity affects product and service development and offers insights how leaders can shape their company cultures by paying attention to what works.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nStretch Leadership and Management Conference\nstretchcon.com"
