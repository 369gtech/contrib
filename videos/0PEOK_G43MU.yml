description: "In this introduction to type-level programming in Scala, we are going to discuss how we can leverage the full power of the type system to verify domain properties of an application at compile-time, instead of doing runtime verifications at the value-level.\n\nJorge Vásquez, Software developer at Scalac - Software developer focused on the backend. He had the chance to work with several technologies and programming languages across different industries, such as Telco, AdTech, and Online Education. He’s always looking to improve his skills, finding new and better ways to solve business problems. He loves functional programming, and he’s convinced it can help to make better software. Also, he’s excited about new libraries like ZIO that are making Scala FP more accessible to developers."
