description: "Towards Effective Microservice Development\n\nAgile, PM, Methodology\nDay: Tuesday \nTime: 04:20 \nRoom: 2011 \n\nMoving to a microservices architecture is not just a technology problem. With the level of tooling and support we get from Spring and platforms like Cloud Foundry, the really daunting tasks quickly move to organizational challenges. How does one find and define the organization’s shared services? What are their boundaries? How should they get distributed? In this talk we will use the Spring Framework’s great support for building services infrastructures, harness the superpowers of PaaS for scalable deployment, and combine this with Lean and Agile principles of product development to lay out a blueprint for how organizations can reason about and develop their service architectures effectively.\n\n\n\nspeakers\n \nStephan Hagemann,  Director, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
