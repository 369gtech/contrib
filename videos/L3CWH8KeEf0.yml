description: "More than anything else, the level of psychological safety determines a teams’ effectiveness, according to research by Google. Psychological safety is defined as the “shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking”. In a fast paced digital world cross functional teams often use Scrum to be able to quickly learn and adjust to customer demands. And for Scrum to work really well, psychological safety in teams enacting it should be high.\nIn this talk/workshop I will shortly dive into the theory behind team effectiveness in general and psychological safety in particular, as published by Professor Amy Edmondson and identified by Google’s Project Aristotle.\nNext to that I will share my experiences with assessing psychological safety in teams. I provide ways of measuring psychological safety, and would like to discover together with you how to foster it as a Scrum Master, Agile Coach or Agile Leader.\n\nAbout me:  I started my career as a software developer. After my fair share of working in traditionally led development projects I learned about Agile. Taken by this approach I started running through my organization and telling everybody about it. After my first experience as a Scrum Master I further spread Agile and Lean methodologies in my company as an Agile Coach. I now am an independent Agile Coach and Professional Scrum Trainer and have helped companies like ING, ABN Amro, the Dutch Railways and Ahold Delhaize. Next to a bachelors degree in Computer Science I hold a Masters degree in the Organizational Sciences.\nIn my spare time you can find me often in the woods: either on my mountainbike dodging trees or geocaching with my three kids. When I’m home I like to occasionally play some computer games and try to make a dent in my ever growing reading backlog.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/martijnvanasseldonk/"
