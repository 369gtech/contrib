description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Chicago 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nLaura Schornack - Head Department Architect at Northern Trust Corporation\nMaureen Penzenik - Data Architect at Northern Trust Corporation\n\nABSTRACT\nCut the time of application delivery by reusing Kafka data structure between projects! Expecting boundaries and data definitions to remain consistent between source and consuming projects can be a constant source of surprise - a Kafka spiderweb.\nDuplicate datasets with mutations often bring with them monetary, opportunity and reputational costs, as well as errors, inconsistencies, tech debt, reactive approach to data problems, audit issues, data ownership confusion and data that is not fit for purpose. Solving this requires moving towards uniform datasets. And this moves requires an Enterprise Domain Driven Design approach, combined with Event Storming. Doing this architecture work upfront allows for real-time, ubiquitous, distributed data implementations, as opposed to a Kafka spiderweb.\nThis talk and demo will show the design, along with a demo illustrating this approach [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:29 Agenda\n02:35 The problem\n08:34 History of data segregation within apps\n10:22 CQRS for operational systems\n11:26 DDD for a single application – Generic example\n13:14 DDD merged with event storming\n13:58 Eventing diagram\n15:56 Enterprise domain driven design\n18:42 Operational vs Data/Analytics ecosystems\n20:23 Monoliths vs Data mesh\n24:45 Summary\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2021/sessions/1761/kafka-in-the-wild\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nMaryann Kisamore • Basics Of Apache Kafka • https://amzn.to/3tkVYFD\nTed Dunning & Ellen Friedman • Streaming Architecture • https://amzn.to/3lhk3Kb\nLiz Rice • Container Security • https://amzn.to/3oU4iJe\nLiz Rice • Kubernetes Security • https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-security/9781492039075\nBrendan Burns, Joe Beda & Kelsey Hightower • Kubernetes: Up and Running • https://amzn.to/3wrtwlp\nSam Newman • Monolith to Microservices • https://amzn.to/2Nml96E\nSam Newman • Building Microservices • https://amzn.to/3dMPbOs\nRonnie Mitra & Irakli Nadareishvili • Microservices: Up and Running• https://amzn.to/3c4HmmL Mitra, Nadareishvili, McLarty & Amundsen • Microservice Architecture • https://amzn.to/3fVNAb0\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ApacheKafka #Kafka #Apache #SoftwareArchitecture #DDD #EDDD #CQRS #DataSourcing #EventStorming #EventingDiagram #DomainDrivenDesign #DataMesh\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
