description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nAutoscaling at Scale: How We Manage Capacity @ Zalando - Mikkel Larsen, Zalando SE \n\nAs of October 2019 Zalando has ~140 Kubernetes clusters varying in size from 5 to 400 nodes. This talk goes over how different applications both stateful and stateless are autoscaled using the HPA(Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) and VPA(Vertical Pod Autoscaler) and also the cluster using the Cluster Autoscaler. More specifically the talk explains the limitations and workarounds to each of these scaling strategies and also the techniques used to monitor so that applications always have sufficient capacity. It also discusses common pitfalls while scaling with these controllers and finally concludes with proposed enhancements to these controllers which would make autoscaling more reliable and efficient.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZelM"
