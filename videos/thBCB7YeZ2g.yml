That’s great news. But you’ve been getting reports of intermittent service failures that you haven’t been able to track down. It doesn’t seem to be anything else...could it be DNS? Maybe we’re not running enough DNS pods or they are restarting too frequently?  This talk will explain how to actually measure DNS health for your Kubernetes cluster and properly plan its capacity. We will share some specific mechanisms to gather DNS traffic information per service both with some standard Linux tools and systematically with eBPF. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UafQ"
