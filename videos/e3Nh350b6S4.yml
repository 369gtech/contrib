description: "When a customer comes to us with a complaint that their code is running slowly, our first question has become, \"Are you using Promises?\". When they predictably tell us yes, our response has become, \"You're likely using them wrong\".\n\n\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the various ways Promises are abused. We'll talk about why that ends up needlessly slowing Node.js applications down. And we'll talk about how to use Promises correctly, the way they were intended to be used.\n\n\n\nExpect code, opinions, and colorful charts.\n\n\n\nEVENT:\nNodeJS Interactive 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nJames Snell, NearForm\n\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish NodeJS Interactive talks.\n\n\nCREDITS: \n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV-u_Ow47s0"
