recordingDate: 1506608069
description: "The year is 2030 and between your house, your car, and all your gadgets are connected to the web. Wait. That’s today. If all we do is connected to the web today, what does that look like 20 years from now? With the rate of integration increasing at a blazing rate, what does this mean to our personal and online security? How will we be able to leverage machine learning into this and at what point does machine learning become too powerful? These are all questions we’ll have to face over the upcoming decade.\n\nIn this session we’ll look at the current threat landscape of the web and Drupal and how it is set to change over the coming decade. With more and more sites becoming integration hubs to data and devices, the threat footprint is increasing rapidly. If we are implementing Drupal at the center of our platforms, it places an even larger target on it as an access point to more services and data.\n\nAdditionally, as the security threat increases, how do the smaller businesses and agencies keep up? Where do they find the time and budget to stay secure?\n\nHeadless Drupal and integrated systems\n\nHow IoT is turning into IoHT (Internet of Hackable things) and how do we keep it from turning on us\n\nHow agencies can protect their clients with increased security\n\nEvolving compliance requirements"
