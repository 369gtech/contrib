description: "Web development libraries for Clojure have started to mature, but there are still quite a few gaps. Although there has been some activity in securing Clojure web applications, there has not been much of an effort into documenting the options or even explaining what should be done. This includes authentication and password management, securing application responses and options, as well as code review and deployment.\n\nJoin Aaron as he walks through what is available, what is coming, and what does not yet exist in any open and consumable fashion. These are ideas that every production Clojure web application should embrace."
