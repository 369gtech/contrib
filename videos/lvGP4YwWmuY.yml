description: "by Thomas Vanderstraeten\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/hey.webm\n\n\nAt Hey, we're building a new breed of social network based on the Blockchain. As most main Blockchains present scalability issues (e.g. Etherem scales at 20 transactions/s), we have decided to run our decentralised application on a so-called sidechain, which is an offspring of the Ethereum mainchain and which enables us to scale to the throughput required to support the rich interactions happening within a social network. Come and discover the specific architectural peculiarities that it takes to run a decentralised application on a sidechain. We will be discussing the following elements about building an on-chain social network:\n- Scalability (volume and throughput)\n- UX vs Security in fostering users adoption\n- Loom, an L2 scaling solution on which Hey's sidechain is running\n- Deep-dive on Hey's architectural peculiarities\n- How to move assets from a sidechain to the Ethereum mainchain \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:20:00+01"
