He is also passionate about open source, and is a maintainer of Benchee and the Elixir track on exercism.io. Away from the computer he's a husband, father and chess player.\n\nIt's a small world\n\nSmall-world networks are a phenomenon that can be found throughout the natural world, from the brains of nematodes to the social graphs of Facebook and Twitter. These networks exist in our code as well, and choosing to model our systems as small-world networks yields significant benefits for the comprehensibility and sustainability of our code. Come learn just what these small-world networks are, how we can spot them in our code, and why theyâ€™re good for us to consider for our application design."
