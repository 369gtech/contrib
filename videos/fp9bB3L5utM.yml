description: "Azure Functions, Microsoft’s serverless offering, allow developers to focus on their code and not be concerned with infrastructure or DevOps. And thanks to a slew of built-in integrations, it's also easy to have your functions get and send data to various services or even be triggered by events in those services. One such integration is with Azure Cosmos DB, the multi-model, globally distributed NoSQL data service. Cosmos DB exposes data as documents that you can access via SQL, JavaScript MongoDB or Cassandra as well as graph and key-value store. In this session, you'll see how easily you can build an API from a set of Azure Functions that interact with Cosmos DB documents and some other services. We’ll go all cross-platform with Visual Studio Code and Node JS.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
