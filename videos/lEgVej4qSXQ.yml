description: 'Kanban is an evolution of organization. No hard decisions, big investments, transition periods, no cultural shock to team members. It simply provides a way to see what is happening in a project. You might not like what you see initially, but one step at a time it allows rearranging the processes and mindsets towards delivery oriented, highly efficient, wasteless production that ensures continuous value stream.'
