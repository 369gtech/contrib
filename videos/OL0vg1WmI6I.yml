We'll talk about electronics, sensors, AI, computer vision and of course, the software that ties everything together.\nWe'll introduce you into the world of self driving cars and compare our solution to the stuff that is done in the big leagues by the likes of Tesla's 'autopilot' and Waymo's self driving cars.
