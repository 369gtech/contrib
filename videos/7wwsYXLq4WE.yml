title: 'YOW! 2016 Lisa Montgomery - Hope is not a Strategy - Not even for Career Management'
recordingDate: 1488937524
description: "Personal career management is much like project management, and the same things that trip us up in the technical realm – formulation, resource allocation, estimation, risk assessment – are also too often absent from our thinking about our own career development. How might we benefit from applying our technical thinking to what we normally think of as a soft topic? What lightweight approaches may help us better achieve personal goals?\n\nLisa Montgomery’s interest is helping smart people do hard things better. Early in her career she guided academically at-risk students as they learned to wrangle language, and later at NASA she guided the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) Software Assurance Research Program (SARP) into being an applied, agency award-winning program. She is a history geek, turned educator, who was seduced to the dark-side by computer science (it had more caffeine and cooler tee shirts). She is currently a strategist for Ovation Solutions LLC.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
