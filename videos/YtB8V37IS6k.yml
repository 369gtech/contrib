title: 'Groovy Parallel Patterns: A Library to Support Parallelization'
recordingDate: 1472810402
description: 'Much has been written concerning the use of Parallel Design Patterns and Skeletal Frameworks but few, if any, have then converted the ideas contained into software products that can be used in the deployment of such parallel systems. The Patterns and Skeletons so far proposed still require the programmer to have a great deal of understanding of parallel systems design. The Communicating Process Architecture community has been producing reusable plug and play components that can be used to build parallel systems based upon Hoareâ€™s Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) theory for more than 30 years using various languages. These ideas are now integrated into the Library described in this paper. The presntation will give an overview of the library using Monte Carlo pi and Concnordance as primary examples together with a more challenging examples using Primes and the Goldbach Conjecture and the Mandelbrot set.
