description: "How to Create Kubernetes Experts - Clarke Vennerbeck & Aaron Teague, Supergiant \n\nEffective knowledge transfer is critical for the continued survival of Kubernetes end-users (and projects).    Rapid growth and adoption of Kubernetes has left a growing demand for operators and developers unmet. In addition, an ever-growing catalog of OSS has sprung up along with Kubernetes, expanding the qualifications needed to operate in an enterprise-worthy fashion.    Our company has dealt with this challenge by changing the way we acquire Kubernetes talent--by building experts in house, sometimes from little to no experience. With good training and committed participants, this is achievable for anyone!    Learn tactics, approaches, and practical tips to training teams with any skill level, creating new generations of Kubernetes experts! \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZn"
