description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nGoing Containerless with WebAssembly - Kevin Hoffman, Capital One \n\nWebAssembly is the future of distributed computing. This session explains what WebAssembly is, how it works outside the browser, and why people at a cloud conference should take notice. Attendees will learn how, with the use of a few open source projects, building functions and services in WebAssembly can be easier, faster, and more secure than building traditional services. Demonstrations will include building systems that engage in low-level, RPC-style communication between the runtime host and guest module, then advancing to the examination of a host runtime written in Rust that dynamically and securely binds zero-trust WebAssembly functions and services with high-privilege capability plugins like message broker providers, key-value stores, and more (also written in WebAssembly!).\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zer1"
