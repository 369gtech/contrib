But abstractions work as a spectrum also. We'll look at how we can adjust our view of abstractions and what kind of examples we can use to better understand that abstractions have less to do with programming and more to do with where we deploy.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nðŸ¥‡ Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk â†’ https://www.stackhawk.com/\nAttest â†’ https://www.askattest.com/careers\nIonic â†’ https://ionicframework.com/\nTidelift â†’ https://tidelift.com/\nSentry â†’ https://sentry.io/\n\nðŸ¥ˆ Silver Sponsors\nStudio 3T â†’ https://studio3t.com/\nMaersk â†’ https://www.maersk.com/careers\nHasura â†’ https://hasura.io/"
