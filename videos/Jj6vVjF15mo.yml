description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nPanel: Beyond Codes of Conduct: Igniting Diversity in Your Community - Jemma Bolland, The Scale Factory; Lara Owen, Github; Shanis Windland, VMware; & Kevin Stewart, Independent \n\nThere’s diversity – and then there’s inclusion. The difference between being invited and being a valued participant is vast. The Kubernetes and KubeCon community have made significant strides on both the diversity and inclusion front – but should not be satisfied with progress to date. Join this panel of thought leaders to learn how to turn a diverse community into an inclusive one, hear the challenges of building versus changing a culture, and how to ignite the power of diversity where you contribute. How does the KubeCon/K8s community continue to lead the way in both diversity AND inclusion? Time to fill the dance floor. It's still too empty. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaWK"
