description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJesper Richter Reichhelm - Head of Engineering at Wooga\nPatrick Huesler - Software Engineer at Wooga\n\nABSTRACT\nAt Wooga we are creating the next generation of social games. To be truly social, a game needs to offer real interaction between players in various forms. What started with simple, asynchronous gift requests is evolving into real time interactions between players. We are experiencing a renaissance of multiplayer games, giving us the opportunity to look into problems that have been solved over a decade ago, such as network architectures, communication protocols, latency and connection loss. And we now leverage that knowledge to bring multiplayer games to the mobile world.\n\nIn our talk we'll cover this evolution of user interaction in our games, what technical problems they posed and how we solved them.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
