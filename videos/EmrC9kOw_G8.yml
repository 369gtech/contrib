description: "GoWayFest 4.0, Online â€“ July 11-12, 2020\n\nspaGO: a work-in-progress yet ready-to-use library for ML/NLP,  Matteo Grella\n\nAre you loving Go? But you're having an affair with NLP? From today, Gophers can exploit the potential of state-of-the-art NLP technologies without moving to other languages (and without the burden of DL frameworks).\nIn this talk, I will introduce spaGO, a work-in-progress yet ready-to-use library for ML/NLP, written entirely in Go. \nI'll examine the library's main packages, providing a quick overview of the bases for the computational-graph and the implementation of the most famous neural models (e.g. MLP, LSTM, BERT), up to their application in natural language processing tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition and Question-Answering."
