description: "The secret of life lies in our DNA. From Mendel to discovering the double helix structure of the DNA to decoding Chromosone 22 to the completion of the Human Genome Project, innovations in the field of molecular biology and genetics have empowered humanity with great powers to change and save lives. Whether by accelerating the pace of sequencing DNA data, using machine learning to edit offending genetics, or blocking a gene from functioning, big data processing, machine learning, and AI are changing the game on the state of the art in molecular biology and genetics.\n\nVijay Narayanan takes you on an inspiring journey exploring how the cloud, data, and artificial intelligence are powering and accelerating the genomic revolutionâ€”saving and changing lives in the process.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Microsoft.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
