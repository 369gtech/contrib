description: 'In this lesson we talk about a git clone and lots of git pulls afterwards and how we create new branches for every new task and then pull requests that either get accepted or rejected. Now, after the clone, we mentioned git pull, as we always want to have the latest version of the project with ours and others changes in it, before we create a new branch. So, every time we create a new branch, it''s our duty to have the latest version to avoid conflicts.'
