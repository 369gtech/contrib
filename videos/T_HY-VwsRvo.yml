description: "by Thorsten Behrens\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UB4.136/libreoffice_lockdown_and_encryption_improvements.webm\n\nLibreOffice has builtin support for working with encrypted documents since a long time (with some recent improvements adding OpenPGP support). Further support for more fine-grained control of ❮em❯what❮/em❯ a user can do with access-restricted documents was though missing.\nCome and see what recent improvements we implemented for LibreOffice 6.4 and 6.5, to permit fine-grained access controls to individual LibreOffice documents, matching the feature set of MS Rights Management Solution.\n\nRoom: UB4.136\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 11:00:00"
