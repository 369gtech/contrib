recordingDate: 1456226139
description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nSpeed, scale, query: can NoSQL give us all three?\n\nThe NoSQL movement promised availability, redundancy, speed and more but query was always the poor relation. Now, non-relational databases are increasingly attempting to fix the problem of query. In this talk, we?ll survey the non-relational landscape to understand where different NoSQL databases have strengths and which use cases each type suits best. Then we?ll look at the different strategies the leading NoSQL databases are taking to solve them problem of rich query in a world that previously saw poor query as a necessary trade-off. You?ll get an overview of how the data model of NoSQL databases shapes what is possible in terms of query and what trade-offs the architecture of those databases brings out. Can we really have scale, speed and queryability all from one database?\n\nArun Gupta, Couchbase\n\nArun Gupta is the vice president of developer advocacy at Couchbase.
