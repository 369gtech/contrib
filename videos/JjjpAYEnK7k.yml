description: "DjangoCon US 2018 - Elasticsearch: Accelerating the Django Admin by Kate Kligman\n\nThe Django Admin offers quick solutions and rapid feature development for new websites. But as your website expands, and datasets grow, it can become unwieldy and slow. Enter Elasticsearch: an easy way to quickly accelerate your Django administration tools and searches.\n\nAt Grove Collaborative, weâ€™ve experimented with Elasticsearch technology and developed reusable patterns that brought new life to our aging Django administration system. This presentation will teach you how to leverage easy Elasticsearch wins while avoiding common pitfalls."
