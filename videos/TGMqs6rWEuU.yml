description: 'If it takes minutes to code a bot, building professional bots represents quite a challenge. Soon you realize you need serious programming and API architecture experience but also “Bot” specific skills. In this session, we''ll first show the basics to build a ChatBot. Then we''ll explore the challenges faced when creating advanced Bots (Context storage, NLP approaches, Bot Metadata, OAuth scopes), and discuss interesting opportunities from latest industry trends (Bot platforms, Serverless, Microservices). This talk is about showing the code and sharing lessons learnt.'
