description: "This session discusses the identity model, the services architecture, and the use cases and assumptions that led to the development of JSR 351, the Java Identity API. The presentation describes the integration of identity repositories in the services architecture and the facilities and interfaces provided in support of identity consumption, propagation, and composition. It also describes the protection mechanisms of the API, their role in protecting identity data from unauthorized access, and their use in establishing the identities of privileged actors. The session includes demonstrations of the use of the programmatic and annotation-based API to interact with identity repositories via the Nobis attribute service.\n\n\nAuthor:\nRonald Monzillo\nJava EE and Servlet Security Architect.
