description: "Deploying applications in the cloud mean a lot of new possibilities but also challenges. Modular applications bring even greater deployment flexibility. In this session, you will learn how to use basic infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to enable autoscaling and automated failover and recovery and how to deal with hot, zero-downtime updates. The speakers have been doing this in a large project for the past two years. In the presentation, they share their experiences in using an open source OSGi-based development and runtime stack.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMarcel Offermans\nMarcel is a fellow at Luminis and the Director at Luminis Technologies. As a software architect he has a broad experience in different operating systems, languages and applications, ranging from enterprise applications to mobile, embedded and distributed systems. He has been involved in lots of commercial OSGi projects for over ten years and is responsible for the architecture, development and support of an OSGi and cloud based software provisioning product. Currently, he is working on the Amdatu Platform. He is also a member of the Apache Software Foundation and involved as a committer and PMC member in the Apache Felix, Apache ACE and Apache Celix projects.\n\nMarcel regularly speaks at conferences such as ApacheCon, EclipseCon, JavaOne, OSGi DevCon, FOSDEM, Devoxx, NLJUG and various local demo camps and user forums and has given several hands-on trainings on OSGi related subjects.\nView more trainings by Marcel Offermans at https://www.parleys.com/author/marcel-offermans-2\n\nPaul Bakker\nPaul is a software architect for Luminis Technologies. His current focus is on building modular enterprise applications and the cloud. He believes that modularity and the cloud are the two main challenges we have to deal with to bring technology to the next level, and is working on making this possible for mainstream software development. Today he is working on educational software focussed on personalised learning for high school students in the Netherlands. He is also responsible for pushing technology forward. Luminis strongly believes in open source and all the technology development they are doing happens in the open source community. Paul is an active contributor on projects such as Amdatu, Apache ACE, JBoss Forge and BndTools. \n\nHe has a background as trainer on Java related technology and is a regular speaker on conferences such as JavaOne, Devoxx and JFokus.\nView more trainings by Paul Bakker at https://www.parleys.com/author/paul-bakker-4\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
