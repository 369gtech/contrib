Attendees will hear how to present the results of their data science, projects or analysis and drive their audience to act on those results. My experience with presenting my work in data science to people who then became inspired to act on that work, when they initially didn’t want to listen. I call this “The Persuasion Equation”. It's how I found a way to make my voice heard within an organisation, and it’s the difference between insights and action.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
