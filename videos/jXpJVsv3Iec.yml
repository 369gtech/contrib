description: "We need to explain Technical Debt to people who are not technical, partly so that they can make better choices because they understand the real trade-offs, and partly to so that we understand it better too. Some of the tension between trying to get product out and developing something you can live with is an essential feature of trying to do anything new, but some is the result of a mismatch of understanding between Product and Development. \n\nThe metaphor of debt does not really convey the risks that arise from poor technical quality. Instead, I will introduce some other metaphors for looking at technical risk that we think match the problem more effectively, and propose some strategies to help product and development teams approach a solution. This is joint work with Chris Matts.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2018, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
