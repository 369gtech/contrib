description: "Apple just announced its new iPhone XS so expect the demand for it to be massive! We can use a special reinforcement learning algorithm called policy iteration to help Apple manage it's retail inventory and make sure that the demand meets supply, I’ll explain how in this video. We'll assume the role of an AI savvy retail manager for Apple in San Francisco and discuss policy iteration as a solution to our problem. Dynamic programming and real world use cases, enjoy!\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/iphone_xs_supply_chain\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
