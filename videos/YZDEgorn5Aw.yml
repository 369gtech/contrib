title: 'Jamming with a Quantum Computer: A musical journey into quantum computing by James Weaver'
recordingDate: 1550058156
description: "Musical improvisation is the creative activity of composing music \"in the moment\" while performing it, often in a jam session with other musicians. Although composing and performing music is a creative process, the underlying musical style informs the probabilities of note and rhythmic choices that the musician makes.\n\nIn this session, James will give an introduction to quantum computing, cover a bit of music theory, and demonstrate how a quantum computer can compose music and participate in a musical jam session. He will then discuss the development and implementation of the Quantum Music Composer application on real quantum computers."
