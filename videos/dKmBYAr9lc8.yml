description: 'Building and deploying an analytic service on Cloud is a challenge. A bigger challenge is to maintain the service. In a world where users are gravitating towards a model where cluster instances are to provisioned on the fly, in order for these to be used for analytics or other purposes, and then to have these cluster instances shut down when the jobs get done, the relevance of containers and container orchestration is more important than ever.
