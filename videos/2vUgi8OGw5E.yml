Any organisation that tells you that it is \"doing Agile\" ISN'T doing Agile. I noticed the first as I was growing up during the Cold War. The second truth I've discovered in the last few years working as a consultant for ThoughtWorks.\n\nHow do you teach Agile to a group of people who think they are already doing Agile? How do you explain to a business that thinks that \"Agile doesn't work\" that the reason why it isn't working is because IT has to change as well as the technology group? How do you even begin to do this when everybody you meet thinks that they've \"tried this all before, it just doesn't work here!\"\n\nWe've worked under these conditions and we've had success in effecting real change both at ground level and throughout the wider business. In this talk I'll share some techniques that we've successfully used.\n\n \nJames Birnie \nFrom Thoughtworks\nI started working in software delivery in the late 1990s when TDD was something you studied but never did and a pipeline was something for carrying oil. In 2005 I joined a startup and started to feel I could really make a difference. After nearly 10 years I moved on to a career in consultancy with ThoughtWorks. After 3 years I still feel like every day is different. I'm constantly meeting great people, learning new things, finding new challenges and helping to solve different problems."
