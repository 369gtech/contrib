description: "When I started in IT the roles were clearly separated. Business Analysts wrote requirements, Architects designed them, Programmers wrote the code, Testers tested the software.\n\nOver the last decade or so we have seen a shift towards “generalising specialists” who can cut code, understand a business domain, design a user interface, participate in and automate some of the testing and deployment activities, and who are sometimes even responsible for the health and wellbeing of their own systems in production.\n\nTo succeed in this new world requires more than “3 years of Java”. The modern developer needs to be constantly reinventing themselves, learning, and helping others to do the same. In this session, Dan explores some of the skills and characteristics of the modern developer, and suggests some ways you can grow them for yourself.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
