description: "Many people know that Kubernetes can report API activity to logging back ends and that auditing is a powerful security tool, but what happens in the real world when you have:\n\n- Multiple API servers\n- Mutating Admission Controller Webhooks\n- Aggregated APIs\n- Webhook audit log backends\n- Massive API throughput requirements\n\nThe short answer is, things get tricky.
