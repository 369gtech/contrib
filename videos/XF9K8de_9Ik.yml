recordingDate: 1575477019
description: 'Yr is the world''s 5th largest weather service. Adored by millons, hated by commercial weather networks, used by weather frustrated Norwegians as well as farmers in South Africa, and being a service for the people funded by the people. Yr is trying to redefine how people view the weather, with world class weather visualization, A LOT of prototyping and crazy ideas. I''m here to talk about our awesome journey, the techy details and the painstaking process of working with a really hetrogenous user group.'
