description: "This panel discusses how web developers will get access to phone functionality such as the address book and the camera, as well as access to payment systems that tie in with the mobile operator. These APIs are fairly new, and they represent a new kind of functionality that simply wasn't there before, so we're expecting a lively discussion. This panel, including Dominique Hazael-Massieux, Daniel Appelquist and Brian LeRoux, is moderated by Jeremy Keith.\n\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
