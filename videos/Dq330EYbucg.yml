description: "Cat Allman\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/143/\n\"Open\" is a concept that has spread far beyond software engineering, into government, data, publishing and science. In parallel, the world is embracing \"making\" as methodology, avocation and profession. Google has had an Open Source Programs Office for more than ten years, but our Making & Science team, an offshoot of the open source team, is just 2 years old. Come hear about what we're up to and why Google has a small (but mighty!) team working to support making and science, inside the company and out. I will also illustrate how the meme is spreading by sharing some of my favorite open science and STEAM ED programs."
