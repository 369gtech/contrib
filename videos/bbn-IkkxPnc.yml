title: 'ScalaSphere: Your deployment in SBT by Gabriel Asman'
recordingDate: 1572429360
description: "SBT builds. It says right there in the name. That’s how we conventionally think of our favorite build tool. It fetches dependencies, compiles our code, and outputs ..err .. a JAR file?\n\nEverything else you need in order to deploy? Building & publishing a docker image, tagging your release, updating the version. That’s your job. Or, more likely, your CI/CD pipeline’s job.\n\nIt doesn’t necessarily need to be like that. Using the sbt-native-packager and sbt-release SBT plugins, I’m going to present one team’s approach in using SBT to declaratively encode our deployment steps."
