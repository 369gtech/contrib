description: "It's not always clear to developers the boundaries between native Web Components and Polymer. What does the library add? What's already built into the platform? This talk aims to demystify Polymer by peeling back the cover to explain how the internals work and show how they complement existing APIs. We cover the basics of building vanilla Web Components using the new v1 specs, and demonstrate new features in Polymer 2.0 that make the whole process more efficient.\n\nFind out more here: \nPolymer 2.0 preview branch: https://github.com/polymer/polymer/tree/2.0-preview\nPolymer 2.0 Preview blog post: https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/2016-09-09-polymer-2.0\n\nMissed the summit?
