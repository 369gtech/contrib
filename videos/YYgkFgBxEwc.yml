title: 'Serenity-JS: next generation acceptance testing for Angular-JS in TypeScript by John Smart/Jan Molak'
language: English
recordingDate: 1478672153
description: "Are your web tests hard to read and hard to maintain? Does their reporting leave something to be desired? Do you have trouble scaling your test suite? Indeed, these are common issues faced by teams working with automated web tests.\n\nThe Screenplay pattern (https://dzone.com/articles/page-objects-refactored-solid-steps-to-the-screenp) presents an innovative answer to these problems, built around readability, reusability and solid design principles. More than just a simple design pattern, the Screenplay pattern represents the next step in writing articulate, declarative tests using a highly expressive DSL.\n\nIn this talk we will demonstrate Serenity-JS, a TypeScript implementation of Serenity BDD that lets you test your Angular-JS apps using the Screenplay pattern, and also benefit from the powerful reporting features provided by Serenity BDD. Combining the advantages of Protractor, the expressive Screenplay DSL in TypeScript, and the powerful reporting features of Serenity BDD, Serenity-JS is set to become the tool of choice for your Angular-JS automated testing!\n\nJohn Smart is a London-based international speaker, consultant, author and trainer well known in the Agile community for his many books, articles and presentations, particularly in areas such as BDD, TDD, test automation, software craftsmanship and team collaboration.\n\nJohn helps organisations and teams around the world deliver better software sooner through more effective collaboration and communication techniques, and through better technical practices.\n\nJohn is the author of the best-selling BDD in Action, as well as Jenkins: The Definitive Guide and Java Power Tools. Very active in the Open Source community, John also leads development on the innovative Serenity BDD test automation library.\n\nJan Molak is a full-stack developer and coach who spent last 12 years building and shipping software ranging from best-selling, award-winning AAA video games through high-traffic websites and web apps to search engines, complex event processing and financial systems.
