description: "Test Driven Alerting: Now with More Data Science! [I]- Rick Farmer & Diego Lapiduz, Pivotal    \n\nDev & Ops professionals everywhere are threatened by a plague. \nAlert fatigue is sweeping the planet.\nThe sheer enormity of the logs and metrics flooding out of the Cloud Foundry firehouse, by comparison, makes finding the needle in the haystack child's play. How can we identify and react to the truly critical events and notify the right people?\nIn this talk we will present a test-driven framework for creating anomaly detectors while continuously filtering out the junk. Sean will discuss creating alert dashboards that matter to you. Rick will provide strategies for identifying the correct model based on common metric patterns.\nProactive alerting enables you to focus on responsive automation for the important things. We’ll get you ready for autonomous system remediation and global bursting.\n\n\nRick Farmer\nPivotal\nGalveston Island, Texas\nWebsiterickfarmer.com\nRick Farmer (Pivotal) is driven to solve business challenges for the most valuable organizations in the world.
