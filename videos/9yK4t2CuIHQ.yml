description: "JavaScript is evolving quickly. New versions of ECMAScript are now released on a yearly basis with new features going through a 4-stage proposal process. But with tooling like Babel, we can leverage functionality slated for future versions right now to write even clearer and more concise JavaScript code. Familiarity with modern JavaScript will help you get the most of this session where we’ll discuss new features such as class properties, null property accessing, and more. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t understand all of those terms — you soon will after this session!\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBen Ilegbodu, Principal Frontend Engineer, Eventbrite\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video."
