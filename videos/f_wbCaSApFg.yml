description: "A stairway costs over $100,000 each year because it turns left instead of right; a Gulp process trapped an engineer for almost a year; and a million laptop fan hurricanes were launched with a pink, flowery crank. All around us, the Hidden World steals our money, time, and energy when we're not paying attention.\n\nWe build empires with JavaScript, but without fully understanding what we care about, how do we know which way to go next, or what our choices really cost? \n\nIn this talk from our July 2018 event, Jacques Favreau (@betaorbust) shares stories of messing up at scale, offering advice on how you can avoid paying the Hidden World in your own projects!"
