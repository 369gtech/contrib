description: "\"Speakers: Philip James, Asheesh Laroia\n\nAccount security means making sure your users are only ones who can access their accounts. Account takeovers happen for a variety of reasons -- password re-use, compromised computers, guessable passwords, and more. This talk gives you concepts and concrete skills that will help you identify and prevent account takeovers and limit the damage. Itâ€™s inspired by practices in use at GitHub, Google, and the Python Package Index.\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
