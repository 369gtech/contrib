description: "We overload our terms a lot in this industry. \"Coupling\" is one such. That word covers situations ranging from essential to accidental to comical to cosmic. Coupling seems to be the root of all ills. It is the molasses that slows our every move. And yet, in the industry from which we borrowed the term, \"coupling\" was not a dirty word. It meant something ingenious. Let us contemplate coupling for a time and see what we can do about it.\n\nMichael Nygard is the Vice President of Customer Solutions at Cognitect. Mike is the author of Release It!, and a contributor to Beautiful Architecture. Mike focuses on highly-available and scalable commerce systems but can often be found coding, writing, speaking, or thinking about how the Universe works.\n\nMike’s most recent projects at Cognitect include designing an architecture for an online P2P lending platform, advising one of the world’s largest financial services firms on their overall software direction, and designing a software defined data center for another financial services firm.\n\nMike’s background includes re-engineering and operating some of the most prominent -- and busiest --?web properties in the world, including Best Buy, American Airlines and Hyatt. Mike also architected the software used to process 60% of all school photos in the US.
