description: "In this session, we will set up IntelliJ IDEA for maximum productivity and less distraction step by step. You'll learn how to clear the view, set better defaults and other useful options and shortcuts for a minimalistic IDE setup. From editing and navigation to working with version control, we will tune the IDE to have a better development experience.\n\nWe will explore some newly added features as well as discover some that always were there, but you didnâ€™t know.\n\nRemove the clutter from your IDE and achieve coding zen.\n\n# Victor Kropp\nVictor is a Software Developer at JetBrains, where he participated in many projects including ReSharper, dotCover, Hub, Toolbox App and other. In his free time Victor runs marathons and long-distance triathlons or hikes in the Alps with his wife and son."
