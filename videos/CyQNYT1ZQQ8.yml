description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPractical Kubernetes Monitoring with Prometheus - Michael Friedrich, GitLab\n\nMonitoring for microservices and distributed workloads isn’t an easy task. Imagine that you become responsible after years of traditional service monitoring. You start your research - Kubernetes as a container orchestrator already is a complex ecosystem to understand. Join this talk for a journey on the first steps, best practices with Prometheus, Grafana and the Prometheus Operator. The adventure does not stop here: Use client libraries to instrument your own application with metrics, deploy it to Kubernetes and what now? Explore how service discovery, long term storage with Thanos/Cortex and alerting help complete cloud native monitoring. It’s also an iterative process, with new workloads, changes, and a constant work in progress. This talk will help prepare you for cold winters and hot summers, silencing alerts before they exist. Spoiler: The end will peek into observability with logs, traces and SLOs, and show monitoring use cases on GitLab.com SaaS."
