title: 'Fred George - Chaos Development: Removing software as the inhibitor of Agile (hands-on session)'
recordingDate: 1558443083
description: "Chaos Engineering refers to system design techniques for a robust system that tolerates change. But changing requirements also occurs throughout the development of a system as well. Chaos Development refers to techniques that readily accommodate (inevitable) changes in requirements during a project.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will address two radically different techniques for Chaos Development:\r\n\r\nMyriads of small classes for legacy systems exploiting the engineering practices of XP, and\r\nMicroServices for the new class of fuzzy problems typical in recommendation engines and other business processes.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss the results of these techniques in specific projects, including implementations in a replacement system for pension plans, enhancement to a legacy DB-driven system, and an animation of a MicroService solution for a recommendation engine. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/keJX6dzr85d"
