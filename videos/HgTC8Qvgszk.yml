recordingDate: 1537924240
description: "Kurt Scherer and Craig Knott, Atlassian\n\nThis talk will be a technical walkthrough of how we built out an infrastructure in AWS using industry open-source tooling (like Packer, Ansible, and Terraform) to build stateless instances that run our antiquated applications and how the CI/CD pipeline allows for rollouts in a reliable way. Because these products are business critical (like billing services), it was quintessential to have a solid migration plan.\n\nI'll cover the before architecture, the goal, the migration, the end architecture, the upgrade build and deployment process, and the monitoring and alerting taxonomy. I'll share what worked and what didn't and the complications (and outages) along the way.\n\nThe goal is to give any SRE the knowledge needed to be confident to perform this type of migration themselves.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
