description: "Observable Streams are a common abstraction over pretty much everything that moves and/or changes. Discussing abstract concepts might be pretty difficult. Therefore, in this talk, we're gonna find metaphors of RX (Reactive Extensions) concepts in the surrounding world! We'll be looking for occurrences of Observables, Observable Streams, Hot and Cold ones, Subscriptions, different types of Subjects and ways to deal with Backpressure.\n\nThe speech took on 8th May 2019 on Fullstack Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n\n#FullStack #SoftwareEngineering #Tech"
