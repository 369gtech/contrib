title: '"Collecting information with care" - Opal Symes (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579223911
description: "Opal Symes\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/71/\n\nHow do you sign up to a website, if you don't have a first name? Or a name that doesn't fit in 30 characters?\r\nHow are you supposed to buy an airline ticket if the gender on your passport isn't available on the dropdown?\r\n\r\nI will cover how to build forms so that they can handle these stress cases. By asking the right questions, in the right way, and supporting the full range of answers; we can build forms that collect the required information without excluding users.\r\n\r\nI will explore these forms through a series of real-world scenarios. I'll discuss the needs of the application, how to collect the right information, store it, and display it. I will also cover how to protect vulnerable users and their privacy by noting what information should not be readily available.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
