description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Chaos Engineering Day 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nKris Beevers - Founder and CEO at NS1\n\nABSTRACT\nThrough the lens of DNS - the first touchpoint between audiences and applications - we'll examine how application networking has grown in complexity to address reliability and security risks and solve for increasingly dynamic and distributed footprints.\nThe future will take a turn - collapsing application networking complexity into the audience footprint to distribute the risk surface, crush blast radius, and drive a return to dumb pipes [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:51 There are lots of risks inherent in internet facing DNS\n03:34 Mitigating risks results in DNS infrastructure complexity\n04:16 More broadly: Optimization = Network complexity\n06:28 This isn't going to get better\n08:34 Converging the network's \"smarts\" at the audience edge\n10:39 Then what happens to risk?\n12:09 Fewer levers, more expressiveness, dumber pipes\n14:38 Real world example - Envoy Mobile\n15:49 Real world example - NS1 Extended Edge\n17:52 Moving application traffic smarts to audience = leverage for scale\n18:39 Outro\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.us/chaos-day-2021/sessions/1711/converging-applications-and-audiences-the-return-to-dumb-pipes-security-chaos-engineering-pushing-security-from-theory-to-practice\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nShortridge & Rinehart • Security Chaos Engineering • https://www.verica.io/sce-book\nNora Jones & Casey Rosenthal • Chaos Engineering • https://www.verica.io/book\nNora Jones & Casey Rosenthal • Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/3hUmuAH\nMikolaj Pawlikowski • Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/2SQ5Olf\nRuss Miles • Learning Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/3hCiUe8\nMurphy, Beyer, Jones & Petoff • Site Reliability Engineering • https://amzn.to/2Vg6Mbr\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ChaosEngineering #SRE #DNS #GameDay #Production #SSH #Container #Security #SecurityChaosEngineering\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
