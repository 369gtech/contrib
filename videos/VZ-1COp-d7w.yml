recordingDate: 1407438006
description: "We want an algorithm that can search a path whose edges are weighted. Weighted edges indicate how difficult it is to travel along a path. By keeping track of how far we've traveled so far, we can make sure we always take the lowest cost path.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/graph-dijkstra\n\nNew video every Thursday.
