description: 'Learn how to take part in Java technology evolution through the Java Community Process (JCP) program. You can participate as an individual, corporation, or nonprofit such as a Java user group (JUG). This session outlines why and how to participate in the JCP Program. You will also learn about the global Adoption programs and how you can participate in the programs. We will discuss details such as how to run hack days, collaborate with other JUG leads on Adopt-a-JSR activities, and review use cases from other JUGs around the world contributing to the Java EE 7 and Java SE 8 JSRs. Currently there are new JSRs being submitted and developed for the Java EE 8 and Java SE 9 platforms. Find out how you have contribute to the future editions of the Java Standard and Java Enterprise Editions.'
