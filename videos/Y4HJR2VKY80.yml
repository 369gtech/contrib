recordingDate: 1551277693
description: "You have a great new idea for a web application that you want to build with React. Awesome! Now comes your first technical question - \"which component types do I use?\". In this talk Eyal reviews the different types of React components, compares their APIs, their use-cases and the best part - puts them 'toe to toe' against each other to see which one has the best performance.\n\nBio:\nEyal has been hitting the JS scene since the evil days of Prototype (that thing that came before jQuery) but finally found his true love - React! Eyal is a Team Leader at Wix and loves helping people overcome problems with their code & product."
