title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Red Team Village - Mathy Vanhoef - Protecting WiFi Beacons from Outside Forgeries'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597890494
description: 'In this presentation, we demonstrate several attacks that are possible by spoofing Wi-Fi beacons. These beacons are periodically broadcasted by an access point to announce the presence of a network. Our attacks include, for example, reducing the throughput of nearby devices and lowering their transmission power. In the second part of the presentation, we describe a scheme to protect Wi-Fi beacons, discuss its properties, and demonstrate its implementation in Linux.'
