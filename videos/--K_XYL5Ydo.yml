description: "\"A chaos experiment a day, keeping the outage away\" by Yan Cui\nYou might have heard about chaos engineering in the context of Netflix and Amazon, and how they kill EC2 servers in production at random to verify that their systems can stay up in the face of infrastructure failures. But did you know that the same ideas can be applied to serverless applications? Yes, despite not having access to the underlying servers, we can still apply principles of chaos engineering to uncover failure modes in our system (and there are plenty!) so we can build defence against them and make our serverless applications more robust and more resilient!"
