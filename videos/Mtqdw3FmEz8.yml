description: "by Sami Ahlroos\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2214/mysql_k8s.webm\n\nRunning databases in Kubernetes has come a long way.\n\n\nFocusing on MySQL, we will explore the challenges and issues of running production databases in Kubernetes. We'll look at the opportunities and benefits of running in Kubernetes too.\nWhile rolling out a database is easy enough, things can get interesting when production tasks are undertaken.\nHow do you achieve scaling – whether that's scaling up or down? How do you know that your latest backup will restore safely?\nWe will also take a look at an open source solution for monitoring your database deployments, adding support for Kubernetes as a robust production environment.\nFocusing on MySQL, we will explore the challenges and issues of running production databases in Kubernetes.
