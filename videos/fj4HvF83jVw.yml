description: "by Wim Bonthuis\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB2.252A/use_configmanagement.webm\n\n\nAfter discovering Foreman Ansible Modules I've set up an Ansible Playbook to set up and configure Foreman and Katello. Once its up and running, it allows you to boot PXE machines, or image based using Packer and Gitlab. The lab is deployed on my laptop and showcases the following technologies: \n\n\nlifecycle management (create/update/delete machines)\ncontent management (Environments/Packages/Subscriptions)\nscheduled image building and delivery with a pipeline\ncloud-init\nimmutable infrastructure\n\n\n\nIn other words, in this talk I will show how I manage foreman/katello/smartproxies with configuration management tools themselves. \n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:00:00+01"
