description: 'Making autonomous vehicles a reality is no small task. It involves thousands of people, including engineers, testers, operators, and analysts. As these systems move from research to production, so must the tools evolve to support the growing audience that needs to get access to the data of the surrounding environment and the state from the vehicle. During a March 2019 Uber meetup, data visualization engineers Tim Wojtaszek and Joe Lisee introduce AVS, Uber''s open source Autonomous Visualization System, and discuss the path to--and future of--building this software.'
