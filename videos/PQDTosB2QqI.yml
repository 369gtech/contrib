description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nIonic is the beautiful, open source front-end SDK for developing hybrid mobile apps with web technologies. By building only one single AngularJS web app with Cordova extensions you can deliver up to 8 different native mobile apps. With this talk I will give you an overview about the features of this framework.\n\nDr. Barbara Ondrisek has worked for 15+ years as a software developer on Java back end projects, mainly as freelancer in Austria. She studied at the Vienna University of Technology where she wrote her PhD on electronic voting. Besides working for Austria's largest bank, she has developed different international web projects and (Android) apps.\n\nThis talk was held at the WeAreDevelopers Conference 2016 in Vienna, Austria: www.wearedevelopers.org"
