title: 'Getting Started with JSON Document Collections in the Autonomous JSON Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603294004
description: "In this session, Todd introduces you to the Autonomous JSON Database (AJD). AJD is exciting because it represents the very first time Oracle is offering a dedicated solution for JSON document collection persistence in the Oracle Cloud. It represents our commitment to offering developers tools and solutions that help them solve the problems they face when developing microservices and applications instead of trying to convince them to use a tool that might not be the best fit for them. Like all good solutions, it is scalable and adaptable, which means that it can transform into a full-blown Autonomous Transaction Processing database if your needs dictate that in the future.\n\nTodd shows you how to launch a new AJD instance and immediately persist and retrieve JSON documents and collections via SQLcl. We’ll also show you how to use the SODA module for Node.JS to work with your AJD instance. Of course, you’re not limited to just Node.JS - we also offer SODA packages for Java, Python, C, REST and PL/SQL so you can choose the package that best fits your needs.\n\nThis session is based on Todd's blog here:\nhttps://blogs.oracle.com/developers/launch-persist-json-documents-in-the-cloud-in-10-minutes-or-less-with-autonomous-json-database\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com"
