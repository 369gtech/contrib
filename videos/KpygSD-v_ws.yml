That becomes extra challenging when dealing with stateful applications. By leveraging out of the box Kubernetes and Vitess features, Derek and his team were able to migrate a high throughput production workload of 20 TB from Azure (AKS) to Google (GKE) in under an hour. This workload consisted of dozens of services writing to MySQL, including heavy usage of the under-marketed pub/sub style message queue feature of Vitess. Derek will go into detail about the public Helm charts that were used to set up these workloads and how Kubernetes and Vitess were configured. We will also touch on a few ecosystem projects like external-dns, cert-manager that helped make the transition low-touch and seamless. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaYn"
