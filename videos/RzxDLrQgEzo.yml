The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nUsing TUF and in-toto to Tighten the Release Process. - Santiago Torres-Arias, NYU & Justin Cappos, NYU \n\nAs enterprise companies move to Cloud Native, the supply chain has become a very attractive target for attacks. An attacker who compromises a project's supply chain can greatly increase the blast radius of their attack to all users of the system. In some cases the exploit is an unintended bug (e.g. Equifax); in others, it is more insidious. In this talk, Santiago and Justin will show you how you can use TUF and in-toto to create a tightly-secured software supply chain. Starting from secure container delivery using TUF, and moving towards the left to tools like build farms, vulnerability scanners, and version control systems. The talk will be grounded in real business delivery values by pointing out common software supply chain misconfiguration pitfalls and through an integration example on one of the largest open source operating systems. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uagm"
