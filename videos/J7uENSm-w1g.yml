description: "Join us for our next conference: https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\nIn an increasingly connected world, APIs are key to great tools and effective workflows. What is better than an API? A webhook of course! Webhooks are the modern way for integrating systems and allowing them to react to one another. This session will cover what a webhook is, and where we might see or use them in our day-to-day activities. We’ll also look at how they can become part of our workflow, by bringing information into our chat channels, integrating with other tools such as Zapier or Hubot, and generally oiling the wheels of our daily work.\n\nABOUT LORNA MITCHELL\n\nLorna is based “up north” in Leeds; she is a Developer Advocate at IBM Cloud Data Services, an experienced developer and a published author. She brings her technical expertise to audiences all over the world with her writing and speaking engagements, delivering advice on a wide range of topics, all with a very practical slant. In her spare time, Lorna runs the joind.in open source project and blogs at lornajane.net."
