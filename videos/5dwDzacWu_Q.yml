recordingDate: 1557246920
description: "Navigating between screens is pretty simple right? No it’s not. Actually not all the time.\nLast year Google introduced Navigation Component tool helping us standardise the design and the implementation of how screens can pass in front of the Android users.\n\nWe started to use it with my team last summer and we learned a lot about its benefits, and its pitfalls. In this presentation, I'll try to give a feedback about what we learned, what hope you can put in it and what’s not to expect from it.\n\nHere is an outline of the talk:\n- The Navigation Component tool and API\n- Testing your navigation\n- Specific use cases\n  - Handling multi start points\n  - Handling custom transitions and Shared Elements\n  - How to handle other entities than Fragments\n  - Handling the back navigation\n- Implementing the navigation logic\n  - 3 examples of implementation patterns we found\n  - Alternative example to Navigation Components\n- The lib is in alpha, what is it implied by this, for real\n- Single or Multiple activities what to choose?\n- Integrate nav controller in an existing app\n- Conclusion\n  - What can it bring to your app?\n  - Should we use it?\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2019/it\nhttps://twitter.com/droidconit\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
