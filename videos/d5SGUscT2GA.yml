description: "\"Speaker: Emin Martinian\n\nProfiling involves computing a set of data about how often and how\nlong various parts of your program are executed. Profiling is useful\nto understand what makes your program slow and how you can improve\nit. After a quick review of deterministic profiling tools and\ntechniques, I will describe how you can do statistical profiling with\nexisting packages or write your own from scratch.\n\nStatistical profiling involves occasionally sampling what your program\nis doing instead of watching each line or function. A key feature of\nstatistical profiling is that by using a moderate sampling frequency,\nyou can profile your production code with almost no overhead. This lets\nyou find the actual bottlenecks in real use cases.\n\nThe core technical focus of the talk is python's sys module and how it\nlets you easily examine a running program. I also describe some tricks\nto be aware of related to threading, context switches, locks, and so on.\nAt the conclusion of the talk, you will hopefully understand how to use\nan existing statistical profiler or write a customized version yourself.\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
