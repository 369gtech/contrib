How do we keep expanding scope, without losing focus on the real work? Join us for a journey into the fourth dimension, where we don't just change code; we design change.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/avdi-grimm/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - AVDI GRIMM\nAuthor of Ruby programming books and recipient of the Ruby Hero award.\n\nIn his 20-year software development career, Avdi Grimm has worked on everything from aerospace embedded systems to enterprise web applications. Heâ€™s a consulting pair-programmer, the author of several popular Ruby programming books, and a recipient of the Ruby Hero award for service to the Ruby community. Since 2011 he has been teaching developers how to work more effectively (and have fun doing) it at RubyTapas.com.\n\nHe spends his theoretical spare time hanging out with his kids, hiking the Smoky Mountains, and dancing to oontz-oontz music.\n\nMore on Avdi Grimm: https://codesync.global/speaker/avdi-grimm/\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JESSICA KERR\nSymmathecist, in the medium of code\n\nJessitron is a developer at Atomist, where she works on very exciting development and delivery automation tools.
