description: "Unleash collective genius: How do you build a truly people focused organisation - a Fampany? A company that focus on the people who work in it, the people we work with and people in the business? For ustwo it is all about relationships and meaning! \n\nThis talk will be about how ustwo built a strong collaborative culture. What our values are and how they are integrated and realised in our daily work. Because culture is not something you have it’s something you do! The way ustwo is run resonates loud and clear with the principles from Management 3.0 and Agile. We hope to inspire others to take the same path. \n\nSpeakers\nMichael Rozenberg & Camilla Dahle \n\nMichael: As team coach as ustwo Michael is part of a team that focus on culture, processes and projects. Over the last ten years Michael has worked in the intersection between business and IT to implement Agile and people focused principles to deliver more value to customers. He is currently leading one of the studio teams working with game development. \n\nCamilla: As a Lead UX designer at ustwo Camilla has a passion for creating meaningful digital services. Which is why she increasingly over the past years has been working with the magic synergy between people, organizations and digital products.
