description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nIntro: Harbor - Enterprise Cloud Native Artifact Registry - Alex Xu & Steven Ren, VMware \n\nAs container technology becomes widely adopted in the industry, how to manage containerized applications poses new challenges to platform engineers. One of the challenges is to securely and efficiently manage containerized application packages with either container image or Helm Chart format. Project Harbor is an open-source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, manages, signs, and scans content, thus resolving common image or Helm Chart management challenges. In this presentation, we will focus on the management of container images and Helm Charts through Harbor. We will review and provide solutions to the challenges faced by organizations, including RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), content replication, pluggable vulnerability scanning, large scale content distribution, content trust (notary), webhook, tag retention, online GC and DevOps integrations, etc.. Real-world use cases will be discussed in the session. Of course, fantastic demos will be shown to let you easily understand the related use cases.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zewj"
