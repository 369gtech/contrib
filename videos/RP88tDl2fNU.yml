description: "http://velocityconf.com\nA nearly infinite array of variables can affect performance. Gaining control over these variables allows providers and enterprises to introduce a greater degree of consistency and high performance into any environment. How can this be done? As infrastructure morphs into code, what was once secret becomes revealed. An application-aware infrastructure, for example, allows organizations to detect degraded service, query current QoS usage, and collect detailed analysis of applications and user experiences. This information could be used to recommend QoS policy changes, which can be implemented on-the-fly across all network devices, and can even be specialized for particular users or customers. It's time to move beyond writing applications to conform to the shape of the infrastructure. Instead, let's program the infrastructure to get the most out of our applications.\n\nhttp://velocityconf.com/velocity2013/public/schedule/speaker/140437"
