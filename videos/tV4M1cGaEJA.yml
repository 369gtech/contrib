description: "We talked about Bayer matrices and reviewed this informative article about them: https://bartwronski.com/2016/10/30/dithering-part-three-real-world-2d-quantization-dithering/ We also programmed an algorithm (a surprisingly fast one!) that generates arbitrary-size Bayer matrices.\n\nThe algorithms that we wrote on-stream are here: https://gist.github.com/BSVino/76a3b98a1e814a09ac0a510d4a0ca75f\n\n-- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/bsvino"
