The power of gamification and the power of people experimenting with AR technology helps them to make better decisions as consumers.\nYou can find an ad in your news feed, open the camera, and preview a product in the \"Real\" world.\nOne day people will wake up and realize that AR is here. There are many questions around this sometimes-overhyped sector. And the biggest of them is how it will make money?\nThere are several answers to that, and we will take a look at the most popular ones.\n\n\nAdvertisers are keeping the eye on AR because it can create higher levels of engagement than traditional advertisements.\n\n\nPeople are very interested in things like shopping and ads, things that help to make a better decision.\nOn the other side, brands want their customers to spend more time thinking about their products and personalizing them to their needs.\n\n\nAnd XR (Extended Reality) can enable that!\n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 10:00:00"
