description: "Cloud Foundry Platform Automation with Concourse - Dennis Gross, anynines\n\nOperating production Cloud Foundry environments require short delivery cycles to constantly mitigate critical security updates and ship new features. Confronted with a rapidly growing number of Cloud Foundry environments, a consequent automation of administrative tasks is mandatory. Improving CI/CD pipelines is todayís systems administration!\n\nThis talk will walk through real-world Concourse CI/CD automation grown during years of operating Cloud Foundry. It will show how Concourse is vital for Cloud Foundry Application Runtime operations, data service automation and operations.\n\nLearn about Concourse best practices to manage the lifecycle of Cloud Foundry environments to maximize your deployment pace. See how you can automate CloudFoundry release updates, test and ship new features from code to production through multiple staging systems and keep track on the outcome at the end of the day.\n\nAt the end of this talk, youíll be keen to download Concourse and start automating your Cloud Foundry environment.\n\nAbout Dennis Groﬂ\nAs part of the anynines platform team, I work with Cloud Foundry and Bosh on a daily basis. I am an active volunteer for the Concourse community and my mission at anynines is to automize our Cloud Foundry driven Platform every day a bit more.anynines is a Cloud Foundry driven PaaS that provides highly available data services at scale. With the feature richness of our data services comes a high demand for automation.In this talk proposal, I want to present a Concourse based CI/CD system I am working on for the past three months.The system automizes the deployment and testing of our Cloud Foundry PaaS and all data services with little to no manual operations work.It is designed to deliver new features and hotfixes continuously at a high pace to all of our customer staging and production systems."
