description: "Erlang User Conference 2012\n\nerlang-solutions.com\nerlang-factory.com\n\n\"Every cool VM-based language today seems to have a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. With the availability of a powerful compiler infrastructure in the form of LLVM, Erlang is close to get a just-in-time compiler of its own. Using LLVM together with its C-frontend, Clang, and automated source-to-source transformations it is possible to generate a JIT-capable Erlang VM which automatically stays in sync with the basic VM.\n\nThis talk will provide a brief overview of different just-in-time compilation strategies and a short introduction to the Erlang VM. The main part of the talk is an in-depth tour of the current JIT prototype and the techniques used to build it.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
