description: "A secure and safe system for connected devices is a critical enabler for successful deployment in many Internet of Things use cases. A key component for such use cases is the combination of an embedded secure element and a Java Embedded platform. Embedded secure elements are a specialized type of microprocessor featuring a high level of security against physical and logical attacks, capable of executing Java Card applets and interfacing by using standard connectors with Java Embedded. This session describes how the Internet of Things will benefit from Java and embedded secure elements, presenting a real use case for securing communications in smart grid deployments in Europeâ€”a platform jointly developed by ST and Oracle.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAnne-Laure SIXOU\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Anne-Laure SIXOU at https://www.parleys.com/author/anne-laure-sixou-1\n\n Bousquet Thierry\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by  Bousquet Thierry at https://www.parleys.com/author/bousquet-thierry-1\n\n Frederic Vaute\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by  Frederic Vaute at https://www.parleys.com/author/frederic-vaute-3\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
