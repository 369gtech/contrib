language: English
recordingDate: 1439795941
description: "In this JavaScript tutorial for beginners, I'll show you the two logical operators we can use with our control flow statements (such as if statements and loops). The two operators are the AND operator ( && ) and the OR operator ( || ) . \n\nThe AND logical operator can be used when you need two or more conditions to be met, and the OR logical operator can be used when you only need ONE of two or more conditions to be met.\n\nAs always, any questions, fire ahead :).\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== JavaScript for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i9Ae2D9Ee1RvylH38dKuET\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n\n========== HTML for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
