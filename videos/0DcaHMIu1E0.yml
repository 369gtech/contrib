language: English
recordingDate: 1637176617
description: "On this weekly Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database, Jie Liu, Data Scientist for Oracle Machine Learning, covered the best practices when utilizing ML Classification Metrics, and showed a variety of ways to use them with Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py), with a live demo.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks offers an easy-to-use, interactive, multi-user, collaborative interface based on Apache Zeppelin notebook technology, and support SQL, PL/SQL, Python and Markdown interpreters. It is available on all Autonomous Database versions and Tiers, including the always-free editions.\n\nOML includes AutoML, which provides automated machine learning algorithm features for algorithm selection, feature selection and model tuning, in addition to a specialized AutoML UI exclusive to the Autonomous Database.\n\nOML Services is also included in Autonomous Database, where you can deploy and manage native in-database OML models as well as ONNX ML models (for classification and regression) built using third-party engines, and can also invoke cognitive text analytics.\n\nVideo highlights:\n00:48 Topics for today\n01:01 Upcoming Sessions\n02:24 Classification Metrics: Agenda Outline\n03:06 Classification Metrics: Motivation\n05:12 Accuracy\n06:44 Probability Score Histogram\n09:33 Confusion Matrix\n11:12 Precision and Recall - Definition\n13:15 Precision and Recall - Trade Offs\n17:53 F1 Score - Combining Precision and Recall\n18:53 Precision-Recall Curve\n20:14 Lift Chart\n21:45 Waterfall Analysis\n22:44 Question: What's the concept behind the \"Threshold\"\n24:16 AUC and the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve\n28:19 Computation of metrics using OML4Py and SQL\n30:58 Demo\n33:08 Question: Which ML algorithm was used and why?\n42:01 Question: Can I use AUC value instead of Accuracy?\n47:04 Demo: Showing AUC is not sensitive to target imbalance\n51:40 Q&A"
