title: 'Linux Kernel Licensing - toward "grep"ability.'
recordingDate: 1548381844
description: "Kate Stewart\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/199/\n\nDuring the Maintainer Summit in 2017, the guidelines for adding SPDX identifiers to the Linux kernel source files were agreed on,  and documented properly a couple of months later.  While the Linux Kernel is GPL-2.0-only at the top level, there are lots of other licenses included in the source files.  Linux kernel contributors are now able to accurately express the license a file is released under with a single one-line comment that can be \"grep\"d for, and it satisfies the conditions of using the DCO.   This talk will overview the state of licensing information in the Linux kernel,   how ambiguous files can be cleaned up,  and progress made in 2018 towards the \"grep\" goal by the community.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
