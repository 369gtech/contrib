title: '"Building Raspberry PI Supercomputers" - Federico Lucifredi (LCA 2021 Online)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1611988831
description: "Federico Lucifredi\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/87/\n\nFederico discusses what is required to integrate clusters of ARM SBCs, with a focus on Raspberry PI units due to their popularity, the software integration necessary to make them practical, what plumbing is necessary to easily configure nodes, and how to issue commands for cluster management. From the initial spotlight on cluster operations we transition to practical use, and briefly look at how parallel computing is utilized to solve numerical problems and how to code and run numerical workloads using the MPI interface. \r\n\r\nThis is a live tutorial with a running cluster (or two!), and is meant to be an introduction for those new to Linux clustering.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
