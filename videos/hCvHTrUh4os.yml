title: 'The Worst Programming Language Ever (Mark Rendle, 2014)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636121458
description: 'There''s something good you can say about every programming language. But that''s no fun. Instead, let''s take the worst features of all the languages we know, and put them together to create an abomination with the worst syntax, the worst semantics, the worst foot-guns and the worst runtime behaviour in recorded history. Let''s make a language so bad it would make people run screaming to Visual Basic for Applications.'
