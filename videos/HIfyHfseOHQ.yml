Filip Rakowski - VueStorefront and Composition API latest & news examples\n\nVue Storefront is currently the biggest Open Source eCommerce frontend that works with any backend platform and already has more than 60 live shops. For the past 2 years we are constantly improving our solution but we came to the point where architecture became a limitation... so we decided to do a rewrite and use the latest Vue features. As one of the first big projects in the world on Vue 3 we had a chance to explore and adapt new amazing patterns brought by Composition API. During this talk you will learn how using new Vue 3 features can bring developer experience to a completely new level!\n\n2. Natalia Tepluhina - Vue Apollo\n\n3. Callum Macrae - Author of Vue.js: Up and Running"
