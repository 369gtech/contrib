description: "Are you being asked to put more cloud in your strategy? If you’re like most people, the answer is a definite yes. The word “cloud” can mean so many things, however, that making an actionable strategy is impossible. At Pivotal, we divide cloud into two distinct parts: migrating as many legacy applications into SaaS as possible and focusing on perfecting the software you build in-house that runs your business. Gartner is predicting that by 2020, 75% of applications used to support digital businesses will be built in-house. If you’re one of these companies, you’ll need to quickly evaluate how you develop and run your custom written software.\n\nWe believe that soon, every company will either be a software company or losing to a competitor who is. It’s time to focus on the craft of managing the software development life-cycle, and this brief, but dense webinar will help launch your efforts to become a software defined business.\n\nRegister now for the second installment in our series: Working with legacy IT - most people find legacy code intolerable, but it is, after all, the stuff that makes all the money. Dealing with your legacy IT, then, must be done judiciously: a rip and replace, or lengthy refactoring project won't do. Organizations going on the cloud native journey need ways of working with legacy code and ensuring that “the stuff that makes all the money“ is well protected, but doesn't slow down progress. The advice here covers mostly putting proper portfolio management in place, managing your resources between new and old, finding legacy code bases that are favorable to modernizing, and adapting your governance process.\n\nPresenter: Michael Coté"
