language: English
recordingDate: 1498913246
description: "Communication is difficult. Whether between humans, machines, or a combination of the two, trying to translate meaningful information is a lossy process.\n\nConverting programming languages to use the new Unicode standard is hard, but once it’s in place, you get this marvellous feature-add: emoji compatibility. No longer do we have to make faces with symbols or use platform-specific emoticons. Rejoice in the extended character set.\n\nEmoji have a rich history as a way to allow the communication of ideas in a reduced amount of data. They date back to a time where this was important: SMS communications in Japan. However, as social networks feverishly try to clamber onto this bandwagon, their implementations of the standard create issues with miscommunication that aren’t possible with a 12×12 pictograph.\n\nWe’ll discuss the history of emoji, cross-platform adoption, the Unicode standard, and emoji accessibility in web applications. ?\n\nKatie has worn many different hats over the years. She has been a software developer for many languages, systems administrator for multiple operating systems, and speaker on many different topics.\n\nWhen she’s not changing the world, she enjoys cooking, making tapestries, and yelling at JavaScript and its attempt at global variables.\n\nFor more on YOW!
