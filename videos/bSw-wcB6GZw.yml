description: "D-Wave’s Leap service is the first cloud based quantum application environment that gives developers real-time access to a live quantum computer.  In this video, we’ll use the Leap service to build a simple application to monitor a crop health sensor network. I've been collaborating with D-Wave on this, and this video will go over several existing use cases, detail how quantum computing uses quantum mechanics, and demo using it for a real-world application. Entanglement, superposition, tunneling, there are some crucial concepts for us to understand to be able to harness quantum technology and through animations, code, and explanations I hope you too get excited about its potentials. Enjoy! \n\nCode examples: \nhttps://www.dwavesys.com/\n\nCoding Challenge:\nCreate a simple app using Leap that solves a problem. Submit your github repository to hello@sirajraval.com by December 9th at midnight PST. I'll give the top 2 entries a video shoutout a week after that!\n\nPlease Subscribe! And Like. And comment.
