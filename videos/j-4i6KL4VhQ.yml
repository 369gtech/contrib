description: "DevOps: From Grassroots to Mainstream\n\nWesley G. Pullen, Chief DevOps Strategist, Electric Cloud \n\nBack in 2009, who would have ever thought or dreamed that we would rely on DevOps as the key enabler to digitally transform businesses and ensure one’s competitive edge? Regardless of how hard your teams work on valuable software updates and new features, no value is delivered until it is running safely in production. Thinking about it that way, your delivery pipeline is THE killer feature, and successful DevOps adoption is the best way to drive your business! With most enterprises now adopting DevOps, starting DevOps teams, and applying key DevOps principles, we are now looking to maximize these investments to ensure that the journey is complete and the desired destination of quality software reaches our customers/end-users. It has been said that we can NOT improve what we cannot measure! \n\nThis talk is designed to share lessons learned and best practices used by successful organizations to enable, measure and scale DevOps success in the enterprise by creating a delivery pipeline that transcends technology – and translates to great culture, employee satisfaction, and continuous momentum for the business.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
