description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary 19, 2009\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Trust is a feature length documentary shot inside San Quentin State Prison and in surrounding Bay Area communities. The film is a character-driven story about the daily struggle of incarceration faced by three San Quentin inmates. After one man is released, the film follows him home as he attempts to re-integrate into society.\n\nThe film takes you inside San Quentin on a one-on-one journey with inmates in The National Trust Program, a re-socialization program in which life-term inmates mentor, train and prepare short-term inmates to become positive citizens. The Trust follows the men as they battle conflicts between the expectations of parole officers, spouses, children and friends.\n\nThe goal of The Trust is to start a national dialogue on the systemic effects of incarceration on communities across the country. In achieving this goal, Director and Producer Tamara Perkins has established extraordinary access through her relationships with the men of The Trust and the Warden and staff inside San Quentin. This project also captures a unique perspective on prison life through the use of an internal film crew, comprised of inmates trained in filmmaking through the San Quentin Media Project.\n\nThere has never been a documentary film done on this topic, let alone, with this depth into the souls of the inmates and their families. The film shows the psyche of the inmates and how they have to overcome their own demons, and society's, in order to survive and remain free from returning to prison.\n \nJoin us in a private, intimate viewing and unseen footage from inside San Quentin and discussions with the director and producer Tamara Perkins and Jesse Dana.\n\nSee the trailer at:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SQTrust \n\nFor more information, visit:\nwww.trustcommunity.org\n\nSpeaker: Tamara Perkins\nDirector/Producer\n\nTamara is an independent filmmaker focused on documentaries that inspire dialogue and inform the public and policy makers.
