description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nDistributed microservices, eventual consistency, billions of events ! Buzz words that attract but mainly repel many developers.\n\nLet's relax a bit an see how the Functional approach leads first to Domain code that is easily readable and highly testable, without headache. Then we'll see how Functional Event Sourcing properties provide many different and simple integration options that let us run it without going full architecturaly crazy headfirst.\n\n\nJérémie Chassaing has been practicing Domain Driven Design and Continuous Improvement for 10 years as an architect at D-Edge / Availpro, a channel manager for independent hotels, to increase scalability and reliability to match its rapid growth. He's an active member of the F# community. You can also see his blog thinkbeforecoding, a blog dedicated to Domain Driven Design, CQRS and Event Sourcing.\n\n\nDue to technical issues the laptop screen was not recorded.
