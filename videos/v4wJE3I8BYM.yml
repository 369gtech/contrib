description: "If your organization has been operating Kubernetes, you probably have been looking for ways to control what end-users can do on the cluster and ways to ensure that clusters are in compliance with company policies. With Kubernetes, how do you ensure compliance without sacrificing development agility and operational independence? Gatekeeper is a customizable admission webhook for Kubernetes that enforces policies executed by the Open Policy Agent (OPA), a policy engine for Cloud Native environments hosted by CNCF.\n\nPresenters:\n\nSertaç Özercan, Software Engineer @Microsoft\nLachie Evenson, Principal Program Manager @Microsoft"
