description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nAdvanced Templates\nThis is the second part of Templates where go more into depth. Attendees expected to know the syntax an properties of function and class templates, type_traits and constexpr if.\n\nIn this session, we look at variadic templates together with fold expressions by using a Printf like function as an example. This knowledge is then used to talk about template specializations.\n\nAt this point we will briefly talk about SFINAE. We compare it to the tag-dispatching pattern and see how C++20s Concepts make SFINAE way less scary. Next on the plate are variable templates as well as template template parameters.\n\nThis session is for developers with C++ experience who have avoided templates so far. After attending this talk, attendees have learned techniques like SFINAE and template specializations.\n\n---\nAndreas Fertig\nUnique Code\n\nAndreas Fertig is the CEO of Unique Code GmbH, which offers training and consulting for C++ specialized in embedded systems.
