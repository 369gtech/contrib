description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSecrets Store CSI Driver: Keeping Secrets Secret - Anish Ramasekar, Microsoft & Tommy Murphy, Google\n\nApplications running on Kubernetes require access to sensitive information (passwords, SSH keys and authentication tokens). But how do you configure your applications when the source of truth for these secrets is an external secret store? What if you need to store, retrieve and perform zero touch rotation of these secrets securely? Meet the Secrets Store CSI Driver, a sig-auth subproject providing a simple way to retrieve secrets from enterprise-grade external stores such as Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager and HashiCorp Vault. In this session, Anish and Tommy will demonstrate how to use the Secrets Store CSI Driver to mount and rotate sensitive information from external secrets stores in the Kubernetes application. They will also discuss trade-offs of the CSI driver versus other solutions to accessing external secret stores and how CRDs are used to make pod portability across Kubernetes environments possible."
