description: "The Data Analytics Platform or How to Make Data Science in a Box Possible - Krzysztof Adamski & Rob Keevil, ING \n\nThe Hadoop and FOSS revolution has reshaped the data analytics landscape. In the search for creating a cutting-edge data platform at ING, we are faced with challenging new requirements such as cloud-ready deployments and frictionless progressions of Machine Learning models into production, whilst ensuring proper data governance and security principals.  Please join us in this session, where we will share ING WBAAâ€™s experience on how to make a data platform based on open source components both enterprise and cloud ready, with an overview of current state and vision of our platform. We will cover the topics such as self-service automation to support machine learning use cases, the usage of distributed frameworks like spark on top of kubernetes and how to prepare the foundation (infrastructure components) within the enterprise environment. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPao"
