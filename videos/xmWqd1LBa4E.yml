description: "GoWayFest 4.0, Online – July 11-12, 2020\n\nDebugging concurrency programs in Go, Andrii Soldatenko\n\nRecently the interest in concurrent programming has grown dramatically. Unfortunately, parallel programs do not always have reproducible behavior. Even when they are run with the same inputs, their results can be radically different. In this talk I’ll show how to debug concurrency programs in Go.\n\nI’ll start from showing how you can debug your gorotines using delve and gdb debuggers. Then I’ll try to visualize goroutines using different scenarios, sometimes it helps to better understand how things work. Next part of the topic will be about dumping a goroutine stack trace of your application while it’s running and inspect what each goroutine is doing. And I’ll demonstrate how to debug leaking goroutines by tracing the process of how the scheduler runs goroutines on logical processors which are bound to a physical processor via the operating system thread that is attached. \n\nAs a bonus i’ll cover debugging tips on how to find deadlocks and how to avoid race conditions in your application."
