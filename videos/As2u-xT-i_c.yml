description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubernetes on Windows - A Journey - Jerry Lozano, RX-M LLC\n\nKubernetes is almost always used in a Linux environment. Tutorials and examples, regardless of hardware platform, always run some distribution of Linux. Yet since 1.14, Kubernetes worker nodes are actively supported on Windows. This session describes one developer’s journey of designing, developing, installing, and deploying Kubernetes on modern Windows Server. The need for microservice implementations on Windows is just as valid as it is on Linux. Windows Server is hosted on at least 3-times the number of servers in use in the world and market share is still increasing (Statista). Most of these servers run enterprise applications that must meet the requirements for scalability, availability, and maintainability that any modern application faces. This session describes the benefits of hosting Kubernetes nodes on Windows Server, similarities and differences from execution on Linux, and lessons learned when implementing a microservice application with the Windows infrastructure."
