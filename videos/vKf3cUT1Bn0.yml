recordingDate: 1519095630
description: "Frank Lloyd Wright was the founder of Organic architecture, a movement that sought to find harmony between nature and human dwellings. This approach changed the way people think of their experience with architecture in ways that has permeated all of design. In this talk we look at some lessons learned that can be applied to help you find ways to improve way finding, contextual understanding and overall user experience in a variety of interactive experiences.\n\nPresented by Cory Gwin at Code & Supply."
