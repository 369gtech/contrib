description: "Erlang User Conference 2012 \n\nwww.erlang-solutions.com\nwww.erlang-factory.com\n\n\"To generate Erlang code dynamically, you have until now had two choices: you could either create plain tuples according to the \"abstract format\" as generated by erl_parse (which is messy and has many special cases to keep in mind), or you could use the API functions in the erl_syntax module (which offer more abstraction, but can get pretty verbose). This talk will present the missing ingredient; a library allowing you to use template strings with metavariables, both for generating and matching on abstract syntax trees. As examples, I will show how we have used this at Klarna to implement a small domain-specific language for business logic, and demonstrate how you too can easily write a parse transform and even implement your own DSL that compiles to Beam code. \"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory \nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
