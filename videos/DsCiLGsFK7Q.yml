description: "http://2015.jsconfbp.com/#juliancheal\n\nWeb apps are great and everything, but imagine using JS to fly drones and make them dance to the sounds of dubstep! Or to control disco lights and other robots! Sounds fun, right? In this talk, we will not only explore how we can write code to make this possible, but it will also be full of exciting, interactive (and possibly dangerous ;) ) demos!"
