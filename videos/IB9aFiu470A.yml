description: "Channel Equalization using GNU Radio  compensating for impairments in the wireless channel, and extensions to existing GNU Radio functionality\nby Josh Morman\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.120/fsr_hannel_equalization_using_gnu_radio.webm\n\nWe examine the use of equalizers in wireless communication systems, how these are implemented in GNU Radio, and how the existing GR equalizer functionality can be extended with a new OOT using training-based adaptation.  The theory of multipath channels, ISI, and how to overcome with adaptive equalization will be reviewed and shown with interactive flowgraphs.\n\n\nPlease note that this talk was originally scheduled to be given at 2:30 PM and will now take place at 10:00 AM.\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 09:00:00"
