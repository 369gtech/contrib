description: "Guilherme de Maio - Software Engineer at Telnyx\n\nEcto without SQL\n\nTalk in three words: ecto schemas datamodeling\n\nAbstract\nThe recent Ecto split got some people confused, but the truth is Ecto was never just a \"db library\" for Elixir. This talk is about what Ecto can be used for besides database interactions. It will showcase real examples of it being used in different ways, to parse, validate and give a proper structure to complex input/output data, working with message queues and so on.\n\nObjectives\nShowcase how Ecto can be used without an SQL database. Showcase how Ecto can be extended to saving and querying other data sources. Explain how the Ecto split works.\n\nAudience\nSoftware developers that are experienced with Elixir or other languages and would like to have a better understand of what Ecto can be used for.\n\nThe speaker \nGuilherme is a software engineer with 10 years' experience focusing on web applications, from ops to backend. Currently, he is working at Telnyx, a Chicago based telecom company aiming at democratising universal communications. He has been in love with Elixir since he started working with the language in 2015, being an active member of Elixir Meetups in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and spreading Elixir love all around :) He also loves science fiction books, movies and tv series.\nGithub: nirev\nTwitter: @nirev\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: www.elixirconf.eu\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/elixirconfeu\nMail: info at elixirconfeu"
