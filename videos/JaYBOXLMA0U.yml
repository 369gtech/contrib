description: "The idea of programming goes back to way before the first computers were built or even conceived of. This talk will take you on a fascinating journey and give you a brief overview of the history of computer programming; starting in the 18th century and ending with a look into the future, focusing on those concepts, machines and languages that have formed the way we program today or may be programming in the near future.\n\nAlasdair Collinson is a software developer for Senacor Technologies by day, I have long been interested in the \"metadata\" of computers and programming. This has lead to the exploration of some esoteric programming languages, the culture around geeks and nerds (of which I am one himself) and the history of computers and programming."
