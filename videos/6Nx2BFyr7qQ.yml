description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nAbsorbing Thanos Infinite Powers for Multi-Cluster Telemetry - Bartlomiej Płotka & Kemal Akkoyun, Red Hat & Frederic Branczyk, Independent \n\nThanos is an open-source, CNCF’s Incubated project that horizontally scales Prometheus to create a global-scale highly available monitoring system. It seamlessly extends Prometheus in a few simple steps and it is already used in production by hundreds of companies that aim for high multi-cloud scale for metrics while keeping low maintenance cost. During this talk, core Thanos (and Prometheus) maintainers, will briefly introduce basic ideas behind Thanos and deployment models and use cases. After that, to satisfy more experienced users, they will explain more advanced concepts, tips for running on the scale, and the latest shiny usability improvements. Thanks to the growing community there is much to talk about! \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekHk"
