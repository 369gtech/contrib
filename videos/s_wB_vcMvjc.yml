description: "When people think of Artificial Intelligence (AI), typically they think of human-like thinking robots or futuristic scenes of self-aware computers taking over the world. But AI goes well beyond the automatons of science fiction into the real world of advanced computer science.\n\nIn this session, we'll explore the new Amazon AI cloud-native deep learning technologies to add the power of artificial intelligence to your apps for; natural language understanding (NLU), automatic speech recognition (ASR), visual search & Image recognition, and text-to-speech (TTS).\n\nWe'll do overviews & demos of the AI services:\n\nAmazon Lex enables building conversational interfaces into any app using voice and text that is powered by the same technology as Alexa used by Amazon Echo.\n\nAmazon Rekognition providing deep learning-based image recognition and analysis. Making it easy to add visual search and image classification to your applications by object, scenes, and faces detection, comparison, and search.\n\nAmazon Polly helps you create applications that talk by turning text into lifelike speech using advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice.\n\nTara Walker \nTara is a technical evangelist for Amazon Web Services, dedicating her time helping developers build apps, games, and solutions on AWS cloud. She has most recently been evangelizing & developing on cloud computing, mobile, gaming, IoT, serverless architectures, cross-platform development and writing tech posts for the AWS blog.
