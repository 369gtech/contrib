The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nin-toto: Securing the Entire Software Supply Chain - Santiago Torres, NYU \n\nAs attackers intensify their focus on the software development, distribution and deployment pipeline, supply chain security becomes more and more crucial to the overall security of software projects. in-toto, which has recently become a member of the CNCF, has tooling and a protocol that allows you to verifiably define all the steps of the supply chain, along with its authorized personnel, giving you and your customers the guarantee that everything happened according to your intentions and nothing else. This talk will walk you through the basics of software supply chain security, and show how a versatile tool like in-toto can add substantial security guarantees to any supply chain in- and outside of the cloud native ecosystem.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zev5"
