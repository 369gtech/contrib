Being able to create complex React Apps without using any JavaScript, but rather compiling from Clojurescript is a breath of fresh air. I'd like to share my experience writing React-powered apps using Clojurescript, Reagent and Figwheel.\n\nClojureScript compiles to JavaScript and, thanks to modern tools like Reagent and Figwheel, actually make writing React apps easier than with traditional React JS library. These apps are also generally faster than natively-written ones, thanks to build-in immutability and leveraging the Google Closure compiler. We need more functional programmers on the frontend side! The web is going somewhere dark, and we can help.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/rakhim-davletkaliyev\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - RAKHIM DAVLETKALIYEV\nA mutable entity\n\nSoftware developer since 2010.
