description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nAs governments pass data-locality laws, jurisdiction-aware database clusters are becoming important. Often, supporting data-locality means re-architecting the applications and taking a hit on new feature delivery. Also, migrating existing databases into databases resident in multiple locations becomes an operational challenge.\n\nVitess has a flexible sharding architecture and natively supports “cells” which correspond to infrastructure located in multiple locations. This allows for the creation of jurisdiction-aware database clusters that solve data locality without having to re-architect your application. Also, Vitess’s built-in support for resharding workflows makes migrating from existing databases into databases resident in multiple locations easy.\n\nIn this Webinar, we will write a custom sharding schema that illustrates distributing data from 16 countries housed in 4 jurisdictions without making any changes to the application."
