title: 'OSCON 2012: Ross Turk, "Ceph: The Future of Storage"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1343763296
description: "The quickest way to get a proprietary storage vendor to change the subject is to ask them what they think of Ceph. What makes them so uncomfortable? Ceph provides object storage, block storage, and a distributed file system -- in a single storage platform -- for free. Ceph runs on commodity hardware, allowing you to power your storage with the best technology available.\n\nCeph's powerful distributed block device allows you to scale cloud platforms without limitation, and its object store is compatible with applications written for S3 or Swift. Ceph has been designed with no single point of failure and intelligent nodes that are self-managing and self-healing. It's time to throw away all the old rules and start a new era of free storage solutions.\n\nYou can pay for expensive and limited proprietary products. Or you can use Ceph and invest that money in your business instead.\n\nRoss Turk\n\nInktank\n\nRoss Turk is responsible for building a strategic relationship with users, contributors, and the open source community.
