description: "? Registration to DevTernity is running! https://devternity.com\n\n#tddstyles #advanced #noslides\n\n\"TDD is a design tool.\" That’s what Sandro has said for years. But not anymore. After working with different teams and in different organisations, and also carefully inspecting how he works, Sandro changed his mind about the role of TDD in software design. In this talk Sandro will explain the pros and cons of the two main styles of TDD when it comes to software design, he'll discuss why some developers can test-drive well-crafted code while others can’t, and he'll also explain how to reason about design decisions."
