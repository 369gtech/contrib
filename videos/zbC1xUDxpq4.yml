description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012\nSpeaker: Ben Corrie\nCustomer interest in virtualizing Java workloads has been growing exponentially year on year. For the last few years, the focus has been largely around looking for best practice guidance to mitigate concerns around virtualizing Java workloads, particularly in the area of performance. Since joining VMware, SpringSource has been investing in providing first class support for the Java runtime on vSphere with products such as EM4J. Combined with the industry-leading capabilities of the vSphere platform and the growing product portfolio around the Java ecosystem, there are many great reasons to virtualize Java.\nSo rather than continuing to ask the question, is it OK to virtualize Java, this session boldly aims to suggest that you would be crazy not to!"
