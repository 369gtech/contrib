description: "Adam Bien, Consultant / Contractor, Adam Bien\n\nThis presentation starts with a “full profile” Jakarta EE/Java EE microservice, builds and deploys a thin WAR from scratch, introduces useful MicroProfile features, develops serverless functions, and lets them communicate. No tricks, no plugins, no magic. Just CLI, IDE, and lean code. Questions during the session are highly appreciated."
