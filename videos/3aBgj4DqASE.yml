description: "The methods and speed at which we develop software today has fundamentally changed the way we approach security. While new development environments increase the flexibility and efficiency in software development, developers may be unknowingly exposing business-related, sensitive data. Despite these risks, traditional security tools——which are slow, complicated, and simply not designed for cloud and virtual infrastructures——are not the answer either. Security needs to evolve seamlessly and transparently with these development environments so as to maintain speed and efficiency while integrating data protection. In this session, we’ll discuss the history of security and cloud computing, how the new developer-first approach has fundamentally changed where security sits in the landscape, and some new ways of automating security and building it into software development and deployment with Cloud Foundry.\n\nSpeaker: Jim Vogt, CEO, Zettaset\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: Coming Soon"
