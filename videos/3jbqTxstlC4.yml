title: 'Akka 2.0: Scaling Up & Out With Actors'
language: English
recordingDate: 1332360670
description: "Viktor Klang, tech lead of Akka at Typesafe, discusses scaling software with actors at the 2012 North East Scala Symposium. Traditional approaches to concurrency and distribution force the issue of choosing between productivity and scalability.The cause of that has been the wrong tools and the wrong layer of abstraction and Akka is here to change that.\n\nAkka is a unified runtime and programming model for scaling both UP (utilizing multi-core processors) and OUT (utilizing the grid/cloud). With Akka 2.0 this will be taken to a whole new level, \"Distributed by Design\".\n\n** videos sponsored by Typesafe (http://typesafe.com) and Marakana.\n** head to http://mrkn.co/vd5of for Viktor's slides."
