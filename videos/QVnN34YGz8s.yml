description: "Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers student\ndevelopers stipends to write code for various open source software\nprojects. We work with many open source, free software, and\ntechnology-related groups to identify and fund projects over a three\nmonth period. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought\ntogether over 7,500 successful student participants from 97 countries\nand over 7,000 mentors from over 100 countries worldwide to produce\nover 50 million lines of code. Through Google Summer of Code, accepted\nstudent applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the\nparticipating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software\ndevelopment scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas\nrelated to their academic pursuits. In turn, the participating\nprojects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers.\nBest of all, more source code is created and released for the use and\nbenefit of all.\n\nTo learn more about the program, read our 2014 Frequently Asked\nQuestions: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/help_page\n\nYou can talk with us on Internet Relay Chat (IRC), join our mailing\nlists (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-summer-of-code-discuss)\nor follow us on various social networking sites. You might also want\nto subscribe to the Google Open Source Blog\n(http://google-opensource.blogspot.com) for regular program updates."
