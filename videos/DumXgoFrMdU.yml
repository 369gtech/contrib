For more info and slides, please go to the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2012/speakers/LoicHoguin\n\nSlides can also be found  at:\n   http://ninenines.eu/talks/reverse-engineering/reverse-engineering.html\n\nCode can be found at:\n   https://github.com/essen/egs\n\nOnline gaming suffers from a big issue. When the owner of the game decides to shut it down, it's gone for good. Sometimes it's released as open source, but most of the time reverse engineering is needed to bring the fallen servers back to life. The best tool to analyze and reverse engineer a protocol and game client is Erlang, closely associated with a good debugger.\n\nThis talk will explain the big advantages Erlang has over other languages for reverse engineering protocols and analyzing client files. A live demo showcasing some of these tools and techniques will be given.\n\nAt the end of the talk you should have a good idea of how to start reverse-engineering your favorite online game.\n\nTalk Objectives: Learn how to use Erlang to analyze and reimplement \nproprietary protocols and file formats efficiently.\n\nTarget Audience: Network developers, video games enthusiasts."
