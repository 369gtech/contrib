description: "CSS Grid Layout finally lands in browsers in 2017, after over five years of specification and browser development. For some of us, we may quickly find 80% of our users have support for the spec. For others, we can take advantage of Grid in a progressively enhanced way - leaning on CSS Feature Queries to detect support. Grid enables a whole range of layout possibilities, both in terms of streamlining existing patterns and in creating new design possibilities for the web.\n\nThis is a talk about Grid Layout, and the previously impossible tasks that grid makes possible. However it is also a talk about what it is to do CSS layout in 2017. I’ll be sharing the things I’ve learned about layout, as I’ve learned about Grid. Passing on the key lessons that can help you really take advantage of what has shipped in browsers already, and the things that are to come.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/rachelandrew/what-i-learned-about-layout-vis-css-grid\nAbout Rachel: https://rachelandrew.co.uk\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
