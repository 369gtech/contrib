title: '"Towards an Open, Reason(ML)able Web" by Parker Ziegler'

description: "Web technologies today are converging towards two paradigms - static typing and compilation to JavaScript. More than ever before, engineers want sound type systems and elegant language ergonomics while generating performant JS. ReasonML promises the best of both by pairing OCaml's robust type system with a blazing fast JavaScript compiler, BuckleScript.\n\nDespite these benefits, Reason made a minimal splash when it arrived in 2016. Other projects like TypeScript eclipsed community attention around static typing and performance. But that's beginning to change. According to 2018's State of JS survey, Reason has seen 94% growth in developer interest over the last year, greater than any other surveyed language. This success has been the result of a distributed open source effort by community contributors. The proliferation of bindings for JavaScript libraries like React and Apollo are making Reason a production choice for teams. In addition, the creation of a native package manager, esy, and UI framework, revery, signals a major breakthrough in cross-platform development.\n\nIn this talk, we'll dive into how the Reason community embraced open source design to create a language that fulfills the promise of \"write once, run anywhere.\" We'll dig into Reason's internals and examine the many rapid evolutions of the language. Finally, we'll discuss the challenges of developing open source in uncharted technical frontiers through the lens of two Reason projects, revery and wonka.\n\nParker Ziegler\nFormidable\n@parker_ziegler\n\nParker is a software engineer at Formidable, a JavaScript consultancy and open source software organization.
