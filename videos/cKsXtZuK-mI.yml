title: 'Jurgen Appelo: How to Fix Your Failed Agile Transformation at Stretch Conference 2020'
recordingDate: 1581916879
description: "The problem with many agile transformations is that existing methods and frameworks treat everyone the same. They make no distinction between startups and scaleups, between disruptive innovative ideas versus existing successful products. But starting new teams and scaling up innovation is more important than ever. The key to a successful agile transformation is applying different practices in different stages of the business lifecycle. What works for a new product does not work for a mature one, and vice versa.\n\nIn this talk, we will nosedive into the major good practices for business leaders and product teams, from the moment they have an innovative idea to the day they will scale it up (or screw it up). Your agile transformation depends on product lifecycles, the innovation vortex, and the innovation funnel.\n\nStretch is a non-profit conference that brings 500 attendees and 16 speakers from all around the world who want to build effective organizations since 2013. An international platform and community for leaders and managers to share stories, hands-on solutions and explore new trends and ideas to lead, fail, learn and stretch.
