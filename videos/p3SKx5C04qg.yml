description: "Recruiting is a 200 billion dollar industry thats all about judging potential job candidates and seeing if they're a good fit for a position at a company. Recruiters receive thousands of resumes and are responsible for analyzing all of them. Theres essentially a massive amount of data that these humans have to parse through and find the best ones. This is easily a problem machine learning can solve, we'll build an app that can classify resumes into 27 different job categories using natural language processing via a convolutional neural network. I'll explain how in this video. Also its midterm time, so see the link below for the midterm assignment. \n\nCode for this video (with midterm):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/AI_for_Resumes\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like.
