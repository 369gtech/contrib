description: "Tim Sneath, Group Product Manager of Flutter & Dart, kicks off Dart Conference 2018 in Los Angeles, CA with this keynote. Dart's mission is to make it possible to build next-generation user experiences — on the web, on iOS, on Android, everywhere. DartConf is the premier event that connects Flutter and AngularDart developers together, and to the Google engineers who work on these projects.\n\nTim Sneath leads product management for Flutter and Dart, working from Google’s office in Seattle. He recently joined Google after seventeen years leading client platform and developer teams at Microsoft. In his spare time, he plays the piano, battles with the New York Times crossword, and attempts to persuade his mother that computers aren’t out to get her.\n\nWatch the rest of the Dart Conference 2018 session videos here: https://goo.gl/4bwhE5\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
