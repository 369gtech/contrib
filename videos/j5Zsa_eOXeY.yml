description: "What is DevOps in the context of software engineering? Learn all about DevOps in this comprehensive course for beginners with three technical tutorials. You will learn what DevOps is, continuous integration, continuous deployment strategies, and application performance management. Many DevOps practices are commonly used in programming and web development, it is important to understand key terms and technologies. \n\nThis course often references the MERN (MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS) technology stack. You will get a series of talks with technology recommendations based on these best practices. There will be several programming examples embedded in these talks. As long as you know the absolute basics of coding and the web, you'll have no problem following along. \n\n⭐️ Course Notes ⭐️\n🔗 Lesson 1: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-devops/\n🔗 Lesson 2: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-test-driven-development/\n🔗 Lesson 3: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-ci/\n🔗 Lesson 4: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-code-coverage/\n🔗 Lesson 5: https://layerci.com/blog/linting-best-practices/\n🔗 Lesson 6: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-an-ephemeral-environment/\n🔗 Lesson 7: https://layerci.com/blog/the-difference-between-vms-and-containers/\n🔗 Lesson 8: https://layerci.com/blog/what-are-rolling-deployments/\n🔗 Lesson 9: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-a-blue-green-deployment/\n🔗 Lesson 10: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-autoscaling/\n🔗 Lesson 11: https://layerci.com/blog/service-discovery/\n🔗 Lesson 12: https://layerci.com/blog/what-is-log-aggregation/\n🔗 Lesson 13: https://layerci.com/blog/vital-production-metrics/\n\n⭐️ Course Content: 3 Pillars of DevOps ⭐️\n\n⭐️ Unit 1 - Code Review Automation\n⌨️ Lesson 1  What is DevOps?\n⌨️ Lesson 2 - What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?\n⌨️ Lesson 3 - What is Continuous Integration (CI)? w/ CI setup TUTORIAL\n⌨️ Lesson 4 - What is code coverage? \n⌨️ Lesson 5 - Linting best practices\n⌨️ Lesson 6 - Ephemeral environments  w/ setup TUTORIAL\n\n⭐️ Unit 2 - Deployment Strategies\n⌨️ Lesson 7 - Virtual Machines (VMs) vs. Containers \n⌨️ Lesson 8 - Rolling deployments  \n⌨️ Lesson 9 - Blue/green deployments w/ Continuous Deployment setup TUTORIAL\n⌨️ Lesson 10 - What is autoscaling?\n⌨️ Lesson 11 - What is service discovery? \n\n⭐️ Unit 3 - Application Performance Management (APM)\n⌨️ Lesson 12 - What is log aggregation?\n⌨️ Lesson 13 - Vital production metrics \n\n⭐️ Course Reddit Discussion Forum: https://www.reddit.com/r/devopsacademy/\n🎥 Course created and narrated by Colin Chartier, Co-founder and CEO at LayerCI\n🐦 Have feedback on the course?
