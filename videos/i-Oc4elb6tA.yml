This panel will take you behind the scenes in some of the biggest service mesh products around through the eyes of the engineers that build them. Hear from service mesh insiders about the greatest ideas that didn't work. Learn how to avoid adoption pitfalls that often end in disappointment. Get an inside look at how a service mesh product is made, and how service mesh maintainers run their own service mesh. Take away patterns and practices for successfully navigation your service mesh journey, regardless of the implementation you choose."
