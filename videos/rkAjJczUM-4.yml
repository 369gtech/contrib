description: "http://velocityconf.com\nEdgeCast is one of the busiest content delivery networks. So, performance is at the heart of everything the company does: whether selecting servers, making routing decisions, or developing and deploying core software and new products. Behind all that is a fleet of numbers and graphs that our technical teams live and breathe daily. We'll share several examples of how watching these numbers have translated into big performance wins for customers, even by implementing small changes. We will share how shaving off milliseconds in global purge-from-edge, log processing, load balancing and other areas result in big performance gains and efficiency. At this session, you'll learn how to measure and monitor a network that's operating at a very large scale, and hopefully we can also help you avoid a couple mistakes we've learned from along the way.\n\nTed Middleton\nEdgeCast Networks\nTed is responsible for product management at EdgeCast and coordinates the definition, development, and launch of EdgeCast products and services.
