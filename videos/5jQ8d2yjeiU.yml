recordingDate: 1519830139
description: "Vue.js is a client side JavaScript framework that is developer friendly: a command line interface to create new projects, easy to learn concepts, great online documentation, and top of the league developer tools. All this will get you started in no time working on modular and maintainable apps. Under the hood there is a fast state of the art rendering engine applying unidirectional data flow and virtual DOM that eliminates manual optimizations. Transitions are already part of the core engine so your apps will look fancy, too! Join me for this talk to see how simple and advanced applications can look like. I also provide a brief overview of the ecosystem. We’ve started to use Vue.js in early 2016 and this talk is based on our day-to-day experience.\n\nAlexander Schwartz, msg systems ag\nAlexander Schwartz is Principal IT Consultant at msg systems.
