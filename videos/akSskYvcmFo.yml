language: English
recordingDate: 1632325460
description: "What’s the best experience of developing an application and deploying to Kubernetes as part of the “inner loop?” You want to make changes to source code and see them wiggle as quickly as possible. Is that even possible with the application deployed to Kubernetes? In this talk, we’ll explore tooling and process options that get you to this goal, making use of all the newest features of Spring Boot, but also of the various tools from the Kubernetes community.\n\nDave Syer, Senior Engineering Consultant at VMware"
