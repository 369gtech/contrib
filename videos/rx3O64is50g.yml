description: "In this talk, we will explore the techniques necessary to design and build CommonJS modules that work both in node.js and the browser using Browserify. We will look at both the general techniques needed, as well as a specific implementation with the Twilio module (npm install twilio), which is currently being converted to work both in node (REST API + utilities) and the browser (WebRTC + VoIP).\n\nhttp://2014.jsconf.us/"
