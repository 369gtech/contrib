This live coding session starts with a typical Java 8 application and runs up against and eventually overcomes the common hurdles:\n\nbuild system configuration\ndependency analysis with jdeps\ndependencies on internal APIs and Java EE modules\nsplit packages\nTo get the most out of this talk, you should have a good understanding of the module system basics - afterwards you will know how to approach your application's migration to Java 9 and the module system.\n\n \nNicolai Parlog \nFrom CodeFX\nNicolai is a thirty year old boy, as the narrator would put it (if he squints), who has found his passion in software development. He constantly reads, thinks, and writes about it, and codes for a living as well as for fun.\n\nNicolai is a freelancing developer, author, and trainer. He wrote The Java Module System with Manning (https://tiny.cc/jms), blogs about software development on codefx.org, has a YouTube channel (https://youtube.com/c/codefx), and is a long-tail contributor to several open source projects. You can hire him for all kinds of things (https://tiny.cc/nipafx)."
