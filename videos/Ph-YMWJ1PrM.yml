description: "Machine Learning is becoming an important workload, and developers are increasingly being tasked with moving the models to production. In this session we’ll walk you through the process of building machine learning models and show you how Azure ML enables tools like VS Code, to build ML models. More importantly, we’ll discuss how you can augment your data science teams to operationalize these machine learning models within your apps and incorporate the right DevOps practices for machine learning, often referred to as MLOps. \n\nExplore Deeper Content and Training -- https://aka.ms/learnatbuild\nLatest news: Azure data & AI -- https://aka.ms/Build21-CloudNativeDataAIBlog\n\n\nMicrosoft Build 2021"
