description: "Details\nAnother meeting is coming!\nAnd guess what? We are sure you’ll fall in love with it! 😉\nLet’s meet this Thursday, 13th of February (yeah, right before the St. Valentine's Day!) and spend this charming time together, learning new things and hanging out with friends!\n\n🎤TALKS\n👉Igor Kachura, Senior Software Engineer – Wix\nDeveloper with experience in web and mobile development. Last 1.5 year works with React Native-based projects in Wix\n\nReact Native for React Developers (RU)\nOver the past year and a half, I’ve been working a lot with React Native. In this talk, I am going to cover how I got into it and made the move from React to RN. I’ll explain how React Native differs from React for the web, and what to expect when developing with React Native.\n\n👉Natalia Tepluhina, Senior Frontend Engineer @ GitLab\nVue.js core team member, Google Developer Expert, conference speaker, and all this stuff. Also in love with writing docs ♥️\n\nThe Magic of RxJS (RU)\nRxJS is often considered as complicated but it's not true! It's just developed to deal with difficult asynchronous tasks. Let's try to learn this magic while building a simple game with RxJS.\n\n👉Anton Pets, Frontend Software Engineer @ Grammarly\nFront-end developer mainly focused on the web editor and desktop app while learning how to make code more reliable with the help of FP\n\nHow FP Made Grammarly Codebase Error-free & Predictable (RU)\nCrafting UI systems with a complex mutable state spread across the network is inherently difficult. This problem is still very new and thus doesn’t have clear answers. At Grammarly, we have found the methodology that lets us tackle this complexity while keeping our codebase error-free and predictable. Our approach combines the pragmatic usage of functional programming with static typing. I will show you how functional programming can solve typical front-end problems in an effective and elegant way."
