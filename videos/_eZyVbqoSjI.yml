description: "I Went to a Coffee Shop... and Ended Up in a Lab\n\nUser testing is a great platform for collaboration and bringing stakeholders in the mix. In this talk Ben will share how his team went from testing in a coffee shop as a minimum version all the way up to the lab set up in British Gas. It doesn't take a lot of money and effort to get a lab in a company.\n\nAbout the speaker: \nBen Franck http://about.me/PtitBen â€“ Experience Designer at British Gas with a severe case of UCD. Addicted to vinyls, SciFi, space, music, photography, beer & LEGO.\n\nAbout the conference:\nAt The UX Conference on February 20th 2018 in London we were exploring how to improve collaboration between designers and business stakeholders.
