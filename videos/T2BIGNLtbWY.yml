recordingDate: 1433784710
description: "In this panel session, learn about the work done so far to provide an open, community-accessible build and test system for developers who want to contribute to OpenJDK.  Itâ€™s a hard problem, but progress is being made. Come hear the participants from various organizations talk about what is happening and what else is needed. A lively debate with many opinions: guaranteed!\n\n\nAuthors:\nRichard Warburton\nRichard Warburton is a software developer who loves solving complex problems, but actively challenges how much of software development is dealing with day-to-day trivialities. Having obtained a PhD in the area of compiler optimizations and static analysis, he has been applying his abilities in industry. Initially on bytecode analysis software, and more recently on Java performance tuning tools. He actively involves himself in the London Java Community, and its Java Community Process Committee. He has been helping with the push to improve and complete the JSR 310 API and the expand community engagement with JSR 335.\nView more trainings by Richard Warburton at https://www.parleys.com/author/richard-warburton\n\nMartijn Verburg\nMartijn Verburg (aka 'the Diabolical Developer') herds Cats in the Java/open source communities and is constantly humbled by the creative power to be found there. Currently he resides in London where he co-leads the London JUG (a JCP EC member), runs a couple of open source projects & drinks too much beer at his local pub. You can find him online moderating at the Javaranch or discussing (ranting?) subjects on the Programmers Stack Exchange site. Most recently he's become a regular speaker at conferences on Java, open source and software development and has recently wrapped up his first Manning title - \"The Well-Grounded Java Developer\" with his co-author Ben Evans.\nView more trainings by Martijn Verburg at https://www.parleys.com/author/martijn-verburg\n\nStuart Marks\nStuart Marks is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Java\nPlatform Group at Oracle.
