description: "For the past two years Jam3 worked alongside Joy Kogawa and the NFB to create East of the Rockies, an augmented reality storytelling experience.\n\nEast of the Rockies is the first interactive AR game of its kind. The story takes users through a piece of Canadian history where Japanese Canadians were forced to leave their homes and live at internment camps during WWII.\n\nThis talk will cover the creation of the game: from concept and storyboarding, to the development process in Unity and various challenges and questions to consider from a creatorâ€™s perspective.\n\nAmelie Rosser\nCreative Developer, Jam3\nhttps://twitter.com/ixviii_io\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ixviii.io/\nhttps://github.com/amelierosser\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
