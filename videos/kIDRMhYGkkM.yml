description: 'It''s more important than ever to use a personal VPN - both for internet privacy and safely accessing your smart-home/IoT-stuff when you''re away from home. There''s no shortage of commercial VPN providers vying for your business - but no option is as satisfying (or secure) as rolling your own setup! In this session I''ll demonstrate how you can roll a personal VPN in just 10 minuter with Wireguard - the simple, understandable and elegant VPN system that recently was merged into the Linux kernel source code tree.'
