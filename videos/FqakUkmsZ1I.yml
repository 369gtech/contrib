description: "HotSpot promises to do wonders for us by Just-in-Time (JIT) compiling the \"right\" code for us, but how does it makes those decisions? And, perhaps more importantly, what happens when it's wrong? In this talk, you'll learn through running Java code how the JVM decides to compile your code and see firsthand some situations where the JVM may get it wrong and have to deoptimize.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/sfjava/\n\nJava Training & Resources for Developers:\nhttps://newcircle.com"
