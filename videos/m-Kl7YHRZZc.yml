description: "http://www.erlang-factory.com/berlin2016/iuri-fernandes-queiroz\n\nHave you imagined using a technology being capable of maintaining a ton of simultaneous network connections? Well, you must have heard of the BEAM. By running on the BEAM and taking advantage of OTP, Erlang and Elixir are excellent choices for highly concurrent applications. However, until recently, Elixir didn't provide a generic way to process a possibly infinite data stream concurrently.\n\nIn this talk you will learn about the recent development on tools so Elixir can handle this kind of problem in a simple, efficient and elegant way. We will see how to use GenStage and Flow and other default OTP abstractions to build a real life application.\n\nTalk objectives\n\nThe main objective is to show in a clear and accessible way all the potential that GenStage and Flow have to ease real-time processing of data with Elixir.\n\nTarget audience\n\nElixir enthusiasts, BEAMers interested in new tools to improve their workflow."
