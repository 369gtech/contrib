description: "As Angular developers we use decorators every day — from class decorators such as @Component, @Module, and @Directive, to property decorators like @Input and @Output. These little accessories to our code can be powerful mechanisms for keeping our applications simple and easy to understand. Let’s peek at how the core Angular decorators bring our code to life, and use that as a springboard for a discussion about creating our own magical wrappers in TypeScript.\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
