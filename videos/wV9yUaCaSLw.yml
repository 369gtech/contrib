recordingDate: 1501096105
description: "Katherine uses Eastern Philosophical models as radical lenses to challenge static, habitual thinking and gain insight into how the tech world might approach things differently.  In this brief talk, she explains how our tendency to handle agility as fixed pieces of work and projects, separated from the whole, can be counterproductive.\n\n\nKatherine Kirk is a solidly experienced independent Agile/Lean Consultant and international conference speaker. Her primary area of expertise lies in co-discovery and insight facilitation through exploring and combining eastern and tribal philosophy to find practical answers to tough, on-the-ground issues, specifically involving contextually driven edge-cases and the cultural interaction between hierarchical management and Agile/Lean teams. After gaining a first class BSc (Hons) in computing she completed post graduate studies in software engineering at University of Oxford and currently enjoys being an active participant of a community of Lean and Agile practitioners in Europe who explore and challenge the status quo through experimenting and collaborating."
