description: "Heartifacts is a Code & Supply conference that encourages intimate discussions about mental health, community building, career management, and other topics software professionals need to talk about more.\n\nLearn more about Heartifacts at https://heartifacts.codeandsupply.co and grab some Heartifacts logo merch at https://codeandsupply.co/x/hfmerch. Learn more about Code & Supply at https://www.codeandsupply.co.\n\n------\n\n\nEngineering managers are, almost by definition, highly capable and strongly driven individuals. These traits are indispensable to success in leading software engineering teams, but they are also the very traits that make engineering managers susceptible to burn out. People who can get things done often find themselves overwhelmed by their to-do lists.\n\nThis talk will combine the understanding from the trenches of Anjuan Simmons (who has been an engineering manager for more than 20 years) with the academic understanding of his wife, Dr. Aneika Simmons. Together, they will provide a framework for reducing burnout and consistently keeping stress levels in a managed state."
