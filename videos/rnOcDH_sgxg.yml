I had no knowledge of the code and a little experience with open source from a side project I developed myself.\n\nObviously, this was a very challenging task and I made a lot of mistakes in the process. The good thing is I learned a lot too.\n\nIn this talk, I will share with you some of the lessons I learned that I think can be valuable not only for open source but for our day-to-day work too."
