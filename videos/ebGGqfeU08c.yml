description: "When big companies decide to between Angular and React, and end up choosing Angular for their projects, they usually feel missing out on all the innovation happening in React state management and code organization ecosystem, which is all the best practices that were developed around using Redux with React.\nBut all of these ideas and practices actually CAN be used with Angular, and sometimes can even be better due to the power built into RXJS. In this talk we see how we can use Ngrx to get all the benefits of Redux, including using Redux libraries and developer tools. We also see how Ngrx and RXJS mix into Ngrx Effects to provide an experience that works even better than using Redux with React.\n\nWe also look into the common patterns and best practices to organize your Ngrx code, and make sure it's testable!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
