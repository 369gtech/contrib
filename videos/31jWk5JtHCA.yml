description: "Have you ever wondered how teams and individuals form a product vision? What soft skills do people with product vision have, and can these skills be nurtured and developed? Does company culture affect the personal qualities and values ​of its employees? Do our mindset and personal qualities affect our level of happiness?\n\nI have analyzed how various teams at JetBrains work and come up with a list of common qualities and values shared by all of our teams. Based on this experience, I will try to prove that the key factor in our products’ success is the mindset of the people who create these products.\n\nI will describe the special qualities that our people, teams, and the company as a whole exemplify, and how these talents can be cultivated and nurtured. I will also touch upon the dark side of such a flexible and informal process and illustrate the concept of a meaningful life as a part of happiness at work.\n\nAt my session you will discover: \n\n* a set of practices that you can apply to your team; \n* a set of personal soft skills that team members need to have product vision; and \n* a recipe for nurturing these skills on the individual, team and company levels."
