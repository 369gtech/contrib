title: 'Flight of the Flux: A Look at Reactor Execution Model'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538670880
description: "If you're familiar with the **Reactor** `Flux` API but have always wondered what exactly was happening at runtime, look no further! In this session, we'll observe various instances of the majestic `Flux` and `Mono` in their natural habitat, the JVM. We'll look past the APIs and Reactive Stream concepts, towards less abstract matters such as the Reactor execution model (is there even such a thing?). What is the difference between assembly time and execution time? What is work stealing? Why does nothing happen until we subscribe? What is operator fusion? Magnets, how do they even work? Come join us and we'll try to answer all of these questions, and more!\n\nSpeaker:\nSimon Basl√©\nStaff Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
