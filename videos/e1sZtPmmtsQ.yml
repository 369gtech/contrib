title: 'Spring Boot Omakase: A Fast-Paced “Chef’s Choice” Dive into Fun and Useful Topics!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027902
description: "\"Spring Boot has revolutionized the Java space and continues to do so, evolving constantly to increase developers’ superpowers and advance the state of production-grade software development.\n\nPresenting a dynamic technology before vastly different audiences often limits what can be proposed and presented. Let’s fix that!\n\nThis session is an omakase, a “chef’s choice” of key points and latest/coolest capabilities for developers in the Spring Boot ecosystem. Known by French chefs as m’étonner (“Astonish me!”), the goal is to combine useful patterns and new possibilities in one fast-paced live-coding adventure from which everyone leaves with something tasty to chew on. Come for the apps, stay for dessert, leave satisfied and excited for the next “course” of production software!\"\n\nMark Heckler, Spring Developer & Advocate at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/spring-boot-omakase-a-fastpaced-chefs-choice-dive-into-fun-and-useful-topics"
