recordingDate: 1571236382
description: "Enterprise app dev used to be simple: you’d build some servlets and JSPs, create a WAR, and SCP it to your server to deploy it. But then you needed better reliability, scalability, security, observability, and so many other ‘ilities. Complexity has exploded with microservices, cloud services, containers (the new ones), CI/CD pipelines, reactive, CAP theorem, ML pipelines, data analytics pipelines, data security, DevOps, etc. How can we regain some of the simplicity we used to have? \n\nIn this session, we'll show you how to regain some of the simplicity of the good ol' days by taking advantage of the latest and greatest in cloud services and Spring.\n\nSpeakers: James Ward; Developer Advocate, Google; Josh Long; Spring Developer Advocate, Pivotal; Matt Raible; Ope Source Developer, Okta\n\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/from-idea-to-dev-to-ops-eg-were-not-scping-wars-to-snowflake-servers-anymore"
