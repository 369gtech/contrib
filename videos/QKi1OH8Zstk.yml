description: "There are two types of RFID – those that use INDUCTIVE COUPLING like NFC and those that use RF like GEN2 UHF as per the title. NFC has been widely covered and exploited in the hacking scene, but UHF really has not, other than a few “long range” experiments. However, UHF is now being widely adopted for all kinds of interesting applications, from vehicle gateways on toll roads and border crossings to goods and inventory tracking in logistics. Even airline luggage will soon be sporting fancy e-paper tags with UHF tracking enabled, but how safe is that going to be? What research has been done in this area? Well, before hackers can start researching they need the tools, and this workshop will cover the first step in creating those tools… Building your own SDR controlled UHF RFID reader gives you the power to dig right down into the guts of the protocol and start fooling around… Who knows what you’ll find? We will be implementing a reader using the BladeRF platform, and will cover “gotchas”, tips and tricks to better understand how to get this working and your UHF hacking project under way.\n\n=== \n\nAdam Laurie aka rfidiot aka Major Malfunction is an old school hacker who’s been breaking things since before PCs and the Internet were a thing. His speciality is hardware / embedded reverse engineering in general, and low level OTA protocols and crypto in particular. He has spoken over the years on Bluetooth,RFID/NFC, Magstripe, Zigbee, DVB-T/S and many other subjects. He has been DEF CON Quartermasterfor over 20 years and runs the London DC chapter DC4420. In his spare time he likes to hack stuff."
