description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nKubeflow is an end-to-end platform for Machine Learning on Kubernetes, with the goal of making deployments of machine learning workflows simple, portable and scalable. It is gaining significant traction among data scientists and ML engineers and has outstanding community and industry support. \n\nIn this webinar we will showcase a simplified data science experience with advanced data management on Kubeflow. You will learn how to:\n* Get started with MiniKF, a production-ready, full-fledged, local Kubeflow deployment that installs in minutes\n* Easily execute an end-to-end Tensorflow example with Kubeflow Pipelines locally\n* Learn about data versioning and reproducibility during Pipeline runs*\n Run a complete Kubeflow Pipelines workflow without K8s-specific knowledge."
