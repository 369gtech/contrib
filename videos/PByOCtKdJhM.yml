title: '[DevFest Nantes 2019] Building better products faster DevUx is the new DevOps'
language: French
recordingDate: 1572525722
description: "Speaker : Yu Ling Cheng\n\nFront-end development has gotten trickier over the years. As new frameworks enable more complex behaviour, UX expectations have also risen. Yet, we still work the old way: Product defines features, designers make mock-ups, then developers integrate them. Side effects include: blocking dependencies, rework, misunderstanding, frustration, for everyone involved.\n\nIn this talk, we will provide you with a proven starter kit to improve all your future collaborations, among other things how to:\n\n- define the right process from the first concept of the feature to its design to its implementation on the app\n- define the perfect mock-up for painless design handoff\n- provide technical insights during the design process\n- involve the designer in your development process for a finishing touch\n\nJoin our movement and start growing a DevUx culture on your projects: build better, work faster, be happier!"
