description: "Every web developer should know about typical attacks such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery, or Cross-Site Scripting. And even though those risks still exist, the bad guys worked on finding new twists to old attacks, or even find new kinds of vulnerabilities on a web site.\nIn this session, we will show and discuss several of those new vectors, including attacks against Angular applications, Clickjacking, abusing external links, XSS via file uploads, and a few more. Technology never stops to evolve, so it's crucial to stay on top of current developments."
