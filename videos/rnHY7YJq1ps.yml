recordingDate: 1541257469
description: 'One of Java''s most iconic features is the Automated Memory Management, better known as Garbage Collection. But how is Garbage made? and when we have too much Garbage how do we go about profiling Garbage generation and optimizing hotspots? In this talk we will cover: - The journey of Garbage: object creation to collection - Allocation profilers: pros, cons and related confusions - Allocation elimination and reduction techniques You will leave this talk scented of lavender, relaxed but invigorated, and wondering where the next cup of coffee might come from.'
