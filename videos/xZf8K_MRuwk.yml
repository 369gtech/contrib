description: "Speaker: Andy Clarke, @Malarkey\r\n\r\n\"Style guide\" is an umbrella term for several types of design documentation; static style or visual identity guides, voice and tone, front-end code guidelines or component/pattern libraries. These all offer something different but often have something in common. They look ugly enough to have been designed by someone who enjoys configuring a router.\r\n\r\nIn this fast-paced talk, Andy will demonstrate ways to improve how style guides look and make them better at communicating design information to creatives without it getting in the way of what technical people need.\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker:\r\n\r\nAndy Clarke is one of the best known web designers because of his design work and contributions to the web design industry. He’s given more than sixty presentations at conferences all over the world. As well as numerous articles in web design publications, he’s written three books on website design and development including Transcending CSS and Hardboiled Web Design. In 2017 he relocated from the UK to Sydney to head the design team at Ansarada.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/SingaporeCSS/events/244533222/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/eGJO/"
