description: "HAI 1.0: HIL-based Augmented ICS Security Dataset\n\nHyeok-Ki Shin, Woomyo Lee, Jeong-Han Yun, and HyoungChun Kim, The Affiliated Institute of ETRI\n\nDatasets are paramount to the development of AI-based technologies. However, the available cyber-physical system (CPS) datasets are insufficient. In this paper, we introduce HAI dataset 1.0 (https://github.com/icsdataset/hai), the first CPS dataset collected using the HAI testbed. The HAI testbed comprises three physical control systems, namely a GE turbine, Emerson boiler, and FESTO water treatment systems, combined through a dSPACE hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator. We built an environment to remotely and automatically manipulate all components of a feedback control loop. Using this environment, we collected HAI dataset 1.0 while repeatedly running a large number of benign and malicious scenarios for a long period with minimal human effort. We will continue to improve the HAI testbed and release new versions of the HAI dataset.\n\nView the full CSET '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/cset20/workshop-program"
