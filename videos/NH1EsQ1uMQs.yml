description: "MobileOptimized 2020, Online – November 6-7, 2020\n\niOS SwiftUI 2.0. Total adaptation of an existing iOS app, Anna Zharkova\n\nSwiftUI is a new trendy framework, that uses declarative API for building entire apps from top to bottom. Adapting your existed app or featuring new one may be very tricky and have many pitfalls. In my report I would like to talk, how to optimize such work and to minify risks during the process.\n\nSwiftUI uses a rather different way to create UI and support it functionality during application’s lifecycle than it was used in a classic iOS application. It doesn’t use a conception of UIViewController any more, but provides a conception of declarative and data-driven UI with View-State data flows (MVI/Redux state application).\n\nIt is a powerful toolkit that is actively promoted by Apple company. It can become a leading technology in the future and preferred solution for iOS development. So it can be useful to know how to combine your existed application or to create new ones and how to avoid many potential pitfalls.\n\nI would like to present the practical solution of many problems that can be faced by developers during the adaptation of an existed iOS application with it entire functionality: - screens and modules - sharing same logic between views - business logic - navigation - configuration of the modules.\n\nLess theory, more practice."
