description: "Shellcodes are short executable stubs that are used in various attack scenarios, whenever code execution is possible. After briefly recalling how they work in general and what interesting things they can do, besides obviously running a reverse-shell, we'll have to deal with the reality that shellcodes are usually not particularly stealthy, due in part to the very suspicious presence of non-printable characters. In a tutorial-like fashion, we'll address increasingly more complex constraints. As a reward, we reveal new methods for writing in particular alphanumeric shellcodes and attacking platforms for which (to the best of our knowledge) no such shellcode was previously known.\n\nDon't know anything about constrained shellcodes? Do not worry: we'll start from the ground up. Black-belt in shellcoding? We have you covered, stay until the end were we'll get our hands dirty!\n\nHadrien Barral\nHadrien Barral is an R&D engineer, focusing on Operating Systems, Security and High-Assurance software.
