title: 'Piotr Stapp - Cloud is Like Alcohol @ DevConf 2018'
recordingDate: 1539019397
description: "This is our story. We get the A-Team and we give them what they asked. First days were awesome. Fascination, a lot of new ideas, simple PoC and bunch of blog posts. But to be fair we knew nothing about the cloud. 12 months passed and we have learned a lot, really a lot. And today we would like to share our knowledge and experience. Without bullshit and marketing stuff. We will show you what worked and more importantly what didn’t. Buzzwords (Docker, k8s, serverless, PaaS, DevOps, magic&tricks, Oh my God!, F…K) live fast and die young. In our session, we will tell you why a cloud is like alcohol. When it is rather a cheap wine and when it is the best whiskey in the world. In FinAi we tasted them all and we know how to prevent a hangover.\n\nDevConf 2018 (http://devconf.pl)\n26-28 September 2018"
