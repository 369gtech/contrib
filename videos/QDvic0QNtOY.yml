title: 'CppCon 2018:Nicolas Fleury & Mathieu Nayrolles “Better C++ using Machine Learning on Large Projects”'

description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nPreventing defects to reach consumers is one of the most important task of any application developer. Using machine learning and pattern matching we attempt to automatically prevent defects from reaching the central code repository by intercepting them at commit-time. In this talk, we present an approach to detect, and resolve, defects in large C++ projects. Our approach, when evaluated on past contributions, was able to detect ~65% of the commits containing defects. In addition, this project allowed us to improve our C++ practices by discovering new guidelines that are applicable for our application domain, in our case AAA game development.\n— \nNicolas Fleury, Ubisoft Montreal\nTechnical Architect\n\nNicolas has 15 years of experience in the video game industry, more years in the software industry in telecoms, in speech recognition and in computer assisted surgery. Technical Architect on Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six Siege for 7 years, he also worked on games like Prince of Persia and has been behind multiple collaboration initiatives at Ubisoft. He presented at CppCon \"C++ in Huge AAA Games\", \"Rainbow Six Siege: Quest for Performance\" and \"Introduction to Sharpmake\".\n\n\nMathieu Nayrolles, Ubisoft Montreal\nTechnical Architect\n\nMathieu has 7 years of experience in software quality and productivity. He obtained his Ph.D from the Intelligent System Logging and Monitoring lab (Concordia, Montréal, Canada) in 2018 and he's now a Technical Architect dedicated to Research & Development on software quality and productivity. He presented at various international scientific conferences such as SANER (Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering), MSR (Mining Software repositories) or WCRE (Working Conference on Reverse Engineering). He also wrote several books on open-source technologies such as Angular, Solr or Magento.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
