At age 14 he learned PHP to create a registration website for his game server only to learn SQL Injection the hard way. Since then, the most important missions he went on was being the CTO (aka the solo developer) of an education startup called Responde AÃ­ and building a banking system almost from scratch using mainly Elixir at Stone, a brazillian fintech that did an IPO at NASDAQ in 2018.\n\n---\n\nCode Mesh V\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshio"
