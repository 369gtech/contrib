description: "CF + CNI: How to Integrate Your Own Networking Solution - Angela Chin, Pivotal\n\nWith the adoption of Container Networking Interface (CNI) into Cloud Foundry, it has become easier for third party networking plugins to integrate. CNI provides an abstraction between container runtimes and networking plugins, meaning that any plugin that abides by the CNI specification should be able to be swapped in place of the “batteries-included” option of Silk.\n\nHowever, the reality is far more complex. Most networking plugins introduce network policy and other SDN features which are controlled by long-running daemons that must be packaged as BOSH jobs. Third party plugins must also respect existing Cloud Foundry networking concepts-- Application Security Groups (ASGs) and Container to Container Networking. In this talk, we will go over both how to package your plugin as a BOSH release and highlight several integration points for respecting existing networking in Cloud Foundry.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyr/cf-cni-how-to-integrate-your-own-networking-solution-angela-chin-pivotal"
