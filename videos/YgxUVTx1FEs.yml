description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe Hitchhikers Guide to Container Security - Tunde Olu-Isa, Oteemo & Jed Salazar, Isovalent\n\nSpeakers: Jed Salazar, Tunde Olu-Isa\nYou’ve seen the Kubernetes security announcements: CAP_NET_RAW rogue advertisements, runc breakout, hostNetwork hijack.. oh my! It seems that the best you can do is keep up with patching, but often these vulnerabilities take advantage of overly permissive Pods. In this talk, we’ll introduce the riskiest privileges that Pods can request, what allowing those privileges means for your cluster, and how to create security policy to protect your cluster and its users. If you’ve ever wondered, “what does enabling privileged actually mean?”, hitch a ride on a whirlwind and fun guide about the basics of Pod security and how you can easily configure security policy to keep Kubernetes safe. Any level of experience can benefit from learning about the riskiest privileges Pods can request and reducing the threats in your environment by running your workloads safely."
