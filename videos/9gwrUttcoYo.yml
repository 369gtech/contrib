recordingDate: 1541885164
description: "Everyone wants to use artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), but none of us are quite sure where to start. These new technologies are exciting, but most people don't have the time to become a data scientist, and nobody really wants to learn a new language. In this session, we'll put the buzzwords aside and expose where we actually are with AI/ML today, and what Node.js developers can realistically use and expect from these emerging technologies.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBrian Holt, Senior Cloud Developer Advocate, Microsoft\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video."
