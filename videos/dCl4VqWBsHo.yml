description: "Aaron Wieczorek, United States Digital Service\n\nHow do you monitor systems that don't want to be monitored or ones that you don't have internal access to? Why monitor these systems at all? The United States Digital Service finds the truth and tells the truth, and fights fires across government, even when those fires don't want to be found. We put together a system to black box monitor all 25,000 .GOV domains and then expanded to perform more robust monitoring of important citizen-facing, government-provided services so we can go where the work is and restore services. In the process, we're hoping to change the culture and prove the value of SRE teams across government. This is how we're doing it.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
