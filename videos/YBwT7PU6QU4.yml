title: 'DEF CON 27 Conference - Wenxiang Qian - Breaking Google Home Exploit It with SQLite'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573862525
description: "Over the past years, our team has used several new approaches to identify multiple critical vulnerabilities in SQLite and Curl, two of the most widely used basic software libraries. These two sets of vulnerabilities, which we named \"Magellan\" and \"Dias\" respectively, affect many devices and software. We exploited these vulnerabilities to break into some of the most popular Internet of things devices, such as Google Home with Chrome. We also exploited them on one of the most widely used Web server (Apache+PHP) and one of the most commonly used developer tool (Git).\n\nIn this presentation, we will share how we try to crack the Google Home from both hardware and software aspects, get and analyze the newest firmware, solve the problem, and introduce new methods to discover vulnerabilities in SQLite and Curl through Fuzz and manual auditing. Through these methods, we found \"Magellan\", a set of three heap buffer overflow and heap data disclosure vulnerabilities in SQLite ( CVE-2018-20346, CVE-2018-20505 CVE-2018-20506 ) We also found \"Dias\", two remote memory leak and stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Curl ( CVE-2018-16890 and CVE-2019-3822 ). Considering the fact that these vulnerabilities affect many systems and software, we have issued a vulnerability alert to notify the vulnerable vendor to fix it.\n\nWe will disclose the details of \"Magellan\" and \"Dias\" for the first time and highlight some of our new vulnerability exploitation techniques. In the first part, we will introduce the results of our analysis on hardware, how to get the newest firmware from simulating an update request, and attack surface of Google Home. We will show how to use Magellan to complete the remote exploit of Google Home, we will also give a brefing talk about how to use Dias to complete the remote attack on Apache+PHP and Git. Finally, we will summarize our research and provide some security development advice to the basic software library developers.\n\nWenxiang Qian\nWenxiang Qian is a senior security researcher at the Tencent Blade Team.
