description: "Dynamic programming is used heavily in Artificial Intelligence! Famous problems like the knapsack problem, problems involving the shortest path conundrum and of course the fibonacci sequence can all benefit from the solutions dynamic programming provides. I'm going to go over a short demo then talk about the types of dynamic programming and when to use it. \n\nCode for this video (with jupyter notebook):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/dynamic_programming\n\nPlease Subscribe!
