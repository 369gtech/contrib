title: 'DEF CON 29 ICS Village - Lauren Zabierek -  Collaborative Cyber Defense & Enhanced Threat Intel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632164398
description: 'The recent ransomware and cyber espionage campaigns prove that a fundamental redesign of our domestic cyber defensive posture is both necessary and urgent to protect against future cyber threats.  As such, we believe the time is now to develop an integrated, networked approach to collaborative defense and intelligence analysis and sharing between the federal government, state and local governments, and the private sector. My team of student researchers and I conducted several interviews with stakeholders in both the state and federal governments and the private sector and poured over existing literature.  We''ve  created a roadmap toward this vision, answering how a 21st century threat can be tackled by the tools available in its own time.  We don''t purport to have all the answers, but we would be interested in feedback from the community on the feasiblity and desirability of these ideas.'
