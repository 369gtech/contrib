description: "In this Coding Challenge, I attempt an implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the optimal path between two points in a 2D grid.  I begin by explaining the mechanics of how the algorithm works, look at pseudo-code, and then write the algorithm in JavaScript using the p5.js library for rendering.\n\nPart 2 focuses on adding obstacles (walls) to the grid as well as functionality for moving diagonally.\n.\nIn Part 3, I look at ways to improve the visual design and invite you to put your own spin on it.\n\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/EaZxUCWAjb0\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/jwRT4PCT6RU\n\nOnline demo: https://codingtrain.github.io/AStar/\nCode: https://github.com/CodingTrain/AStar\n\nTo see the whole unedited version of this challenge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4yQYiAECnM&t=34m50s\n\nSupport this channel on Patreon: https://patreon.com/codingtrain\n\nSend me your questions and coding challenges!: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Topics\n\nContact: https://twitter.com/shiffman\n \nA* Algorithm on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm\nArtificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach: http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/\nMy Maze Generation Coding Challenge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4\n\nSource Code for the all Video Lessons: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code\n\np5.js: https://p5js.org/\nProcessing: https://processing.org\n\nFor More Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\nFor an Intro to Programming using p5.js: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/2el5/"
