title: 'What every Visual Studio Code user should know about GitHub | BOD116'
recordingDate: 1590413818
description: "GitHub isn't just for source code anymore: it is now a core part of your planning and development toolchain, and so is your text editor. Unfortunately, GitHub and the editor are two separate things. But what if they weren't? What if your editor was a window not just to your code, but to all the code in the world? Over the past year, Visual Studio Code has been hard at work delivering tighter and more seamless integration with GitHub. From viewing diffs and commit history, to managing PRs and conducting code reviews to creating Issues and setting up Actions.\n\nIn this session, we'll take a look at the features and extensions for VS Code that might change the way you think.\n\nMicrosoft Learn -- https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nMicrosoft Docs -- https://docs.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nChannel 9 -- https://channel9.msdn.com/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\n\n\nRelated Sessions\nINT167B -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT167B?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco\nINT167C -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT167C?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco\nINT167A -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/INT167A?wt.mc_id=yt_PLlrxD0HtieHhlbuh4wiUVHGeVw8vY4Rco"
