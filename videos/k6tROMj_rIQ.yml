title: '#DCBERLIN18 202 Lopez THE AUTHENTIC DEVELOPER_DAY2'
recordingDate: 1534491122
description: "Anastasia Lopez, Android Developer, Movivo\n\nTHE AUTHENTIC DEVELOPER\nIntermediate / Best Practices / Code Quality / Talk\n\nShame is the most powerful, master emotion. It’s the fear that we’re not good enough. Vulnerability is about showing up and being seen. It’s tough to do that when we’re terrified about what people might see or think. Brené Brown We live in a society that's motivated by comparison, in a culture in which everything you do is never enough, one in which you are constantly engaging with people using shame, either to shame or to be shamed, and in which making yourself vulnerable – exposing your fears and uncertainties, taking emotional risks - is considered a form of weakness, and something most of us want to run away from. But as an Android developer you cannot run away from being vulnerable. No matter your level, you will be constantly exposed, you are constantly vulnerable. With pull requests, stack overflow (questions or answers), blog posts, talks.. You are being vulnerable. Unfortunately that means you are also more exposed to being shamed, to being told off on how wrong you are, or how little knowledge you have. This kind of behavior can be toxic and can lead to people feeling insecure about themselves (hello impostor syndrome). It's not only you. This is something that affects all of us the moment we decide to be developers.And it has an impact in our growth, our jobs and the way we interact back with the community. I want to explore what shame and vulnerability really are, how we perceive it and how it affect us in the core of our interactions and our job. What makes Android developers vulnerable. Learn the tools we are already using to fight against shaming behaviour, and what we can do in our day to day job to make it even better. With this talk I want everyone to leave the talk knowing they are good enough, they are brave enough, and they can put a stop to toxic behavior we don't realize we do."
