description: "\"Debezium (noun | de·be·zi·um | /d?:?b?:zi??m/) - secret ingredient for change data capture\"\n\nUpdating caches and full-text indexes, synchronizing data between microservices, maintaining different read models in a CRQS-style architecture, feeding operational data to your analytics tools -- just a few use cases which benefit so much from streaming the changes from your datastore.\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn what change data capture (CDC) is about and how it can be implemented using Debezium, an open-source CDC solution based on Apache Kafka. Find out how Debezium captures all the changes from datastores such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB, how to react to the change events in near real time, and how Debezium is designed to not compromise on data correctness and completeness also if things go wrong.\n\nGunnar Morling is a software engineer and open-source enthusiast by heart. He’s leading the Debezium project, a tool for change data capture (CDC). As part of the Hibernate team, he contributes to Hibernate Search, OGM and Validator. Gunnar is the spec lead for Bean Validation 2.0 (JSR 380). In his spare time he leads the MapStruct project. Prior to joining Red Hat, he worked on a wide range of Java EE projects in the logistics and retail industries. He’s based in Hamburg, Germany."
