Frontend developers demand that APIs are simple and extensible, leading to either constant upkeep or unsound, complex code.\n\nWe will walk through a case study of creating an API in Scala for searches through the use of a DSL (Domain Specific Language). By taking inspiration from Lisp, language design and type systems, we will implement an API which will be secure, simple and extensible.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/yilin-wei/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - YILIN WEI\n\n\nYilin is a polyglot developer which means that his favourite language is constantly fluctuating. He is continually amazed at the variations in syntax that language designers have come up with and sees nothing wrong with brackets. Needless to say, he is an emacs user.\n\nMore on Yilin Wei: https://codesync.global/speaker/yilin-wei/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
