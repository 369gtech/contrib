description: "Speaker: Talya Gendler\nA deep dive into Spring Insight's plugins for Spring Integration and RabbitMQ\n \nSpring Insight uses a plug-in architecture to collect, correlate, and analyze performance metrics from your application.\nIn this video we will use two sample applications  which use Spring Integration extensively and see the capabilities of the plugins for Spring Integration as well as for RabbitMQ.\nThe plugins are available here.\n \nThe Spring Integration Plugin for Spring Insight provides deep visibility into the flow of data in your application and between applications,\nwhile tracking various Spring Integration components such as channels, gateways, transformers, service activators, and more. \nIt also tracks the message payload types and message ids.\n \nThe RabbitMQ Plugin for Spring Insight allows for monitoring RabbitMQ Java client libraries at the code-level. \nUsing this plugin you can monitor your application's performance around publishing and receiving messages through RabbitMQ.\n \nThe Spring Integration and RabbitMQ plugins combined provide a powerful tool for tracking how a distributed asynchronous application is performing.\nWatch this video to see how."
