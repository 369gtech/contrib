title: 'CSSconf EU 2017 | Ivana McConnell: CSS and the hierarchy problem: What makes a CSS developer?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495012837
description: "http://2017.cssconf.eu/speakers/ivana-mc-connell.html\n\nThis talk is about hierarchies: as CSS hurtles toward being object- and systems-oriented, the titles and responsibilities of designer and developer become much more fluid and yet, we continue to categorise. We draw lines between front and back end, between CSS and Javascript (“CSS isn’t _real_ development”), and even between CSS disciplines, but why? Furthermore, we implicitly draw these lines between white male developers and everyone else. This results in damaging hierarchies that threaten to devalue the work we do in diversifying CSS — both as a language and as a community."
