description: "This presentation by Holden Karau took place at Lambda World Seattle on September 18th, 2018 at the Living Computers Museum in Washington. \n\nBringing the Jewels of the Python World to Scala with Spark\n\nWith the new Apache Arrow integration in PySpark 2.3, it is now starting become reasonable to look to the Python world and ask “what else do we want to steal besides tensorflow”, or as a Python developer look and say “how can I get my code into production without it being rewritten into a mess of Java?”. Regardless of your specific side(s) in the JVM/Python divide, collaboration is getting a lot faster, so lets learn how to share! In this brief talk we will examine sharing some of the wonders of Spacy with the JVM world, which still has a somewhat lackluster set of options for NLP & deep learning.\n\nFollow: \n-https://www.twitter.com/lambda_world \n-https://www.twitter.com/47deg\n-https://www.twitter.com/holdenkarau"
