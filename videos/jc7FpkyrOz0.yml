title: 'Linux Security and How Web Browser Sandboxes Really Work - Patricia Aas'
recordingDate: 1499244237
description: "The Linux Security and Isolation APIs have become the basis of some of the most useful features server-side, providing the isolation required for efficient containers.\n\nHowever, these APIs also form the basis of the Chromium Sandbox on Linux, and we will study them in that context. This is the sandbox used in the Vivaldi, Brave, Chrome and Opera browsers among others. The Chromium Sandbox has a very platform specific implementation, using the platform APIs available to construct it. In this talk we will describe the requirements of the Chromium Sandbox in detail and go through how the Linux implementation fulfills these requirements."
