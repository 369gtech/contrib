However, has anyone ever looked at it from the perspective of the bot? In this session we will be assisted by Pepper to educate you on behalf of all bots on best practices when creating intelligent automated programs that will benefit us all. You will learn how to design and create conversational AI. There will be a lot of discussions, coding and live demonstrations around best practises concerning the language, expectations and personality of a bot. Chatbots enables a more engaging and personalised experience for both customers and employees, and through analytics, we can help the bot to learn and improve."
