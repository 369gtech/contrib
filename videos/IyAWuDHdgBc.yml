description: "You’re a database person doing mostly PL/SQL stuff? You’ve been doing Oracle Application Express (Oracle APEX) for several years but always struggle with web or browser things? Or you’re a front-end person who always wanted to understand the connection between APEX front end and back end? This session is for you! Some examples:\n• What browser dev tools are\n• Client-side APEX debugging (JavaScript, dynamic actions)\n• Inspecting AJAX calls delivering data from the back end\n• Performance analysis of client-side code\n• Checking accessibility of pages, regions, components\n• Testing JavaScript before including it in APEX development\n• Changing existing or adding new CSS for styling your app\n\n\n\nA recording provided by the awesome APEX community, that built a virtual 24 hour conference called APEX@Home held on April 16th 2019.\n\nWith 24 world renowned speakers and nearly 5000 virtual attendees, this event was a huge success.
