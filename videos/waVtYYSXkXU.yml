description: "P2P Docker Image Distribution in Hybrid Cloud Environment with Kraken - Yiran Wang & Cody Gibb, Uber \n\nDocker image is a foundational building block of container based infrastructure, but distributing high volume of docker images in a multi-zone, hybrid cloud system has been a scaling problem for many. In this talk, we will walk through different approaches we investigated for distributing docker images and introduce Uberâ€™s own solution, Kraken, a P2P docker registry loosely based on BitTorrent protocol, and capable of distributing terabytes of images within seconds. This talk will cover: - Image distribution solutions and their characteristics - Whether you need a p2p solution - Architecture, performance and security features of Kraken - How to deploy Kraken in a Kubernetes cluster \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPcz"
