title: '"[PATCH v22] Landing a Large Series" - Casey Schaufler (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579160313
description: "Casey Schaufler\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/137/\n\nMost development efforts in the Linux kernel are self contained and reasonably small. Review usually involves a few interested developers and the relevant maintainer. Making a large infrastructure change is another matter. It can involve multiple sub-systems and a score of maintainers, all with their own development priorities. Casey Schaufler has spent the past seven years reworking the Linux security modules infrastructure. In this talk he shares his experience dealing with the long development process, unresponsive or hostile maintainers, and surrounding technologies that change without warning. He offers recommendations on how to address conflicting feedback and identify when progress is stalled.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
