Unfortunately, Parcel 1 had some major design flaws that led to the creation of Parcel 2, a ground-up rewrite of Parcel which aims to resolve those design flaws whilst also creating a bundler that can scale to the size of companies like Atlassian and Adobe and beyond. A new plugin system, bundler targets, optional configuration, stable caches, improved scope-hoisting, improved developer experience and better performance are just a few of the things we’ve been working on for the last 3 years.\nIn this talk I’ll glance over how Parcel works and talk about a couple of the largest and most exciting new features in Parcel 2.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 🏆 🏆  Platinum Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\n🏆 🏆  Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nHarness → https://harness.io/\nBuddy → https://buddy.works/\nSonarSource → https://www.sonarsource.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nSentry → https://sentry.io\n\n🏆  Silver Sponsors\nMoogsoft → https://www.moogsoft.com/"
