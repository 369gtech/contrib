description: "Smart brackets, autoindent, templates: your IDE constantly fights the fundamentally broken design of programs-as-pure-text. Why can you ever mismatch a bracket? Why is indentation hard-coded in source files? This session introduces Stride, a new free Java-like language. Stride’s novelty lies not in its language features but in the editing interaction. Stride’s unique frame-based editor makes you more productive, with faster program entry, better readability, and fewer errors. The implementation in the Greenfoot IDE is aimed at education, but the principles are just as applicable to Java and professional programming. If this technology is successful, your IDE might one day look like this. Come and decide if this is the future of programming.\n\nSpeakers:\nNeil Brown, Research Fellow, University of Kent\nI work as a computing education research at the University of Kent. Our group produces the educational Java IDEs \"BlueJ\" and \"Greenfoot\". More recently, I have been working on a new \"frame-based\" editor in Greenfoot 3 for a new JVM language, Stride. The editor is entirely built in JavaFX.\n\nMichael Kölling, Professor, University of Kent\nMichael Kölling is a Professor at the School of Computing, University of Kent, in Canterbury, UK. He holds a PhD in computer science from Sydney University, and has worked in Australia, Denmark and the UK. Michael’s research interests are in the areas of object-oriented systems, programming languages, software tools, computing education and HCI. He has published numerous papers on object-orientation and computing education topics and is the author and co-author of two Java textbooks. Michael is the lead developer of BlueJ and Greenfoot, two educational programming environments. He is a UK National Teaching Fellow, Fellow of the UK Higher Education Academy, Oracle Java Champion, and a Distinguished Educator of the ACM. In 2013, he received the ACM SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contribution to Computer Science Education. Michael is a founding member of 'Computing At School', a UK organisation furthering computing teaching at school level."
