description: "Thanks to our Community Sponsors: Honeycomb.io and CircleCI.com\n\nSpeakers: Christian McCarrick (VP Engineering, Auth0), Camille Fournier (Managing Director, Two Sigma), Lara Hogan (Co-Founder, Wherewithall), Rachana Kumar (VP Engineering, Etsy).\n\nAt the core of an engineering managers’ role is the responsibility to ensure the happiness of your teams. As a leader, you’re expected to shield your teams from outside noise and create a stable environment for work - but what happens when there are situations too big for you to resolve?\n\nCompanies may be taken over, recessions may take place, and even pandemics may occur - all of which can lead to disruptions in your colleagues’ personal and professional lives.\n\nIn this panel we’ll take a look at how to lead engineering teams in times of uncertainty, understanding that times of change affect people in different ways due to their personal circumstances, and identify the responsibilities of leaders during these situations."
