State-of-the-art DNNs have been found to achieve high accuracy on tasks in computer vision and natural language processing, even outperforming humans on object recognition tasks. Concurrently, the increasing complexity and sophistication of DNNs is predicated on significant power consumption, model size and computing resources. For example, since 2012, the training complexity of AI models has increased by 350,000x. These factors have been found to limit deep learning’s performance in real-time applications, in large-scale systems, and on low-power devices.\nFurthermore, many low-end and cost-effective devices do not have the resources to execute DNN inference, causing users to sacrifice privacy and offload processing to the cloud. Application developers, software engineers and algorithm architects must now create intelligent solution that deal with strict latency constraints, such as in smart city, mobility and healthcare applications which often require that inference be performed in a matter of milliseconds [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:33 Embedded AI 101\n02:06 Deep learning models are growing rapidly\n03:05 These demands force AI to the cloud\n03:50 Edge computing challenges\n04:27 Time to deploy AI on edge devices\n05:01 Edge computing solutions: small is the new big\n05:31 Designing compact deep learning models\n06:40 Where does this fit in an ML/AI workflow?\n07:25 Levels of optimization\n08:29 Types of optimization\n10:07 Optimization benchmarks - computer vision\n11:15 Accelerating autonomous perception\n11:53 AI on low cost, low power chips\n13:07 Bringing AI to daily life\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1261/small-is-the-new-big-designing-compact-deep-learning-models\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#DeepLearning #DeepNeuralNetworks #DNNs #AI #AIModels #ML #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #Programming\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
