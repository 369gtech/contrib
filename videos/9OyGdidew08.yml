description: "In this talk I would like to share my experience on how from PM perspective you can ensure project success from the very beginning. Most of experienced managers probably noticed that some projects seem are doomed not even started, some need more effort to arrange. I shall not be talking about standard PM things like Zero sprint or project Initiation must activities, I’ll take a different angle – have you ever thought when a project really starts for the team? What feelings team members have, how you are impacting them ..?\n\nAbout the speaker: Certified Scrum, PRINCE2, PMP and IBM Senior PM. Blockchain consultant. 13+ years’ experience in the IT industry with a focus on the development of SW products, 9 of them purely PM. 25+ implemented projects acting in different roles and applying different PM methods. Working in various environments with global teams, including Deutsche Bank, British Gas Group, Honda Europe, Fluor, VEON and etc. Currently concentrated on Cognitive stuff. Public speaker starting from 2008 Oracle days in Lithuania. Responsible for 23 people as People (line) manager in IBM.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardmelman/"
