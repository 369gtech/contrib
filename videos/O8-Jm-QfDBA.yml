description: "Spring Data REST provides a solid foundation to build domain-driven REST webservices leveraging hypermedia. It takes away the boilerplate part of the development and allows you to concentrate and easily hook code to cover more advanced scenarios, like custom state transitions. The talk is going to look into which means the library provides to easily integrate manually coded REST resources, tweak representations and work with lookup types (database backed value types) and especially focusses on the features added in recent releases.\n\nOliver Gierke - Spring Data Project Lead, OpenSource developer, Musicianâ€¦ Soul Power!\n\n[EFQ-9530]"
