description: "We will explore How Rio Tinto is turning data into information and using that information to manage and control mining and manufacturing physical assets globally. We will discuss the convergence of traditional IT (information technology) platforms and heavy industry OT (operations technology), Rio Tintos automated Mine of the Future concepts as well as our Big Data driven remote manufacturing optimization practices. How do you centralize expertise to remotely optimize manufacturing processes on 5 continents?; How can fleets of automated drones and lighter-than-air dirigibles improve mining efficiency?; How are autonomous vehicles and other mining equipment improving productivity and safety?, are all questions which will all be explored.\n\nDon't miss an upload!
