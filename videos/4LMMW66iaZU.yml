description: "One day we woke up and things were different. Maybe it happened overnight, maybe it took many years. Suddenly we are scripting against thousands of Virtual Machines from the command line while creating things today with JavaScript in the browser that were impossible yesterday. LiveScript becomes JavaScript becomes ES6 and now we’re compiling C++ to JS. Join Scott Hanselman as he explores the relationship between the Cloud and the Browser, many Languages and one Language, how it might all fit together and what might come next.\n\nScott is a web developer who has been blogging at http://hanselman.com for over a decade. He works on Azure and ASP.NET for Microsoft out of his home office in Portland. Scott has three podcasts, http://hanselminutes.com for tech talk, http://thisdeveloperslife.com on developers’ lives and loves, and http://ratchetandthegeek.com for pop culture and tech media. He’s written a number of books and spoken in person to almost a half million developers worldwide.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
