title: 'A refresher on the floating-point computations and the standard library. - Boguslaw Cyganek'
language: English
recordingDate: 1595444412
description: "In my talk I’ll present the basics of floating-point computations and how to avoid some pitfalls such as under- and overflow, the catastrophic cancellations, and how the NaN can pop up. I’ll also talk if the std::accumulate is good for all accumulations and what can we gain launching std::transform_reduce with the std::execution::par? Then, what are the most accurate and the fastest summation methods and how easy it is to use them in our code. I’ll also touch on such topics as accurate computation of the inner product of vectors and the fast matrix multiplication. Everybody is welcome.\n\n--------\n\nBoguslaw Cyganek is a researcher and lecturer at the Department of Electronics, AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, Poland.
