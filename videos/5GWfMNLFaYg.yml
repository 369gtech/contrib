However, the main focus of the talk will be on how the unavoidable (and generally ugly) financial side of making a living off your art can be handled successfully – and made pretty – without compromising either art or integrity.“\n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
