description: "Joe Levy, Oracle\n\nWe live in a cloud-paced world in which developers use a plethora of programming languages, frameworks, and DevOps tools. Supporting such a fragmented development landscape, at the breakneck pace of innovation that the cloud allows, is no easy task. Come learn how the Developer Experience team of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure group delivers and supports a variety of open source developer tools (Ruby, Python, Java SDKs, and CLI, to name a few) for a quickly growing set of cloud services without breaking a sweat. In this session, you’ll get valuable knowledge about how leveraging Swagger and the open source community can lead to huge productivity gains, whether you’re delivering a cloud, an app, or anything in between."
