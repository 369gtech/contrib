description: "Ближайшая конференция — Mobius 2020 Piter\n22-25 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/mobius2020piter\n\n. In this talk, we’ll review the basics of memory and performance optimization techniques. We will learn how C or Swift structs are aligned in memory and look at some tricks to reduce the size of large datasets. Armed with these tools, we can load millions of stars into the memory of an iPhone and present them in a simple SceneKit/ARKit app that allows us to visually explore our galaxy."
