description: "Keynote: Cloud Native Transformation - The Journey Begins Here! - Ken Owens, CTO of Cloud Infrastructure Services, Cisco\n\nDevelopers are driving the market for cloud consumption and leading each industry into the new era of software defined disruption. There are no longer questions about elastic and flexible agile development as the way to innovate and reduce time to market for businesses. However, current cloud solutions do not enable application development platforms natively or provide the ability to create applications that are cloud native with elastic services. In addition, businesses are moving to application development architectures leveraging microservices, which are becoming more strategic to their business strategy. When making the decision to build and operate an application in a cloud platform, microservices become central to your application architecture and strategy.  \n\nThis presentation will describe the Cloud Foundry contributions that address current devops challenges, the data platform that is required to support the business analytics, and the build, deploy, and run, including application monitoring and advanced user plane network enhancements.\n\nThe overall architecture of the combined contributions will be described with a customer use case.\n\nKen Owens \nCTO\nCisco\nGreater St. Louis Area\nKen Owens is Chief Technology Officer, Cloud Infrastructure Services at Cisco.
