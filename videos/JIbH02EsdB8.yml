These can improve clarity and performance with targeted changes to opt-in without sprawling changes to one's codebase. We'll talk about how you can use these features, what they do under the covers.\n\nA special emphasis will be placed on the associative containers' data structures, as those containers have received a large number of enhancements and most folks don't have a simple mental model of how they work.\n— \n\nBilly O'Neal\nMicrosoft\nSenior SDE\nBilly a maintainer of the standard C++ libraries at Microsoft. He improves performance in the library for existing features, and is the author of several C++17 library features in Visual C++, including string_view, boyer_moore searchers, parallel algorithms, and parts of filesystem.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
