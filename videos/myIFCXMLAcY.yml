description: "Fraser Mitchell\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/229/\n\nTechnical writing and user testing may seem like two compltetly different fields, but they actually intersect more often than not. If you think about it, they both share the same purpose of ensuring that the UX is smooth and streamlined.\r\n\r\nWhen in the position of writing documentation, we are always told about the issues that users face on a daily basis. But what if we tumbled down the rabbithole and into the world of user testing, and actually witnessed the users issue first hand? \r\n\r\nIn this talk I want to discuss the many benefits of intersecting user testing with technical documentation. I will share my experiences of writing documnetation and conducting user testing, while also going over several skills and techniques that can be used to convert the results from user testing into better documentation.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
