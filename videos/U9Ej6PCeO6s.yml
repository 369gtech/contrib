description: 'Love Apps Script, but wish that it would just automatically work in the background? We''ve got just the thing for you - Triggers! This show will be an introductory level show about how to set up Apps Script so your scripts are run on a schedule, or in response to certain events like a spreadsheet being edited or a form submission. We''ll talk about what triggers are, how to manually schedule triggers, how to programmatically create them, and some of the cool things you can do with them.'
