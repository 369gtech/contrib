recordingDate: 1485156156
description: "Writing libraries and toolchains for your developer peers can be a challenge. Easy to use, flexible, testable, and extensible are all qualities we strive for when writing software that others will use. Hardware related tools specifically can be especially complex, where extra empathy and thoughtful process is often needed.\n\nThis session will be a walk-through of several case studies sourced from personal open source work, written for both the NodeJS Hardware Working Group and the vibrant worldwide Nodebots community at large. Lessons learned will be aplenty, providing some fresh perspectives on how deeply your code can improve the first impressions of those in the communities you wish to cultivate.\n\nSuz Hinton is a JavaScript developer who likes to tinker with hardware. A maker at heart, she’s no stranger to minor burns from soldering irons and 3D printers. She’s a regular contributor to the open source Node.js electronics scene, and enjoys teaching others how to immerse themselves in the nerdiverse.\n\nFor more on YOW!
