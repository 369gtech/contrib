description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\npandas has recently gained the ability to extend dtypes with an interface called Extension Arrays. I will use an in depth example to show how this enables a long time requeasted feature of pandas, support for Integer NA in a first class way.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
