description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIteratively Implementing Istio: Zero to Service Mesh with No Downtime - Patrick Auld, Autodesk \n\nPlanGrid (now part of Autodesk) successfully starting using an early release of Istio in production running ~50 microservices with no downtime. This gave us great observability into our systems and we are continuing to expand its usage today. This required careful planning and experimentation to iteratively utilize specific services and features of Istio when we were confident in their stability and determined they would add value. Starting with Ingress Gateways we found ways to canary features and slowly rollout changes. We now have nearly 100 microservices all with sidecars and custom L7 routing of VirtualServices that have saved us performance incidents and unblocked the decomposition of our monolith in several ways.  This talk will go over the systems we built to allow a small team to do this on behalf of the entire engineering org as well as the culture aspects of development we continue to evolve as we grow. \n\nhttps://sched.co/abZz"
