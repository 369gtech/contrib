recordingDate: 1380708213
description: "Panel Debate: Runtime Evolution, the Future of VMs \nRich Hickey, Werner Schuster, Kresten Krab Thorup, Simon Marlow, Robert Virding \n\nThis panel debate will discuss advantages and tradeoffs between languages and their underlying runtime systems. Are languages with their own VM better off? How do they compare with those running on multi-purpose ones? How do they tie into the existing ecosystem? How do they perform and scale on multi-core? Or should we just compile to native code? Join language inventors and VM experts and listen to the arguments for and against choosing the right tool for the job."
