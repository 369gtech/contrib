description: "Google Tech Talk\nOctober 4, 2012\n\nPresented by Andrey Breslav.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nKotlin is a modern statically typed language targeting JVM and JavaScript and intended for industrial use. The main goal behind this project is to create a language that would be a good tool for developers, i.e. will be safe, concise, flexible, 100% Java-compatible and well-supported by IDE and other tooling. Kotlin is an open-source project developed by JetBrains, creators of IntelliJ IDEA and ReSharper, with the help of the community.\n\nThis talk gives an overview of the language in its present state and a perspective we have for the future.\nAmong other things, the following features will be covered:\n* Static null-safety\n* Extension functions\n* Higher-order functions and type-safe builders\n* Smart casts: Kotlin's lightweight pattern matching\n* Enhancing existing Java APIs with Kotlin\n* Developing mixed Kotlin/Java projects\n \nTo find out more about Kotlin, please refer to http://kotlin.jetbrains.org\nSlides in Prezi http://prezi.com/himfy6vlxxlx/kotlin-uberconf/\nCode examples from the talk https://github.com/abreslav/introduction-to-kotlin\n\nAbout the speaker:  Andrey is the lead language designer working on Project Kotlin at JetBrains (http://kotlin.jetbrains.org/). He also works on making the Java language better, serving as a Java Community Process expert in a group for JSR-335 (\"Project Lambda\"). In what spare time is left he tries to make sure that his traveling is not all about work and teaches programming to high-school children. Used to teach OOP/Software Design at a university, but currently switched to speaking at software conferences such as JavaOne and Devoxx."
