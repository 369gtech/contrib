title: '#HITBCyberWeek #CommSec D1 - The Art of Exploiting Logical Flaws in Web Applications'
language: English

description: "You cannot perform tests to detect logic flaws if you do not know how the application works, also it is never possible for a known vulnerability scanning tools to detect logic flaws because they are designed to work in a (automatic) way that does not know the logic in which the application works and for this there is a very wide difference. Between technical vulnerabilities and logic vulnerabilities, therefore logic flaws remain a complex problem unknown to many developers and researchers in information security because it depends on a very exciting and philosophical way of thinking ( outside the box ) and it is a weapon for some professional hackers …\n\nThis presentation is divided into two parts:\n\n– Part 1: Contains classic logic flaws : ( Parameter Tampering & Manipulation- AccountTakeover & 2FA Bypass – Privilege Escalation ) we will conduct manual experimental tests in labs to begin creating a philosophy through which you can detect and study such flaws from scratch.\n\nPart 2: It contains the unknown real-world logic flaws that we have already discovered on bounty programs with interesting clues to the concept of exploiting them.\n\nThe logic flaws are related to the logic in which the service operates, and it is in fact wrong logic, meaning that the service works in a wrong way, and from here we can exploit the wrong way in which the service operates to achieve malicious goals \n\n=== \n\nSaifAllah BenMassaoud (Security Resarcher, Intel)"
