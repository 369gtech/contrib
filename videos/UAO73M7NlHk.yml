description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nDecember, 14 2007\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nWe present an algorithm, WITCH, that learns to detect spam hosts or pages on the web. Unlike most other approaches, it simultaneously exploits the structure of the Web graph, as well as page contents and features.  This work is a collaboration with Olivier Chapelle and Carlos Castillo, both of Yahoo! Inc.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Jake Abernethy"
