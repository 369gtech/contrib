title: 'YOW! 2014 Matt Stine - To Microservices and Beyond'
recordingDate: 1514470861
description: "Microservice architectures have generated quite a bit of hype in recent months, and practitioners across our industry have vigorously debated the definition, purpose, and effectiveness of these architectures. In this session, we’ll cut through the hype and examine some very practical considerations related to microservices and how we might solve them:\n\nNot an End in Themselves: why microservices are really all about continuous delivery and how they help us achieve it.\n\nSystems over Services: why microservices are less about the services themselves and more about the systems we can assemble using them. Boilerplate patterns for configuration, integration, and fault tolerance are keys.\n\nOperationalized Architecture: microservices aren’t a free lunch. You have to pay for them with strong DevOps sauce.\n\nIt’s About the Data: bounded contexts with API’s are great until you need to ask really big questions. How do we effectively wrangle all of the data at once?\n\nAlong the way, we’ll see how open source technology efforts such as Cloud Foundry, Spring Cloud, Netflix OSS, Spring XD, and Hadoop can help us with many of these considerations.\n\nMatt Stine is a Cloud Foundry Platform Engineer at Pivotal. He is a 15 year veteran of the enterprise IT industry, with experience spanning numerous business domains.\n\nMatt is obsessed with the idea that enterprise IT “doesn’t have to suck,” and spends much of his time thinking about lean/agile software development methodologies, DevOps, architectural principles/patterns/practices, and programming paradigms, in an attempt to find the perfect storm of techniques that will allow corporate IT departments to not only function like startup companies, but also create software that delights users while maintaining a high degree of conceptual integrity. He currently specializes in helping customers achieve success with Platform as a Service (PaaS) using Cloud Foundry and BOSH.\n\nMatt has spoken at conferences ranging from JavaOne to OSCON, is a regular speaker on the “No Fluff Just Stuff tour, and serves as Technical Editor of “NFJS the Magazine. Matt is also the founder and past president of the Memphis/Mid-South Java User Group.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
