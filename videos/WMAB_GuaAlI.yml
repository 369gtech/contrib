We find it's quite easy to setup, use and maintain, it can also leverage lots of existing features from PaaS if we're building both. Here is the agenda:  1. Our DevOps Expectations - Easy to use/scale/extend; high availability; a superset, can integrate with existing CI/CD tools  2. Kubernetes capabilities and advantages to build DevOps solution - Pod/Job/CrontJob/InitContainer/Resource management/Scheduling  3. Architecture and features  - CRD and operator design - Pipeline/Stage/Task/Task Template/Version Control/UI generation/Volume... - Logging, monitoring, autoscaling, high availability - Extensibility/Integration  CI/CD examples  4. Future plan - ChatOps/AIOps - Enterprise users are actively using this solution, bring consistent user experience and generate consistent system metrics, make DevOps easier.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FvBJ"
