description: "Speaker: Ricky Blacker\n\nWordPress has become a passion of mine and I love to share this personal journey of how WordPress has changed my life for the better in many ways … and continues to do so. I share my story to inspire others to become more involved with the WordPress community and also to follow their dreams.\n\nWordPress has taken me from a factory job that I was NOT happy in, to loving my work in an amazing company and being paid to travel the world and interact with the WordPress community.\n\nThis talk tells of how ‘discovering’ WordPress became a life-changing experience – how I was adopted into the WordPress community who are now like family to me, and how attending WordCamp Sydney in 2014 lead to a series of events that paved the way to me acquiring my dream job.\n\nDuring my talk I give examples of how giving back to the WordPress community can be beneficial in many ways. Hopefully, I inspire those just embarking on their WordPress journey to follow their dreams, and encourage people by sharing how overcoming some of our fears and social anxieties can lead to amazing opportunities.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nRicky is a self taught web professional who found and fell in love with WordPress, and the community behind it while looking for a CMS platform to build websites for clients.\n\nHe originally started his own web design business after being made redundant from a factory job in 2013, but now works for WP Engine as a Pre Sales Engineer, providing a Digital Experience Platform for WordPress user around the world.\n\nHe is a Co-Organizer for the Sunshine Coast & Brisbane WordPress Meetup Groups, as well as the Brisbane Web Design Meetup group, and was one of the amazing team who put together the Sunshine Coast WordCamp in 2016 and WordCamp Brisbane in 2017/2018, and has spoken at WordCamps in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nRicky is very passionate about building the WordPress community and helping others to learn how to use WordPress and what it can do.\n\nEvent Page: https://2019.singapore.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-1111\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/BEH5N/"
