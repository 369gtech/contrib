description: 'We do it when writing code, when debugging, when profiling, when reviewing code, but we rarely talk about how to do it well: to think. We often assume you are either born as a thinker, or you''re not one, but it is a skill that can actually be learned, which involves implicit techniques such as concept mapping, hypothesizing, backtracking, matching mental models, and documenting your studies. To become better programmers we must learn how to think.'
