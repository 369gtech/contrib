description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nKotlin in Action\n\nKotlin comes to us from Jetbrains the same people that make the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. Designed to run on the JVM and interop cleanly with exisiting Java classes, Kotlin provides a number of upgrades from standard Java development. More than just another language tour with and ceaseless parade of tidbits and nuggets, this talk is a walkthrough of an actively developed project. Converted from existing Java code, this dropwizard and angularjs based application offers a glimpse of a number of Kotlin features in context. We'll walk through each layer from the Jersey resources all the way through the testing code showing how Kotlin works and can be used in conjunction with exising Java libraries.\n\nJustin D Lee, MongoDB\n\nJustin has been a Java developer since 1996 (and can still remember being excited about the upcoming release of the new Swing UI toolkit). Not counting occasional forays in to desktop development, Justin has spent the better part of the last 19 years doing server-side development including building quasi-Java EE application servers and ORMs and helped shepherd websocket support in to first Glassfish/Grizzly and then in to Java EE itself. He is currently a member of the Developer Experience team at MongoDB where he works on the Java driver, Morphia, mongo-hadoop, and more. He speaks as often as he can at conferences and user groups around the world and blogs less than he intends at antwerkz.com. Follow Justin on twitter at @evanchooly."
