description: "You probably know and maybe even use Google App Engine and Google Compute Engine. But did you know that Google Cloud has made a huge progress in 2014? The many new cloud services that were released aim to reshape the Google Cloud Platform as we know it. \n\n\nIn this talk we will focus on 2 of the new technologies - Google Containers Engine and Google Managed VM. Both of them are based on Docker, so we will also dive in to the new world of containers.\n\nTalk by: Evgeny Lieb and Dimitri Krassovski"
