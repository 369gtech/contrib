description: 'Object-oriented programming was invented as a solution for the unmanageable complexity of a procedural one. Objects were supposed to replace procedures and global variables. Is it really happening in modern Java projects? Are we really thinking in objects, methods and classes? Or we still are in that complex and messy procedural world. Unfortunately, we are still there. Can that be fixed? Can we make our code really object-oriented and clean, while staying with Java? I believe we can.'
