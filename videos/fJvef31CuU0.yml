description: "by Jérôme Martin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.201/makeownlangracket.webm\n\n\nYou always wished you could have a language that explains perfectly what you are trying to do?\nYou find yourself constantly waiting for your favorite programming language to add a feature?\nWhy not doing it yourself? Come at this workshop and try making your own language using Racket, the language-oriented programming language!\n(did I say \"language\" twice?) This workshop will quickly describe how to use the Racket language, then dive into making your own language.\nI should be able to handle between 3 to 5 people at a time.\nSession duration should range from 1 hour to 1.5 hours. \n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 17:20:00+01"
