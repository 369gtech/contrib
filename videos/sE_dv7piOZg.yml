description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nKirk Pepperdine - Kirk knows more about the JVM than most of the engineers that actually build it do. Let him take you to the secrets and dark corners of the JVM\n\nABSTRACT\nWhen developers and Operations are asked what their biggest performance bottleneck is, it's rare that memory inefficiency comes up as an answer. Unfortunately, this runs counter to observations that 60% of all applications are memory-inefficient. Quite often this memory inefficiency hides as lower application throughput and longer, more frequent tail latency events, meaning that other things often take the blame. This session looks at the telltale signs that your application is in that 60% and the steps you can take to attack this [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:59 Demo\n02:46 What is your performance trouble spot?\n04:37 Where do these problems show up?\n06:13 Demo continued\n08:25 War stories\n09:12 What about Mastermind?\n10:00 Allocation sites\n10:55 Demo continued\n12:20 Allocations\n13:30 Demo continued\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1333/memory-efficient-java\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Java #JVM #MemoryEfficiency #MemoryInefficiency\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
