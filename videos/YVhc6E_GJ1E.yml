description: "...aka \"A Bunch of Small Reasons to Migrate Beyond JDK8\"\n\nJava 8 was one of the most important Java releases ever... but still wasn’t free of bugs, or just places where things could’ve been done better. In this session, we’ll go through a quick post-mortem session and explore various bugs, flaws and design inconsistencies along with ways how we can address those problems (if possible).\n\nTo enumerate a few, we’ll see how Stream#flatmap is broken, why Parallel Streams are not a good choice for production, or how to avoid checked exceptions boilerplate in lambda expressions by tricking the compiler."
