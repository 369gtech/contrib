description: "LISA16 - Failure: Why It Happens & How to Benefit from It\n\nVM (Vicky) Brasseur, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nProjects fail in droves. Up to 90% of new businesses fail within 10 years. Screws fall out all the time; the world is an imperfect place.\n\nJust because it happens doesn’t mean we can’t do our best to prevent it or—at the very least—to minimize the damage when it does. As a matter of fact, embracing failure can be one of the best things you do for your project. Failure is a vital part of evolution. By learning to love failure we learn how to take the next step forward. Ignoring or punishing failure leads to stagnation and wasted potential.\n\nDuring this session I'll cover:\n\n• The most common causes for failure\n• Suggestions for how to avoid failing\n• How to use failure to your advantage\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
