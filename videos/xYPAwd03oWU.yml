description: "The talk from Java Fest 2020 Online conference. \nPresentation: https://bit.ly/3fnpRgm\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/javafestua/  \nWebsite: https://javafest.com.ua\n\nMost of you probably heard about the distributed caching being the most common application of Hazelcast - but I bet not many of you heard about CRDT, HyperLogLog, or CP Subsystem.\nDuring this talk, we'll go for quick journey around Hazelcast's ecosystem, revise basic functionality and have a look at some of the hidden flavours.\nEven if that’s way too much for your use case, there’s still a lot for an engineer to learn from studying these concepts.\n\nJava is a registered trademark of Oracle and/or its affiliates, used by permission."
