description: "Regression testing is done to see if introducing modifications to software affects existing functionality. The simplest regression testing strategy is to rerun all test cases. It is an easy strategy to implement, but often it is also unnecessarily expensive, especially if changes affect only a small part of the whole system under test. Therefore, applying regression test selection techniques can be of great advantage. Edward Ekelund will describe the results of his Master Thesis on test selection, which was done at Axis.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
