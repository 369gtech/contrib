description: "► Check out https://gorails.com for Pro episodes and more!\n► SaaS business template for Ruby on Rails with built-in features like Payments, Teams, and much more: https://jumpstartrails.com\n► Ruby on Rails hosting with Hatchbox.io: https://hatchbox.io\n► Learn how to add Stripe Payments (with SCA support!) with Ruby on Rails: https://courses.gorails.com/payments-with-rails-master-class\n\nJumpstart Pro organizes resources around Accounts. Each user has a default Account and they can create other Accounts to collaborate with other users. Accounts are also used to make your application multitenant.\n\nSometimes you might want your user to add some Account details on registration. In this video, we'll take a look at how to modify sign up so that we can register our user and collect their account details all at the same time."
