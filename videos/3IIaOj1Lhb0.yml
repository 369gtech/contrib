description: "Tim Pettersen is a Bitbucket developer by day, and Git evangelist by night.\n\nIn the first section of his talk, he'll cover the nuts and bolts of creating aliases including parameter handling, incorporating multiple commands in the same alias, and tweaking the behavior of Git through options, environment, and inline configuration overrides.\n\nThen he'll move on to the fun part: a bestiary of aliases. Tim has scoured dark corners of the web, freenode, and social media to uncover mystic aliases that perform every function from automating standup meetings to \"I'm feeling lucky\" searches across the DAG. He breaks apart each alias in turn, and dissects their guts to understand how they do what they do. \n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels. Git Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and to showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from contributors, maintainers and community managers around the world.
