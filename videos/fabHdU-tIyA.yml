description: "From Strata + Hadoop 2015 in New York: Traditional BI is getting an overhaul at a rapid pace. “BI 2.0” was predicted to hit the mainstream by 2017, but business leaders view the ability to see “what’s happening now” and make better decisions as an urgent need to differentiate and win. Eighty-nine percent of business leaders view data analysis to be as transformative as the internet.\n\nThree factors are fueling its early arrival:\n1. Rapid innovation through Spark, machine learning, cloud technology, and other advances\n2. A data landscape that’s growing larger, more diverse and complex\n3. Accelerating business needs that are driving decision times down and the impact of data insights up, directly for the mainstream business user\n\nThis keynote unveils why rapid modernization is taking place, what it looks like, and the urgent business use cases driving it. The modernization of BI moves businesses beyond IT-dependency, traditional ETL, and static dashboards toward interactive answers that use up-to-the-minute data so companies can compete, win, and thrive.\n\nAbout Tim Howes (ClearStory Data):\nDr. Timothy Howes, co-inventor of LDAP and holder of numerous patents, leads innovation on ClearStory’s Spark-based data analysis platform.
