description: "Sometimes, undefined is not a function. As mortal programmers, we ship bugs to production everyday. Bugs slow us down, frustrate our users, and cause us to have crises of confidence. Don't go aloneâ€“type systems in technologies such as TypeScript, Flow, and GraphQL can improve your confidence and help you ship less bugs. \n\nLauren dives into the practical benefits you'll get from embracing types.
