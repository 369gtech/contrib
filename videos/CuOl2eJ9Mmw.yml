title: 'Colleen M  Farrelly - Lessons From A Nuclear Core Loading Quantum Algorithm Study|PyData Global 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609873289
description: "Talk \nThis talk presents lessons learned from an initial, novel application of quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms to optimize core loading patterns. Some of the challenges faced have included performance concerns on large simulation problems, lack of quality open-source code for some target algorithms, and the need for software interactions with a proprietary software.\n\nSpeaker\nColleen M. Farrelly is an experienced data scientist and entrepreneur whose expertise spans many industries, including quantum computing, nuclear engineering, education, defense, healthcare, and biotech. Her research focuses on topological data analysis, psychometrics, network analytics, and quantum machine learning. Sheâ€™s currently working on a book focused on applications of topology and geometry to machine learning.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
