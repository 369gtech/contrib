description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nThe basic definition of Site Reliability Engineering is when you ask software engineers to design operations function and to solve problems that historically were solved by hand. In a large enterprise such as Goldman Sachs with lots of sophisticated process and security control in place, how can we ensure that reliability can be applied to existing software? In this talk I am going to share with the audience how we apply the SRE principles and help to design some of the building blocks that transform applications with observability, security, maintainability and scalability in mind, using open-standards such as gRPC, Envoy and Prometheus."
