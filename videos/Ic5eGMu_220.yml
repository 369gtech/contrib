Oracle Data Redaction enables you to redact sensitive data returned from queries issued by applications. This session will explore best practices for implementing sensitive data redaction methods including full, partial, regular expressions and random redaction. Participants will learn from real life examples how they should use Data Redaction and what are the pros and cons of implementing this solution. The session will also include a live demonstration and will present various scripts and best practices for implementing Data Redaction to mask your sensitive data either in cloud or on-premise database."
