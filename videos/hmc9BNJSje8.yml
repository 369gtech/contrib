title: 'Performance Testing in Agile Contexts - Eric Proegler'
recordingDate: 1400821976
description: "Performance Testing has long been conducted as a single experiment against a fully complete and assembled system. Architecture, software, hardware, networks, data states, and workload models are all combined to try and create the most \"accurate\" simulation possible to produce test results predictive of production experience.\n\nPerformance testing with this approach can be helpful for validating a completely assembled system, but in the new world of (a/A)gile development contexts, testing at the very end is unhelpful for providing timely feedback. To be more useful, performance testing can be adapted to the component levels and iteration intervals delivery teams are often working with.\nWe will discuss approaches and techniques for providing performance feedback earlier, more specifically, and more often.\n\nSession Takeaways:\n- Strategies for designing,\nconducting, and tracking frequently repeatable performance tests.\n- Techniques for testing individual components and incomplete systems.\n- Suggestions for blending performance metrics into continuous integration.\n- Other ways to provide performance feedback throughout a project.\n"
