description: "The Future of DevOps in the Enterprise: Trends & Predictions\n\nSteve Brodie, CEO, Electric Cloud\n\nDevOps adoption is growing rapidly, especially in the enterprise. What started as a “keeping up with the unicorns” grassroots movement within more forward thinking companies, has matured to large, complex enterprises now often being on the forefront of DevOps innovation.\n\nNew technology advancements and emerging design patterns—such as containers, microservices, complex integrations, hybrid infrastructure, and more—all create significant business benefits, yet dramatically increase the burden on Operations and Release Management teams. This poses hurdles to the adoption of these new developments within large enterprises, who need to operate at an increasingly larger scale.\n\nThis talk will discuss the new technology trends affecting DevOps in the enterprise, and best practices for modern IT to take advantage of them to increase delivery velocity, improve operational efficiencies and ensure security, compliance and stable operations at scale.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
