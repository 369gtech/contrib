description: "What does it take to become agile with thousands of people? In this talk, Ola and Jeff will share their experiences from helping a business unit in one of Sweden's largest companies to move towards agility, focusing on three aspects:\n\n    -Lean thinking - so that the pattern of visibility and continous improvement is installed at every level;\n    -The big picture - so that the whole process from concept to running code is transparent and fully understood by all, including management;\n    -Cross functional training - so that team members, their coaches, and their managers are brought into the same classroom and get to share the same view.\n\nOla and Jeff will also talk about issues observed, present the most common misconceptions they've encountered, and discuss the challenges involved in making the changes stick."
