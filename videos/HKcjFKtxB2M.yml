title: 'JUnit 5 - Shaping the Future of Testing on the JVM - Sam Brannen @ Spring I/O 2016'
recordingDate: 1466585780
description: "Spring I/O 2016 - 19 -20 May Barcelona\n\nWant to know what the hype surrounding JUnit 5 is all about? Then join this talk by JUnit 5 core committer Sam Brannen to find out!\n\nSince JUnit 4.0 was first released, a lot has happened in the world of Java. Unfortunately, JUnit 4 hasn't kept up with the times. JUnit 5 therefore aims to help shape the future of testing on the JVM, with a focus on Java 8, modularity, extensibility, and a modern programming API for authoring tests in Java.\n\nThis session will start off by providing attendees an overview of the inspiration for and architecture of JUnit 5, from launchers to test engines. Sam will then take the audience on an example-driven tour of the new programming model, highlighting support for dependency injection via flexible method signatures, conditional test execution, using lambda expressions and method references in assertions and assumptions, and implementing test/before/after methods via interface default methods.\n\nTo round off the discussion, Sam will present a deep dive into the new extension model in JUnit 5, demonstrating how to author and register extensions for conditional tests, method parameter resolution, lifecycle callbacks, and more."
