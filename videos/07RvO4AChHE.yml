description: "Scaling Edge Operations at Onefootball with Ambassador: From 0 to 6000 rps - Jonathan Juares Beber & Rodrigo Del Monte, Onefootball GmbH \n\nOnefootball is a media company with more than 10M monthly active users delivering more than 10 TB daily content. We needed a Kubernetes-based API Gateway and Ingress solution that could handle our 6,000 rps workload reliably and efficiently.  In this session, we'll talk about why we chose the open source Ambassador API gateway, and how we made the migration to it. We will cover the challenges identified and the benefits we've seen, like:  Cost reduction: Reduced the number of cloud-based load balancers from &gt;100 to 4.  Observability: The combination of Ambassador and Prometheus' capabilities to empower our small SRE team.  Maintainability: We took advantage of Ambassador's Kubernetes declarative configuration, and we were able to decouple the cluster settings and applications' delivery process allowing more velocity on the shipment of new features.   \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYF"
