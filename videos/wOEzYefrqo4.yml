description: "Google Tech Talk (more below)\nFebruary 17, 2011\n\nPresented by Roozbeh Pournader.\nRecorded at the February 2011 meeting of IMUG - The Original Multilingual Computing User Group, San Jose, CA, USA.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nEnabling software and web apps for people who write in bidirectional languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Urdu presents many challenges. Not only must we support mixed writing directions, but \"bidi\" locales in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia have additional requirements like localized numbers and alternative calendars.\n\nThis talk will address common problems of bidirectionalization, current approaches taken by the industry, and suggestions for avoiding headaches, plus some examples of bidirectionalization for web apps. We will also discuss bidi localization engineering, a cost-saving step in the localization process.\n\nRoozbeh Pournader is an internationalization expert at HighTech Passport, a company specializing in localization and internationalization services. Roozbeh has been working on software bidirectionalization for his whole professional life, since 1996.\n\nAs a native speaker of Persian, Roozbeh has had ample opportunity to experience the challenges of bidirectionalization firsthand. He is an author of multiple standards and technical reports for Persian support in software for Iran and Afghanistan, and a contributor to the Unicode Standard.\n\nRoozbeh contributes to various free software projects and is an advocate of open source software development. He represents the GNOME Foundation in the Unicode Consortium."
