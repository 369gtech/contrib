description: "DROWN: Breaking TLS Using SSLv2\n\nNimrod Aviram, Tel Aviv University; Sebastian Schinzel, Münster University of Applied Sciences; Juraj Somorovsky, Ruhr University Bochum; Nadia Heninger, University of Pennsylvania; Maik Dankel, Münster University of Applied Sciences; Jens Steube, Hashcat Project; Luke Valenta, University of Pennsylvania; David Adrian and J. Alex Halderman, University of Michigan; Viktor Dukhovni, Two Sigma and OpenSSL; Emilia Käsper, Google and OpenSSL; Shaanan Cohney, University of Pennsylvania; Susanne Engels and Christof Paar, Ruhr University Bochum; Yuval Shavitt, Tel Aviv University\n\nWe present DROWN, a novel cross-protocol attack on TLS that uses a server supporting SSLv2 as an oracle to decrypt modern TLS connections.\n\nWe introduce two versions of the attack. The more general form exploits multiple unnoticed protocol flaws in SSLv2 to develop a new and stronger variant of the Bleichenbacher RSA padding-oracle attack. To decrypt a 2048-bit RSA TLS ciphertext, an attacker must observe 1,000 TLS handshakes, initiate 40,000 SSLv2 connections, and perform 2^50 offline work. The victim client never initiates SSLv2 connections. We implemented the attack and can decrypt a TLS 1.2 handshake using 2048- bit RSA in under 8 hours, at a cost of $440 on Amazon EC2. Using Internet-wide scans, we find that 33% of all HTTPS servers and 22% of those with browser-trusted certificates are vulnerable to this protocol-level attack due to widespread key and certificate reuse.\n\nFor an even cheaper attack, we apply our new techniques together with a newly discovered vulnerability in OpenSSL that was present in releases from 1998 to early 2015. Given an unpatched SSLv2 server to use as an oracle, we can decrypt a TLS ciphertext in one minute on a single CPU—fast enough to enable man-in-the-middle attacks against modern browsers. We find that 26% of HTTPS servers are vulnerable to this attack.\n\nWe further observe that the QUIC protocol is vulnerable to a variant of our attack that allows an attacker to impersonate a server indefinitely after performing as few as 2^17 SSLv2 connections and 2^58 offline work.\n\nWe conclude that SSLv2 is not only weak, but actively harmful to the TLS ecosystem.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '16 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions"
