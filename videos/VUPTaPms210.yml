title: 'Stéphane Landelle - Load Testing Done Right with Gatling'
recordingDate: 1445386283
description: "The applications we build have to deal with more and more data and users and having them perform poorly could hurt business pretty bad. Yet, performance testing is usually not properly dealt with. Too many organizations just throw this brick over the wall to a team that knows nothing of the project, and do so only once the project is almost complete and it's too late to fix it. This talk covers some methodology and tooling for load testing, and then focuses on Gatling (http://gatling.io). Gatling is an open-source load testing tool used to generate virtual users, typically browsing a website.It focuses on: \n• a modern and efficient architecture based non blocking IO and actors let you generate very heavy loads\n• a nice DSL that let you write flexible code instead of getting lost in a bloated GUI\n• nice reports with meaningful metrics"
