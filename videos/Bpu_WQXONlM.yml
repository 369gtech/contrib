description: "With CSS animations and web animations moving elements became possible in the browser. But how one moves an object in such a way that it appears “correct” for the human eye? How does a motion feel natural? These and similar questions confronted the artists who brought cartoons to life as early as 1906. Let’s take a look behind the scenes and see how drawings learned to walk and what we can learn from it for animations in the browser.\n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/martin-sonnenholzer/animations-learning-from-cartoons.html"
