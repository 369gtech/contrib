description: "Debugging applications in production is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer. Especially with microservices. Especially with containers. Especially in the cloud. Trying to see what’s going on in a production deployment at scale is impossible without proper tools! Google has spent over a decade deploying containerized Java applications at unprecedented scale and the infrastructure and tools developed by Google and JFrog have made it uniquely possible to manage, troubleshoot, and debug, at scale.\n\nJoin this session to see how you can diagnose and troubleshoot production issues w/ the insight provided by Artifactory, Weave, Google Cloud Platform, as well as out of the box Kubernetes tools\n\nRay had extensive hands on cross-industry enterprise systems integration delivery and management experiences since 2002. Ray specalizes in Java application development and architecture, and is active contributor to open source projects. Aside from technology, Ray enjoys traveling and adventures. Ray is currently a Developer Advocate at Google. Follow Ray on Twitter @saturnism (https://twitter.com/saturnism)\n\nGalder is one of the founding engineers of Infinispan, Red Hat's distributed in-memory data grid store. He is responsible for the client/server architecture and has recently been implementing a Node.js client. A seasoned conference presenter, Galder is on a mission to promote Infinispan wherever he goes. He's always happy to learn new technologies and programming languages to apply in live coding demos. He's particularly keen on functional programming related technologies, having used Scala since 2009 and Haskell more recently."
