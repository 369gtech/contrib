description: "Speakers:  Mattias Severson, Johan Haleby, JayWay Inc\nYou've probably heard the buzz about functional programming and you may have glanced at the new Lambda features in Java 8. What is less known is that it's actually possible to leverage some of the functional-style techniques even in older Java versions. This means that you can program in a functional style, even if your organization has not updated to Java 8.\n\nIn this session, you'll learn about real-world experiences with functional frameworks such as LamdaJ, Functional Java and Guava. What should you consider before adopting them? How do they compare against one another? If you are stuck with a legacy Java version and want to be prepared for the functional future of Java 8, make sure to attend this session."
