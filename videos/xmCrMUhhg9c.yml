title: '"Why is a Monad Like a Writing Desk?" by Carin Meier (2012)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623699975
description: "Inspired by Alice in Wonderland, we will take a whimsical look at monads and how to understand them by implementing them in Clojure.\n\nWe’ll follow the adventures of a developer who fell asleep while reading one of Philip Wadler’s papers on monads (and eating too much cheese). Along the way, we’ll discover why monads are important for a functional language and might accidentally achieve enlightenment by implementing the three different types: the Identity Monad, the Maybe Monad, and the State Monad.\n\nCarin Meier\n\nCarin Meier is a software developer at EdgeCase. She started off as a professional ballet dancer, studied Physics in college, and has been developing software for both the enterprise and entrepreneur for the past 15 years. She comes from a solid Java background, but has discovered a passion for the simplicity, power, and elegance of Clojure."
