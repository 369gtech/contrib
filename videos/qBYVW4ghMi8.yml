title: 'Dependency Injection revisited - Mark Seemann'
recordingDate: 1533542573
description: "Over the last decade, Dependency Injection has moved from obscurity into the realm of something that every library and framework must address. During the same time, functional programming has gathered much interest. Dependency Injection is an attempt to control non-deterministic behaviour, but the way it’s done is fundamentally at odds with functional programming.\nWhat can you do instead, and does the functional solutions apply to object-oriented programming as well? In this talk, you’ll see where all this ultimately leads. Most code examples will be in C#, and while you’re not expected to know any of the following topics, be prepared for some lambda calculus, Greek words, Haskell, F#, and monads as well."
