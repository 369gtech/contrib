title: 'Integrate Python and C++ with pybind11 - Robert Smallshire'

description: "You can write fast code in C++. You can write code fast in Python.\nPython has emerged as the de facto programming language engineering, data-science and machine-learning disciplines. Increasingly IoT appliances use Python too, for high-level control. Python is nominally ten times slower than C or C++, so how is it that these solutions often exhibit great performance?\nThe secret is that many core data-science, machine learning, computer vision, and computational geometry libraries are implemented in C++, and then later exposed to Python.\n\nIn this talk, we introduce pybind11 a header-only, open-source C++11 library for exposing existing C++ libraries as Python modules. Come along for plenty of code examples, and advice on building hybrid Python and C++ solutions.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
