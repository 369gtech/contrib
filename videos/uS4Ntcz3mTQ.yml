He has more than 14 years of experience managing and developing software solutions in Java, Ruby, Groovy and also in Scala. He is zealous about programming in Scala ever since he got introduced to this beautiful language. He enjoys sharing his experience via talks in various conferences and he is also the author of the “Scala in Action” book.​\n\nYou say big data, I say Fast data\n\nNowadays most of the \"Big Data\" problems are dealing with speed not size. Folks want \"Fast Data\". Speed is the problem to solve, not size. Most organizations today actually face smaller big data problems that they are trying to address through in-memory cached real-time processing of data. In this presentation we will explore architectures used for solving \"Fast Data\" problems.\n\n \nWe will be using Spark Streaming and Scala for code examples."
