title: 'YOW! September Online 2020 - Jim Webber - A Humane Presentation about Graph Database Internals'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624253298
description: "Databases are everywhere, but did you ever wonder what goes on inside the box? In this talk we’ll dive into the internals of Neo4j - a popular graph database - and see how its designers deal with distributed systems challenges now and in the future. Borrowing heavily from the academic literature, we'll see why computers are far too easy to program and why oppositely distributed systems are far too hard. We'll follow that with some approaches to making distributed systems safer and contrast that with conflicting approaches that make systems more scalable! If that doesn't sound nightmarish enough, we'll finish up by showing how we can build systems that are safe and scalable by borrowing and gluing together a bunch of ideas from folks who are smarter than me. Come experience the last 10 years of my harrowing day job in less than an hour. You might even enjoy it, or at least empathise!\n\nDr. Jim Webber is Chief Scientist at\_the popular open source graph database\_Neo4j, where he where he works on R&D for highly scalable graph databases\_and writes open source software.\_Jim has written two books on integration and distributed systems: “Developing Enterprise Web Services” on XML Web Services and “REST in Practice” on using the Web for building large-scale systems. His latest book is “Graph Databases” which focuses on the\_Neo4j\_database.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit, www.yowconference.com.au"
