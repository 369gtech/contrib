description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIntro to Scaling Prometheus with Cortex - Tom Wilkie, Grafana Labs & Ken Haines, Microsoft \n\nHave many, disparate Prometheus instances scattered around your organisation? Want a single, centralised place to store and query all your metrics? Don’t want to manually shard your metrics across instance? Want faster queries and indefinite retention? If you answered “yes” to any of those questions, Cortex might be for you. Cortex is a horizontally scalable, highly available Prometheus-compatible TSDB. Cortex allows users to deploy a centralised, globally aggregated view of all their Prometheus instances, storing data indefinitely and scaling to hundred of millions of series. In this talk we will discuss a bit of Cortex's history, Cortex's architecture and how to get started with Cortex. Cortex is an Apache-licensed CNCF incubation project. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekHh"
