description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotcss.io on November 8th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nReflecting on 20 years building websites, Dan shares what CSS taught him. Often, it had little to do with CSS itself, but everything to do with making mistakes, teaching while you're still learning, and that everything we create on the web will eventually disappear. And that's ok."
