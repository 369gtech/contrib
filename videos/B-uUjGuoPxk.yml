title: '"Dynamic Workloads need Dynamic Storage - using rook-ceph with k8s" - Steven Ellis (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579063457
description: "Steven Ellis\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/124/\n\nContainer technology is a great enabler for developer agility, and these environments require an agile and dynamic storage platform. Gone are the days where you had to wait on your storage administrator to provision a new LUN or NFS mount for your project. Thanks to the Rook Project, and its ceph storage provider, you can now have a rapid, dynamic and elastic storage footprint for all your development needs.\r\n\r\nThis session will cover - rook basics, dynamic vs static persistent storage needs of workloads, and a demo of using rook-ceph.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nTue Jan 14 12:00:00 2020 at Room 7"
