description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune,  4 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIt's a question that has probably been asked by all of us.\nPrograms are rarely perfect; we often have to find out what's\nwrong with them. Usually, the answer to the question involves\ntesting. In this talk, I will review some work that I, my\nresearch team, and other researchers have done in the areas of\nrandomized unit testing, test effectiveness measurement and\nautomatic fault localization, all of which is intended to help\nanswer that plaintive question.\n\nSpeaker: Jamie Andrews\nJames H. (Jamie) Andrews received his BSc and MSc degrees from\nthe University of British Columbia, and his PhD degree in 1991\nfrom the University of Edinburgh. He is now an Associate\nProfessor of Computer Science at the University of Western\nOntario, in London, Ontario, where he has been since 1997. His\nresearch interests include software testing, programming\nlanguages and formal specification."
