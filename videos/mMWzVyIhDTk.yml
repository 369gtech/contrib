description: "Design Sprints allow you to get to the crux of your problem and explore a solution, quicker than other ways of working. It doesnâ€™t give you a perfect solution or exact data, but it gives you more than enough to decide what to do next by helping you glimpse into the future. This saves you a lot of time and money as well as resulting in better end products that people will love.
