recordingDate: 1574327166
description: "Much ink has been spilled on what a monad is, but why do people care? As an abstraction, monads hit a sweet spot between being very general while letting the developer retain a lot of control, but this is often hand-waved over. In this talk explores the foundations of this useful abstraction (bootstrapping up from the familiar map function), and what it means for everyday programming tasks, code reuse, testing, and overall code architecture. Examples will be given in both strongly typed (Haskell) and weak/unityped (Elixir) languages.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
