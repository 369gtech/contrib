description: "Google claimed to achieve Quantum Supremacy in a research paper that was briefly leaked on a NASA website. The paper was taken down, but the Internet moves fast to recover data. In this episode, we'll discuss what quantum supremacy means, what the applications of quantum computing will be, and i'll explain how a quantum-resistant cryptographic technique called \"A New Hope\" works. Quantum Computing is my new love, I can't get enough of it. If you take a look at any QC research paper, you'll find a bunch of mat symbols and techniques that are not used in classical computing papers. It's confusing! But that's exactly why it's exciting, there's so much to learn. I hope you find this useful, enjoy! \n\nGoogle's Quantum Supremacy paper:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/19lv8p1fB47z1pEZVlfDXhop082Lc-kdD/view\n\nD-Wave API:\nhttps://www.dwavesys.com/take-leap\n\nIBM Q:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/network/overview/\n\nQuantum Machine Learning:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmzWsvb-Un4\n\nQuantum Computing with D-Wave:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSw-wcB6GZw\n\nQuantum Machine Learning Live:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAO4oq2M_48\n\nThe Neural Qubit:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9jC_V7ojqo\n\nAn amazing blog by Scott Aaronson on Quantum Supremacy:\nhttps://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317\n\nA curated list of quantum computing learning resources:\nhttps://github.com/desireevl/awesome-quantum-computing\n\nRing Learning with Errors Blog post:\nhttps://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/learning-with-errors-and-ring-learning-with-errors-23516a502406\n\nQuantum Encryption:\nhttps://pqcrypto.org/index.html\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nAre you a total beginner to machine learning?
