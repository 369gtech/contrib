description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nA Flight Over the Cloud Native Landscape - Carson Anderson, Weave \n\nThe Cloud Native Computing Landscape is big! And it's just getting bigger all the time. There are already 12 graduated and 21 incubating projects in the foundation! Most of us have heard of a few of these projects. But who really knows what they all do? And more importantly: how they all fit together?  This presentation is a speed-run through all 33 graduated and incubating projects, what they are on a surface level, and how they relate to each other. The presentation will be given with zero bullet points and a lot of visual aid. *Projects promoted to incubating status during the conference may not be covered. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ek9f"
