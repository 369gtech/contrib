description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2018\nhttps://dddeurope.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nAs Time Goes By… (a Bi-temporal Event Sourcing story)\n\nWhen we started that project for an asset management company (finance), we had difficulties to understand what the business really needed. Despite the various event storming sessions, we struggled during 2 weeks to understand why they needed so much things such as retroactive events, advanced bi-temporality, forecasted \"events\", etc. It was in the context of an event sourcing (ES) platform and this is our learning story (with chunks of advanced ES patterns). Yet another illustration of the power of modeling, sketches and concrete examples when we need to understand each others.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nCo-organizer of the DDD Paris user group, Thomas is an eXtreme Programmer & technical architect obsessed by use cases (Vs. solution-driven approaches). He likes using DDD & TDD to boost his efficiency at work. Advocating the advantages of the Hexagonal architecture since many years (talks, blogposts...), Thomas has recently live-coded with Alistair Cockburn on that topic.\n\nHis company 42skillz which aims to help organizations to make software and to work differently, he provides trainings, coaching, consulting about TDD, BDD, legacy code refactoring techniques and DDD with an extra soul."
