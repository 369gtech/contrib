description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nManage Multiple Kubernetes Clusters in a Cloud Native Way - Renyu Zhang, Qing Cloud \n\nAs the container technology and Kubernetes are growing more and more popular among various industries, it’s common to see companies running multiple Kubernetes clusters for their business. For example, one could use different clusters for development/testing/production isolation. Comparing to running a large standalone cluster, spread workloads across multiple small clusters is more effective. It's esasier to isolate single cluster fault such hardware malfunction, power outage, those errros happened inside cluster will not propagate to other clusters. On the one hand, we are glad to see plenty of open source projects and platforms helping cluster administrators managing and maintaining a standalone Kubernetes cluster. On the other hand, there aren’t many options for managing multiple clusters. For example, how can we manage multiple Kubernetes clusters in a unified manner? How can we deploy and upgrade applications on multiple Kubernetes clusters located at different places simultaneously? Today, we’re going to talk about how to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters and how to deploy applications to them in a cloud native way regardless of where the clusters are located. \n\nhttps://sched.co/dINy"
