description: "Celal Ziftci (Google)\n\nFree Tests Are Better Than Free Bananas: Using Data Mining and Machine Learning To Automate Real-Time Production Monitoring\n\nThere is growing interest in leveraging data mining and machine learning techniques in the analysis, maintenance and testing of software systems. In this talk, Celal will discuss how we use such techniques to automatically mine system invariants, use those invariants in monitoring our systems in real-time and alert engineers of any potential production problems within minutes.\n\nThe talk will consist of two tools we internally use, and how we combine them to provide real-time production monitoring for engineers almost for free:\n\nA tool that can mine system invariants.\nA tool that monitors production systems, and uses the first tool to automatically generate part of the logic it uses to identify potential problems in real-time."
