title: 'Bulk88 - "Writing XS in Plain C":'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498247370
description: "Even if you learned C in a classroom at some point, Perl's \"XS\" API for writing perl subs in something purported to be C but is really a cat on a tablet with caps lock on. In this talk I will show how difficult it is to write subs in plain C. This talk will make XS seem like a cakewalk.\n\nBulk88 has been working with Perl for 14 years. He is a frequent contributor to Perl 5 Porters, with a particular interest in optimization and Win32 support. While he loves Perl, he's also happy being close to bare metal, including both ARM and x86 assembly programming."
