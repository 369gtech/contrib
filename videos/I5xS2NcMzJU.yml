description: 'Mojolicious has added industry standard features like Promises/A+ and async/await support. Those alone make writing asynchronous web applications much easier than it used to be, indeed its a whole new ballgame. I’ll cover some common async needs and their related patterns with my usual style of lots of example code that’s all available to run from the repo (and as always, including tests). I’m excited to share the new features (and a few old favorites) with everyone!'
