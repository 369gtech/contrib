description: "As an instructor of lifelong learners, I am constantly looking at ways to effectively transition students from other, sometimes unrelated careers to software development, and also from the academic space to the work environment. I am fortunate to be able to do this with an 8 hour a day, 8 week long Java bootcamp in which I teach the basics of software development. By the end of the course, students have the equivalent of almost 300 hours of hands-on practice developing applications which range from core java applications to Spring Boot applications with security and REST APIs. Spring Boot has been the platform of choice because even though it does have a steep learning curve for beginners, it is usually easier to translate the principles of core java into their applications for web development. In this talk, we will describe our journey through the eyes of students of varying backgrounds, describing their path to the workforce using Spring Boot.\n\nSpeakers:\nAfua Ankomah\nInstructor, Montgomery College\nAlton Henley\nSenior Director, Montgomery College\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
