title: 'Using C# Expression Trees in the Real World - Spencer Schneidenbach'
recordingDate: 1558600632
description: "Entity Framework is the de facto data access standard in .NET, and for good reason – its simplicity and power enables anyone to quickly write and execute strongly-typed queries using LINQ. Have you ever wondered how Entity Framework translates even the most complicated of LINQ queries to SQL? The answer is simple – expression trees.\n\nUsed by many libraries we know and love (including EF, AutoMapper, and NHibernate), expression trees provide a lot of power in an easy-to-use API surface. In this session, Spencer will unravel the mysteries of expression trees. Attendees will learn what expression trees are, how to create them, and how libraries like Entity Framework and AutoMapper use them to perform routine tasks.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
