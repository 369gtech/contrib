description: "This video was recorded at virtual Lambda Days conference, which took place on 16-19th February 2021 - https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2021\n\nFunctional Programming: the Glue for Introducing Computing through Data Science\nby Kathi Fisler |\n\nABSTRACT\nThe \"language wars\" about the best way to teach programming are alive and well. They're also moving into new territory. Many countries are ramping up computing education for K-12. Disciplines across universities are looking to develop Data Science abilities in their students. Leaders emphasize having these efforts reach students equitability, lest we increase digital divides. Which languages, curricula, pedagogies, and tools would help us meet those goals? \n\nLuckily for the fun()ky folks like those as Lambda Days, we have a lot of experience, as well as educational research, showing the value of functional programming in these broader settings. By summarizing what we already know from these efforts, I hope to leave everyone with fresh talking points about the centrality of functional programming to holding these values together in computing education.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://www.lambdadays.org​\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/LambdaDays​\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
