description: "Building a highly trusted, customisable UI for millions of users is hard. Having rigorous performance requirements and not break any existing customisations or code base is even harder.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the UI Architecture Team at Salesforce created a solution that has just gone live: Lightning Web Components.\n\nThanks to this webinar you will learn how the team designed the UI architecture; the problems they encountered; and the solutions they built. These lessons will help you conquer your own UI architecture challenges."
