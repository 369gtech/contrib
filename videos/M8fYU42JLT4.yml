language: English
recordingDate: 1602907173
description: 'Learning a new skill? That means, at some point, you''re likely to find yourself confused. That perplexion, the murky and unclear state of being out of sorts, can be daunting. The fear of never being able to understand can be hard to overcome, let alone eventually understanding the concept itself. However, it is more important than you think to be confused. In this session, you''ll learn that confusion is an important part of the process of learning. We''ll talk about identifying it, what steps to take when you''re confused, and why the act of finding the answer is more important than the answer itself.'
