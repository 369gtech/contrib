recordingDate: 1551823204
description: "The Origins of Opera and the Future of Programming\n\nThere’s a story to tell, about musicians, artists, philosophers, scientists, and then programmers.\nThere’s a truth inside it that leads to a new view of work, that sees beauty in the painful complexity that is software development.\nStarting from The Journal of the History of Ideas, Jessica traces the concept of an “invisible college” through music and art and science to programming. She finds the dark truth behind the 10x developer, a real definition of “Senior Developer” and a new name for our work and our teams.\n\nJessica Kerr is a developer of development systems. She works remotely from St. Louis, for Atomist, where she writes automations and automation infrastructure in TypeScript, Clojure, and whatever else is needed. She is a back-end developer who believes the front-end is most crucial. Jessica speaks at conferences in the US and Europe; find her on the Code podcast (greaterthancode.com)\n\nFor more on YOW!
