description: "by Yolanda Robla Mota and Ricardo Noriega\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.1308/akraino_edge_kni_blueprint.webm\n\nBlueprints in the Kubernetes-Native Infrastructure Blueprint Family leverage the best-practices and tools from the Kubernetes community to declaratively manage edge computing stacks at scale and with a consistent, uniform user experience from the infrastructure up to the services and from developer environments to production environments on bare metal or on public cloud.\n\n\nAll blueprints in this family share the following characteristics:\n\n\n❮ul❯\n❮li❯K8s Machine API: declarative API to manage a configure the infrastructure of a cluster.❮/li❯\n❮li❯Operator Framework: automated and secure lifecycle of applications running on the edge stack.❮/li❯\n❮li❯Kubernetes-native workloads: allowing the mix of CNFs and VM-based workloads via Kubevirt.❮/li❯\n❮/ul❯\n\n\nCome and see the leading edge!\nLaunched in 2018, Akraino Edge Stack aims to create an open source software stack that supports high-availability cloud services optimized for edge computing systems and applications.\n\n\nAs part of the Akraino project, Kubernetes-Native-Infrastructure blueprint family represents the reference edge stack managed as a declarative platform, where controllers monitor a system for deviations between the user-declared target state and reality and take corrective\nactions to reconcile reality with the declared target state.\n\n\nKNI blueprints cover up two different use cases:\n\n\n❮ul❯\n❮li❯Provider Access Edge: as part of the network transformation, telco operators are moving to run its radio access network in a cloud-native manner. Technologies like vRAN will be only possible with a declarative approach, and leveraging open networking best practices.\n❮/li❯\n❮li❯Industrial Edge: workloads such IoT, AI/ML, AR/VR, and ultra-low latency control will be run in the edge. These workloads will require specific hardware such GPUs and FPGAs. KNI can show how this needs can be a reality today.\n❮/li❯\n❮/ul❯\n\n\nWith Kubernetes Native Infrastructure learn about the k8s way of managing infrastructure. By defining a declarative state, the edge administrator will be able to manage thousands of sites by following an innovative GitOps approach.\n\n\nIf you are interested in these exciting topics, don't miss the talk!\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 14:00:00"
