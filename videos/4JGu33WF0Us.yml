title: 'Steve Miner - Generating Generators'
recordingDate: 1416522399
description: "Property-based testing provides good test coverage and automatic shrinking of failure cases. However, coding universal properties with the test.check generator combinators is somewhat of an art. In many cases, it's easier to start from a declarative description of the test data. The Herbert library automatically generates test.check generators from EDN schemas. Learn how schemas can offer simplified testing, easier maintenance and better documentation for your Clojure code.\n\nSteve Miner is a software developer focused on Clojure. He has programmed professionally in many languages, including Common Lisp, Smalltalk, Objective-C and Java. Most of his career has been with Silicon Valley companies such as SRI International, Xerox PARC, ParcPlace and Apple. At Apple, he was a senior software engineer on the Enterprise Objects Framework, WebObjects and Core Data projects. Steve received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University. He now resides in South Carolina."
