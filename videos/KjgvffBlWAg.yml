description: "Beauty in Code 2018 was a single-track full day IT-conference held at the Malmö Live conference center on March 3, 2018, featuring seven different speakers from three continents.\nKevlin Henney about his session \"1968\": It's half a century since the NATO Software Engineering conference in Garmisch. How are we doing? Are we nearly there yet? Or is there no there there? The world of software development has changed so much and in so many ways since 1968 that it's difficult to imagine what we could learn from  the past, but it's learning rather than imagination that's the constraint. There was no shortage  of imagination, insight and inspiration in the 1960s and 1970s, and in many ways the apple of 21st-century  software development has fallen disappointingly close to the tree of the past. So let's turn back  the clock to see what we could have learned from the past, what we can still learn from the past  and what the future might hold in store for code and its development."
