description: "Natural Language Code Search for GitHub Using Kubeflow - Jeremy Lewi, Google & Hamel Husain, GitHub \n\nTurning ML into magical products often requires complex, distributed systems that bring with them a unique, ML specific set of infrastructure problems. A year ago, we started building Kubeflow to leverage Kubernetes to solve these problems. In this talk, we will use the example of a search engine for code using natural language (http://bit.ly/gh-kf-search) to illustrate how Kubeflow and Kubernetes can be used to deploy and manage ML products. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrVn"
