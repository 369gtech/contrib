Some of these concepts can help us better prepare for an interview, while others can help us find our strengths and make a bigger impact. All of the musical theatre concepts combined can help us get better at interviews and drive us to become better software engineers and managers.\n\nThe world is full of drama - let's add a spark to our job search!\n\nBio: Victoriya Kalmanovich is an SW team lead at Aspectiva - a Walmart company.
