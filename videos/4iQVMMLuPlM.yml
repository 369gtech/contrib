Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. In this open panel, ask .NET performance experts anything you’d like about profiling, optimization, and the state of high-performance .NET applications today. Bringing together experts on microbenchmarking, distributed system architecture, GC optimization, and low-level CPU tricks, the discussion is guaranteed to be interesting. Among other things, we’ll talk about how to avoid performance regressions, how to choose which part of the system warrants investments in profiling and optimization, and how to build a system that consists of multiple disparate microservices while maintaining low latency and scalability."
