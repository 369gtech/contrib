description: "Modern Web applications are built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript on the client side, which interact with server-side Java, using REST services. Eclipse is the premier platform of choice for developers building modern Web applications. Which plug-ins will make you the most productive? This demo-driven session builds an end-to-end Web application for building services with EclipseLink and REST. It shows the powerful design-time features of the Eclipse VJET project for building a rich HTML5 application with popular JavaScript components. The presentation shows how Eclipse enables JavaScript library management, code completion, validation, and testing and debugging from within both the IDE and the browser.\n\n\nAuthor:\nCameron Bateman\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Cameron Bateman at https://www.parleys.com/author/cameron-bateman\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
