language: English
recordingDate: 1404350156
description: 'Eclipse Flux project can deliver essential Java IDE features such as Content Assist, Problem Markers and much more. The video demonstrates how integration of Flux project into Orion can bring Eclipse JDT Content Assist and Problem Markers into Orion Java source editor. It shows Orion and Eclipse side-by-side and goes over project''s file contents synchronization between a Java project in Eclipse connected to Flux and the mirror of this project in Orion navigator. It goes further and demonstrates how editing of files in Eclipse and Orion editors is synchronized (just like for Google docs), enables content assist and problem markers from Eclipse JDT right in the Orion editor. Furthermore, the problem markers are updated as text is being typed in the Orion editor just like it would in Eclipse.'
