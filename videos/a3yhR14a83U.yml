description: "Filmed at http://2015.dotcss.io on December 4th in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\nCSS was designed with boundaries in place to make it simple and accessible to “non-programmers”. Those boundaries have benefits as well as drawbacks that affect us in technical and non-technical ways. Recent developments in web tooling and technologies are expanding the boundaries of CSS -- hopefully for the better."
