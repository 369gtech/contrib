description: "This video will get you up and running with your first AI Writer able to write a short story based on an image that you input. \n\nThe code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/AI_Writer\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nGreat write-up on recurrent neural nets (LSTMs and GRUs)\nhttp://deeplearning4j.org/lstm.html\n\nPaper on skip thought vectors:\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06726v1\n\nPaper on Unifying Visual Semantic Embeddings:\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2539v1.pdf\n\nYou can test this code out at this site! It's really cool, they have a bunch of deep learning models in the cloud, you just have to upload an input and it gives you an output:\nhttp://www.somatic.io/models/2n6g7RZQ\n\nIf you're interested in NLP, check out Michael Collins course. This guy is such a G (it's free and open source!):\nhttps://www.coursera.org/course/nlangp\n\nAnd check out this guy's free deep learning course on Udacity:\nhttps://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page. If you like my videos, feel free to help support my effort here!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&u=3191693\n\nMuch more to come so please subscribe, like, and comment.\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
