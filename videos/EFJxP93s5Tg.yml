description: "Side projects can be daunting if you're new to them. It takes discipline to get started, and even more so to finish. And what's even more daunting is that finishing is only the beginning of maintenance.\n\nIn this talk, I'll relate my adventures coming up with dance-mat.js, the project for making a Dance Dance Revolution controller with Raspberry Pi, the Bare Conductive PiCap, and Node.js."
