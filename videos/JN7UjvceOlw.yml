description: "The speaker talks about his first impressions on the universality of JavaScript, and how it’s different from isomorphic JavaScript (when any given line of code can execute both the server and the client). The main difference is that Universal JavaScript means Write Once, Run Everywhere and “universal” needs to be a platform concern and not a development target.\n\n\nThe spaker also talks about the different JavaScript runtimes (browsers, Node.js, Deno, Edge Workers and others), namespaces objects, and ECMAScript Modules.\n\n\nEVENT:\nNodeJS Interactive 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nMyles Borins, Developer Advocate, Google\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish the NodeJS Interactive talks\n\n\nCREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2M7g8Xwc7g"
