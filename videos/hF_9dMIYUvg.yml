recordingDate: 1505128591
description: "It can be a real challenge to convert from a server side whole page desktop site to a responsive design with client side logic. Having over 600 different customers already using the desktop version and expecting seamless upgrades does not make this journey any easier. \n\nThis event will focus on approaches and techniques used to accomplish a transformation from a traditional desktop design to a responsive one, adaptive for all devices. If you are interested in front end and/or responsive design you will most probably get some great takeaways from this session. \n\nMathias Lagerwall is co founder and CTO at Netset AB and has been working as a full stack developer for roughly 20 years. \n\nDaniel Juzovitskij is working with front end design at Netset AB, and has been responsible for the front end part in the responsive project.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
