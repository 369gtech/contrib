description: "NorDevCon - 9th April 2014\n\nMainframe for Start-ups\nby Colin Mower \n(@ColinMower)\n\nMany view the a Mainframe as big, expensive and archaic. As the Mainframe (or System z as it is known) reaches it's 50th year, you will learn in this talk how these views are challenged, and understand how it has been evolving quietly, remaining at the cutting edge of IT. System z is still as relevant today in modern computing as it was in the 1960's, and can be applied to almost any business size and need. \n\nColin Mower has been working in IT for 17 years, joining Norwich Union as a Mainframe Systems Programmer, before moving into cross platform design and architecture. He joined IBM in 2011 as a client facing architect, and spends most of his time on Greater Anglia trains or on the A11. Outside of work, he is kept busy with two young children, a mini computer museum and vague attempts at keeping fit through cycling and running.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/166258512/\n"
