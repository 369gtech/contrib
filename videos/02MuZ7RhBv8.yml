So, Microservices are the next important thing in designing scalable, easy-to-maintain applications. This not only makes application development easier but also offers great flexibility and lets you utilize various resources optimally. If you want to build an enterprise-ready implementation of the Microservices architecture, then this course is the first step for you!\n\n------------------------\n\nWhat are the Objectives of our Microservices Architecture Training?\n\n1.Understand and differentiate between various Microservices Architectural styles\n2.Apply Microservices Architecture principles\n3.Know how to make the appropriate Microservice Architecture decision\n4.Develop and test a Microservice\n5.Know what technologies can be used to enable Microservices with an example\n\n------------------------\n\nWhy should you go for Microservices Architecture Training?\n\nMicroservices Architecture, or simply Microservices, is a unique method of developing software systems as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services in which each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal. Thanks to its scalability, this architectural method is considered ideal when you have to enable support for a range of platforms and devices spanning across the web, mobile, Internet of Things, and so on. Because of its flexibility, you can also use this method when youâ€™re not sure what kind of devices youâ€™ll need to support in an increasingly Cloud-based future.\n\n------------------------\n\nWho should go for this Microservices Architecture Training?\n\n1.Application Architects\n2.Software Architects\n3.Application Developers\n4.Developer working on Web, Cloud, Mobile, and other social technologies\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free)."
