title: 'Immutable Database. Safe Way to Migrate Large Data Stores. (Yevhen Bobrov, Ukraine) [RU]'
recordingDate: 1545238982
description: "Relational database schema migration is a procedure familiar for everyone: add a new field, create transformation script, run it, several seconds of waiting and done!\n\nBut what if the data volume is bigger than 1 TB or even 10+ TB? How to guarantee high availability of the storage? How not to miss the updates? What if something goes wrong during migration? Who wants to be responsible for the downtime of a 24?7?365 system?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll take a deep dive into an approach for safe large-scale data migration, that we use in YouScan to evolve multi-terabyte Elasticsearch cluster. You will understand what role do DevOps culture and Immutable Infrastructure principle play in this approach and what additional benefits it could bring."
