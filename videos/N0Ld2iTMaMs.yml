description: "DeepMind recently released a new paper called \"Neural Scene Representation and Rendering\". Its pretty amazing stuff, I have to admit. Their AI, if given just a single image of an environment, can generate a 3D map of that environment. That includes all the objects, textures, colors, and shapes that it sees. In this video,. I'll talk about its applications, theory, and code it up myself in Keras even though they haven't released any code to give you a programmatic example. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Generative-Query-Network\n\nPlease Subscribe!
