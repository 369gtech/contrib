description: "This presentation was recorded at Aarhus' GOTO Night 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nAndy Gross - Chief Architect at Basho Technologies\n\nABSTRACT\nOctober 2012 marks the five year anniversary of Amazon's seminal Dynamo paper, which inspired most of the NoSQL databases that appeared shortly after its publication, including Riak. In this session, Andy will reflect on five years of involvement with Riak and distributed databases and discuss what went right, what went wrong, and what the next five years may hold for Riak as we outgrow our Dynamo roots.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
