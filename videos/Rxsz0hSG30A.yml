The Data Platform’s responsibility is not only to collect, structure, and index the incoming data, but also add extra value by adding additional information to the events, known as enrichments.\n\nTo offer targeted advertising based on location, the Data Platform enriches all incoming events using an API that will translate IP addresses into coordinates. To do this in real-time and at scale, with sub-second latencies, we utilize Kafka and Kafka Streams.\n\nIn this presentation, I will introduce Kafka, Kafka Streams, the Kafka Streams DSL and the Processor API to explain how it can be used for branching, caching, bulking, asynchronous HTTP lookups, and joining. I will also talk about experiences related to operations, performance, and scaling."
