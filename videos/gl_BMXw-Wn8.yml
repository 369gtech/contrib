description: "Martin Krafft\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/249/\n\nBy now you've probably heard the term \"self-sovereign identity\", and most likely this was associated with blockchain of one form or another. Let's cut through the hype and look at what decentralising identity, and putting users back in control of their data is really all about. I'll introduce the concept of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and look at what the hard questions are, which by the way, blockchain cannot solve for you.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource"
