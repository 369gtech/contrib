description: "When you first get started with using Springboot microservices in a distributed architecture, things are remarkably easy. But it won’t take long for a production system to start showing some signs of strain. Responses get slower, availability decreases and you’ll suddenly start realize that services aren’t always as decoupled as you thought! This is often because of too much peer-to-peer communication, missing possibilities to store state which leads to a resistance to use asynchronous or reactive concepts.\n\nI will demonstrate how a workflow engine or state machine can easily improve your architecture and decrease coupling.\n\nI will have three Springboot microservices ready, refactor them live on stage and add Camunda’s Open Source workflow engine. You will not only gain a better understanding on the architecture, but also can follow along on the code level.\n\nNiall Deehan is a Developer Advocate for the Camunda BPM Open Source platform."
