title: 'Postponing architectural choices and start developing first with Dapr - MichaÃ«l Hompus'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623754498
description: "When starting a new project, we tend to make a lot of architectural choices when it comes to components like (relational) databases, service busses, and deployment models like cloud and/or on premises. Most of the choices will be based on past experiences and upfront assumptions. But are they part of the right solution to your current challenge?\nWhen you discover it is not the right fit, are you still able to change your code to use the better tool? Or is it now too expensive to change?\n\nWhat if we could postpone our choices and just can start developing the right solution first, and pick the right dependencies when we know which those are, or maybe even keep it open until it is time to launch.\n\nDapr is a distributed application runtime which promises us we can postpone our decisions until we know what the right decision is. In this session we will discover how that is possible."
