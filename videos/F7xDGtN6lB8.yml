description: "Lightning Talk: Optimizing Kubernetes Networking at Datadog - Laurent Bernaille, Datadog \n\nAs your applications become composed of more and more microservices, network traffic becomes challenging both in terms of latency and throughput. Datadog applications are network-intensive, so we invested a lot of time in optimizing the network when we started to migrate to Kubernetes to minimize the induced overhead. This talk will start by giving a quick overview of our challenges. It will then explain how we manage the different types of traffic: pod-to-pod, pod-to-service and ingress. For all of those, I will show how our setup evolved and why and what we are looking into for the future. The talk will detail the CNI and ingress plugins we explored and the issues we faced along the way, as well as some contributions we made to these projects. \n\nTo learn more: https://sched.co/GrVD"
