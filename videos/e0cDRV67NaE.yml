description: "Speaker: Nils Binder\r\n\r\nYou may think, art history and frontend development do not have much in common. Well, you may be surprised. Some of the problems we have to deal with today were discussed in art history long before the invention of the Internet. Also, the skills needed to analyze a piece of art correctly show significant similarity to the capabilities required to implement modern layouts with CSS. This talk will show you how to analyze a static layout by looking beyond pixels. Instead, you will understand why a given design works the way it does and translate this to modern CSS.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://singaporecss.github.io/54/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
