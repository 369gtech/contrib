description: "Speakers: Josh Long and Joram Barrez, Activiti\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/joshlong/process-driven-applications-with-spring-boot\nToday's applications are complex, distributed systems that - taken together - produce results. Tracking the flow of work through that system, however, becomes increasingly more painful as automated- and human-driven tasks are integrated into business processes. Business can't react to what it can't see. Business can't measure what it can't see. \"Workflow\" describes the sequence of processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion. Workflow systems, like Activiti, describe and then execute these processes. Activiti is an open-source, Apache 2-licensed workflow engine that works with Spring and Spring Boot. In this webinar, join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long and Activiti-ninja Joram Barrez for a look at how to distill, describe and reuse complex business processes using Spring (and Spring Boot) and Activiti.\n\nLearn more about Spring Boot: http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot\nLearn more about Activiti below!\nActiviti project page: http://activiti.org/\nJoram's blog: http://jorambarrez.com/blog\nActiviti documentation: http://activiti.org/userguide/index.html\nActiviti Github: https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti"
