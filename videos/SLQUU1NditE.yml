description: "AthenaX is Uberâ€™s self-service stream processing platform. It empowers users, both technical and non-technical, to run comprehensive, production-quality streaming analytics using Flink SQL. From our user feedback, we found learning different SQL dialects has been a pain point for data users to achieve high productivity. In this talk, we will introduce our initiative and production experience to support Presto SQL in AthenaX for users who have been using Presto SQL for interactive queries and ELT.\n\n0:00 Overview\n7:19 Default SQL\n12:58 Implementation\n32:37 Future work"
