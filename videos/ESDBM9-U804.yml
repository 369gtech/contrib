description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nSeptember 24, 2009\r\nslides: http://www.slideshare.net/jchrisa/couchdb-local-web-platform\r\nWeb Exponents: http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=689D6EE903ED5CB6&search_query=web+exponents\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Chris Anderson.\r\n\r\nCouchDB's web API and offline replication capabilities make it ideally suited to power a sea-change in the relationships between users and service providers. I'll give a 10,000 foot overview of CouchDB, as well as discuss the benefits and challenges of writing applications that can be replicated transparently from the cloud to local machines.\r\n\r\nChris Anderson is an Apache CouchDB committer and co-author of the forthcoming O'Reilly book \"CouchDB: The Definitive Guide\". He is a director of couch.io, offering commercial hosting, support, consulting, and custom development. He enjoys working on JavaScript CouchApps which can be peer-replicated just like any other data. Chris is obsessed with bending the physics of the web to give control back to users."
