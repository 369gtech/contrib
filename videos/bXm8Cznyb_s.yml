description: "EventStorming enables a team struggling with understanding and exploring a complex business problem to model that problem collaboratively in hours instead of weeks. In this talk youâ€™ll learn how this technique quickly generates shared understanding and insights into how the software can, and should, support the business capability being explored.\n\nIn EventStorming, development team members and business people gather in a room and together they create a visual map of the flow of events - important things that happen - through concrete business examples. They use sticky notes to map out a story of how the software system behaves, or should behave, given a particular business problem to solve. This session will teach you the rules of EventStorming and how it can help your team.\n\nI am from Perth, Australia, but choose to live, work and play with my amazing wife and two children in Denver, Colorado.\n\nI can often be found enjoying barefoot running, gymnastics, guitar playing, serving my church community, and good conversations with friends and family.\n\nI co-founded and co-lead DDD Denver. Look for me speaking at local user groups, and at regional and international conferences.\n\nIf you are looking for an expert hands-on team coach and design mentor in Domain-Driven Design (DDD), BDD with Cucumber, or lean/agile process I am available for consulting and training through my company, Virtual Genius LLC..\n\nFor more on YOW!
