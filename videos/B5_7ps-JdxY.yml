description: "The Jupyter ecosystem already comes with popular libraries for creating interactive charts such as Bokeh and Plotly. But in some situations, we need access to a lower level API to draw custom shapes (triangles, circles, squares). The purpose of this presentation is to go through examples of custom JupyterLab extension using Jupyter Widgets and a JavaScript library called Pixi.js.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData Berlin 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJeremy Tuloup\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
