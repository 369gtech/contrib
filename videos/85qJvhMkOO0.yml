description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nObservability Brings Clarity in 5G World - Yamini Sridaran & Praveen George, Affirmed Networks \n\nKubernetes has become the de-facto standard for running 5G core virtual network functions (VNFs) - a set of standards defined applications, each implemented as dozens of microservices and often run across multiple K8s clusters. Centralized monitoring, early detection of problems, and deep troubleshooting tools are essential to ensure telco-grade availability of this complex set of inter-connected microservices. In this talk we present our experience building and using our telco observability platform using CNCF projects. This platform provides: End to End 5G call tracing across multiple VNFs using Jaeger 5G network performance monitoring using 1000s of base and derived metrics using Prometheus Fault detection and troubleshooting using AlertManager, Fluentd and Kibana Attend this talk to learn how observability brings clarity to complex, high-reliability applications such as 5G VNFs. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekCx"
