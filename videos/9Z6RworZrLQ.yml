description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nSeptember 2, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIn recent years, cloud computing has emerged as an attractive tool for delivering web-based services. Cloud computing enables rapid deployment of new services and allows those services to scale dynamically, in response to changing user demand. However, the range of cloud computing applications is constrained by limitations of the Internet service model. New network level services are needed to enable advanced applications that include real-time, person-to-person communication. This talk discusses how to add a dynamic network layer to cloud computing infrastructures, to enable the rapid introduction of new network services in support of advanced applications.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Jonathan S. Turner\r\nJonathan S. Turner received the MS and PhD degrees in computer science from Northwestern University in 1979 and 1981. He holds the Barbara and Jerome Cox Chair of Computer Science at Washington University, is Chairman of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and Director of the Applied Research Lab. The Applied Research Laboratory creates experimental networking technology to validate and demonstrate new research innovations. The Lab's current projects center on extensible networking technology with a particular focus on high performance platforms for overlay hosting services.\r\n\r\nProfessor Turner served as Chief Scientist for Growth Networks, a startup company that developed scalable switching components for Internet routers and ATM switches, before being acquired by Cisco Systems in early 2000.\r\n\r\nTurner is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a fellow of ACM and a fellow of the IEEE. He received the Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award from the IEEE in 1994 and the IEEE Millenium Medal in 2000. He has been awarded 30 patents for his work on switching systems and has many widely cited publications."
