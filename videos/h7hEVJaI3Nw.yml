description: "Minority Report, starring Tom Cruise, was a 2002 American science fiction film based in 2054 where police officers apprehended criminals based on predictions and foreknowledge. We are not in 2054 but fast-forward to present day, we are now closer than ever before to the world imagined in Minority Report. Machine Learning (ML) is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn and make predictions. ML for all intents and purposes is foreknowledge! When foreknowledge is combined with computer vision, a machine exists that has the potential to outlearn and become smarter than its human makers.\n\nThis talk discusses machine learning, computer vision, and reveals the \"secrets\" and technologies behind S. A. M. (Suspicious Activity Monitor). During this talk, attendees are exposed to tools like Amazon Machine Learning and Amazon Rekognition. There is even bonus material that reveals how to invoke Machine Learning algorithms using the Internet of Things (IoT). Attendees walk away with knowledge to architect and even develop their own Machine Learning algorithms. To learn more about S. A. M., visit his website at http://www.iamsam.tech/."
