description: "Speaker: Michael Plod, InnoQ @bitboss\n Domain-Driven Design is currently experiencing a lot of attention and has evolved constantly the last couple of years. The fifth and final part of the webinar series is all about code.\n\nSo far we have discussed the theory behind Domain-Driven Design. You learned about Bounded Contexts, Strategic Design and the internal building blocks like aggregates, entities or value objects.\n\nThis time you will learn how to implement aggregates, how to handle their persistence, or how to work with domain events (using Spring Cloud Stream or Spring Web for feeds). Another part we are going to look at is how to implement microservices based on the idea of hexagonal architectures with Spring Boot and a bunch of other Spring technologies.\n\nThis webinar is all code and zero slides. \n\nhttps://github.com/mploed/ddd-with-spring\n\nhttps://github.com/mploed/event-driven-spring-boot\n\nEuropean training from InnoQ on DDD:\nhttps://www.innoq.com/en/trainings/domain-driven-design-in-der-praxis/"
