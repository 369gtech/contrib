description: "When you're a first-time leader it's hard to transition from being a problem solver to leading a team to solve problems. It's often tempting to step in and solve problems for your team. However, the more often you step-in, you end up stripping your team's autonomy and neglecting your own work. Ultimately, this makes it hard to scale yourself.\n\nInstead, you need to learn how to train your teammates, delegate problems to them, trust they'll be able to resolve them, and develop an intuition for knowing when it's appropriate to step in and help solve a problem.\n\nIn this talk, Poornima Vijayashanker will be sharing a framework for scaling yourself and building a self-sufficient team.\n\nAbout Poornima Vijayashanker\nFor more than a decade, Poornima Vijayashanker has led teams through recruiting, onboarding, retaining technical talent, and going from idea to shipping product to successfully exiting.\n\nShe is currently the founder of Femgineer. Previously, Poornima was an entrepreneur-in-residence at 500 Startups, a mentor-in-residence at Techstars, a lecturer at Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering, and the founding engineer at Mint.com from its prototype to acquisition in 2009.
