description: "In this episode, Filip and Matt start by erasing some of the technical debt that the Hacker News reader app accumulated in the past 3 episodes. They remove the new keyword everywhere, delete unused files, and re-enable unit tests.\n\nThen they set out to tackle state management and separation of concerns between view logic and business logic. They choose to follow the BLoC pattern, using Streams and ReactiveX (rxdart).\n\nWith that in place, they implement a new feature: ability to switch between the listing of top and new stories.\n\nLet us know your thoughts and requests for future episodes in the comments below or on Twitter using #BoringShow.\n\nGet started with Flutter → https://flutter.io\nTry a Flutter codelab → https://goo.gl/d3fHPo \nJoin the conversation → https://goo.gl/68oUnb \n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel → http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
