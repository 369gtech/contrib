title: 'DEF CON 29 ICS Village - Dieter Sarrazyn -  Fortifying ICS   Hardening and Testing'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632164398
description: "Every ICS environment will sooner or later have to deal with updates, upgrades or additions to the control system environment. Nowadays it is important to include cybersecurity within such projects, although that is still sometimes forgotten (sad but true). One of the ways to include security is to set security requirements but also perform hardening and cybersecurity testing within FAT and SAT cycles.\n\nThis talk will explain important elements of hardening as well as things to keep in mind when performing cybersecurity testing during FAT/SAT phases after performing said hardening."
