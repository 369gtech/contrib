description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay 21, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAlex Sotirov is a vulnerability engineer at determina. He will discuss some latest techniques in reverse engineering software to find vulnerabilities. Particularly, he'll discuss his technique that lead him to find the ANI bug (a critical new bug in WinXP and Vista).\n\nAlex will describe the tools he uses for reverse engineering and show how he reverse engineered ANI Bug. He will continue to discussed Windows security mechanisms (ASLR, /GS) and describe how ANI exploit bypasses them.  Credits: Speaker:Alex Sotirov"
