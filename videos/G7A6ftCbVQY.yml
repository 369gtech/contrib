description: 'OAuth2 allows users to delegate abilities to applications, so applications can act on resources on the user''s behalf. It''s a great story, but the story seems to end when the request makes it into your microservices based architecture. With microservices, the ""application"" in an OAuth2 interaction might actually be many applications, and the ""resource"" may need to call other resources. What should your services do once they obtain the user''s token? Is there a way to assert a particular call stack through your web of applications in a way that''s both performant, and flexible for when your services evolve? What if some applications don''t use HTTP? In this talk, you''ll see a standards based approach to solve all these problems, and provide a consistent method for enforcing each application''s security policies.'
