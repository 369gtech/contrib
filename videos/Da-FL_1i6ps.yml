description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nMany of the available resources on unit testing focus on standard software engineering tasks, but data science work involves some unique challenges. After a refresher on the basic building blocks, you’ll learn the tips and tricks I’ve gathered writing test suites for several data science libraries at ShopRunner.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
