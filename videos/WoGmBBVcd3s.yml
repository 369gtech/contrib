description: "Leon Wright\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/108/\n\nLate one evening at LCA2017, Leon found himself in his room and exhausted from the day's social interactions. Earlier he'd been bouncing some ideas around for something he could hack into his badge. Armed with a ESP8266, a bag of electronics, and vague understanding of C++; The 'Hug Detecting' badge was born!\r\n\r\nThrough this journey you will learn about the challenges faced when building adhoc hardware into a conference badge, literally load testing, Twitter shadow bans, and much much more. So hang around for a glance into how a whimsical project turned into a novel way of managing and overcoming social anxiety.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

Hall"
