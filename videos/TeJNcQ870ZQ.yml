description: "Calculating the Operations Cost of Software You Haven't Developed\n\nJohn Davis, Lead Architect, easyJet\n\nOne of the challenges an enterprise has with DevOps is cost. It is not acceptable for an enterprise project to request that the board write a blank cheque. This can be further complicated by legacy systems perhaps requiring that actual hardware is purchased rather than being able to use a cloud provider. \n\nWhat we would like to have is an idea of costs before development have created all the software.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
