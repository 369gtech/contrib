description: 'Lets face it writing fault tolerant, concurrent and scalable application is hard. Working with locks and threads are painful and sometimes plain wrong. I think it is because we are using wrong tools to build our concurrent, fault tolerant and scalable applications. We need a tool that will raise the level of abstract so that we don’t have to deal with complexity cause by threads, clustering and network failures. Come to this presentation to find how Akka help you to build Reactive applications.'
