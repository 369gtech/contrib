title: '"PyTorch: Fast Differentiable Dynamic Graphs in Python" by Soumith Chintala'
language: English
recordingDate: 1506788069
description: "In this talk, we will be discussing PyTorch: a deep learning framework that has fast neural networks that are dynamic in nature.\nPyTorch is written in a mix of Python and C/C++ and is targeted for very high performance using GPUs and CPUs. We'll be discussing the design and challenges of PyTorch, as well as the need for the dynamic nature because of new-age AI research. We will also be talking about a Tensor compiler that powers PyTorch, which fuses operations on the fly to make them faster.\n\nSoumith Chintala\nFACEBOOK\n\nSoumith is a Research Engineer at Facebook AI Research. He works on high performance deep learning."
