title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2012: Matt Patterson - Visualising public service:  Seeing inside Birmingham City'
recordingDate: 1545060606
description: "Birmingham City Council is Europe's largest municipal authority. In 2011 they commissioned a project to visualize the data coming out of their call centres: what, and where, the public were contacting them about, and when they were doing it. The result was http://civicdashboard.org.uk/, which we built together with the digital design agency Mudlark, in a short space of time, and on a very tight budget. This session will cover: * Working with highly structured data whose schema regularly changes * Importing data exported from SAP * Prototyping data exploration * Deeply nested data structures in MongoDB * Hosting an app like this on Heroku * Performance\n\nmore info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/visualising-public-service-seeing-inside-birmingham-city-councils-interactions-public\n\nDescription of Matt Patterson https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/matt-patterson"
