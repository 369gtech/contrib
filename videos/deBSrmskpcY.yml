language: English
recordingDate: 1571235707
description: "The Micrometer library is extremely useful. In this presentation, we'll review the basics of recording metrics as well as give an intro to the Prometheus and Grafana backends and dashboarding. \n\nAfter the introductory points, we'll step back to see what story we want our monitoring to tell us along with alerting. We'll dig into some of the metrics offered by Hystrix, Resilience4J, and RestTemplate via Micrometer to understand how our system's health is, along with tips for making Spring Actuator's HealthIndicator beans useful as Micrometer alerts. \n\nLastly, we'll look at how we could get some simple frontend metrics by funneling metrics from an Angular application back to our Micrometer backend. \n\nSpeaker: Clint Checketts; Core Committer Micrometer Project, Software Engineer; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/performance-monitoring-backend-and-frontend-using-micrometer"
