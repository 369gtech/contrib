description: "There are multiple scenarios where having attestable documents and media is valuable. Media doesn’t belong on the blockchain, but hashes of the media and metadata can be added. In this video we demonstrate a blockchain devkit accelerator that shows how to hash a media file, uploaded to a service like Adobe Creative Cloud, and its metadata and add it to a blockchain.\nURL: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/blockchain/blob/master/blockchain-development-kit/accelerators/attestable-documents-and-media/blockchain-workbench/AdobeCreativeCloud/README.md"
