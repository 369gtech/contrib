title: '"What Lies Beneath: What are they really tracking and how?" - Anne Jessel (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579268038
description: "Anne Jessel\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/55/\n\nMany people know that Facebook and other companies track what we do online. Cookies and JavaScript are complicit in allowing Facebook and others to know what we like and who our friends are. Some people accept this as part of the price of a $0 service they enjoy using. Others take care to block cookies, and reduce the amount of personal data that third parties can gather about them.\r\n\r\nBut what information is really being collected when you are using the web? Where, when and how is it being collected? Do those who agree to this data collection really know what they are handing over? And are those who don't agree having any success at protecting their personal data?\r\n\r\nI will show you how extensive is the information Facebook openly admits to collecting (if you know where to look!), and how easy it is for Facebook to collect it without your knowledge. You will also see how third parties routinely gather your data from other websites, in many cases without the website owner realising. \r\n\r\nWe will look at a real world example by analysing a fairly typical website of a well-known company that isn't known for its data collection, to see what sorts of things it is sending to third parties. In addition, you'll see the results of research into what those third parties use the data for.\r\n\r\nFinally I will discuss what you can do if you wish to better protect your personal data, and some of the problems you may face, including why deleting your cookies may be counter-productive.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
