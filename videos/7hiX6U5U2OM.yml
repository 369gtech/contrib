title: 'Thomas Sundberg "How to fail a software project fast and efficiently?'
recordingDate: 1358538769
description: "Software development is an industry that has been around for a little bit more than 50 years. There are a lot of really smart people working in this industry. How is it possible that these smart people are so good at failing? How can we as an industry continue year after year with failing or really slow development?\n\nThe answer is embarrassingly easy, we tend to apply methods and techniques we don't understand or that don't bring any value.\n\nThere are many anti patterns that can be applied to software projects.\n\nThey tend to fall into these categories:\n\n    Architectural\n    Development\n    User interface\n    Organisational\n    Management\n\nWe will look at a selection of these anti patterns and see why they are so bad and the problems they contribute with.\n\nJust looking at bad examples may be depressing. But if you can identify a bad example in your own project or product then you have a chance to do something about it. Understanding and accepting that you have a problem is always the first step to fix it."
