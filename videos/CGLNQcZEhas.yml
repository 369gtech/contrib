description: "As a young mom, this #APEX developer coded a reading log app for her kids. Now it has 500,000 users. Continuing our APEX App Creator Spotlight article series, Oracle brand journalist Alexa Morales interviews Michelle Skamene, vice president of consulting services at Insum [https://www.insum.ca] about how she built the app.\n\n2:40 Reading Rewards demo\n3:20 Detailed reading logs can be printed with AOP https://www.apexofficeprint.com\n3:46 Searching for books\n3:56 Tricks of integrating with Amazon Product Advertising API\n6:23 Interactive dashboard view\n6:49 iOS native app pros and cons\n7:20 APEX progressive web app comparison\n7:45 Third-party components\n7:59 A career built on APEX\n\nEleven years ago, Michelle Skamene was a mom of six- and eight-year-old boys who, like most of their peers, favored video games over books. In order to encourage them to “earn” their gaming hours, she and her husband had the kids track reading time on a spreadsheet. \n\n“That worked, but it became a bit onerous,” says Skamene, who discovered APEX (then called HTMLDB) in 2003 as a developer for the McGill University Research Institute in Montreal. “I happened to be an APEX developer even way back then. I thought, you know what? I'm going to do something different.”\n\nSkamene, now vice president of consulting services at Insum [https://www.insum.ca], created an APEX app that the kids could use to log their time. Reading Rewards [https://www.reading-rewards.com] soon attracted not only parents, but also teachers tired of paper reading logs.\n\nAPI-driven fun\n\nReading Rewards helps children choose and review books from a virtual library, using Amazon’s Product Advertising API. Other APIs and components further enhance the Reading Rewards experience. The app makes data dazzling via various APEX and FusionCharts JavaScript elements, turning dashboards and challenge pages into colorful, motivational progress indicators. Teachers can print out certificates of achievement using APEX Office Print https://www.apexofficeprint.com/, a third-party plugin for PDF printing. Finally, Reading Rewards processes payment via the Paypal API, and onboards users via the Mailchimp API.\n\nMobile: Go native or progressive?\n\nReading Rewards has an iOS app that communicates directly to the same database using RESTful web services [https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/application-express/20.1/aeutl/about-oracle-RESTful-services-in-application-express.html].  However, native mobile apps require specialized developer resources, as well as the maintenance overhead of submitting to different app stores. “It's a native app, and Oracle APEX and ORDS made it easy to integrate,” says Skamene, reflecting on the early decisions she made. But if we were to do it again, years later, I would probably go the progressive web app route.”\n\nFor a beautiful example of how slick a progressive web app based on APEX can be, look no further than evry [https://evryapp.org], for which Skamene is a member of the board. evry is an environmental initiative by Steven Feuerstein and Vincent Morneau; Insum has contributed developer talent to the app (an earlier version, called Fabe, was profiled on Forbes https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2019/06/11/does-skipping-the-plastic-straw-feel-futile-against-climate-change-help-is-on-the-way/]). “Using the progressive web app gives you all of the bells and whistles of the native apps without the overhead of having the native code and the two different versions,” Skamene explains.\n\nA career built on APEX\n\nUltimately, Skamene has charted a path with APEX app creation and consulting that has sustained much of her career — and she’s passionate about that. \n\n“I love what I do,” Skamene says. “We've had some amazing testimonials, teachers and parents that have written us to say, ‘This has really helped our kids go from being reluctant readers to avid readers.’ I can't think of anything better, really. I feel very lucky.”\n\n#AppCreator #OracleAPEX"
