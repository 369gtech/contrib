description: '“I tested it how you told me to”, “Acceptance Criteria said this is expected”, “I assumed it is fine” – these are frequent thoughts of teams which more likely to end up with customer cases in Production. Having an opinion about the product and ability to put themselves in its customers’ shoes is what makes a good tester, great. These great testers become the last line of defense before releasing functional but unusable product. In this talk, we will discuss on how to apply Domain Driven Development practices and principles in a testing field, creating Domain Driven Testing. We will learn why it is important to understand exactly what you are working on, and why “Programming by Coincidence” is the main danger to User Experience. The speaker will share his experience in starting in a new domain of Website Building Software, and how learning about other products in the industry allowed him and his team to avoid reinventing the wheel, and as a result to prevent problems which were previously solved by other organizations.'
