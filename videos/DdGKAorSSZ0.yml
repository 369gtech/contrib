title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2011: Jonathan Gray - Realtime BIG DATA at Facebook with Hadoop & HBase'
recordingDate: 1545060761
description: "Buzzwords: NoSQL, Big Data, Realtime, Hadoop, HBase\n\nFacebook has one of the largest Apache Hadoop data warehouses in the world, primarily queried through Apache Hive for offline data processing and analytics. However, the need for realtime analytics and end-user access has led to the development of several new systems built using Apache HBase. This talk will cover specific use cases and the work done at Facebook around building large scale, low latency and high throughput realtime services with Hadoop and HBase. This includes several significant contributions to existing projects as well as the release of new open source projects.\n\nhttp://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/realtime-big-data-facebook-hadoop-and-hbase\n\nDescription of Jonathan Gray: http://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/jonathan-gray"
