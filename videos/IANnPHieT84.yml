description: "RubyConf 2018 - The Games Developers Play by Andy Croll\n\nWe all play games. Not video games, but the “games” of communication and power between humans.\n\nEven the most rational of us may be unaware of the drivers of our behaviour and the impact it has on our ability to work well with others.\n\nFind out how an awareness of our state of mind, our biases and the dynamics of human communication can help us to understand each other, ourselves, and build better software."
