recordingDate: 1501676756
description: "Amazon EC2 is the de-facto IaaS platform for running distributed applications across multiple hosts. Docker is the developer-friendly container technology that enables creation of your application stack: OS, JVM, app server, app, database and all your custom configuration. A typical application is defined with multiple containers and deployed across multiple hosts. This session will show a simple multi-container multi-host application can be deployed using different container orchestration platforms on EC2.Attendees will learn the recipes, design patterns and anti-patterns in this code-intensive session of different container platforms. Specifically, the following platforms that will be covered:\n\nAmazon EC2 Container Service\nDocker Swarm\nKubernetes\nDC/OS\nThe session will start with a brief introduction to an orchestration platform. It will then explain how each platform can be easily started on Amazon EC2. A simple multi-container multi-host application will then be deployed to each platform. The session will conclude with a compare and contrast of different container orchestration platforms on EC2.\n\nArun Gupta is a Principal Open Source Technologist at Amazon Web Services.
