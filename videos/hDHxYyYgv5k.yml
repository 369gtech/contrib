title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Future of the CMS: Decoupled, multichannel, and content-as-a-service'
recordingDate: 1494544186
description: "Content! It’s everywhere! It’s on websites and apps. It’s displayed on computers, televisions, and watches. It’s heard on phones, radios, and screen readers. How can you keep pace with the rapidly changing landscape of content management and publishing?\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn how media companies, publishers, universities, and nonprofits are adapting and thriving — all while keeping their content centrally managed and easy to update. We’ll discuss:\n\n    Decoupling your CMS: Separating the management of content from the presentation of content makes it easier to support new technologies and devices. Also known as “headless” Drupal or WordPress, this approach can provide a better experience for users, developers, and designers alike.\n    Multichannel publishing: Distribute your content to any service or device (think Facebook Instant or Apple TV) with minimal changes.\n    Content-as-a-service: Collect, manage, and distribute your content from a single, easy-to-manage location — and foster a community of content contributors and app builders.\n    Future-proofing your project: When is it a good idea to decouple frontend and backend so they’re entirely separate? When is it not?\n\nWe’ll close with a couple of Four Kitchens case studies that demonstrate these techniques:\n\n    TWiT.tv: How we relaunched This Week in Tech as a decoupled Drupal site with an exposed API that allowed their fanbase to directly access content and build their own apps.\n    NBC: How we helped relaunch NBC.com, The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and Saturday Night Live as decoupled Drupal sites with an API that shares content across multiple NBC brands, devices, and apps. Plus, a bonus demonstration of our Amazon Echo app: How we made an app that responds only to human speech.\n\nA webinar version of this session is available."
