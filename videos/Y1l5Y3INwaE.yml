description: "Progressive Web Apps are one of the hottest things to come to the web platform in years, but how much of it is just hot air? When can you actually start shipping these things? Decades ago! In a hands on presentation, I'll show how PWAs are truly meant to be progressive - building on an evolution of web technologies nearly as old as the web itself, and still let you ship one of the most performant and cutting edge web apps around.\n\nABOUT PATRICK KETTNER\n\nPatrick Kettner won a year nine talent show competition singing Gloria Gaynor’s 1978 disco hit “I Will Survive”, and things have been looking up ever since. He has traded in the golden microphone for a PM position on Microsoft Edge, as well as being the lead developer for Modernizr. He lives in Seattle with his wonderful partner Katrina, son Holden, and dog Baxter."
