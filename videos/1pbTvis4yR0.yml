description: "Further information: https://foss-backstage.de/session/hateful-20\n\nI’ll spent a good chunk of these 20 minutes listing a bunch of pet peeves (like the value of documentation contributions or how hard it is to even get started contributing) I have acquired while participating in various FOSS projects (mostly ASF). It might involve some ranting - to be precise there will almost certainly be ranting. And I’m afraid there'll be very little in the way of offering solutions. That’s why I’d love to start a discussion in the hope that others have more ideas than I do."
