He is a Visiting Researcher at the Alan Turing Institute working on tools for open data-driven storytelling. He wrote a popular book called \"Real-World Functional Programming\" and is a lead developer of several F# open-source libraries. He is a partner at fsharpWorks where he provides trainings and consulting services. Tomas' PhD thesis at the University of Cambridge focused on context-aware programming, but his most recent writings also includes two essays try to understand programming through the perspective of philosophy of science.\n\nRethinking compilers with live coding\n\nLive coding environments run your program on-the-fly as you write it. This makes development easier, but it is a challenge for compiler writers - textbook compiler architecture does not work for live coding systems. Iâ€™ll show interesting aspects of a live coding environment for The Gamma, its functional F# implementation and explain how the compiler differs from textbook examples. Along the way, you'll see practical code samples interesting for both web developers and programming language enthusiasts."
