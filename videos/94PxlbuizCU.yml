title: 'The Twelve Factor app: Best Practices for Java Deployment by Joe Kutner'
language: English
recordingDate: 1447405732
description: "Twelve Factor apps are built for agility and rapid deployment. They enable continuous delivery and reduce the time and cost for new developers to join a project. At the same time, they are architected to exploit the principles of modern cloud platforms while permitting maximum portability between them. Finally, they can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture or development practices.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn the principles and best practices espoused by the Twelve Factor app. We’ll discuss how to structure your code, manage dependencies, store configuration, run admin tasks, capture log files, and more. You’ll learn how modern Java deployments can benefit from adopting these principles, and why they fit nicely within the cloud."
