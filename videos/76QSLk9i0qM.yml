description: "By 2020 our household robot will most likely be our house. How will we communicate with it? More and more, our machines now respond to gesture, touch, sight, and sound, but for the really natural interaction we desire, we'll need context and personalization. Perhaps even character and emotion. After all, people are social beings. Weâ€™re hard-wired to communicate in certain ways. Our house may be a robot, but it will still seem like just an environment to us. Will we want a disembodied presence in our homes? Or will we surround ourselves with small social robot toys or appliances that become the  face  of the connected house. The butlers and maids of our machine infrastructure. The translators of the Internet of Things. Attend this session for a discussion of these issues.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAndra Keay\nAndra Keay is the Managing Director of Silicon Valley Robotics, an industry group supporting the innovation and commercialization of robotics technologies.
