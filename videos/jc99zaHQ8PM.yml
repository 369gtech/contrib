language: English
recordingDate: 1563562606
description: "Sumit Sulakhe, LinkedIn\n\nAs we add more products to our offering, the customer base increases, which leads to an increase in the amount of traffic served by the various microservices in our platform. Such a surge, if not handled in a timely manner, might lead to degraded user experience. To avoid such situations we have to plan our infrastructure capacity. The challenge here is not just getting the traffic prediction right but also how we will test our infrastructure to make sure we can handle it. In this session we will discuss the importance of traffic forecasting, what are the challenges faced while forecasting, and how we can verify if our infrastructure can handle the forecasted traffic.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
