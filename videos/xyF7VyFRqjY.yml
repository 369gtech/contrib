description: "You’re mindlessly scrolling through Facebook when you see your friend share a post and comment, “Mine is Bubbles Sunset!”\n\nYou click. It’s a meme that reads: “What’s your stripper name? It’s the name of your first pet and the first street you lived on! Comment with your answers, and share with your friends!”\n\nAre alarm bells going off in your head yet?\n\nSecurity-savvy internet browsers know to be on the lookout for the digital version of a mustached man in a trench coat, like emails selling discounted Viagra. But as you’ve gotten smarter about avoiding these obvious bids for information, attackers and online marketers have gotten subtler to persuade you to divulge personal information. Every second, users willingly divulge sensitive information in comments on social media memes like the stripper name post because they don’t see them as a threat.\n\nIn this talk, Hannah Silvers — social engineer and SEO marketing content strategist —brings the two worlds together. Using (hilarious) real-life examples, she will illustrate how social media memes are hotbeds of valuable PII for marketers and attackers alike, how these memes encourage users to engage with and share them, and the ways attackers can make use of them as an attack vector.\n\nOf course, the talk won’t stop at the doom and gloom. The presenter will discuss implications to the work of security educators and what users can do to mitigate the risk these memes present once they understand how they work."
