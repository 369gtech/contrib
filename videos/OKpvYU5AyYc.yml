title: 'How can I see variable values when debugging?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620672341
description: "One of the primary tasks you'll want to perform when using the debugger is determining the value of different variables. Visual Studio has various windows which can reveal this information, and allow you to dig into the specific ones you're seeking. Leslie Richardson (@lyrichardson01), PM on the Visual Studio team, will show us some of her favorite ways to navigate variables in the debugger.\n\nDid you know... You can find out all about the debugger on Microsoft Docs!\n\n- Visual Studio debugger documentation: https://aka.ms/WebWeds/VSDebuggerDocs\n- Debugger resources: https://aka.ms/vsdebugging"
