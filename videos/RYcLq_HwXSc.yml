description: "\"Image processing with scikit-image and Dash\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - MongoDB  [PyData track]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Emmanuelle Gouillart\n\nImages are an ubiquitous form of data in various fields of science and\nindustry. Images often need to be transformed and processed, for example for helping medical diagnosis by extracting regions of interest or measures, or for building training sets for machine learning. \n\nIn this talk, I will present and discuss several tools for automatic and\ninteractive image processing with Python. I will start by a short\nintroduction to scikit-image (https://scikit-image.org/), the open-source\nimage processing toolkit of the Pydata ecosystem, which aims at\nprocessing images from a large class of modalities (2-D, 3-D, etc.) and\nstrives to have a gentle learning curve with pedagogical example-based\ndocumentation. scikit-image provides users with a simple API based on a large number of functions, which can be used to build pipelines of image processing workflows. \n\nIn a second part, I will explain how to use Dash for building interactive\nimage processing operations. Dash (https://dash.plot.ly/) is an\nopen-source Python web application framework developed by Plotly. Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is meant for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. The dash-canvas component library of Dash (https://dash.plot.ly/canvas) is an interactive component for annotating images with several tools (freehand brush, lines, bounding boxes, ...). It also provides utility functions for using user-provided annotations for several image processing tasks such as segmentation, transformation, measures, etc. The latter functions are based on libraries such scikit-image and openCV. A gallery of examples showcases some typical uses of Dash for image processing on\nhttps://dash-canvas.plotly.host/. Also, other components of Dash can be leveraged easily to build powerful image processing applications, such as widgets to tune parameters or data tables for inspecting object\nproperties.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
