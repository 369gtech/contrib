description: "“Everybody must learn how to code” is a demand you hear a lot. Technical advancements have made computers and online systems a given and automation is threatening a lot of jobs and our traditional ways of working. Good news for us, right? Maybe, but even we as developers, designers and makers of software products are not immune to automation – if anything, we should embrace it more. In this talk Chris Heilmann will question our approach to “coding” and hopefully make you less worried if you think you aren’t “technical enough”.\n\nEVENT:\n\nbtconfMUC2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nChristian Heilmann\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nbeyond tellerrand Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nConference web-site: https://beyondtellerrand.com/"
