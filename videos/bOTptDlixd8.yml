description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKeynote: Pipeline as Code Empowering Cloud-Native CI/CD on Kubernetes Using Open Source Tools - Christian Hernandez, Red Hat\n\nThe pipeline-as-code approach allows git workflows to automate the deployment of CI/CD pipelines, turning code into features faster and at a more secure pace for business. This approach means developers continue to focus on developing and contributing code as they always have, through git repositories, and helps traditional operations teams evolve into their desired SRE or DevOps engineer roles they’ve aspired to become. Kubernetes has provided a platform to integrate all of these tasks and desired tools along the way.\n\nWe’ll demonstrate how to fully integrate git repositories, pipelines, and CD frameworks on top of OpenShift to deliver a complete, declarative, pipeline as code and GitOps framework in a cloud-native environment."
