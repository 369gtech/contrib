When consumers repel trends that are “so last season”, how does one draw patterns from the appropriate signals? Karen will discuss the characteristics of unstructured data that makes identifying and synthesizing fashion trends particularly challenging and how getting it right can be a competitive advantage.\n\nAbout Karen Moon:\nKaren is Co-founder and CEO of Trendalytics, a style-centric visual data platform that measures consumer engagement with merchandise trends.

Previously she worked in Gap Inc.’s Corporate Strategy group, where she assessed acquisition and new retail concept opportunities such as Piperlime.com. Karen started her career in investment banking at Goldman Sachs & Co. where she executed over $1 billion in technology and media transactions.\n\nKaren holds an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School and a B.A. from UCLA where she graduated Summa Cum Laude.
