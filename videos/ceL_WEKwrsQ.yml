description: "Securing a Cloud Migration - Erik Costlow, Contrast Security\n\nCloud Foundry simplifies the “lift & shift” model of cloud migration, making it easy for developers to secure applications before or after migration. By using a suite of free tools, developers can create and deploy self-defending applications to Cloud Foundry that open up security expertise like any other cloud resource: available on-demand without human intervention, scaling to any size.\nWe will cover security differences of on-premise and cloud deployments, and the risk of unsecured cloud deployments. We will then use free tools to analyze applications as they are built and run, matching everything between development, testing, and the cloud.\n\nAbout Erik Costlow\nErik Costlow was Oracle's principal product manager for Java 8 and 9, focused on security and performance. His security expertise involves threat modeling, code analysis, and instrumentation of security sensors. He working to is broaden this approach to security with Contrast Security. Before becoming involved in technology, Erik was a circus performer who juggled fire on a three-wheel vertical unicycle.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
