To support the enormous amount of stateful services and keep-alive connections, the underlying Kubernetes service is facing many challenges including:  • Memory sharing during Pod upgrade • Upgrade jitter (a few ms) for keep-alive services • Automated large-scaled batch and canary deployment • Dynamic quota control • Dynamic cluster node balancing  • High performance HPA for (thousands of) replicas  In this talk, you will learn how we tackled these problems by enhancing Kubernetes, making it a highly reliable platform for Tencent Meeting. \n\nhttps://sched.co/dIMT"
