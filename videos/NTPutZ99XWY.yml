In addition to the invaluable training, ng-conf will deliver a premier conference experience for attendees, providing opportunities to network with other developers, relax at social events, and engage in some of the unique entertainment opportunities available in Utah.\n\nBen Clinkinbeard\nTopic: Angular with Browserify\n\nBrowserify is client side dependency management done right. It enables developers to write client side JavaScript using the CommonJS module format, just like in Node. That means intricate script tag soup and the boilerplate of AMD are completely unnecessary. Not only that, but it opens the door to using thousands of modules from npm, and enables you to write modules that can be used on the client or server interchangeably. Browserify even provides shims of several Node core APIs like EventEmitter, path, and others. This session will introduce Browserify and the CommonJS module format, discuss the benefits they provide, and demonstrate how to utilize those benefits in the context of an Angular app. Angular apps, module definitions, and code organization is a cinch with Browserify, and more people should know it."
