recordingDate: 1534775864
description: "Felix Krause is an iOS and Ruby developer and creator of Fastlane, who previously worked at Twitter and who is now a Software Engineer at Google. In this interview for the \"Coffee with Developers\" series, he talks about how Fastlane came to be, whether Fastlane being acquired by Twitter first and later Google was a good decision, and what the difference between working for Twitter and Google is. On a more personal note, he shares his experience with moving to San Francisco, and why he took the decision of living a more nomad lifestyle and fitting all his belongings in two suitcases. \n\nThe interview was recorded during the WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nInterviewed by Thomas Pamminger, co-founder and CPO of WeAreDevelopers.\n\nFind out more about DevJobs here:\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/devjobs/"
