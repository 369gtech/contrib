description: 'This talk will discuss tools.decompiler, a new library producing readable clojure code starting from plain old JVM bytecode. We’ll go over the design and implementation of the library, discussing the challenges faced along the way, including the different techniques used to parse and reverse engineer bytecode, implement macrocompaction, and work around Hotspost and Clojure bugs. Finally, we’ll show how this library can be used by tools to help users undertand cryptic stacktraces.'
