title: 'Vlad Dumitrescu - Developer tools using the language server protocol - Code BEAM STO'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531412773
description: "One of the problems that development tools had was that each editor and IDE had its own implementation of functionality that could have been common: parsing the code, understanding project structure, etc. Microsoft has specified an open protocol that allows separating language-specific backends from generic editing clients. I will describe an implementation for a LSP server for Erlang (sourcer) and show how it can be used for more than editor support.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nDescribe an infrastructure that provides Erlang support for developer tools, editors, IDEs and others.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/vlad-dumitrescu/"
