description: "Evolving the Cloud Foundry CLI UX - Dies Köper, Fujitsu & Mike Long, Pivotal    \n\nStarting with an overview of what the Cloud Foundry CLI is and what has been added and improved since last year’s Summit, Dies and Mike will give the audience a peek under the covers of the design process they follow for new features for the cf CLI.\n\nCLI anchor Nick will explain how the team converts Dies & Mike’s output into code.\n\nThe cf CLI gets about half a million downloads per month and is used by users of all Cloud Foundry products and offerings. Supporting new features and workflows, as well as improving the user experience of existing workflows without breaking user’s scripts, requires diligent work. Or just luck? Take a peek with us!\n\nMike Long\nPivotal\nProduct Designer\nSan Francisco Bay Area\n\nMike Long has worked on Cloud Foundry as a product designer for nearly three years, and designing tools for developers for about six years.
