description: "Many IoT solutions are business-critical systems that must be reliable and available at the edge. With this new integration, users can use a modern, feature rich and resilient infrastructure layer that Kubernetes provides to run their edge applications. These applications are powered by Azure IoT Edge which provides cloud-managed intelligence by deploying and running AI, Azure services and custom logic directly on the cluster. Edge applications can continue to be managed remotely, securely and at-scale using the simple and familiar deployments from Azure IoT Hub.\n\nLearn more at https://aka.ms/iotedge-on-kubernetes\nJoin us on May, 15th at 9am PT for an IoT Show Deep Dive: Deploying IoT Edge workloads on Kubernetes.
