recordingDate: 1608746670
description: "Observing from Incidents\n\nCory Watson\n\nDespite thousands of squawking alerts and a morass of dashboards our complex systems remain firmly mysterious. Incidents continue to pop up in places that, frankly, they should not. In this talk, we'll leverage techniques from dozens of companies to learn successes and failures, how to spread that hard-earned knowledge via observability and visualizations, and how to productize the process internally to drive down incident impact, improve customer experience, and reduce stress.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
