description: "Writing {{‘poems that change’, ‘chance poems’, ‘dynamic poetry’}}! by Andrew Yoon\n\nRoses are red, violets are—purple? Blue? Why not both! {{‘The Blur Markup Language’, ‘BML’}} allows {{‘writers’, ‘authors’}} to {{‘make’, ‘write’}} text which is lazily evaluated, freeing them from the {{‘requirement’, ‘assumption’}} that their words have to exist in any one {{‘static’, ‘fixed’}} form. Unlike more open-ended text generation approaches, BML allows the creation of {{‘tightly’, ‘precisely’}} composed texts rich with surprises and possibilities. We’ll explore the motivations behind chance poetry{{‘ and BML,’, ‘’}} and see how it’s being used in {{‘the wild’, ‘action’}} from books to essays to installations.\n\nAndrew Yoon is making poems that change, live coding noise, playing melodica, growing the art journal nothing-to-say.org, and advocating for copyright abolition. He can be found online at andrewyoon.art"
