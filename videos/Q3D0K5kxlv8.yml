However, in its wake, businesses and industries are being disrupted. The only way to survive and be competitive is to be more nimble, adaptable and innovative than ever before. And importantly we need to think about our greatest asset – our people – in a new way.\nInvesting in our human capital is even more important than ever, and at Xero, we strive to continually shift the dial on our people experience, creating a positive workplace where our Xeros really can do the best work of their lives. In this presentation, Rebecca will share a number of examples of what Xero is doing to create a positive and evolving people experience\n\nRebecca is the Director of People and Performance for both Australia and Asia at Xero.
