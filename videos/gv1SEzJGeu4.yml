description: "The modern web would be grossly incomplete without JavaScript. While the dev world is using JS to build more user friendly, experience rich, responsive and fast web applications, hackers have been using JavaScript on a parallel trail using the same programming principles as the devs to break implmentations, attack users and servers alike.\n\nIn this very “informally fun” (TM) talk, filled with examples and demos, we will see how hackers (mis)use the constructs available within JavaScript/ECMAScript to go beyond XSS and automate vulnerability discovery, attack seemingly secure endpoints, exploit weaknesses in implementation and break user trust for profit and for fun.\n\nThe key takeways for attendees from this talk would be:\n- Understanding how attackers see and use JavaScript - Introduction to attacks and techniques/usage of JS beyond the standard XSS - How JavaScript can be used as a powerful weapon in the discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities.\n\nEVENT:\n\nJSFOO 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRiyaz Walikar\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KLm7dvhGJw"
