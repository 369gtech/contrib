description: "A Google TechTalk, 2018-11-12, presented by  Eakta Jain\nABSTRACT: As eye-tracking becomes a built-in service for virtual and augmented reality headsets, I am interested in converting gaze data into usable information. In this talk, I will give an overview of three projects from my lab at University of Florida that use perception cues toward different goals.\n\n(I)In the attention economy, what is the relative importance of pictorial and text elements on a website? Simply put, we use eye-tracking to quantify how many words a picture is worth.\n(II) As eye-tracking becomes a built-in service for virtual and augmented reality, can we extract more than gaze positions from it? Specifically, we infer user engagement from pupil diameter changes.\n(III) Looking ahead to social virtual reality, what would it take to create avatars for child users? We investigate how users perceive adult and child motion capture data.\n\nAbout the speaker: Prof. Eakta Jain\n\nEakta Jain is an Assistant Professor of Computer and Information Science and Engineering at the University of Florida.
