description: "Doug Ireton and Jane Ireton speak about \"Encouraging Girls in IT: A How To Guide\" at Velocity Santa Clara 2014.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor estimates that between 2010-2020 there will be more than 1.4 million computing-related job openings available in the United States. At current graduation rates, we can only fill about 30% of those jobs with U.S. computing graduates. (Ashcraft & Blithe, 2010; Simard, et al., 2008; Voyles et al., 2007)\n\nSo, how do we get more women in IT? There are so many job openings, yet there are fewer and fewer women CS graduates.\n\nIn this session we will cover:\n- Reasons why girls lag behind in Computer Science.\n- Four specific things you can do to encourage girls in programming.\n- Our story of teaching Jane, age 7, programming and electronics projects, and making it fun.\n- Practical ideas on teaching and mentoring girls in your life how to love programming.\n\nOur session is ideally suited for parents, caregivers, or anyone who has an interest in mentoring girls and young women to consider an engineering career in IT.\n\nAbout Doug Ireton (Nordstrom):\nDoug Ireton is an Infrastructure Engineer at Nordstrom, working on automating all the things with Chef and Ruby. In his spare time he teaches his kids programming and electronics.\n\nAbout Jane Ireton (Ireton):\nJane Ireton is 7 years old. She loves learning to program, Arduino, and devouring books. She is also a big fan of the Illiad and the Odyssey.\n\nWatch more from the 2014 Velocity Conference: http://goo.gl/JoMfvo\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\n\nDon't miss an upload!
