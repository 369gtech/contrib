description: "Google Tech Talks\nApril 25, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nChip-level multiprocessing has recently emerged as one of the most effective solutions to the problem of increasing processor performance. As a result, issues related to construction of scalable and reliable concurrent applications have become increasingly important. In particular, providing effective means for controlling concurrent accesses to shared memory is currently one of the most pressing problems in concurrent programming. Traditionally, such accesses have been mediated using mutual-exclusion locks resulting in scalability, composability and safety problems. In this talk, I will present transactional memory, an alternative concurrency management..."
