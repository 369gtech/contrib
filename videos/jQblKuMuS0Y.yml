description: "http://velocityconf.com/velocityny2013/public/schedule/detail/31324\n\nOftentimes security seems like a daunting challenge which many organizations aren't sure how to get started on. However, the engineering principles inherent to devops and continuous deployment lay the groundwork for a number effective security mechanisms. We'll discuss concrete actions that take advantage of data you're already collecting and systems you've already built to improve security posture and monitor things worth monitoring. Finally, we'll demonstrate how the principles of devops and moving quickly enhance, not reduce, the security of your organization."
