language: English
recordingDate: 1608074328
description: "To mitigate the risk of side-channel attacks, browsers offer an opt-in-based isolated environment called cross-origin isolated. With a cross-origin isolated state, the webpage can use privileged features in a secure way. We show why you should adopt crossOriginIsolated and how to implement and test it in Chrome DevTools.\n\nWe walk you through the steps to:\n -  Isolate your site using COOP/COEP\n - Test the implementation with DevTools\n - Use a reporting API to verify that your site works correctly for your users\n - Enable powerful features such as SAB / memory measurement\n\nResources:\nMaking your website \"cross-origin isolated\" using COOP and COEP → https://goo.gle/3qqxMQi\n\nSpeaker: Camille Lamy\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers here → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\nWatch all Chrome Developer Summit sessions here → https://goo.gle/cds20-sessions\n\n#chromedevsummit #chrome #chromedevtools"
