title: 'Vuejs In Practice at Optoro with Andrew Krawchyk'
language: English
recordingDate: 1556915400
description: 'We’ve learned a lot since deploying our first Vue.js app in production over one year ago. I’d love to share our experience shipping Vue.js to desktop and mobile devices and leveling up our engineering team in the process. I’ll discuss lessons learned from deprecating AngularJS and Bower to adopting Vue.js and deploying an internal NPM repo. I’ll talk about the benefits we’ve seen with Vue.js by providing real stories from the volunteers that upgraded our tooling and the engineers that build the apps today. This is how Optoro upgraded its enterprise front-ends with Vue.js.'
