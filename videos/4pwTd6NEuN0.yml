description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/michael-simons/bootiful-databases\n\njOOQ is one of several quite different technologies to access relational data from Java based applications.\n\njOOQ is short for \"Java object oriented querying\" and describes a query builder framework that takes a look at your database schema, independent wether you use an Open Source database like PostgreSQL or an commercial product like Oracle Database., and provides you with a domain specific language (DSL) for generating statements.\n\njOOQs goal is explicitly not to shield the user from SQL but providing a type safe way to use it.\n\nLearn in this session who you can facilitate the \"magic\" of Spring Boot to provide jOOQ with needed resources and then use it to publish advanced analytic queries as HTTP apis.\n\nAlong the way you learn how automatic database migrations help you to do continuous delivery even with database centric applications."
