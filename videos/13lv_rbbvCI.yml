description: "lgorithmic 3-D modeling can be very complex and time-consuming and demands specialized design tools that typically have a steep learning curve. What if you could mix visual and text-based programming to create 3-D geometries using a well known programming language?\n\nVRL-Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on the Java Platform that combines both visual and text-based programming. For this purpose it uses the Java Reflection API and Groovy to automatically generate interactive user interfaces (visual reflection). VRL projects are fully functional programs that are developed at runtime. A powerful plugin system enables easy integration of Java libraries, such as the 3-D modeling library JCSG.\n\nModeling the language used for describing visual workflows allows for detailed and automatic visualization, instrumentation and profiling of the executed instructions. In addition, language models can be used to add domain specific optimization algorithms to the compiler infrastructure.\n\nIn this talk we give an introduction to VRL-Studio and visualization techniques based on language models which are currently in development."
