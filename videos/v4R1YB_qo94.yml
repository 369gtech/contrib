recordingDate: 1605263904
description: "Serverless platforms have emerged over the last five years, and they are currently considered the next generation of system deployment techniques, taking over from containers. Serverless architecture allows teams to build cost-efficient, scalable, and highly available solutions with no need to provision or maintain any infrastructure. This approach however, has some caveats and limitations and may not be appropriate for some use cases. In this talk, Illia Kavaliou will share his experience implementing solutions using serverless platforms for small and large organisations. You will leave this talk knowing what the risks and challenges to look out for are when implementing serverless solutions, why and when companies should consider serverless over traditional deployment strategies and how the serverless approach affects organisational structure and technical roles in a team.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
