description: "SREcon16 Europe - Extreme OS Kernel Testing\n\nKirk Russell, Shopify\n\nFuzz testing has been used to evaluate the robustness of operating system distributions for over twenty years. Eventually, a fuzz test suite will suffer from reduced effectiveness. The first obstacle is the pesticide paradox: as you fix the easy defects, it gets difficult to find the remaining obscure defects. Also, the test execution time and the debug/fix cycle tends to be manual work that can take hours or even days of effort. During the presentation, a structured framework for creating new fuzz tests will be introduced, along with a competitive analysis approach used to minimize defect reproduction complexity.\n\nView the full SREcon16 Europe Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program"
