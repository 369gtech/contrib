description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - "The talents we have" by Tobias Tom - The idea is to create a new talk, based on my articles https://tobiastom.name/articles/increasing-the-barrier and https://tobiastom.name/articles/things-will-not-change which summaries the problem, but more importantly shows us how to make a difference. Starting with ourselves, which then might inspire to do the same. https://tobiastom.name/articles/dealing-with-virtual-offices might be a concrete example of how that can work in the real world, even when applied to our daily job as a developer.'
