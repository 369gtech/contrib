description: "Besides being useful, comments in source code can also be fun!\n\nThis legendary StackOverflow post\_tells me that sometimes a well-chosen joke put into source code can lighten the mood at work and make your developer life just a bit better. Now, because I am both a developer and a musician, I tend to use song lyrics to lighten up my code.\n\nSo in this Lightning talk, I'll demonstrate this by showing a few typical code fragments that could use some musical quality. And of course I'll perform bits of the songs that go with it.\n\nSo are you in for a light-hearted talk on code comments - slash - a mini-concert featuring songs by Coldplay, Oasis, Adam Lambert, Imagine Dragons and many more?\n\nPlease join in and feel free to sing along!\n\nHanno Embregts is a Java Developer, Speaker and Teacher at Info Support (the Netherlands). He has over 12 years experience with both front- and back-end development, with a special interest in automating the software development process to the fullest. He likes his work best when it is fast-paced and versatile, which is why he juggles Java development, public speaking and teaching courses at Info Support’s Knowledge Centre. When Hanno doesn’t have access to any kind of computer - which can only be called the most desperate of times - he plays in a band as a lead singer and guitar player. He is also a passionate fan of alternative rock band Switchfoot and Dutch football club Feyenoord. Last but not least: he has been told off repeatedly for using Star Wars quotes at work (things didn’t improve much by replying “I find your lack of faith disturbing”)."
