description: "This tutorial involves building a distributed application with Akka Clustering and Java 8. Traditional approaches to scaling applications across a cluster were very difficult. With Akka Clustering and Java 8, building a distributed application becomes as easy as building a local application. An essential part of the tutorial is showing how Akka clustering can easily handle and recover from failures with Akka Persistence. You will participate in building a reactive application that scales dynamically across a cluster of machines as the load varies and will learn how to use a simple load testing tool to simulate a variety of loads and experience how Akka Cluster can easily handle scaling and failure. The entire session is based on Java 8.\n\n\nAuthor:\nRyan Knight\nRyan Knight is a Senior Consultant at Typesafe on the Professional Services team where he does consulting and training for Scala, Akka and Play.
