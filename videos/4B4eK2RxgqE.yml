title: 'Power-up Power Platform with Serverless Custom Connector'
language: English
recordingDate: 1594961452
description: "Power Platform provides nearly 400 connectors for external API communication. However, what if there is no out-of-the-box connector available for my purpose? You can easily build a custom connector using Azure Functions so that your Power Apps or Power Automate has more power! Throughout this session, I'm going to show how an Azure Function app can be powered by Swagger and easily turned into a powerful custom connector.\n\nAzure Functions Swagger Extension: https://github.com/aliencube/AzureFunctions.Extensions"
