title: 'Beautiful Python Refactoring'
language: English
recordingDate: 1587330177
description: "Refactoring can lead to absolutely beautiful code. Not only this, but the refactoring itself can be a thing of beauty. This talk demonstrates taking an example with a double-digit number of lines of code down to a single-digit number of lines of code. This talk will show how to identify certain anti-patterns that can be replaced with more expressive and declarative code. This is a simple talk that can be understood by all, but when applied to oneâ€™s daily work can make a significant difference.\n\nSPEAKER:\nConor Hoekstra, Senior Library Software Engineer at NVIDIA\n\nCREDITS:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/code_report \n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/codereport"
