Operators allow developers to create some powerful tools that can be used on any infrastructure where Kubernetes is installed. Operators take all of that knowledge about an applicationâ€™s lifecycle that a DevOps team practices manually and systematize it. Operators can be used to provision multiple applications in a consistent manner while adhering to best practices for that particular installation.  To discuss the future of the operator pattern and why are operators have become so valuable to organizations working with containers, we've assembled some key project leads, engineers, and builders of operators to help demystify the concepts, share lessons learned and best practices for building operators and grow the operator community. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UadO"
