title: 'What is Headless CMS and why should you care? - Kristoffer Fredriksson'
recordingDate: 1523624718
description: "The term Headless CMS or Decoupled CMS is used more and more frequently. But what does it mean and why should you bother? And what about that name? Going headless is about so much more than just the CMS.\n\nOnce you gain full control over a web project by making it headless there are several opportunities that opens up. Using modern CSS or creating a progressive web app becomes so much easier. You can also start preparing your project for virtual assistants without piling on added complexity.\n\nKristoffer will share insights he's gained over the last three years of working in several headless projects. You will learn how a basic headless set-up should work and most importantly why it will be worth your time.\n\nKristoffer Fredriksson has worked with interactive media professionally since 1999. He's been at the forefront of the digital media revolution since then. He's currently working as Concept Developer at 24HR Malmö.\n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
