description: 'Working on a real time bidding platform is a demanding job. Response latency is critical and high traffic volume affects how we utilize available resources. All this leads to greatest challenge - distributing work over microservices. I will present real life problems that forced us to redesign our microservice communication so that applications stay performant and resilient. I’ll also show how we learned from previous mistakes to create a small and reusable library on top of netty.io and aeron.io that aids to readily implement business features.'
