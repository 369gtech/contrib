description: "Deep Dive: Scheduling SIG - Babak Salamat, Google \n\nKubernetes Scheduler is a critical component of Kubernetes that finds the best nodes for running pods based the configured scheduling requirements. The scheduler provides features to run clusters with desired configuration. Users can choose to run their clusters with high resource efficiency, high reliability, or various other custom policies. This talk will provide information on recent SIG Scheduling projects and features, including the development of the scheduling framework, batch scheduling, pod scheduling policies for multi-tenant clusters, and scalability improvements. We will dedicate about half of the time of the presentation to audience questions and users' feedback. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPkg"
