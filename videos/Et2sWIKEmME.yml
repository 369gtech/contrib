description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/building-microservice-architecture-with-apache-kafka/\n\nMicroservices in 2019 is not something new. It is a standard. Still, understanding of microservice architecture is different in each company. I’d like to share how we build a microservice architecture based on communication via Kafka messages. Namely, benefits we got and issues we had. Frameworks we use for various tasks. I’ll show on examples how Kafka helps us build independent services and update solutions fast. Also, I’ll share which tools help with developing and monitoring such solutions."
