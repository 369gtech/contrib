Youâ€™ll start with best practices for your datasets, learning to bring VACUUM data-quality principles to your projects, and ensure that your datasets can be reproducibly sampled. Next, youâ€™ll learn to implement machine learning models with PyTorch, discovering how to scale up your models in the cloud and how to use PyTorch Lightning for distributed ML training. \nWhen youâ€™re done, youâ€™ll have the tools to easily bridge the gap between ML models and a fully functioning production system."
