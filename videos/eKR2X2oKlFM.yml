description: "PyData LA 2018 \n\nThe explosion in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is unprecedented now - and text analysis is likely the most easily accessible and understandable part of this. And with python, it is crazy easy to do this - python has been used as a parsing language forever, and with the rich set of NLP, ML and Computational Linguistic tools, it's worth doing text analysis even if you don't want to.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
