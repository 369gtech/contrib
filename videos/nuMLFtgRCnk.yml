description: 'Thanks to customer, I’m able to introduce to publicity architecture of our advertising project with more than 100 million active users, average load 11000 req/sec, more than 20 billion requests a month. What lessons we learned? What code performance improvements were done? How Coda Hale metrics helped us? How introducing Redis improved request processing speed 10x times? How Java 7 improved performance and what features did we you use? Why I don’t like Amazon services? How to build reporting with 25GB data per hour and why we use Cascading?
