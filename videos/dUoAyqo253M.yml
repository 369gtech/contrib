description: "by Anton Babenko\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB2.252A/terraform_best_practices.webm\n\n\nImmutable infrastructure is a way to success, but what about the lifecycle of individual resources. This talk is about the evolution of resources, code structure, Terraform coding tricks, composition, and refactoring. Your infrastructure almost always starts simply: few resources + few developers. As time goes it grows in all possible directions. You found your ways around grouping resources into Terraform modules, so what can possibly go wrong? (famous last words) \n\nOver the time you feel that infrastructure is your new pet, but why? You are worried about the configuration drift, you are afraid of touching it, you are delaying things... \n\nBy the end of my talk participants will become more aware of principles related to management of Terraform resources, Terraform modules best-practices and some CI/CD principles applicable to infrastructure management and deployments. \n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:30:00+01"
