description: "Video technologies are \"The Upside Down” of the web for sure. Being a frontend engineer writing HTML5 video players, WebRTC broadcast clients, supporting 360/VR videos or maybe writing interactive movies like Bandersnatch is just like to live in a parallel universe where everything and nothing is the same. Working with video is an exciting combination of all the trendy stuff out there like new Web APIs, ByteArrays, Workers, WebRTC, WebGL, etc.\n\nIn this talk, Mate would like to share important insights of video specific frontend engineering nowadays. The purpose of sharing this adventure is to give you some sense of this universe, to explain how a web video player works, to talk about the key layers and challenges and to point out that every frontend engineer has the power in their hands to utilize this knowledge to boost the user experience in any kind of product. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/craft"
