description: "Keynote: Developing Kubernetes Services at Airbnb Scale - Melanie Cebula, Software Engineer, Airbnb \n\nYou've already made the plunge to move to Kubernetes, and you feel pretty good about that. But why does it feel like it requires expert-level Kubernetes knowledge for engineers to get anything done? This talk will identify key problems that make out-of-the-box Kubernetes less friendly to developers, and strategies for addressing them, based on Airbnbâ€™s experience empowering one thousand engineers to develop hundreds of Kubernetes services at scale. This talk will focus primarily on four problem areas:\n1. Configuration: Generated and templated configuration, extracting shareable components and containers\n2. CI/CD: Containerizing CI/CD, multi-stage builds, deploy strategies\n3. Service lifecycle: Primary and sidecar containers, Advanced pod readiness, warmup, graceful termination, etc\n4. Tooling: Creating and Distributing a kubectl wrapper \n\nTo learn more: https://sched.co/GsxY"
