description: "From zero to to hero - Total domination.\n\nIn this presentation, Chris Dale shows how a typical network is compromised through multiple levels of exploitation. The talk is very demo intensive and hands on, proving how an attacker with extremely limited access to an organization is still able to get a foothold, even with no apparent vulnerabilities present.\nOnce a foothold is gained, the attack surface increases. The attacker uses the increased attack surface to compromise further into the organisation, eventually gaining all the keys to the kingdom.\n\nIf you are curious on how a hacker accomplishes their goals, how they work and the attacks that take place, this hs the talk for you."
