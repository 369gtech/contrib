description: "Speaker: Divya Sasidharan (@shortdiv)\r\n\r\nMaps are an integral feature in many modern applications. They are frequently used to optimize travel routes and delivery systems, and to visualize geographic-related data such as weather and traffic that power applications we love and rely on in our daily lives. Historically, the process of making an interactive map for the web has been a messy process. Handling the state of the map, such as zoom level, showing and filtering selected markers, and other complex interactions, require a tangle of event listeners and handlers to ensure the map responds appropriately to a userâ€™s actions. In this talk, we will explore the process of leveraging React and it's component lifecycle to make cool interactive maps without all the fuss.\r\n\r\nSponsor(s) Venue sponsor: PayPal Food and drink sponsor: PayPal \r\n\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/243915922/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/cBle/"
