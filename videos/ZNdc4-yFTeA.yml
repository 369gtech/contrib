description: "Docker is the developer-friendly container technology enabling creation of your application stack: OS, JVM, app server, app, database, and all your custom configurations. So you are a Java developer, but how comfortable are you and your team taking Docker from development to production? Do the developers say, “But it works on my machine!” when code breaks in production? And if they do, how long do you spend creating an accurate test environment to research and fix the bug? Docker’s PODA (package once, deploy anywhere) complements Java’s WORA (write once, run anywhere). It also helps you reduce the impedance mismatch between dev, test, and production environments and simplifies Java application deployment. This tutorial shows how to package, deploy, and scale Java applications with Docker.\n\nPresenter: Arun Gupta\n\nWhat is Docker? - https://youtu.be/ZNdc4-yFTeA?t=3m35s\nDocker Workflow - https://youtu.be/ZNdc4-yFTeA?t=14m40s\nUnion File System - https://youtu.be/ZNdc4-yFTeA?t=20m05s\nDocker Toolbox - https://youtu.be/ZNdc4-yFTeA?t=27m10s\nDocker Lifecycle - https://youtu.be/ZNdc4-yFTeA?t=1h13m33s\nDistributed Application Bundle - https://youtu.be/ZNdc4-yFTeA?t=1h14m30s\nCI/CD with Docker + Jenkins - https://youtu.be/ZNdc4-yFTeA?t=1h21m30s\nMonitoring Docker Containers - https://youtu.be/ZNdc4-yFTeA?t=1h30m10s"
