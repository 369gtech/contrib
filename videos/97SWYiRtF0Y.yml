description: "Speaker(s):\nChet Haase, Romain Guy\n\nDescription:\nFormerly titled \"Graphical Android: Rich effects for great user interfaces\"\nThis session will dive deeply into two different aspects of the new material design experience of the Android platform. The first half will focus on an application that was written explicitly to take advantage of material design capabilities to provide a rich experience for users. Developers will see how to apply similar techniques to create rich applications of their own. The second part of this talk will dive into some of the internals of how various capabilities of material design on Android work; it will provide an interesting look under the covers to see how platform functionality evolves and how to achieve high-performance, rich effects in constrained situations.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
