description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: What Happened to the Promise of Cloud Computing? - Doug Davis, IBM Cloud \n\nBack in the day we were told that cloud computing would revolutionize how we work. The complexities of the infrastructure would be abstracted away from us and we could focus on what really matters... the code in our applications. Are we there yet?  To some extent there has definitely been some progress. IaaS has abstracted how we work with VMs, and Kubernetes has abstracted how we manage containers - but in many cases the complexities of the underlying infrastructure are not just still visible but \"in your face\". And, not all of these issue are simply a matter of a nicer UX either.  There has been some recent advances made though, and in this session we'll explore what some of the challenges are that people are facing, and what work has been done to help us get closer to our goal of letting developers be developers, not infrastructure experts. \n\nhttps://sched.co/f6k6"
