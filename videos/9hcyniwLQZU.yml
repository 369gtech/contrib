description: "Is HTML5 just an incremental update to HTML4.01, or is it a new, revolutionary technology that is gong to change the web? Well, it's actually a bit of both, and in this webcast we'll give you a 45 minute jumpstart on this new technology and everything you need to know when you walk into your next staff meeting and the subject comes up. You can expect to leave this webcast with the answers to questions like:\n\nDo I need to rewrite my HTML4.01 pages to be HTML5 compliant?\nIs web video as easy as it looks with the new video element?\nDo I need to know JavaScript to use HTML5?\nWhat are \"web workers\" anyway?\n\nAnd a lot more.\n\nAbout Eric Freeman:\n\nEric Freeman is described by Head First series co-creator Kathy Sierra as \"one of those rare individuals fluent in the language, practice, and culture of multiple domains from hipster hacker, to corporate VP, engineer, think tank.\" Professionally, Eric recently ended nearly a decade as a media company executive, having held the position of CTO of Disney.com at The Walt Disney Company. Eric is now devoting his time to WickedlySmart.com and lives with his wife and young daughter on Bainbridge Island. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Yale University.\n\nElisabeth Robson:\n\nElisabeth has been developing for and writing about the web since its early days. She co-founded one of the first web sites for mentoring women in technology, and created a web interface for online document management back when the only browsers on the market were IE and Netscape. She just completed her second book on web development, Head First HTML5 Programming, as a follow up to the best-selling Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML (O'Reilly, 2005). Elisabeth enjoys sharing her passion for all things web whenever she has the opportunity.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
