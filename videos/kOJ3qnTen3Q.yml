Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nProtecting Stateful Workloads With CSI Snapshot - Xing Yang, Huawei & Jing Xu, Google\n\nHow do we make sure that data in a Kubernetes cluster is safe and reliable so that one can rest at ease at night?   Snapshot is a point-in-time copy of a volume. It is the basic building block of backup and restore, data migration, replication, and many other advanced applications built on top of it. Snapshot is a sought-after feature in Kubernetes and it is finally here to support CSI!   In this session, Jing and Xing will discuss about the snapshot support in Container Storage Interface (CSI), the standardized API design to represent snapshot objects in Kubernetes, and the controller to handle snapshot provisioning and binding. This talk will also cover restoring of volumes from snapshots, and how this can be applied to backup and restore, data migration, and many more advanced features to ensure data availability and integrity for stateful workloads in the Kubernetes environment.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKd"
