title: 'Incorporating DevSecOps into Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes with Check Point''s CloudGuard'
language: English
recordingDate: 1612995015
description: "As application developers, our goal is to produce secure, robust code that meets business needs and is easy to maintain, extend, and support with the least effort. Within that framework, the challenge of securing our code can be a never-ending whack-a-mole exercise that robs us of precious development time. Evolving new exploits and obscure attack vectors have created the new role of DevSecOps to protect vital corporate assets from application vulnerability exposure.\n\nBest practices now require automated solutions, integrated into robust CI/CD pipelines, that provide threat prevention from both known and unknown vulnerabilities.\n\nCheck Pointâ€™s CloudGuard provides the tools you need to protect both your (Oracle) Kubernetes environment with continuous posture management evaluation and your container-based applications with CloudGuard AppSec (Web Application & API Protection).\n\nThis webinar will present options using Terraform and Helm for integrating Check Point's CloudGuard Posture Management for Kubernetes in OKE and deployment of Check Point's CloudGuard AppSec protection for Kubernetes applications.\n\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
