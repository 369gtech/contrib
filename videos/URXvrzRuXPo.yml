title: '#11 e-Meetup | Adele Carpenter - “Programming is hard: lessons through the eyes of a noob”'
language: English
recordingDate: 1602680788
description: "When did you learn to program? Do you remember the child-like thrill of typing in some text in the command line and making the computer do something? The feeling of endless possibility? \n\nProgramming might not be magic, but it can definitely feel magical. But the more magic you need to scrape away, the harder it gets. Let’s face it, programming is hard. Once we’ve been doing it for a while, perhaps with a dash of Stockholm Syndrome, we forget how much pain we have gone through to get where we are.\n\nSo what might you know, but have forgotten that you ever learned it? In this talk, I will share my experiences of working on a software project as a freshly-minted software engineer. I will detail what I struggled with, where everyone around me just kind of “knew”. At the end of this talk, you will have a noob perspective on how fundamental some software fundamentals, or “knowns”, really are."
