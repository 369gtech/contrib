title: '[DEVFEST Toulouse 2019] Modern Forms in React'
language: French
recordingDate: 1570520125
description: "ðŸ—£ Erik Rasmussen\n\nIf the new React Context API and Suspense killed Redux (they didnâ€™t), surely Hooks kill the need for a form library, right? Well, not exactly. Managing form state is more than just holding your current values in state; itâ€™s about sync and async validition errors, and much more! But that doesnâ€™t mean that Hooks are irrelevant to the situation. Hooks make building forms in React easier than ever before."
