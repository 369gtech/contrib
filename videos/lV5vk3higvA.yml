description: "Google BigQuery, Freebase, Maps: Mining 2 billion records (in seconds) to understand the gender gap.\n\nFreebase is a database that holds over a billion facts on more than 40 million real-world-entities. Working with these 88 GB of uncompressed data brings its own challenges. 2 Google developers will demonstrate how to explore these datasets, starting from raw data to full maps visualizations. We'll go into the technical how-to: You'll learn what are the Freebase entities. We'll show you how we were able to query this massive dataset in seconds with BigQuery - and how to discover new insights on an interactive map. Don't miss some impressive real time demos we'll attempt on stage :)."
