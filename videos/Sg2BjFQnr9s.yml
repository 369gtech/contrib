description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nAndrew Sorensen - Artist-Programmer, Author of Impromptu & Extempore languages\n\nABSTRACT\nThe act of programming is typically removed from a program’s ongoing execution, both temporally and spatially. This is particularly true for real-time systems, where the system’s operation is often tightly coupled with the physical environment. This talk aims to challenge this separation by looking at programming as the ongoing orchestration of real-time processes through time - an ongoing cyber-physical dialogue between the programmer, the machine and the environment.\n\nAfter a very brief history of live coding Andrew’s talk will delve into some of the deeper technical issues surrounding this challenging domain.\n\nUsing Andrew’s Extempore system, this talk will explore notions of time, liveness, feedback and procedural orchestration, addressing these ideas from the perspective of both end-user programmers as well as system designers.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
