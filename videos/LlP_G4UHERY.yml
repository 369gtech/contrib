title: 'Continuous Delivery of Microservices using Jenkins and Gradle - Alex Soto @ Spring I/O 2016'
recordingDate: 1466493962
description: "Through the use of build pipelines, Continuous Delivery will enable faster and more frequent build, test and deployment cycles of software.\n\nTo ensure that what you are delivering has the required quality: how do we build a continuous delivery pipeline in the real world, and\nhow do we correctly implement real integration and functional tests?\n\nIn this session, instead of relying on static step configurations, we are going to demonstrate how to code a pipeline using Jenkins and Gradle. To write readable tests, we will see how Spock or Docker can help or how to create traceable Docker containers. The end result is faster application releases with higher quality.\n\nUsing a simple Java application as an example, we will use Gradle: to build; to automate unit, integration and functional tests; and to utilize popular code quality tools. In addition, the Jenkins Workflow will act as the director of the process: to package, publish and deploy the deliverables."
