recordingDate: 1484803167
description: "Kate Andrews\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/121/\nThe ease of image sharing on the web results in the rapid dilution of the creator's ownership, and it can be really hard to tell whether the image you want to use is open source.\r\nIn this presentation, you'll learn some tips and tricks for finding the license on an image, and useful tools for tracking down high-quality, genuinely open source images. Real-life stories from the artist's side of the copyright minefield will give you a new perspective on the importance of getting your image use right first time."
