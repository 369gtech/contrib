description: "Bridging Traditional and Cloud World with OSBAPI - Matthias Winzeler & Boban Glisovic, Swisscom\n\nMost big companies have invested enormous amounts of time and money in enterprise-scale services during the last decades. Databases, connectivity systems and storage solutions have reached a stability and maturity that is at the heart of mission-critical IT.\n\nCloudFoundry has brought agility and to the Application tier.\nHowever, interacting with the 'legacy' services that are required for mission-critical applications is often a hard, manual interaction.\n\nTo lay bare the potential of these valuable services, companies must bring them to 21st century and make them consumable and manageable in a self-service manner.\n\nThe OSBAPI is an ideal technical approach to bridge this gap.\nBorn within CloudFoundry, it is now being adopted as an open standard by different platforms.\n\nSwisscom decided to not only use OSBAPI for its CloudFoundry offering but to build a marketplace that is used for all kind of consumers, from IaaS to on-premise workload. The marketplace offers access to various types of services such as databases, storage, and connectivity.\n\nBoban and Matthias tell you about the challenges, obstacles and joys of bridging the old and the new world - which are very often not only technical, but also cultural.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/GATO/bridging-traditional-and-cloud-world-with-osbapi-matthias-winzeler-boban-glisovic-swisscom"
