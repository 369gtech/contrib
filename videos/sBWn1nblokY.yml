description: "Kubernetes scalability - the path from 25 to 5000 nodes in a cluster\n\nThis talk will explain various dimensions of scalability of Kubernetes. You will learn what were the key improvements that paved the way from 25 nodes clusters (prior to Kubernetes 1.0) to the current 5k nodes clusters. Current bottlenecks of the system will be presented along the designs of how to overcome them and enable even better scalability of Kubernetes.\n\nThe talk should be interesting to anyone who is thinking about Kubernetes deployments at scale as well as to all software engineers who would like to learn how to improve the scalability of sophisticated distributed systems.\n\nThe speech took place on 8th of May on DataTech Stage during Infoshare 2019 in Gdansk, Poland.\n\n#DevOps #Cloud #DataTech #Kubernetes #Tech"
