title: 'There''s More to Performance than Meets the Eye (LÃ©onie Watson, 2019)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636121420
description: 'What does performance look like when you can''t see the screen? The browser does more with the DOM than visually render content. It presents an accessibility tree that''s queried using platform accessibility APIs. Different browser processing models mean that Assistive Technologies (AT) are changing the way they obtain accessibility information, but is that having an impact on performance, and what happens when we introduce a JavaScript accessibility API into the equation?'
