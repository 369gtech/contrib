title: 'Building Micro Services with gRPC'
language: English
recordingDate: 1494276029
description: 'gRPC is a general RPC framework focused on performance and interoperability across a wide range of programming environments. gRPC was initially developed at Google as a successor to an internal RPC platform called Stubby â€” a general application platform at the heart of many Google products and services. gRPC seeks not only to replicate the success of Stubby, but improve upon it, in the open, around modern standards such as HTTP/2 and proven technologies such as Protocol Buffers. In this session, we will discuss how to design, build, and deploy a collection of microservices using gRPC from the ground up. Key gRPC concepts will be covered including authenticating gRPC services and clients, service discovery, load-balancing, monitoring, and troubleshooting.'
