description: "Noah Falstein introduces Play Games Player Stats API.  Now big game companies, individual developers, and everyone in between can access an easy to use API to access statistics about the people who play their games.  Use these statistics to customize responses to playersâ€™ needs and habits.  For instance high value, highly engaged players can be rewarded and encouraged with rare items to supercharge their experience, or highly engaged players who have yet to spend on the game can be given great breaks for purchases and special instruction on how to take advantage of them.\n\nWatch more episodes of Game On! here: https://goo.gl/B5yFiu\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
