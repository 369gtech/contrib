title: 'YOW! 2012 Brian Beckman & Erik Meijer - The Story of the Teapot in HTML'
language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1503837912
description: "Would you believe that the image below of the famous Utah Teapot is rendered using just div elements and CSS without any OpenGL, WebGL, Canvas, or other “real” graphics capabilities?\n\nIn this fun talk, we will explain this glorious hack we first learned from a blogpost by Jeff Lau aka Useless Pickles, and that we subsequently used as a demo for our IL to JavaScript compiler project.\n\nWhile the original Live Labs project has long gone to the happy hunting grounds of technology, we salvaged this little pearl as a timeless demonstration of doing a lot with very little.\n\nBrian Beckman wrote foundational software for new starts in Bing Mobile Mapping and Technology platform. Created pure-functional language and runtime using combined numeric and symbolic processing for business intelligence and visualization. Co-Found Tesla and Volta efforts with Erik Meijer via LINQ and the Reactive Framework. Approximately 85 patent filings and 25 issued patents. Consultant for Tire Physics on XBox racing game “Forza”. * Designed and coded all physics for secret video-game project based on my “Physics of Racing” papers. Co-Founded Biztalk effort with Greg Meredith and Marc Levy. Greg and I wrote the original Biztalk workflow engine, which became Windows orchestration framework. Early architecture and coding for .NET code-access security (pre-1.0) Design and Coding for Microsoft Transaction Server role-based security architecture, including back-port of Windows NT DCOM security to Windows 95. Prototyped secret kernel-based sandboxing of downloaded code in the NT kernel using Scheme in kernel mode. Solo: Hostile Foreign-Function Interface for Scheme, allowing any native-mode Windows DLL to be loaded into the scheme runtime. With Barbara Fox, established Microsoft Crypto group and all Microsoft’s public-key security efforts. Research and architecture for post-link profile-driven code rewriting. Principal Architect for version 1 of the Time Warp Operating System, with David Jefferson et al. ~20 publications and awards. Relativistic corrections to GPS interferometry for direct measurement of Continental Drift. Water-Vapor Radiometry for GPS and Astronomical interferometry for direct measurement of Continental Drift (under the Geodynamics Program at JPL). Many software innovations, including improved integration routines, simulation architectures, special-purpose retargetable editors, embedded scripting, etc. Software Passion: Mixed symbolic and numeric computing.\n\nErik Meijer is an architect in the Microsoft SQL server division where he currently works together with the Microsoft Visual C# and the Microsoft Visual Basic language design teams on data integration in programming languages. Prior to joining Microsoft he was an associate professor at Utrecht University and adjunct professor at the Oregon Graduate Institute. Erik is one of the designers of the standard functional programming language Haskell98 and more recently the Cw language.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
