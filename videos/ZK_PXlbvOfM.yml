description: "http://strataconf.com/\nSome of the most complex challenges in data management exist where you may least suspect: inside video games. In the past decade the audience for games has exploded from 200M active users to 1.5B gamers worldwide. And these gamers are playing on multiple platforms -- high definition consoles, PCs, social media, mobile, online -- and they expect a seamless experience that connects them all. Consumers are becoming accustomed to features that allow them to play against their friends, track their progress, and even be able to turn off their console game and pick up where they left off on another platform like a smartphone.\n\nMuch like other forms of media, playing a video game used to be linear -- you insert the disc and play the game. Now, new content can be purchased and downloaded to augment the experience, consumers can connect and play against friends online and you can track your progress and scores live over time. But these rich experiences mean an explosion in the amount of data that can really be a double-edged sword. To keep at the pace of consumer demand for online connected gaming experiences, EA's data scientists are building a new technology infrastructure that will improve the consumer experience and help the company analyze the hundreds of terabytes of consumer data that flow through the system each day.\n\nIn this talk, EA CTO Rajat Taneja will dive in to the challenges and complexities facing the gaming industry, how to harness the power of data and share examples of how technologies like machine learning and predictive analytics have been put in place to improve the customer experience.\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/strata2013/public/schedule/detail/27603"
