description: "Hi, Spring fans! In this talk Spring Developer Advocate, Java Champion, and Kotlin Google Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman) introduces the Kotlin ecosystem, the language, and its application when building server-side Spring applications.\n\nThis is a roving tour of all things Kotlin, and there's a lot to cover, including:\n\n* building Android applications with Kotlin on mobile devices\n* building native applications with Kotlin and Kotlin Native ((m)alloc, pointers, and POSIX APIs, oh, my!)\n* giving existing APIs like the venerable `JdbcTemplate` a fresh coat of paint with Kotlin\n* using Kotlin ecosystem libraries like the Exposed ORM with Spring\n* using rich DSLs such as those provided for Spring Framework's programmatic bean registration, HTTP endpoints, and for Spring Cloud Gateway\n* kicking up our reactive applications a notch with coroutines"
