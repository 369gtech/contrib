description: "Java is evolving at a rapid pace. While Java 8 introduced the most significant change to the JDK and the language, each release of Java since then has added some distinctive features both to the core language and the JDK.\n\nIn this session we will dive into the significant changes to Java from Java 9 to the latest version.\n\nWe will take an example oriented approach to look into the features, discuss the pros and cons of using them.\n\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston.\nHe has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with sustainable agile practices on their software projects.\n\nVenkat is a (co)author of multiple technical books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer.
