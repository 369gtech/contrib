description: "\"Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence are becoming ubiquitous in websites, chatbots and mobile apps. While JavaScript/Node.js may not be the language/framework of choice for building and training ML models, it is an excellent option for building the user-facing server layer that brings ML product to life.\n\nIn this talk learn about the ways that Node and ML can work together, whether it’s through running ML models in the browser (using WebAssembly and WebGPU) or writing a node server for an ML chatbot.\n\nWe’ll show you how to take a pre-trained ML model built on any library (e.g. TensorFlow, Torch) and any language (python, lua), and build and deploy a node server for a Facebook messenger bot that interfaces with the model.\"\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeConf EU 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nNikhila Ravi\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nnearForm Ltd. provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nnearForm Ltd YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp2Tsbjd3P8itnBHUNHi82A"
