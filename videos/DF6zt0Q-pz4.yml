title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2021 - RÃºnar Bjarnason - Unison: a friendly programming language from the future'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628208835
description: "Unison is a new open source functional programming language based on a simple idea with big implications: every type and definition in the language has a unique cryptographic signature, determined by its content. Instead of a bag of mutable text files, the Unison codebase is a distributed immutable data structure and the signature serves as a global address into this structure. This is the basis for some serious improvements to the developer experience. Unison has no builds, no dependency conflicts in the traditional sense, and it allows for easy dynamic deployment of code in a distributed setting.\n\nRunar is a software engineer in Boston. I post here periodically about topics that interest me, including functional programming, relational database theory, and generally applying a rational philosophy to practical problems in the development of software.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
