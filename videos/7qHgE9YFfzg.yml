description: "Come and see how Bill and Ben used Serverless and IoT to create an automated paradise for Weed!\n\nServerless architectures really come into their own with time-constrained activities such as Capgemini Engineering’s annual Hackathon. We’ll show you how using a serverless tech stack with Graal freed us up from deployment configs to focus on introducing IoT to a greenhouse. We’ll look at the power of linear actuators (real power – 75kg? No problem!), sensor data, Lidar, and linking them to the cloud via ESP32 microcontrollers."
