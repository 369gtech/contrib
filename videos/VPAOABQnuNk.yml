description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nBeyond the Buzzword: BPF’s Unexpected Role in Kubernetes - Andrew Randall & Alban Crequy, Kinvolk \n\nIncreasingly, cloud native tools are leveraging the Linux kernel’s Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) capabilities for a range of applications, such as networking, security, observability, and troubleshooting. In recent Linux kernel releases, BPF has been significantly enhanced, resulting in this proliferation of BPF-powered cloud native projects. In this talk, we will go beyond the BPF buzzword, review the latest relevant developments in the Linux kernel and the rich ecosystem of cloud native tooling built on it. With live demos we will show how easy it is to deploy these BPF-based tools into your Kubernetes cluster, gaining greater visibility and control at the pod level of granularity. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekDR"
