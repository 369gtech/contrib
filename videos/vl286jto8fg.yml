description: 'Effective collaboration between developers and designers has often been a challenge. Several aspects of software, like interactivity, animation or business requirements can be elusive by nature and therefore difficult to validate before they are actually built. Through many years of experience, we have found a way to build the bridge between both groups. And that bridge are prototypes. In this talk we are going to review modern prototyping tools, including Framer, Origami, Pixate, Principle and InVision to demonstrate how designers and developers can perform cost-effective software iterations before a single line of production code has been written.'
