description: "by Tom Marble, Charles Eckel, Nithya Ruff, Duane O'Brien and Jeff McAffer\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.220/foss_inside_companies.webm\n\n\nCompanies regularly use and contribute to FOSS.  Most larger companies now employee internal staff who make policy decisions, recommend Tools,  oversee license compliance, teach others about FOSS, and interpret community politics for the\ncompany. Different offices and departments usually differ in their approaches to managing, using, contributing to, and releasing FOSS.  This second annual Open Source Program Office (OSPO) panel explores the different approaches companies have to FOSS. \n\nRoom: UA2.220 (Guillissen)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 16:30:00+01"
