description: "Robots are no longer the dream of some future. Robots are already here. And we’re not talking about software bots or autonomous systems. We’re talking about humanoids! Real robots evolving in the real world, the next generation of devices you might develop for.\n\nDuring this session, we'll show you how to create an application in Java, using Aldebaran APIs, to control our robot, and take advantage of human emotions to enhance the interaction.\n\nWe'll also discuss, along the way, the future of personal robotics and its different fields of application.\n\nFurthermore, for the first time in Europe, this session will be done with Pepper, the 1.2m tall robot Aldebaran created for the japanese market."
