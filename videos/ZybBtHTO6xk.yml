description: "Spring I/O 2016 - 19 -20 May Barcelona\n\nCome learn what's new in the Spring Data Couchbase 2.0.0 release, and how you can now leverage Couchbase through Spring for various use cases, including caching, session, automatic auditing, free form querying of your JSON entities (with N1QL and query derivation) and Multi-Dimensional querying (geographical and beyond using Spatial Views)... Now tied together by Spring Boot and the Initializr checkboxes :)"
