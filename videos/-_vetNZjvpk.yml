description: "PyData London Meetup #47\nTuesday, August 14, 2018\n\nUndesirable market crashes happen often especially in new securities such as cryptocurrency. Here I tried to apply Hidden Markov Model to predict market crashes in conjunction to design and to backtest a simple trading strategy. I will present the results of the strategy, the mistakes I made in the models and possible improvements for further development.\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
