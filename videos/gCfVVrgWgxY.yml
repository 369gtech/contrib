title: 'Extending Spark Machine Learning: Adding Your Own Algorithms and Tools'
recordingDate: 1497290271
description: 'Apache Spark''s machine learning (ML) pipelines provide a lot of power, but sometimes the tools you need for your specific problem aren''t available yet. This talk introduces Spark''s ML pipelines, and then looks at how to extend them with your own custom algorithms. By integrating your own data preparation and machine learning tools into Spark''s ML pipelines, you will be able to take advantage of useful meta-algorithms, like parameter searching and pipeline persistence (with a bit more work, of course). With Holden Karau and Seth Hendrickson'
