title: 'QA Fest 2015. Gáspár Nagy. BDD Crash Course for Testers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1447798229
description: "I'm a developer. Similarly to other developers, I like dealing with technologies, architectures and solutions. I also like thinking about ways how to do this better and better. 2009 was the first time I encountered behavior-driven development (BDD) -- as a tool to extend our agile development process to the entire project, including testers and product owners. BDD works like a glue that connects and reinforces agile methods you already use, making one plus one more than two.\nBDD is still often regarded as a developer tool, so in this session, I would like to explain why Testers should care about BDD: What is good for? What benefits you might expect? What is the role and responsibility of a tester in a BDD process? What is Gherkin and why do we care about vegetables at all?\n\nCategory: Test Automation\n\nPresentation: https://www.slideshare.net/QAFest/qa-fest-2015-gspr-nagy-bdd-crash-course-for-testers\nOur website: http://qafest.com/\nOur Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/qafest\n\nWant to know more?\nCome to the QA Fest 2020 in Kyiv!\nOn September 25-26, you will meet more than 50 speakers from 10 countries who will share real cases and experience in software testing.\nAnd do not forget that QA Fest is not only a conference but also a testing festival!"
