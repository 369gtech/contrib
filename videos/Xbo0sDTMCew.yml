description: 'Want to have a commute of just seconds and the freedom to plan your day as you wish? Those are just 2 things you can achieve when working remotely. But where there are positives there are also negatives... In this session I''ll cover the lessons I learned from my 3 years of working fully remote and how they can help you. It''s a talk about freedom, responsibility, loneliness, team building, but most of all it''s about building relationships. If you want to know what remote working really entails, and check if remote working is something for you, this is the session for you.'
