title: '"Redux: Architecting and scaling a new web app at The NY Times" by Juan Carlos Montemayor Elosua'
language: English
recordingDate: 1506949751
description: "In under a year, we scaled NYT Watching from being a brand new React web app to more than a million users per month. Our approach to Redux was a key part of this success, enabling us to manage complex data relationships in an iterative and functional way. In this talk, I will share our approach to implementing Redux for our app – what worked, what didn't, and the many tips and tricks that we've learned along the way.\n\nKey takeaways: - Practical examples of how to organize and update data in your apps using actions and reducers - Why you should use containers to separate your data logic from your views - How to increase performance while simplifying data relationships with the use of selectors - How to deal with different product requirements (specs from Advertising, anyone?) and keep pesky business logic out of your views - When to perform location changes using Redux actions and why - How to integrate query parameters into Redux, and the benefits of doing so\n\nExpect this presentation to use more boxes and arrows than code. I'll use real-world examples based on the challenges my team at The New York Times has faced in the past two years as we used Redux to manage and scale an increasingly complex app.\n\nJuan Carlos Montemayor Elosua\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES\n\nJC is a Senior Engineer in The New York Times' Beta team, where he leads the development of their TV and movie recommendations app, NYT Watching. Previously he worked as an iOS developer for NYT Now, a (now retired) aggregated-news app. JC has a BS in Computer Science degree from the Tufts University School of Engineering. Outside of work, he is an opera producer, a classically trained tenor, \"studying\" for a sommelier certification, and is always looking for new things to learn and do."
