title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Pattern Language: Pattern Libraries in the Wild'
recordingDate: 1493239119
description: "Web teams have embraced pattern libraries to address the complex requirements of responsive sites. This involves everything from a methodology (for ex: Atomic Design) to its tool (Pattern Lab), or both. But how do these tools actually work in practice? This session will look at what Bluecadet has experienced as we shifted our design and development process\_to create flexible, modular sites. This session will touch on:\n\n* Identifying content and visual patterns\n* Forming consensus around the language we use to describe patterns\n* How we build our patterns in Drupal\n* How the authoring experience (AX) correlates to visual patterns\n* Visual patterns vs. front-end patterns\n* The spectrum of fidelity, from sketches to code snippets\_\n\nWe’ll discuss tools like PatternLab, Fractal, and how we leverage Drupal’s View Modes. We’ll also talk about Drupal’s Paragraphs module, Drupal Shortcodes, and how to make complex, flexible, modular systems that are simple to understand and manage for content authors. Session attendees should have some familiarity with sitebuilding and front-end theming, but the focus will be on ways to improve communication and process to design and build modular sites."
