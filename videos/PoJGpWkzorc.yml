language: English
recordingDate: 1433234878
description: "Java ME 8 is a major alignment step toward Java SE 8, bringing many Java SE 8 language concepts, core APIs, and virtual machine features to Java ME 8. This enables developers to leverage Java code much more easily between Java ME 8 and Java SE 8 to reduce development, porting, and testing time across both platforms. In this session, learn about the commonalities and differences between Java ME 8 and Java SE 8 and what you need to know to design highly portable code and libraries.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTerrence Barr\nTerrence Barr is a Senior Technologist for Mobile and Embedded Technologies at Oracle.
