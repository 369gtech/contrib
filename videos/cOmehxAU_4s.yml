description: "Today on A11ycasts I want to give a brief look into the process I use when I'm checking a site for accessibility. This is by no means an exhaustive audit that I'm doing here, but instead a set of quick checks that you can use to highlight any big problem areas. I've found that most sites tend to have issues with at least a few of these checks, and it only takes a few minutes to do it so it's totally worth it for the improved user experience!\n\nSome of the things I look for are:\n- Does the tab order make sense and can I reach all controls on the page?\n- Is there a clear focus indicator for interactive controls?\n- Are there any offscreen elements which should not be focusable?\n- Can I traverse the page with a screen reader without getting stuck?\n- Is there appropriate alt text on images?\n- Do custom controls work with a screen reader?\n- Is the user alerted to new content added to the page?\n- Are there appropriate headings?\n- What about landmark elements?\n- Is text high contrast enough to be legible?\n\nAnd here are some of the tools I like to use:\n- Chrome aXe extension: https://goo.gl/67Bm24\n- Chrome accessibility devtools extension: https://goo.gl/DvAxi2\n- aXe-core: https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core\n\nSidenote: at 5:18, not sure why the video didn't announce the different sizes but I tried again later and it was working. Maybe a VoiceOver quirk. \n\nWatch all A11ycasts episodes: https://goo.gl/06qEUW\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers YouTube channel for updates on new episodes of A11ycasts: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
