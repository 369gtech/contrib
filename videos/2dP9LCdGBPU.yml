title: 'Ulf Wiger - Using Erlang in Blockchain Development - Code BEAM STO'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531412684
description: "Ulf goes through the advantages and challenges of using Erlang to build the Aeternity Blockchain. Language choice affects many aspects of a project, from recruitment to productivity. \n\nUlf discusses how programming languages may differ in general, and where it matters—more specifically what is important in the blockchain space—then describe how it played out in their project.\n\nIn particular, after having implemented state channels in Aeternity, he revisits some old arguments about complex state machine design, discuss how Erlang helps, and also report on how the new gen_statem behaviour fares in avoiding the death of accidental complexity.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/ulf-wiger/"
