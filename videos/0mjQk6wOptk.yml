description: "Speaker: Michael Feathers (@mfeathers), Director @ R7K Research & Conveyance\n\nIn most systems, code lives forever. Occasionally, we can delete it if we are sure it is not used; however, static path analysis and production monitoring of code usage are often expensive and present inconclusive results. In this talk, Michael Feathers will describe techniques that allow us to generate more certainty around our assessments of feature liveness, and strategies that can be used to remove code that does not have high value.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nMichael Feathers is the Founder and Director of R7K Research & Conveyance, a company specializing in software and organization design. Prior to forming R7K, Michael was the Chief Scientist of Obtiva and a consultant with Object Mentor International. Over the past 20 years he has consulted with hundreds of organizations, supporting them with general software design issues, process change and code revitalization. A frequent presenter at national and international conferences, Michael is also the author of the book Working Effectively with Legacy Code (Prentice Hall, 2004).\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvTG/"
