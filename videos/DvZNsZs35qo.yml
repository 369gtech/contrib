description: "The Route to Rootless Containers - Will Martin, Pivotal\n\nRootless containers are a new and exciting development in the container community, offering up the ability to create and manage containers as completely unprivileged, non-root users. This is hugely appealing both in terms of security, as well as making container-based workloads more accessible to a much wider audience.\n\nOver the past few months the Cloud Foundry Garden team have been working to bring support for rootless containers to the platform. This talk will focus on how and why we went about doing so, including a technical overview of what rootless containers are, why they’re important and how we make use of them inside Cloud Foundry.\n\nThe talk will also discuss Cloud Foundry’s use of the Open Containers Initiative (OCI) standards, and how the platform has benefited from new features, such as rootless containers, by adopting them. \n\nAbout Will Martin\nWill is an Engineering Manager currently working on the Garden project, bringing containers to Cloud Foundry, Concourse and Bosh. In a past life he also worked on services for Cloud Foundry at IBM. He is an active contributor the Ginkgo/Gomega testing tools for Go."
