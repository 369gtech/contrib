title: 'NodeJS MICROSERVICES On Autopilot'
language: English
recordingDate: 1518552003
description: "Too often microservices aren't designed to be resilient to changes from services they depend on. Even if services are resilient, most solutions retry connection attempts or make requests that will fail. There is a better way, one that can reduce unnecessary chatter and help ensure that services are responsive to upstream changes. The solution to this and other Node.js microservices issues is follows the Autopilot Pattern. This talk presents solutions to common pitfalls that developers face as they move to microservices and containers.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nWyatt Preul, Product Engineer, Joyent\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNodeSummit 2018 registration: http://www.nodesummit.com/registration/"
