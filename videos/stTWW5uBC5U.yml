description: "Operators can now route key Geode metrics to a variety of external monitoring systems. This makes it easier to observe and assess the health of their apps and server. Geode tracks key health metrics such as memory usage, operation latency, and communication queue size. We'll demonstrate how to connect a Geode system to an external monitoring system. We'll review some of the key metrics and show how to respond to them as the system encounters a problem in its environment. You'll leave with knowledge of what metrics Geode is emitting and how to capture those metrics. By being able to group and summarize these metrics, you'll be able to see data that allows you to make informed decisions about the health of your Geode system.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2MVTNni\n\nSpeakers: Michael Oleske, Software Engineer, Pivotal and Dale Emery, Principal Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/visualize-your-geode-metrics"
