description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nDebugging Live Applications the Kubernetes Way: From a Sidecar - Joe Elliott, Grafana Labs \n\nLinux features a number of powerful debugging tools that give us insight into how our applications run in a real environment. Through live demonstration this session will present a straightforward way to begin debugging applications in a Kubernetes native way: from a sidecar. Sidecars offer a low impact way of profiling applications without installing packages or making messy changes to your nodes.  The techniques demonstrated will include recording LTTng events, cpu profiling, generating Flame Graphs and dynamic tracing with BCC. These techniques will be performed against a .NET Core sample application, but that will not be the focus of the session. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaXU"
