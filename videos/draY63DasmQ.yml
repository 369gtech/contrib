description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\r\nAugust 17, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Cory Smith, Google Test Engineer.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nJavascript is the defacto standard for rich application development on the web, supported by many browsers on many different platforms. Each day, more and more applications are being deployed over the web in a browser that rival desktop applications for interactivity and functionality. Examples of such rich applications include Google Maps, Google GMail, Google Docs, Hipmunk.com, and Angry Birds Chrome.\r\n \r\nHowever, Developing fast, robust, and high quality Javascript is a challenge within the industry. Unlike C++ or Java, the availability of high quality development, debugging, and testing tools for Javascript is still lagging industry standards.\r\n \r\nInside Google, Javascript is the 4 largest language (in terms of lines of code) but one the fastest growing. It is key to all Google Web Applications (e.g. gmail, docs, etc.) Google has developed several unique tools to help address this issue, and make JavaScript developers more productive, both in developing and testing Javascript code.\r\n \r\nCome and hear how Cory Smith, the main engineer behind JsTestDriver, has approached the problem and what tools he developed for addressing some of these issues."
