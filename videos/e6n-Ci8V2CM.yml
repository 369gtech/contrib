Clearly they've been wrong, since imperative languages are still far more popular. Clearly they've also been right, as the advantages of functional programming have become increasingly obvious.\nIs it possible to combine the two models?\nScala is one language that does this and Java too has been on a journey, which still continues, of learning from functional languages and carefully adding features from them.\nIn this talk, we'll review what Java has learned from functional languages, what it can still learn, and how its added features compare to Scala's  [...]\r\n\r\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\r\nhttps://gotocph.com/2019/sessions/887/the-sincerest-form-of-flattery\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcph\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\r\n#Java #FunctionalProgramming #FP #Scala #Programming\r\n\r\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\r\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
