description: "Learn what tips and techniques you can use to significantly reduce the amount of toil and chaos when you have many foundations all around the world. Tony will share experiences managing dozens of foundations across multiple private and public IaaS. An organization with many foundations will encounter challenges that are intensified and require different strategies to manage the product at scale. We'll cover technical strategies for maintaining environment parity, keeping the foundations upgraded, and handing support requests. This scale affects more than the technical, so we’ll also cover product management topics for interacting with customers and organizational impacts such as managing the backlog, team structure with people around the world, and maintaining an acceptable velocity. We’ll share what we’ve learned, what went well, and what we'd never do again.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2OZbK74\n\nSpeaker: Tony Elmore, Solutions Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/youre-up-to-your-eyes-in-foundations/Pivotal/youre-up-to-your-eyes-in-foundations"
