description: "Spinning up a local Kubernetes cluster is easy. But, enabling self-service Kubernetes for enterprise developers remains a major pain. Enterprise-grade clusters are complex as they require proper security and configuration, including lifecycle management of required add-on services across multiple clusters and cloud providers. In this talk, Jim Bugwadia, a founder and the CEO at Nirmata â€“ the Day 2 Kubernetes company, will cover best practices and emerging patterns that can help enable self-service Kubernetes clusters across an enterprise. The session is ideal for platform teams that require visibility, governance, and want to enable enterprise-wide business agility and drive adoption of cloud-native tools.\n\nPresenter:\n\nJim Bugwadia, Founder and CEO @Nirmata"
