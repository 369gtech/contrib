description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Mirantis - Introducing K0s 0.13 and kosctl\n\nSpeakers: Miska Kaipiainen\n\nK0s (k0sproject.io/https://github.com/k0sproject) is a single-binary Kubernetes distribution engineered to make Kubernetes frictionless. It installs with a single command and runs on (almost) any Linux, on i86 and arm6/7 hardware, on Raspberry Pis, VMs, or datacenter bare metal. In this session, we'll demo k0s 0.13, which uses kube-router as CNI (released on Friday, April 9). We'll show native (i.e., one-command) deployment, and more sophisticated deployments using the open-source, community-developed 'kosctl' management framework."
