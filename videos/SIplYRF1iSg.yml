title: 'Serverless your containers with Knative and Cloud Run - Bret McGowen'
recordingDate: 1582968863
description: 'Even if you don’t see them, containers are what runs your code in most serverless platforms. By using containers directly, you can write serverless apps in almost any language and bundle your custom runtimes and binaries. If you’re nervous about containers, we’ll even discuss community tools that build containers for you, without having to know anything about Docker! Also learn how Knative, the open source project from Google, Pivotal, Red Hat and more, provides an industry standard way to build serverless platforms and run your serverless apps on top of Kubernetes. Knative lets you tune scaling parameters, run on hardware with GPUs or multi-core processors, and more.'
