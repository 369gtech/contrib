recordingDate: 1383147188
description: 'Marc Andreessen has started an interesting discussion with his article "Why Software Is Eating The World" in the Wall Street Journal. The message is that software is changing the business models of all industries. This is backed by the fact that 70% of all Fortune-1000 companies have vanished from this list in the past decade. Trends like Cloud Computing, Big Data, Smartphones and Social Media are radically changing our (IT) world. Today everybody can start a successful business and only the business models that utilize these trends and adopt to changes quickly will survive. The keynote will show these trends by example and will get into details what this means for us software developers who are the new kingmakers!'
