description: "Testing against Time - Meaningful testing in Ember apps when timing matters\n\nEmber offers a rich API and a wide set of helpers and blueprints to make testing in your apps fast and straight-forward. But as the applications we write tests against grow more complex, we might find ourselves stumbling into test timeouts, eventually succeeding tests and other hard-to-reason about test errors brought on by asynchronous and time-dependent behaviour. This talk will give an insight into how to create meaningful test cases for async or other, time-related operations in our applications. We will see how we can leverage Ember's test helpers, newest JavaScript features and Ember community addons to reduce non-determinism in our test suites and make those tests turn green even as time passes by."
