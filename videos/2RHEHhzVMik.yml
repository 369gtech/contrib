description: "During the speech they will explain what NoOps model means for them in Finastra and how they are adopting such model. In more details, they are going to show how our company’s production and operations requirements look like, and what are the tasks that they automated for such requirements. Their ultimate goal is to get from commit to production in less than 24 hours.\n\nAlso, during the presentation they’ll discuss platform services’ CI/CD pipeline as code, quality gates enforcement, and will demo how it works with Azure DevOps.Yet another subject of the presentation will be their pipeline’s integration with company’s release and change management system, which allows to audit any change made to production.And finally, they’ll explain how they configure monitoring to send feedback to release pipeline and allows quick reactions like rollbacks or declining promotion to next stage in case of any issues.\nKey takeaways:\n• why you want to have everything as code\n• why you want to automate everything\n• what you should take into account to have resilient deployment of your services to production stage\"\n\nThe presentation took place on 19/11/2019 at O4 Coworking at the Olivia Business Center in Gdańsk."
