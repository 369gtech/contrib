description: "In early 2006 JetBrains decided to create its own solution for Continuous Integration – TeamCity.\n\nWe will start with preconditions of this decision and main concepts of the product. Then we’ll discuss common problems that we and our customers have faced over the decade, trends and plans for the future.\n\nFinally, we’ll look into installation that builds all Jetbrains products and find out how TeamCity continuously delivers itself every day."
