description: "Marshall Kirkpatrick \n\nCEO, Little Bird\n\nSeven years ago, presenter Marshall Kirkpatrick worked at a convenience store in a small town in Oregon, today he's become one of the most successful tech industry bloggers online (formerly lead writer at both TechCrunch and ReadWriteWeb) and is now the CEO of a venture-backed company called Little Bird. Little Bird helps anyone do the kind of work that Marshall did to make his career in the social web: to find the right people, to discover key information, to act fast and raise your voice by adding value to conversations on a global stage."
