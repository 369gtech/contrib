title: 'Andy Hall: Server Side Node.JS Programming With... Photoshop? - JSConf.Asia 2013'
recordingDate: 1387084360
description: "\"Photoshop recently shipped a new feature called Generator, but what not everyone realizes is that behind the scenes this feature is powered by a Node.js server built right into the tool. This means that you as a developer can now automate photo editing from JavaScript, or access Photoshop features from a Node app, or.. well, anything really. So this talk will take a look at what's possible when high-level tools expose low-level programmable interfaces, and show how to have some fun with this in Photoshop in particular.\"\n\nAndy is a developer evangelist for Adobe Japan, focused on gaming, Flash, HTML5, and web standards. He's been building web content since the mid-90s, and is most interested in the grey areas between code and design, like programmatic animation and designer-developer workflows. He speaks regularly at conferences, user groups, and game studios, and spends most of the rest of his time blogging at aphall.com.\n\nJSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Hotel H2O and Manila Ocean Park, Philippines - 28 + 29 November 2013.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.asia/blog/2013/10/31/jsconfasia-2013-andy-hall-server-side-nodejs-programming-with-photoshop\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/fenomas1/nodejs-and-photoshop-generator-jsconf-asia-2013\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
