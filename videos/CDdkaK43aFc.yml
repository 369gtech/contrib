description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl)\n26th of September 2014\n\nQi - \"Hacking The Mind: How Art Can Help Us Talk and Teach Technology\"\n\n\"The world of software development is changing at an increasingly rapid pace, leaving developers with less time to learn new tools and paradigms, and hardly any time to convey that knowledge to others. How do we convince our managers to change course? How do we bring other developers up to speed? And if things go wrong, how do we explain it to our non-technical customers without losing their trust? Qi will talk about the relationship between art and code, and how we can use the principles of fiction, music, poetry and painting to present complex information to any audience without confusing or -- worse -- boring them to tears.\""
