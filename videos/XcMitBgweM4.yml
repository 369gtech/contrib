description: "Welcome to season 5 of Assistant on Air. We’re all at home, but we’ve got a lot of great content coming your way! This season, we’re chatting with designers and developers who collaborated with the Google Assistant team on a couple of new games for smart displays.  \n\nMeet co-hosts Mary Chen (Google Assistant Strategy Lead) and Leon Nicholls (Google Assistant Developer Relations Engineer), who together launched a project to create several games for smart displays. In this episode, they’ll chat about the makings of this initiative and why games are a great use case for smart displays.\n\nTry out the games! Just say, “Hey Google, play Mime Jam” or “Hey Google, play Cookie Detective” on your Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max.\n\nActions on Google docs → https://goo.gle/2YIelnq\n\nOther episodes of Assistant on Air → https://goo.gle/2X0nBqG\nPlease subscribe for more updates →  https://goo.gle/googledevs"
