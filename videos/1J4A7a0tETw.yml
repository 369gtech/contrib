title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Usability Testing is Super Important and Easier than You Think'
recordingDate: 1523507329
description: "You already know that delighted users are a good thing. A user who’s having a great experience on your site will spend more time exploring and engaging with your content, and will leave feeling happy that they accomplished what they wanted. Improving usability strengthens your brand, drives conversions, and can even improve SEO and decrease spending on marketing campaigns. But how do you know for sure if your site is user-friendly?\n\nIn this hands-on session, we'll show you how to conduct one-on-one usability tests with minimal equipment, time, and money. (Spoiler alert—you don’t need a fancy lab or eye-tracking software.) We’ll cover how to recruit users, how to design and run tests, how to read tester’s minds, how to collect the data, and what to do with it. You’ll have the chance to try the techniques out yourself during the session, and there will be prizes for our intrepid volunteers.\n\nThis session is for designers, developers, site owners, and anybody interested in making the web a better place. No technical experience necessary."
