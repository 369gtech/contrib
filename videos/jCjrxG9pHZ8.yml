description: "In Spring Framework 5.0, we introduced the functional web framework as an alternative to the existing annotation-based MVC. This year, we follow up with a presentation where we go beyond the basics, and show more advanced features, including:\n* Predicates: how to create your own custom predicates,\n* Nesting routes: how to remove duplication from your predicates,\n* Route organisation: how to organize route functions into a nearly arranged whole,\n* Filtering routes: how to introspect and manipulate both request and response with a filter\n* Much more!\nSpeaker: Arjen Poutsma, Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
