description: 'We could say that microservices are the topic of the year. Everyone is talking about them but few people have production experience with such systems. I’ll share our experience from a journey into the world of microservices with Semaphore CI. We learned a lot about systems design and thinking during the process and even more during our post-mortem sessions. In the end we really like the results that we have achieved but it’s not a free ride.'
