title: 'Web and mobile apps using React Native Web with Robin Heinze'

description: "We tend to think about web apps as being completely separate from native iOS and Android apps. But often we end up writing very similar business logic and even visual content on each platform — reinventing the wheel each time. This leads to duplicated effort and can result in out-of-sync app features. With React Native and React Native Web, we now have a framework to write UI code and business logic in a common language (JavaScript) and then deploy to all platforms. In this episode, we’ll demonstrate how to build a single codebase which will power web, iOS and Android.\n\nLearn React: https://aka.ms/WebWed/LearnReact"
