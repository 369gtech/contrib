description: "With new requirements changing the way data is collected, stored and processed, we need to change the way we write applications and the technologies we use.\n\nChanging a programming language or a technology stack is hard and requires everyone on board to give extra effort and get out of the comfort zone.\n\nOne of the most challenging tasks is moving from monolithic applications and traditional relational databases to scalable distributed system.\n\nIn this presentation we will go through process of migrating our projects from mysql and mongodb to cassandra and what problems we had and our learning process.\n\nWe will talk about both the advantages and disadvantages and how to overcome some of them and how this transition impacts development in both R&D and production phases.\n\nThere are a lot of blog posts and success stories about big companies moving to some distributed storage and scaling their architecture but this presentation is about that guy who needs to get it implemented and make it work.\n\nThis is not a typical success story but rather first hand experience of our transition and some tips that can help people thinking about making that step.\n\nWe will cover basic differences and biggest obstacles we had to overcome when moving from ACID to BASE and how message based system helped us solve problems of architectural changes and technology swaps."
