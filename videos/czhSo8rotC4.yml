title: 'Migrating to Modules by Mark Reinhold'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495012931
description: "The introductory session, “Modules in One Lesson,” assumed an ideal world in which applications are constructed solely from modules, but that is not the world in which we live today. How do we get there from here? In this session we’ll live-code a simple Java 8 application that uses some popular libraries and then modularize it with Java 9. We’ll see how Project Jigsaw and the Java Platform Module System give you the ability to migrate to modules at your own pace, even if the libraries upon which you depend have not yet been modularized.\n\nMark Reinhold is Chief Architect of the Java Platform Group at Oracle. His past contributions to the platform include character-stream readers and writers, reference objects, shutdown hooks, the NIO high-performance I/O APIs, library generification, and service loaders. Mark was the lead engineer for the JDK 1.2 and 5.0 releases, the JCP specification lead for Java SE 6, and both the project and specification lead for JDK 7 (Java SE 7) and JDK 8 (Java SE 8). He currently leads the JDK 9 and Jigsaw projects in the OpenJDK Community, where he also serves on the Governing Board. Mark holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
