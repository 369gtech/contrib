description: "Speaker: Sebastiaan Deckers, @sebdeckers\r\n\r\nYou would have seen generic font families like serif, sans-serif or monospace before at some point, but the CSS Fonts Level 4 specification introduces a few new ones, like system-ui.\r\n\r\nSeb will share with us how he pony-fills this cutting edge feature using CSS variables so you can use system-ui font stacks today.\r\n\r\nAbout the Speaker:\r\n\r\nSeb is a frontend fanatic hailing from Belgium. When heâ€™s not busy coding, you can find him cultivating the local developer community. Seb is the co-organiser of the Front End Developers Singapore (FEDS) meetup and regularly speaks at SingaporeJS events.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/SingaporeCSS/events/244533222/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/eGJN/"
