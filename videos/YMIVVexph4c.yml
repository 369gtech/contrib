description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nEfficient Model Exploring and Continuous Delivery With Polyaxon + Kubeflow - Shotaro Kohama, Mercari Inc\n\nMachine learning projects are highly iterative. A project begins with an experiment phase, a productionization phase, an operation phase, and the next experiment phase. The smooth transition from the experimental stage to the productionization phase is the key to accelerate the iterations. Polyaxon is a cloud-native machine learning experiments platform that allows developers to run parallel and scalable hyperparameter tuning job in a declarative way. KubeflowPipelines is a workflow engine for machine learning pipelines. This talk shows how the Machine Learning Platform team at Mercari helps accelerate machine learning projects by Polyaxon and KubeflowPipelines."
