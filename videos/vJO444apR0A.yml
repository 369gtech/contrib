description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2018. #gotocon #gotocph\nhttp://gotocph.com\n\nWendy Mackay - Research director with INRIA Saclay and Head of ExSitu team at Université Paris-Sud\n\nABSTRACT\nIncredible advances in hardware have not been matched by equivalent advances in software; we remain mired in the graphical user interface of the 1970s. I argue that we need a paradigm shift in how we design, implement and use interactive systems. Classical artificial intelligence treats the human user as a cog in the computer's process -- the so-called “human-in-the-loop”; Classical human-computer interaction focuses on creating and controlling the 'user experience'. We seek a third approach -- a true human-computer partnership, which takes advantage of machine learning, but leaves the user in control. I describe a series of projects that illustrate our approach to making interactive systems discoverable, appropriable and expressive, using the principles of instrumental interaction and reciprocal co-adaptation.\nThe goal is to create robust interactive systems that significantly augment human [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2018/sessions/600\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocph\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#AI #ML #HumanFactor #MachineLearning #ArtificialIntelligence"
