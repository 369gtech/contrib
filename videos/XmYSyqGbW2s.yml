description: "\"Extracting Tabular Data from PDFs with Camelot and Excalibur\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Osaka / Samarkand [PyData track]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Dimiter Naydenov\n\nPortable Document Format (PDF) is commonly used to produce, publish, exchange, and\narchive business and academic documents alike. Often in such PDFs there are tables\nwith data that you want to extract and process in some automated fashion. Unlike HTML\nor other formats, PDF has no concept of tables as rows and columns with related data.\n\nTables in PDFs are rendered to visually resemble a table (when printed) using low-level\ninstructions to place the text of each table cell where it should be, while the original\ntabular structure is lost.\n\nWhile there are existing solutions to extract structured data from PDFs, most of them\nare expensive proprietary products or hosted online services, not Python-based, not\nopen-source, and give you little control over the process, or how your sensitive\nPDF documents are handled.\n\nIn this talk I'll present two open-source Python tools for PDF tables extraction, the\nCLI tool Camelot, and its web-based frontend UI - Excalibur. I'll show you how to\ninstall both locally, and how to use them to extract tabular data from PDFs with ease.\n\nExtraction under your control: 1) define rules with areas on the PDF page containing\nthe table you want to extract; 2) save and reuse the rules to automate / batch-process\nsimilar PDFs; 3) export the extracted tables as CSV, Excel, JSON, HTML, or use directly\nas pandas DataFrames.\n\nIf you find Camelot and Excalibur useful, please consider supporting those projects,\nor even get involved as a contributor!\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
