description: "Recorded At SpringOne2GX 2015\nPresenters: Kris De Volder & Martin Lippert\nCore Spring Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/developing-cloud-native-applications-with-the-spring-tool-suite\n\nIn this session we will demonstrate how to work effectively with Spring projects in Eclipse and the Spring Tool Suite (STS). We will demo all the latest enhancements in the tools including features like much smarter property file editing. We will also demonstrate new features in the Eclipse 4.5 (Mars) platform. Going beyond basic application development we will look at how to build and work with systems composed of individual Spring applications that represent microservices. How to easily exploit Spring Cloud to address some common infrastructure issues that come up with this architecture, and we’ll show how to deploy these applications both locally and then remotely to Cloud Foundry, all from Eclipse. We’ll show off the new features of the Cloud Foundry Eclipse plugin including better support for Spring Boot apps, improved performance and full remote debugging for apps running on CF from your desktop Eclipse. For more rapid development of your cloud native applications in a ‘Cloud Foundry like’ environment on your local machine we will demonstrate deploying to Lattice from STS. Lattice (http://lattice.cf) is an open source project for running containerized workloads.  Note: lattice.cf is being discontinued and is being replaced with MicroPCF https://github.com/pivotal-cf/micropcf"
