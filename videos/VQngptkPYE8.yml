description: "Google Workshop on Quantum Biology\nExperimental Studies on a Single Microtubule: Investigation of Electronic Transport Properties\nPresented by Anirban Bandyopadhyay\nOctober 22, 2010\n\nABSTRACT\n\nUsing nanotechnology we have studied electronic transport properties of a single microtubule (MT) under direct current/bias (DC) and alternating current (AC) of varying frequencies. Our study ranged from 10 K to the room temperature. At specific, 1) spontaneous MT growth under AC signal that led to Froelich Condensation, 2) ballistic electronic transport under DC and AC signal, 3) ferroelectric MT properties under DC signal. Applications of MT as a multilevel information processing and memory device (beyond binary logic) will be discussed. I will present our rigorous study to unravel the origin of room temperature coherent transport in terms of band energy diagrams where point contacts between valence and conduction band triggers transport of electrons/quasi particles. Finally, I will describe challenges and resolution of detection of MT topological qubits based on Hemchandra/Fibonacci MT geometry at physiological temperature.\n\nAbout the speaker: Dr. Anirban Bandyopadhyay completed his doctorate in supramolecular electronics at IACS, Kolkata, India, in 2005. He is a permanent scientist in NIMS, Tsukuba Japan. In 2008, he and his colleagues invented nano brain an artificial molecular processor that mimics a fundamental hardware feature of our neural network. Apart from holding executive positions in particular scientific organizations and editorial board of information related journals, he is involved in setting up a global platform for creating a super-intelligent molecular machine \"Bramha\".
