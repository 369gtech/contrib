description: "The Vision AI DevKit (https://aka.ms/iotshow/visionaidevkit) is a smart camera device powered by Azure IoT Edge. Equiped with a camera and microphones, it allows developing proof of concept (or even actual) projects implementing advanced image and sound analytics directly on the device.\nIn a previous episode (https://aka.ms/iotshow/185), Mahesh Yadav showed us the unboxing and first time experience with the device. In this new episode, Mahesh is back to show us how you can train and deploy new AI models on the device in a matter of minutes.\n\nCheck out the Vision AI devkit site to learn more and take it for a spin: https://aka.ms/iotshow/visionaidevkit"
