description: "We've seen how easy it is to modify CPython—it's a C program after all, and one written to be understood and extended by normal human beings.

This talk presents a practical example of dynamic code instrumentation using hacked interpreters.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData Amsterdam 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJames Powell\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxPf_pmQoYA&t=16s"
