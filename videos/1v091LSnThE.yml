title: 'Adam Ralph - Getting the first PR into .NET and other tales from an OSS contributor'

description: "The world of open source software has never been more exciting than it is right now. Communities spanning all platforms are thriving and more inclusive than ever, with like minded individuals and organisations, small and large, working together to produce great software for everyone. In particular, Microsoft are making huge strides into OSS with frameworks, runtimes, compilers and more being publicized on GitHub at unprecedented rate.\n\nIn November last year I unexpectedly became the first community member to have a PR accepted for the .NET core framework. With my 15 minutes of fame now over, I'd like to reflect on the journey that took 'that Czechoslovakian guy' from a curious OSS onlooker to a passionate OSS addict and share my views on the future of OSS. We'll discover what OSS is, why it works and just how easy it is to get involved, perhaps even with a contribution or two. OSS is not just about coding and there are plenty of other ways to contribute, so even if you're not a coder, this talk is still for you."
