description: "Video with transcript included: https://bit.ly/2SPqQ1Y  \n\nJez Humble and Nicole Forsgren explain the importance of knowing how (and what) to measure in order to focus on what’s important and communicate progress to peers, leaders, and stakeholders. Great outcomes don’t realize themselves, after all, and having the right metrics provides the data needed to keep getting better at building, delivering, and operating software systems.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon San Francisco 2018: https://bit.ly/2uYyHLb \n\nThe next QCon is QCon London 2019 - March 4-6, 2019: https://bit.ly/2hxsoN1 .
