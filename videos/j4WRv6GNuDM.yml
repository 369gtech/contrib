language: English
recordingDate: 1539618771
description: "In a world where big data is continuously touted as \"the new oil\" and U.S. companies are shutting their websites down rather than following increased European privacy rules, why should we care or worry about privacy? Is privacy dead? If not, should we work to preserve it?\n\nIn this talk, we'll dive into privacy for data science and why ensuring privacy for machine learning contributes to creating more ethical and fair models. We'll dive into research related to fair-and-private machine learning algorithms and privacy-preserving models, showing that caring about privacy and working to preserve user privacy in your machine learning workflows can help ensure a better model overall and support a more ethical product design.\n\nSpeaker: Katharine Jarmul"
