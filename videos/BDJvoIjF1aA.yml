title: 'Keep your nose out of it. Denying yourself access to production - Glenn F. Henriksen'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603268874
description: "In today's world of personal data, privacy concerns, malware and just plain bad luck, having access to a production system and production data is simply a Bad Idea. And not just for yourself, but every one. The developers, the database admin, the operations team - none of them should have access to production.\n\nSo how can we do that, and at the same time maintain our high rate of releases, our agility and our sanity?\n\nGlenn will go though some principles to follow and also show you in practice how you can create your environment, lock it down and update it, all without human intervention. He will also show you how you can monitor the environment for unauthorized changes. How you can have \"emergency hatches\" for when you really need access, but in a controlled fashion. Examples will be for Microsoft Azure, but the principles are universal.\n\nIn short, if you want to keep your production environment and production data at an arms length, but still so what you need when you need it, this is your session.\n\nCheck out more of our talks at\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/"
