description: 'Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a design pattern that is very popular in modern web systems, but at the same time is totally against basic principles of object-oriented programming. ORM turns objects into dumb and passive data bags which simply transfer data from one procedure to another. There is a better way to design SQL representing objects.'
