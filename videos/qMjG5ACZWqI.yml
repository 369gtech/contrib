The two extremes of mutability: atomic counters and persistent terms were introduced without much ado, almost secretly in the patch release OTP 21.2.

And also show some benchmarks for scenarios when \"\"you have to measure\"\".\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/peter-goemoeri/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - PÉTER GÖMÖRI\nBEAM Enthusiast, XProf maintainer\n\nMore on Péter Gömöri: https://codesync.global/speaker/peter-goemoeri/\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CBL AMSTERDAM 19\nCBL AMSTERDAM is powered by Code Sync.
