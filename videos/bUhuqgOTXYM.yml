language: English
recordingDate: 1639263987
description: "Self-Healing Tests is an approach in which machine learning helps with the maintenance of automated tests. Self-Healing, the automation of test automation, recognizes changes in the \"system under test\" and automatically adapts the test execution so that the tests remain functional. Commercial tools like TestIM and Tricentis Neo Engine are promising and focused on this area in good time. But there are also promising open source alternatives such as Healenium. This talk explains the pros and cons of self-healing tests and shows the implementation with the open source library Healenium using a concrete example.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license  (reuse allowed).
