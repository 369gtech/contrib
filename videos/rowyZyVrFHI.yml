title: 'Design Discussion with Casey Muratori'
recordingDate: 1607022848
description: "Casey was working on a new game, for which he had done the basic programming, but hadn't yet started on any real design. He wanted to talk about how to do game design, and this is what ensued.\n\nAt some point I referred to Frank Lantz's \"Immersive Fallacy\" rant, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JzNt1bSk_U\n\nThe volume is a little wacky since Casey was quiet on the recording; I went in and hand-boosted his volume in many places, but not everywhere."
