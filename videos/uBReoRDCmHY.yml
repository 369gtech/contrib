title: 'Querying Massive Data Sets in the Cloud with BigQuery and Java'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433258933
description: "In a recent Java-based project for a big Australian telecommunications company, Google BigQuery was selected for back-end data storage. This enabled its client to interactively query a terabyte of data in 25 seconds—as opposed to 30 minutes with a traditional RDBMS. What’s more, it was able to do it with a SQL-like query language and didn’t have to host any of the infrastructure itself. This presentation discusses what BigQuery is, how it relates to other big data solutions, and the different mechanisms you can use for querying it from a Java client. It also shows how you can leverage the new Java 8 streaming APIs to efficiently stream massive quantities of data into BigQuery.\n\n\nAuthor:\nKon Soulianidis\nI am the organiser of the MelbJVM meetup in Melbourne, and an engineer at Gradleware\nView more trainings by Kon Soulianidis at https://www.parleys.com/author/kon-soulianidis-2\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
