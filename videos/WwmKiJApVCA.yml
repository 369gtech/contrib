description: "by Yutaka Niibe\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.125/gnuk_hardware.webm\n\n\nGnuk Token is a security hardware USB token for GnuPG, which supports OpenPGP card protocol.\nThe important feature is it avoids special thing like hardware accelerator or tool (which comes with NDA).\nDevelopment environment, Tools, Firmware, and hardware design are all free, as they should be. \n\nFST-01 was designed and used as a reference hardware implementation for Gnuk.\nIn 2011, FST-01 was designed as free hardware design with KiCAD, so that people can use Gnuk Token for their computing, having the nature of reproducible by other parties.\nIn 2016, we had a revision called FST-01G, following update of KiCAD.  FST-01 and FST-01G were mass produced and sold more than 1200 pieces (2012-2018).\nIn 2018, it has major update, now called FST-01SZ, using Chinese chip (GD32F103TB) and Chinese connector for USB, following another update of KiCAD.\nIn this short talk, I will show my experience of FST-01/FST-01G/FST-01SZ, focusing new revision. See  https://www.gniibe.org/memo/development/fst-01/fst-01-revision-sz.html for an explanation and  https://www.gniibe.org/memo/development/fst-01/fst-01sz-testplan.html for the test plan. \n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 16:30:00+01"
