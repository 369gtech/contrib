title: 'Azure Maps Weather services for developers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1588014004
description: 'Azure Maps Weather services (https://aka.ms/iotshow/AzureMapsWeatherService) add a new layer of real-time, location-aware information to Azure Maps portfolio of native Azure geospatial services. Bringing Weather Services to Azure Maps means IoT developers have a simple means of integrating highly dynamic, real-time, historic and forecasted weather data and visualizations into their applications through their existing Azure subscriptions. The Weather Service APIs for Azure Maps are brought to life in partnership with Accuweather. Weather is a critical factor for many scenariosâ€”whether it''s to ensure the safety of mobile assets, model and forecast need for renewable energy, or predict risk and assess claims in the insurance industry. Outi demonstrates how a few of these APIs can be used to enhance data visualizations with radar and infrared map overlays with an Azure Maps Web SDK, and how call APIs to make weather-based decisions with current and forecast based weather, as well as weather along route.'
