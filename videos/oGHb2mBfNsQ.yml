description: "A large change is afoot in software development. Baby steps have led the way, as evidenced by continuous delivery efforts, virtual machines, and service-oriented architecture. Leading a cloud R&D team makes it clear that the next steps in cloud development are through virtualized applications and application containers (not virtual machines). This movement has already started, as can be seen at Docker, Inc.; Twitter; foursquare; AirBnb; and Baidu, to name just a few. This session covers the future of cloud development with Docker and Mesos, how it will create a commoditized cloud solution, and how it will change software development moving forward.\n\n\nAuthor:\nKen Sipe\nKen Sipe is a Cloud Solution Architect at Mesosphere, focused on helping companies simplify the development and operation of large scale infrastructure and distributed systems with the Mesosphere Stack.
