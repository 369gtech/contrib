title: 'Building a Developer Relations Stack with Next.js Ahmad Awais (Next.js Conf 2021)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635396120
description: "Everyone in DevRel can build demos, but not everyone makes a developer activation stack. My team built the entire DevRel Stack (Guides, Learn, LMS) with Next.js, and we wouldn't have it any other way. I'm going to help you grow developer engagement and qualify more DevRel leads with Next.js. From betting on Jamstack (and beyond with Next.js) to quickly prototyping a shared library of developer activations. By the end, you'll walk away â€” a tad more concerned about the state of the web yet very well equipped to deal with it using Next.js (SDK for modern web apps).\n\nAhmad Awais\nHead of DevRel at RapidAPI"
