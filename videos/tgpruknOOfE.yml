description: "Java and JavaScript are the most popular languages. Popularity attracts developers and developers like tools, frameworks and libraries. Libraries come and go, frameworks are introducing breaking changes on each release, and the enterprise (=longer lasting) projects have to survive in such environment. Is there a simple strategy for survival? There is, but it is hardly explainable with slides and easy to demonstrate with code.\n\nConsultant and Java (SE/EE/FX) enthusiast Adam Bien (adambien.blog) uses Java since JDK 1.0 and still enjoys writing Java code. Adam occasionally organizes Java EE / HTML 5 / JavaScript workshops at Munichâ€™s airport (http://airhacks.com)."
