In fact, the most common way of writing JavaScript in Fable is via the \"\"Elmish\"\" library which implements the, well, Elm architecture. But the philosophy behind the two languages is very different. Take a tour of the two languages with someone who's used both professionally, and we'll investigate how the different ideas behind them have lead to different features, different ecosystems, and even differences in how teams work with them.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/michael-newton\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MICHAEL NEWTON\nMostly Functional Human\n\nDeveloper, Architect, Trainer, Consultant: Michael is currently working with NoRedInk to teach children better written communication skills.\nblog.mavnn.co.uk\n\nMore on Michael Newton: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/michael-newton\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
