We'll take a look at a simple application and show how you can:\n\nUnit test classes\nUse mocking\nTest the persistence layer\nTest remote REST calls\nTest MVC controllers\nIntegration test a fully running application\n\nAlong the way we'll also discuss how you can structure your applications to make them more amenable to testing, and how new features in Spring Boot 1.4 make testing even easier."
