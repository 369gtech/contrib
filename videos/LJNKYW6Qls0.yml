description: "Eric Smalling, Solution Architect, Docker Inc.\n\nWhat if you could run your Java application in the same artifacts as your developer workstation, integration, and user acceptance testing environments as it does in production? With Docker, your deployment artifacts conform to a common, portable standard that allows your team to do exactly that. In this session learn how to best run the JVM inside containers; ensure it is built and tested in deterministic, repeatable fashion; and deploy it in a guaranteed known-good-state in every environment. This session explores the basics of Docker, how to build and run your applications in containers, how to deploy a web application using the same artifacts on workstations and servers, and best practices for managing and configuring JVM-based applications in Docker."
