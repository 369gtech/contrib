description: "We all know how difficult (and expensive!) it is to convince brilliant engineers to join our team. The real challenge starts on Day 1 – What can we do to keep them happy and engaged?\n\nAfter all, bored people quit.\n\nIf you know you should do better but run out of ideas on how – come on down! We’ll talk about how to make their 1st day at work memorable, how to help them build a personal brand, how to figure out and sell our unique strength as a company (GitHub-style), why we should bring them to investors’ events and plenty more.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll share 8 tips you could apply to build happier engineering teams.\n\n\nAbout Oren Ellenbogen\n\nOren is the curator of Software Lead Weekly, author of Leading Snowflakes and Head of Engineering at Forter."
