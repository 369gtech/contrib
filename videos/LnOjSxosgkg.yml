title: 'Building products for emerging industries'
recordingDate: 1610516081
description: "New products and companies are oftentimes motivated by an existing problem, usually one that has been experienced by the founders. The demand is already there, but the experience for those involved can be optimized by reducing friction among actors, reducing the price, or finding better matches. When the product is presented for the end user - it’s obvious how it should be used and what aspect of life it can improve. Existing industries become disrupted by better ways of doing things.\n\nBut what about building a product that is completely new for society? Your challenge is not to digitize or optimize existing procedures but rather create something that no one is using yet. The problem is there, but communally there is not an accepted solution yet. This presentation will discuss how you should approach your product, features, and lines of code when you’re trying to find a product/market fit that has never existed before. How can you pivot your resources and way of thinking to accelerate the market to the best of your abilities?\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
