description: "Slides and more info: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2016/robert-virding\n\nThese are some thoughts, maybe even a philosophy, I have about program language design based on my experiences with various programming languages. They include languages I have used, and languages I have been a part of in designing and implementing. These languages have come from many different types and have had different characteristics. Much of this is also valid to system design as well."
