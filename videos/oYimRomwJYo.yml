title: 'Roy Derks - GraphQL Will Do To REST What JSON Did To XML'
recordingDate: 1536932473
description: "Why GraphQL will become the new standard for accessing external data in your React Native app. I will show how using GraphQL instead of REST services the development process becomes even more declarative as GraphQL will take away the (imperative) hassle of tying data from multiple endpoints together. This will increase the level of complexity in React Native development, while also increasing the performance of the application.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/RoyDerks1/graphql-will-do-to-rest-what-json-did-to-xml-113763718"
