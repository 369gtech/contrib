title: 'React Native EU 2020: Eli White - Modernizing React Native’s JavaScript'
recordingDate: 1602055883
description: "Abstract:\nA lot is changing in the core of React Native. We’ve got Fabric, TurboModules, JSI, etc. We’ve also been working on how these systems interact with the JavaScript in React Native apps. This talk will be a deep dive into some of the expected JavaScript API changes, React Native’s JS internals, new startup performance improvements, codegen, and more!\n\nEli White is a Software Engineer on the React Native core team at Facebook. Eli can live on ice cream, but thrives on pie."
