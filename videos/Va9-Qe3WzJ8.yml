description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nAs C++20 brings new features for C++ programmers at all levels of experience, so does our last year of work on Visual Studio and MSVC. New versions of the IDE have brought new productivity features and experience improvements for all developers, no matter what platforms they are targeting. Our open source standard library has seen contributions from across the C++ ecosystem, improving in conformance and performance. We've been hard at work on key C++20 compiler features like Concepts. We're also working on bold new ways of working on C++ projects with cloud environments.\n\nCome along to hear about all of these as well as announcements about the future of our tools.\n\n---\nMarian Luparu\nMicrosoft\nPrincipal Product Lead, C++ Team\nSeattle, WA\n\nSy Brand\nMicrosoft\nEdinburgh, Scotland\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
