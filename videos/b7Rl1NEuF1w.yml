description: "Ближайшая конференция — Mobius 2020 Piter\n22-25 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/mobius2020piter\n\n. Харизматичный докладчик и один из первых GDE.\n\nThe GPU is your silent partner 98% of the time as it allows you to provide sleeker animations and richer UIs with little to no effort for the majority of applications and users, but it can also create bugs and issues that are very hard to debug and resolve, especially if you don't know how GPU run hardware acceleration works.\n\nIn this session we'll review past cases where Royi had trouble that originated in the GPU and how you can diagnose and solve similar issues quickly and more effectively in your Android application."
