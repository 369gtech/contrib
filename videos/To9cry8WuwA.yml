description: "Arjen Lentz\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/264/\n\nHTML is not a programming language.\r\nBeing sandboxed in an app on a tablet is not programming.\r\nIf we can agree that these things are not good, we need to look at why these things are happening.\r\n\r\nOf course the issue is not about programming as such, it's really all about thinking, patterns, and problem solving!\r\nAnd not getting that right is obviously very detrimental to our children's and country's future.  We must do better.\r\n\r\nWhat have other countries been doing?  There are some surprising insights there.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
