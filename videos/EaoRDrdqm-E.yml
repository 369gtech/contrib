It's created by Jeff Lindsay, powered by Docker and written ~100 lines of shell script.\n\nThis is brilliant hack, very interesting to look inside, but it also provides huge value for developers.\n\nIn this talk I gonna describe Dokku magic behind as well as show how to build own PaaS for Node.js applications in minutes.\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
