description: "Michael Duigou, Instigator, Definitely Not A Robot\n\nFor high-availability services, rebooting or starting a new instance is not a viable failure-handling strategy. This session covers experiences and approaches used for developing and deploying resilient, fault-tolerant code. It looks at exception handling, threads and pools, locking, timeouts, deadlocks, recovery, memory, logging, saturation/runaways, resource hogs, manual repair of running systems, and—yes—when a reboot is your best option. The presenter works on the on-vehicle software for the Liquid Robotics Wave Glider, an autonomous marine data collection platform that often spends months at a time at sea."
