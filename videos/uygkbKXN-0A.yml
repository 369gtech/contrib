With options available today, it has never been easier to build solutions, run experiments, and recover from mistakes. Cheap leverage however encourages incidental complexity, reduces inherent need for cooperation, and obviates common standards.\n\nFunctional programming offers unprecedented leverage, which amplifies these externalities. Knowingly or not, the modern software developer wields tremendous power thusly, but at the same time walks on the knife edge.\n\nIn this talk, Evadne will attempt to provide an overview of these externalities, the historical context, near- and long-term implications, and a few projections as to how things will play out. She will also share some ideas as to how we can mitigate these problems together as a community.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2AX6mMd\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - EVADNE WU\nSoftware engineer at Faria Education Group\n\nEvadne is a technologist with design/implementation background in HCI and can offer a wide scope of expertise in software architecture, high-fidelity prototyping, service architecture, and operations management.\n\nCurrently she work as a technology lead at an education SaaS ISV.
