description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nI'm excited about constexpr. It's probably my favorite C++11 feature and it's gotten even better with C++14. This talk will introduce constexpr to the uninitiated. We'll start with C++11 and continue into the improvements introduced with C++14. We'll look into useful ways to think about constexpr code. We'll also cover some tips and tricks with writing constexpr code.\n— \nIf you ask his children, they will tell you that Scott has been writing software since dinosaurs roamed the earth. In 1996 Scott learned C++ by working through the exercises in Stroustrup's TC++PL 2nd edition and he has never looked back. Scott is currently working at Ripple Labs developing open source crypto-financial software. When he's not writing code Scott plays the Chapman Stick, sings rock and roll, and spends time with his lovely wife.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
