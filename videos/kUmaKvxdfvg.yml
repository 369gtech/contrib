description: "How We Used Kubernetes to Host a Capture the Flag (CTF) - Ariel Zelivansky & Liron Levin, Twistlock \n\nCTF competitions are now commonly used for cybersecurity education purposes, and are solved by many enthusiast researchers looking for a challenge. In Twistlock, we decided to host an online CTF competition with unique challenges that required a live, dedicated persistent machine, for each participant. Using Kubernetes, we managed to successfully host the challenge, publicly open, without sacrificing the security of our infrastructure.     We will discuss:  Introduction to the CTF and why we choose to run it on Kubernetes  Attack vectors for giving users untrusted shells to pods  Container isolation technologies such as gvisor and network policies.  Patterns for dynamically scaling pods and routes for new CTF participates    In the end, attendees will learn the security building blocks of Kubernetes, and how it can be used for non conventional purposes such as hosting a one time live challenge. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYd"
