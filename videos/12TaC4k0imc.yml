title: 'How VMware IT Modernized My VMware to Deliver an Exceptional Customer Experience'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327253
description: "VMware is undergoing a digital transformation to enable the transition of our business model from perpetual-license software to subscription and software-as-a-service (SaaS). To deliver new digital capabilities quickly, VMware IT modernized several mission-critical apps, such as the My VMware® customer portal, used by millions of customers.\n  \n My VMware, over time, faced several scalability and performance issues, and its legacy monolithic architecture made it hard to deliver features quickly. To modernize the app, VMware IT leveraged the Chief Digital Transformation Office (CDTO) Modern Application Platform (MAP), powered by VMware Tanzu, to rearchitect it as lightweight microservices built and delivered using Spring Boot and Tanzu Application Service. This delivered a 40% improvement in service response time, saved over 1,000 person-hours in maintenance, and enabled us to launch VMware Customer Connect™, an update and rebranding of My VMware, to simplify our customers’ experience.\n\n Moin Tavargere, Senior Manager at VMware\n Nicy Thomas, Sr. Product Owner at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/how-vmware-it-modernized-my-vmware-to-deliver-an-exceptional-customer-experience"
