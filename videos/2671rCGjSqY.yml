description: "A Node.js platform is built on top of few principles. One of these is having a small set of functionalities, leaving the rest to the developers. This rule makes the learning curve as small as possible, and in combination with the same language reduces an amount of time spent on switching between front-end and back-end side. We glorify simplicity, we praise reusability, but the question is - how to really take advantage of them? In this talk you'll learn why NestJS could increase your productivity and how to unlock your full potential as a JavaScript/TypeScript developer.\n\nEVENT:\n\nJSCamp Barcelona 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nKamil My≈õliwiec\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixz0IefmecI"
