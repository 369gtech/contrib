description: "Spring I/O 2016 - 19 -20 May Barcelona\n\nThe change to reactive involves a fundamental shift in writing application logic from imperative to non-blocking. Understanding what this change means is an essential first step towards creating reactive applications. This talk introduces reactive programming and discusses some of the tools for Java developers.
