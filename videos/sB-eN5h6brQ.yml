description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nAlthough security and identity management is a crucial aspect for any application, its implementation can be difficult. Worse, it is often neglected, poorly implemented and intrusive in the code. But lately, Identity Management servers has appeared which allow to outsource and delegate all authentication and authorization aspects, such as https://auth0.com/. Of these servers, one of the most promising is Keycloak, open-source, flexible and agnostic of any technology, it is easily deployable / adaptable in its own infrastructure. In this session, I propose you to discover KeyCloak progressively and in an interactive way: 0 slide, 100% live coding.\n\nWe will naturally focus on the Spring Boot adapter that Keycloak provides but also see how you can combine Spring Security with Keycloak."
