description: 'As in the Star Trek Beyond movie, which the title of this talk tries to recall, we will present how Kubernetes can be extended beyond containers using Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) to schedule custom tasks and resources or bring Kubernetes automation to the next level. During the presentation we will go deep into the concept of Operator and provide some useful examples of application of this pattern to, i.e., the automated scaling of Services.'
