description: "Java 8’s lambdas empower us to create wonderful APIs. Vavr lets us dive deeper into the world of functional programming by providing us with persistent data types, immutable collections, and functional control structures. The results are beautiful and do just work.\n\nDuring this presentation, we will recall Java8’s downsides and explore how Vavr’s Scala-inspired features fill-in the gaps."
