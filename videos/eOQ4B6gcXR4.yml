Therefore, each system we develop must have mechanisms to allow users to identify themselves, the famous login. One of the drawbacks of this, is that we must ensure that the information of each user is stored with strict security rules, on the other hand each user must create a password to access, each platform sets its own rules, and finally the users create unsafe passwords or forgot them.\n\nThere are mechanisms that make this process less complicated for both, developers and users. Passwordless and Federated Identities, that allow users to login without having to create a password, and developers will not have to store that information under strict security protocols.\n\nThis sessions seeks to explain in detail What Passwordless is? What strategies exist and how implement them. The Federated Identity and how implement that. Finally how do those thins using PaaS Technologies.\n#Passwordless\n\nPresented by Mercedes Wyss\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
