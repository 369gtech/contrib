title: 'Automated Tuning of the JVM with Bayesian Optimization'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474391095
description: 'Tuning the performance of a JVM is hard and maintaining optimal performance in the face of hardware and software upgrades even harder. As a result, services often leave a lot of performance on the table. This sessionâ€™s speakers apply state-of-the-art machine learning technology to continuously optimize the performance of a JVM-based microservice. Initial results show that machine-learning-based Bayesian optimization can be used to solve an otherwise intractable high-dimensional combinatorial optimization problem. One case saw a performance efficiency improvement of over 80%, measured by requests served per unit of GC time. The session discusses initial results, lessons, pitfalls, and how to integrate such automation into a microservices-based production environment.'
