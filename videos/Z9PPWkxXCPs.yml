description: 'Sergey Sverchkov of Altoros considers uses cases typical for some advanced applications of Cloud architectures incorporating Cloud Foundry PaaS. High-Availability, Fault-Tolerance, scaling down to smaller form-factors while operating in mission-critical environments - all these requirements put constraints on architecture, configuration, and testing. Cloud Foundry''s operation depends on the number of external and internal dependencies. Points of failure may exist on different levels stretching from hardware/IaaS foundation to microservices.'
