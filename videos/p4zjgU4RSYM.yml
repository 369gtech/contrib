description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBuilding Cloud-native applications with Rust - the good, the bad and the ugly - Luca Palmieri, TrueLayer\n\nRust has built a reputation as an excellent systems programming language. Yet more than a few companies have chosen to bet on Rust for a completely different type of software: Cloud-native applications. What does Rust have to offer compared to other established languages (e.g. Java, C#, Python, Golang) when it comes to APIs and message consumers? The talk will walk you through TrueLayer's experience. We will cover what convinced us that Rust was a viable option for our latest product (spoiler - not just performance!), the issues and annoyances we experienced along the way as well as what we believe to be some of its intrinsic limitations for the backend development usecase."
