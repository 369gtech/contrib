A stream data pipeline with Flink typically includes a storage component to ingest and serve the data. Pravega is a stream store that ingests and stores stream data permanently, making the data available for tail, catch-up, and historical reads. One important challenge for such stream data pipelines is coping with the variations in the workload. Daily cycles and seasonal spikes might require the provisioning of the application to adapt accordingly. Pravega has a feature called stream scaling, which enables the capacity offered for the ingestion of events of a stream to grow and shrink over time according to workload. Such a feature is useful when the application downstream has the ability of accommodating such changes and also scale its provisioning accordingly. In this presentation, we introduce stream scaling in Pravega and how Flink jobs leverage this feature to rescale stateful jobs according to variations in the workload.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
