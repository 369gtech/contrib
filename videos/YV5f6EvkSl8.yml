recordingDate: 1484154418
description: "For a decade augmented reality has been confined to print media, using markers, coded images, and other elements to bring the idea to life. The impact of AR goes well beyond print. Just as Pokemon Go exposed the world to geo-located AR, this presentation will explore and explain the use of AR in other innovative applications. From object selection, user defined tracking (UDT), and Point Cloud spatial tracking, to RGB color recognition, face recognition, and environment based AR.\n\nCo-presented by Steve Martell (VP Creative Technology) and Dennis Hubley (Senior Developer) from Current Studios, this presentation bridges the gap between code and creative. Offering two sides of the story needed to conceive, create, and produce innovative experiences.\n\nFITC produces events for digital creators in Toronto, Amsterdam, NYC and beyond\nSave 10% off any of our events with discount code 'youtube'\n\nCheck out our events at http://fitc.ca\nor follow us at https://twitter.com/fitc"
