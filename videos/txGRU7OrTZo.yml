We'll make a C++ GUI Calculator app in one video. Along the way we'll learn a lot! We'll cover a topic which confuses many people which is how to setup event handling with Signals and Slots. We'll also cover how to work with widgets in many ways, setting up an interface, stylesheets, casting, regular expressions and much more.\n\nBrought to you thanks to contributions from my Patreon subscribers such as https://perl6.org/"
