description: "The Fragment API forms one of the core components google has provided to build Android apps. Despite the key role it is meant to play, many people find Fragments hard to use, prone to bugs and frustrating. We will pose the question - do we actually need Fragments? Are they worth the trouble? We will review some of the common problems with the Fragment API and look at why Fragments are so prone to issues. We will also survey some alternative approaches to using Fragments look at what solutions provided by the community and review best practices. Finally will also look at what advice Google has provided and how they are improving fragments.\n\nLuke Sleeman is a freelance Android developer, based in Melbourne Australia. Luke develops great apps for digital agencies, tiny startups, global brands and everything in between. Luke also regularly speaks on Android and Mobile development.\n\nFor more on YOW!
