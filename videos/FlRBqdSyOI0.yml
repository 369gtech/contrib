description: "Deep Dive: Autoscaling SIG - Solly Ross, Google & Michael Hausenblas, Red Hat \n\nEvery had a question about the nitty-gritty details of the horizontal pod autoscaler? Want to weigh in on the future of the cluster autoscaler? Curious about the ongoing work on the vertical pod autoscaler? If so, come to the SIG Autoscaling Deep Dive. We'll be discussing future and ongoing developments in all three autoscaling components, as well as answer questions and concerns about their functionality. While the session will be centered around areas that attendees wish to discuss, potential topics include algorithmic improvements to the HPA, the path to stabilization of HPA v2, and cluster autoscaler integration with the cluster API. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grew"
