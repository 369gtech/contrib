recordingDate: 1446939238
description: "In this session, you’ll learn about game design: the art and science of constructing enjoyable, engaging games. We aren’t doing any coding, and we’re not talking game engine development – instead, we’ll be taking a deep dive into game design theory, using it to understand how people interact with rules, and how to use it to improve your community, your company, your project, and your software.\n\nVideo games are the most glamorous of the electronic arts, but splashy graphics and amazing sound aren’t the defining feature of games. Games are the world’s only interactive artistic medium, and good interaction needs to be designed. Today’s master crafters of interaction design are game designers.\n\nIn this session, you’ll get a fresh perspective on user experience design and community engagement by understanding how people are interacting with the fastest-growing form of entertainment in the world.\n\nTopics covered in this session include:\n\nWhy games work, and how to analyse and build engaging experiences\nThe Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics framework: what it’s good for, and how to use it\nHow to understand what a game’s doing, and how to build for fun\nWe’ll take this knowledge and apply it to real world examples in the realms of UX and UI design, community management, project management, and company building, as well as a few examples from the actual game development industry.\n\nJon Manning is a world renowned iOS development trainer and writer, game designer and mobile software engineering wizard.\n\nHe has co-authored two books on mobile development and enjoys re-implementing such things as OpenGL and the Objective-C runtime (in his spare time).\n\nJon is also a researcher in Human-Computer Interaction working towards a PhD.\n\nParis Buttfield-Addison is a developer and designer specialising in game design, development, and playful user experiences. He has written more than ten books, including “Swift Development with Cocoa (O’Reilly Media, 2014), and the upcoming “Mobile Game Development with Unity” (O’Reilly Media, 2015). Paris co-founded Secret Lab together with Jon Manning, and has worked with clients including the ABC, Apple, CSIRO, Meebo (acquired by Google), the National Museum of Australia, and Study Ladder.\n\nParis has a BA in History, and a PhD in Computing, and lives on the side of a mountain in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.\n\nFor more on YOW!
