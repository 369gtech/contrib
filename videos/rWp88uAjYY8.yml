description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nThe Epic Groovy Puzzlers S02: The revenge of the parentheses\n\nMore strange, more bizarre, more fun! The Groovy Puzzlers hits with its second season in which we implemented the lesson learned from the first one - do more of the same (always as a duet)! Expect even more ?NO WAY!?, ?WHOA!?, ?WTF!?, O_o and prizes flying around, and expect to learn more about Groovy?s darkest secrets! As usual, the traps we fell into here in JFrog and contributions from top-notch Groovy authors and users!\n\nBaruch Sadogursky, JFrog\n\nJavaOne Rockstar Baruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate of JFrog, the creators of Artifactory Binary Repository, the home of Bintray, JavaOne 2011 and 2013 Duke Choice Awards winner. For a living he hangs out with the JFrog tech leaders, writes some code around Artifactory and Bintray, and then speaks and blogs about all that. He does it repeatedly for the last dozen of years and enjoys every moment of it. Baruch is @jbaruch on twitter and mostly blogs on http://blog.bintray.com and http://blogs.jfrog.org."
