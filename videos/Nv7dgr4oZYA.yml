I have compiled a list of 10 tools that I think are really powerful that you can use today. These are completely free (not trial versions). Some do have paid upgrades, and I point those out, but I did not put anything in this list that I do not recommend the free version of. Check out the list and let me know if you know of any others that you think developers need to know about.\n\nTimes and Links:\n 1.
