description: "Speaker: Daniele Polencic\r\n\r\nAbstract: In the last few years, the industry has experienced a shift towards\r\ndeveloping smaller and more focused applications. Smaller services are excellent\r\nfrom a product and development perspective: they are quicker to deploy, easier\r\nto iterate on and can handle failure gracefully. But how does that cultural\r\nshift impact the infrastructure? In this talk, you will learn whatâ€™s all the\r\nhype about containers and Kubernetes and how they impact the development of your\r\nmicroservices. Daniele is an instructor at Learnk8s, where he teaches Kubernetes\r\nand containers to small and large enterprises.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/danielepolencic\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/266152374/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Ying Ka Ho\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/CQTFy/"
