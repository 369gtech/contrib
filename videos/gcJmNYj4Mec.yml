title: 'Yet & Datomic Immutable Facts Mutated Our Stack - Milton Reder'
language: English
recordingDate: 1507912879
description: 'Yet Analytics has been using Datomic (and Clojure) in our core products since we started the company three years ago. We’ve had a great experience using it as a database, but Datomic is much more than that: It is a collection of great ideas that have come to inform almost everything we do. In this talk I’ll tell Yet’s Datomic story with a focus on the ways these ideas have changed our approach to software across our stack, even when Datomic itself is not involved. I’ll talk about how event sourcing helps us manage application state in browsers, how datalog simplifies dataset manipulation and queries in data science workbooks and virtual ETL applications, and how multiple ideas from Datomic are informing our current work on large-scale streaming data platforms.'
