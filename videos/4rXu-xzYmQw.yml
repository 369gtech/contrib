title: 'YOW! West 2017 Ian Randall - From Inception to Production – A Continuous Delivery Story'
recordingDate: 1497227019
description: "At Pushpay in New Zealand, we make changes to our production servers half-a-dozen times a day or more. We do this with an expanding engineering team in an industry (mobile payments) that demands rigour and risk aversion.\n\nJoin me as I talk about how we ship a feature all the way from a thought in someone’s head to running on the production servers. Sometimes, on the same day!\n\nThis session will cover the tools and systems that make this possible, but more importantly the organisational culture that is the bedrock on which those systems are implemented.\n\nIan Randall is a technologist and a family man originally from England, now living in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nHe spends his days coding vicariously through extra-super-double talented developers at Pushpay.\n\nFor more on YOW!
