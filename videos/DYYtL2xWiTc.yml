description: "CF-Abacus: Introduction to the Standard Metering and Aggregation Engine for Cloud Foundry - Jean-Sebastien Delfino, IBM & Hristo Iliev, SAP\n\nAs Cloud Foundry (CF) matures into the dominant Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) the focus of development has been shifting towards re-engineering components for scale and stability as well as increasingly towards adding components that allows it to be used in commercial environments. \n\nCF-Abacus is a metering and aggregation engine extracted from IBM's Bluemix. It enables the aggregation and metering (flexible pricing) of various usage data (service, apps, and buildpacks) so that the resulting output can be presented to end users and used for subsequent billing. For instance, a user with a few apps connected to several services can see the cost breakdown for each app, each service, over time and get projection of their costs as well. \n\nIn this talk we will cover briefly how CF-Abacus came into fruition, we will describe its micro-services architecture, detail where it is going, and how you can use it into your own (private or public) CF environments.\n\nJean-Sebastien Delfino\nSenior Technical Staff Member, IBM\nSenior Technical Staff Member at IBM | Architect for IBM Bluemix Cloud services, account and subscription management, usage metering and rating, payments, and analytics. | Working on the Cloud Foundry Abacus project.\n\nHristo Iliev\nSAP\nHristo Iliev has been a professional developer for over 16 years. He works at SAP, providing NetWeaver (SAP`s Java EE platform) with core and provisioning infrastructure, including core modularization, deployment, class loading, configuration, thread and cache management. He also worked on Eclipse Virgo - application server, designed to run enterprise Java applications. In the last 5 years he is actively contributing and integrating cutting edge technologies like SAP HANA Cloud Platform, Docker and Cloud Foundry. He worked on Cloud Foundry’s new scheduler (Diego) and currently works on CF Abacus – metering and aggregation engine for Cloud Foundry. Hristo has spoken at SAP meetups and Eclipse Con, JAX and ISTA conferences about Java, Eclipse and CF related topics. In his free time he is doing lightsaber duels with his 4 year daughter."
