description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nAfter almost ten years of working on ScalaTest, there is still lots of potential for improvement of the library. In this talk, Bill Venners will describe what he has come to believe is the essence of testing, and how he wants to evolve ScalaTest as a result. He will dive into propositional and predicate logic and show how they relate to testing. He'll explain where he thinks property-based testing fits in the big picture, and give demos of some new and exciting features currently being developed for ScalaTest and Scalactic."
