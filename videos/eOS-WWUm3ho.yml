description: "SharePoint turned 10 years old recently and is now arguably among the most successful software ever in terms of sales and installations. There is almost universal agreement that the SharePoint 2010 platform is vastly improved from a technology perspective when compared to its predecessors.\n\nYet most organizations are only using a fraction of the product's capabilities, which can lead to frustration. The issues are as complex as the organizations themselves, but common themes can be identified and categorized into the following five most common \"sins\":\n\n    Treating Governance as a one-time event\n    IT leadership abdicating responsibility for Information Architecture and Roadmap\n    Treating user adoption & training as an after thought\n    Underestimating Human Resource implications\n    Failing to educate and engage executives\n\nJoin Dux Raymond Sy, Managing Partner of Innovative-e, as he discusses the danger of each of these pitfalls and how to avoid them in your organization's implementation of SharePoint.\n\nAbout Dux Raymond Sy:\n\nWith over 15 years of experience in Information Technology, Dux Raymond Sy has earned a reputation as among the leading experts in leveraging technology to enhance project management.
