description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLoad Shedding for Evil Wizards - Tony Allen, Unaffiliated\n\nEnvoy has a number of different load shedding mechanisms available out-of-the-box. Circuit breaking, rate limiting, admission control, adaptive concurrency-- how do they work? When should you use them? How can they fail spectacularly? Let's find out!\n\nThis one's a deep-dive into the different load shedding mechanisms available in Envoy. Come watch Tony gush about how each one is implemented, the queuing/scheduling concepts behind them, and how they can fail to protect us from noisy-neighbor problems. He'll conclude with some experimental results based on his previous work on FBThrift and how we (as a community) can apply those ideas to improve Envoy."
