description: "Have you heard about Server-less application? \nAnd what about Continuous Delivery?\nYou may not be responsible for the management of servers when you have a Server-less application, but you are responsible for the high-availability and fast time to market for your app!\n\nI would like to demo a simple JIRA Cloud Server-less add-on (built on top of AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway and AWS DynamoDB, S3 and CloudFront) using a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) approach. On top of this, I will demo how you can make your Server-less web application globally distributed, ensuring your application will always be available for your customers.\n\nLeonid Kyrpychenko\nWorked in Bwin, Fultilpoker, Vistaprint and now with Atlassian. Spoke at Merchant Payments Ecosystem and a few meetups."
