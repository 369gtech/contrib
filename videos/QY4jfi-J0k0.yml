description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nCONTINUOUS TRACING IN PRODUCTION (WITHOUT ERLANG'S TRACE MODULE)\nby Greg Mefford\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nProduction \nMonitoring \nTracing\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate \n\nABSTRACT\nCollecting trace data from your application is a very important, but often overlooked,  aspect of Application Performance Monitoring (APM). In this talk, we will learn about the core concepts of application tracing (OpenTracing and OpenCensus), some of the tools that are available for collecting and visualizing trace data, and how this data can be used for troubleshooting errors and performance issues, in both monolithic and distributed micro-service architectures.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/greg-mefford/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - GREG MEFFORD\nNerves Core Team and Spandex Core Team\n\nGreg has always had a passion for metrics and monitoring. When he joined Bleacher Report, he had the opportunity to use the Spandex library to collect distributed trace data and visualize it using Datadog APM.\n\nSince then, he has joined the Spandex project as a core maintainer, with the goal of supporting various vendor-specific back-ends with a vendor-neutral collection API.\n\nHe is also a core maintainer of the Nerves project for building BEAM-based embedded devices.\n\nMore on Greg Mefford: https://codesync.global/speaker/greg-mefford/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
