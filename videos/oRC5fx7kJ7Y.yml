The language is based on behaviour trees. It is suitable for making UI, artificial agents, chatbots, games, NPCs for games, AGI-ish projects, and for simulating hybrid systems with state transitions and continuous changes within each state. \n\nIt was originally built to create mock data that behaved in 'real world' ways. Itâ€™s reasonable to think of SimGen as an implementation of behaviour trees for SWI-Prolog. SimGen programs deconstruct the world into 'behaviours', and provide node types to describe micropatterns of behaviour seen in the world to train machine learning/symbolic AI anomalometry with. An example of such a system is a bouncing ball. The ball is either in the air, or in contact with the ground. Its behaviour is different in each regime.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/anne-ogborn/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ANNE OGBORN\nSoftware Engineer\nHasura.io\n\nAnne (Annie) Ogborn is a core contributor to the SWI-Prolog language and a frequent speaker on\nSWI-Prolog related topics. She is the author of a number of tutorials on SWI-Prolog, and recently taught\n357 students Prolog in an online class.\n\nShe has been programming since 1975. Her professional interests include logic programming, symbolic AI, and social robotics.\n\nMore on Anne Ogborn: https://codesync.global/speaker/anne-ogborn/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
