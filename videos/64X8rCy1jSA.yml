description: "Like floating point and Unicode handling, date and time is one of those areas many developers are afraid of. That's understandable, but is curable.\nThe date/time handling in .NET feels okay, until suddenly it's not - we'll look at the root causes, and how you can think about date/time information (even time zones) without fear. It's just possible that I mention my Noda Time library, just occasionally."
