description: "CDI has been around since 2009. It has quite a robust dependency injection feature set that allows it to match both the easy to use feature set and the robust enterprise features that developers need. In this session, we'll look at hands on application development using CDI 2 and the reference implementation, Weld 3.\n\nJohn Ament \nI'm a software architect located in Central NJ, focused heavily on server side Java and Cloud computing."
