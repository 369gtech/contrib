description: 'Progressive web apps (PWA) are becoming an industry standard for building web applications. With reliability, speed and immersive user experience in mind, PWAs help you reach a broader audience. In this session we will take an existing web app and convert it into a PWA. First, we''ll make our application installable to homescreen by adding a Web App Manifest json file. Next, we''ll focus on making our app reliable by enabling service workers inside our application and caching resources. Throughout this session we''ll also learn how to use Lighthouse to test the performance of our PWA.'
