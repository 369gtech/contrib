description: 'This talk educates junior and mid-level developers on common security vulnerabilities, how they are exploited, and how to protect against them. We''ll explore several of the OWASP Top 10 attack vectors like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and others. Each topic will be approached from the perspective of an attacker to see how these vulnerabilities are detected and exploited using several realistic examples. We''ll then apply this knowledge to see how web applications can be secured against such vulnerabilities.'
