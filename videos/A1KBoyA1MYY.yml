title: 'What’s Up with Modularity?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433263237
description: "Modularity is an architectural theme you’ll hear about more and more. Being able to deal with change in a codebase is not something trivial and requires some serious thought. Technical solutions are often thought to be either too complex (OSGi) or nonexistent (Jigsaw). This session shows you—in a fun way—that it is actually pretty easy to achieve a modular architecture with OSGi and the right set of tools. The presenters, who authored the book Building Modular Cloud Apps with OSGi, are using these techniques in high-profile production applications on a daily basis. Of course, you’ll witness live coding, and along the way, you’ll find out how to build the next 19-billion-dollar killer app.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBert Ertman\nBert is a Fellow at Luminis.

His current focus is on building modular enterprise applications and the cloud. He believes that modularity and the cloud are the two main challenges we have to deal with to bring technology to the next level, and is working on making this possible for mainstream software development. Today he is working on educational software focussed on personalised learning for high school students in the Netherlands. He is also responsible for pushing technology forward. Luminis strongly believes in open source and all the technology development they are doing happens in the open source community. Paul is an active contributor on projects such as Amdatu, Apache ACE, JBoss Forge and BndTools. \n\nHe has a background as trainer on Java related technology and is a regular speaker on conferences such as JavaOne, Devoxx and JFokus.\nView more trainings by Paul Bakker at https://www.parleys.com/author/paul-bakker-4\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
