description: "Human-machine interaction is no longer the exclusive province of science fiction. The advance of the internet and connected devices has inspired data scientists to create machine-learning applications to extract value from these new forms of data.\n\nSo whatâ€™s the next frontier?\n\nEric Frenkiel explains how to use real-time data as a vehicle for operationalizing machine-learning models by leveraging MemSQL, exploring advanced tools, including TensorFlow, Apache Spark, and Apache Kafka, and compelling use cases demonstrating the power of machine learning to effect positive change.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by MemSQL.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
