title: 'Manik Surtani "The JBoss Data Grid, or Enterprisegrade Infinispan"'
recordingDate: 1358538269
description: 'In an increasing number of disciplines and industries, data volume and complexity has become both a challenge and an opportunity. Application developers are tasked with bridging the gap between challenge and opportunity and one tool in a developer''s belt to help build that bridge is a data grid. Red Hat JBoss Data Grid -- the supportable version of the Infinispan open source project -- is a manageable, scalable, highly available, distributed, in-memory data store that lets you scale horizontally, based on memory and distribution across commodity hardware rather than relational database management system (RDBMS) licenses, database expertise or specialist hardware.'
