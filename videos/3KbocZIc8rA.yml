description: 'Whether you’re a small, medium or large organization focused on service dispatching, sales field management or customer pick-up and deliveries, effectively planning routes and driver schedules to maximize workforce efficiency is a business priority. Traditionally route planning and service dispatching have been done manually, which is stressful, time-consuming, and error-prone – especially when new requests are added to existing routes or when there are road closures due to construction. Our Bing Maps Multi-itinerary Optimization API automates the route optimization process by creating itineraries that support multi-day route planning and multiple driver shifts, as well as time windows, priorities and dwell time at each destination, all while considering the differentiating factor of the predicted traffic on the route and customers’ preferences for reducing costs related to travel time and distance. We are helping customers of all sizes create a modern workplace by offering automated solutions for the most complex route optimization challenges, saving our customers time, money, and much more'
