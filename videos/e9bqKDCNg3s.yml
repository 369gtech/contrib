title: 'Polyglot JVM: Who, Why, When, and How'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433515679
description: "The JVM is such an extensive platform that it is capable of harboring many different languages. Some of these languages are close to Java in syntax and features; others are radically different. The bottom line is that the JVM has recently seen a new revolution: the Polyglot Revolution. Current leaders in the race are Groovy, Scala, Clojure, and JRuby. Upstarts Fantom, Gosu, Kotlin, and Ceylon are trailing behind. Nashorn and Golo have something to say too. What motivates people to try out these languages, especially given that Java is finally receiving a face-lift in JDK8? Come learn what makes these languages tick, whoâ€™s behind such efforts, how you can make use of these languages within a Java project, and more.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAndres Almiray\nAndres is a Java/Groovy developer and a Java Champion with more than 12 years of experience in software design and development.
