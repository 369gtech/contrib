description: "Agile practice is used very successfully in cases of small co-located teams. It becomes more complicated if there are several teams from different locations, vendors etc.\r\nHaving experienced quite a few agile projects, we would like to share some pointers on collaboration with subcontractors as well as clients that may help to experience another agile success story rather than a failure:\r\nContract - what you should not forget to agree on\r\nEducating clients and suppliers - investment in education brings rewards\r\nRegular tracking - know where you are\r\nTransition to support -- the last but not the least important phase in the project\r\nAs a good example we would like to tell about our experience in a project working with Tieto, where Tieto is the prime vendor and eBIT is a subcontractor."
