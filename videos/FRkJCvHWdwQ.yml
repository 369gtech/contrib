description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nThe technical work on C++20 was finished in January 2020, and is now being pushed through ISO certification.\n\nThis presentation gives an overview of (almost) all new features in both the language and the Standard Library. Some more exotic features will be left out. New language features include modules, coroutines, concepts, templated lambdas, constexpr changes, designated initializers, the spaceship operator, string literals as template parameters, feature test macros, conditional explicit, immediate functions, and more.\n\nThe second part of the session discusses the changes to the Standard Library. This includes topics such as ranges, atomic smart pointers, cancellable threads, a synchronization library, calendars, time zones, span, a formatting library, features test macros, and more.\n\nThe material is mostly the same as the \"C++20: What's in it for you?\" session from CppCon 2019, but it has been updated with the final standard. If you want a complete overview of all C++20 features, including references to other more deep-dive sessions at CppCon 2020 on certain topics, then this session is for you.\n\n---\nMarc Gregoire is a software architect from Belgium. He worked 6 years as a consultant for Siemens and Nokia Siemens Networks on critical 2G and 3G software running on Solaris for telecom operators. This required working in international teams stretching from South America and the United States to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Now, Marc is a software architect at Nikon Metrology (www.nikonmetrology.com), a division of Nikon and a leading provider of precision optical instruments, X-ray machines, and metrology solutions for X-ray, CT, and 3D geometric inspection.\n\nHis main expertise is C/C++, specifically Microsoft VC++ and the MFC framework. He has experience in developing C++ programs running 24/7 on Windows and Linux platforms: for example, KNX/EIB home automation software. In addition to C/C++, Marc also likes C#.\n\nSince April 2007, he has received the annual Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) award for his Visual C++ expertise.\n\nMarc is the founder of the Belgian C++ Users Group (www.becpp.org), author of “Professional C++” 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Editions (Wiley/Wrox), co-author of “C++ Standard Library Quick Reference” 1st and 2nd Editions (Apress), technical editor for numerous books for several publishers, and regular speaker at the CppCon C++ conference.
