description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nTesting Kubernetes Clusters - Building Confidence in Your Changes - Guy Templeton & Matteo Ruina, Skyscanner\n\nSpeakers: Matteo Ruina, Guy Templeton\nOperating Kubernetes clusters involves a large number of components, each of which can impact the functionality of clusters. As cluster operators, building confidence in the changes being made is key to allowing frequent updates without compromising on reliability. Running the full Kubernetes conformance test suite every time is generally too slow, and doesn't always cover the functionality users of clusters care about. In this talk, you will learn how Skyscanner uses Kubernetes' existing test codebase along with Sonobuoy and Spinnaker to build a custom test suite. This allows cluster operators to build confidence in changes made to their clusters and their components, focussing on the functionality developers care about. This case study will enable you to make a start in developing your own tests for Kubernetes clusters, understanding the benefits this can bring, as well as the drawbacks you need to beware of."
