language: English
recordingDate: 1598260271
description: "Red team operations involve many skills, the operation requires a lot of monitoring, consolidating and caution. In order to perform red team operations faster, and stealthier without thinking about the infrastructure every team has its’ own habits and standarts. However, there is a problem with those habits and standards;\n- There are tons of tools but no operation management,\n- No aggregation between these tools,\n- When OPSEC fails due to problems above or any other reason, it’s essential to possess the capability of maintaining robust infrastructure which can be recreated if discovered, and more importantly, without any issues upon deployment.\n\nIn this talk, infrastructure challenges we face as a red teamer will be discussed. Along with challenges, a solution will be proposed based on DevOps practices such as;\n- Design your infrastructure based on the standarts and habits which your team has\n- Create playbooks which suits your needs based on your design\n- Create CI pipeline to test and maintain your playbooks"
