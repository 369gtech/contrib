description: "What makes remote meetings, workshops and training so difficult? As I've been teaching great in-the-room trainers, facilitators and coaches to do their thing remotely, it struck me that we can boil it down to three big challenges, the 3 Difficult-Ds: - Distraction - Discomfort - Disconnection (both literal and metaphorical) To make our remote meetings and events brilliant, we need to tackle these.

This session will complement both Lisette Sutherland's sessions, but can also stand alone.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
