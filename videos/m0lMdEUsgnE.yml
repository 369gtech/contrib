description: "The talk from Embedded Fest 2021 ONLINE\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/EmbeddedFest/\nWebsite: https://www.embeddedfest.com\n\nComputer Vision as a technology to test Navigation UI Computer Vision technology can be used to identify, analyze, and compare images which are being changed dynamically. There is simple way to automate testing of UI features by comparing screenshot sizes or color palettes.\nBut, in case of Navigation, images are flexible, could be zoomed in/out, noisy or blurred, replaced or scaled, simple one to one image comparison will not return proper results and such testing will be unstable or even irrelevant.\nAs a solution, this talk provides ideas how to increase accuracy of image comparison and provide reliable automation testing results using OpenCV cross-platform open-source library."
