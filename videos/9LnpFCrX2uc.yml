description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\r\nMarch 30, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Raffael Marty.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIn this two part presentation we will explore log analysis and log visualization. We will have a look at the history of log analysis; where log analysis stands today, what tools are available to process logs, what is working today, and more importantly, what is not working in log analysis. What will the future bring? Do our current approaches hold up under future requirements? We will discuss a number of issues and will try to figure out how we can address them.\r\n\r\nBy looking at various log analysis challenges, we will explore how visualization can help address a number of them; keeping in mind that log visualization is not just a science, but also an art. We will apply a security lens to look at a number of use-cases in the area of security visualization. From there we will discuss what else is needed in the area of visualization, where the challenges lie, and where we should continue putting our research and development efforts.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Info:\r\n\r\nRaffael Marty is COO and co-founder of Loggly Inc., a San Francisco based SaaS company, providing a logging as a service platform.
