title: 'Real-time Twitter analysis with Reactive Extensions - Niall Connaughton'
recordingDate: 1476861491
description: "2016 is a big year in politics, with the recent Australian federal election, Brexit, and the US presidential race to name a few. Live political debates and interviews are drawing large online audiences. This is hugely powerful for politicians, not only because we're watching them - but also because they can watch us.\n\nTwitter allows the public to quickly vent a reaction to a debate they're watching, and the Twitter feed during these debates can be a goldmine. The Reactive Extensions (Rx) framework is a powerful tool for working with real-time data, and it gives us some simple ways to see trends and patterns playing out as we watch.\n\nThis talk will look at using Rx with recent election Twitter feeds to draw out bigger pictures of user engagement and hotly discussed issues. From trolls to LOLs, it's a bumpy ride with social media. But there's method in the madness, and these approaches can be applied anywhere you have data on the move."
