description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v\n\nGet involved in the next Code Sync conference - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nELIXIR MEETS ERLANG IN BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPMENT\nby Ulf Wiger\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Aeternity blockchain was developed in Erlang, by something of an All-Star team, and made a mark as one of the most productive development teams in the business. Unfortunately, Core development outpaced SDK and tool development by a fairly wide margin, and the core team found itself lacking direct user feedback. One approach to address this was to bring onboard a talented Elixir developer, Aleksandar Filipov, as a one-man prototyping team and virtual user to the State Channels team. In this talk, we will describe the reasons for augmenting an Erlang project with Elixir, and present some of the results.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/ulf-wiger/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ULF WIGER\n\n\nUlf Wiger has been using Erlang since 1992, bought the first-ever commercial license in 1993 and has been a full-time Erlang dev since 1996. While at Ericsson, he became something of an Erlang ambassador, speaking about the AXD 301 ATM Switch/Media Gateway and about how Erlang works in large industrial projects. After leaving Ericsson, Ulf joined Erlang Solutions as CTO. He then entered the Connected Device market first via the startup Feuerlabs, then as a freelance contractor to Jaguar Land Rover, and Lead Developer of GENIVI’s Remote Vehicle Interaction component. Ulf joined the Aeternity Core Team in 2017 and is now busy exploring and developing blockchain technology. In the Open Source arena, Ulf is perhaps best known for components like Gproc, Jobs, and Exometer. In his spare time, Ulf doubles as an opera singer and dabbles in politics.\n\nMore on Ulf Wiger: https://codesync.global/speaker/ulf-wiger/\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ALEKSANDAR FILIPOV\nEmbedded programmer gone functional\n\nAleksandar has been all over, going from real time embedded OS:e where he worked with hardware and matching OpenGL ES drivers all the way to automotive electrical systems and also a few years with end user apps including android apps for banking. Today heâ€™s a big fan of functional programming, and is a driver for the eternityâ€™s â€œchannel servicesâ€ which is a reference framework showcasing aeternityâ€™s unique state channels. He's also an fp evangelist in the automotive space where he maintains Signalbroker.\n\nlinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandar-filipov-a806303/\nhttps://github.com/volvo-cars/signalbroker-server/Â \nhttps://github.com/aeternity/ae-channel-service/\n\nMore on Aleksandar Filipov: https://codesync.global/speaker/aleksandar-filipov/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM V 2020\nCode BEAM V is powered by Code Sync.
