title: 'JeremyBytes - C# Delegates - Part 3: Action & Multicast Delegates'
recordingDate: 1418270238
description: 'Delegates are an important feature of .NET. They allow us to pass methods as parameters to other methods (among other things). In this video, we''ll use the built-in "Action" delegate. Along the way, we''ll see how multicast delegates allow us to run multiple methods by invoking a single delegate variable.
