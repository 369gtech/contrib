title: 'Rails PR Code Review with Kasper Timm Hansen'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635853697
description: "► Check out https://gorails.com for Pro episodes and more!\n► SaaS business template for Ruby on Rails with built-in features like Payments, Teams, and much more: https://jumpstartrails.com\n► Ruby on Rails hosting with Hatchbox.io: https://hatchbox.io\n► Learn how to add Stripe Payments (with SCA support!) with Ruby on Rails: https://courses.gorails.com/payments-with-rails-master-class\n\nKasper and I sat down to walk through a Pull Request on Rails and review it. Rails 7 is making redirects safer by default and this PR helps make that functionality available to developers. We walk through the design and naming process he uses to determine how this functionality should fit into Rails and what should be exposed as part of the public API."
