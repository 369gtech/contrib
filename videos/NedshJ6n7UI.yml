language: French
recordingDate: 1578392828
description: "üó£ Liliia Abdulina\n\nHave you heard of the code-sharing feature in Kotlin, accompanied with ‚ÄúWrite once, run everywhere‚Äù slogan? Among its users not only libraries and frameworks authors; there are some projects which have already adopted multiplatform for production. Their applications, written in Kotlin for both iOS and Android, are published in stores. With this talk, you‚Äôll get a brief overview of the evolution of multiplatform technology in Kotlin, concerning the tasks it‚Äôs evolved to solve. How it was and how it is expected to be; what has changed and which tasks can be already solved with it. What are the facilities right now and which real projects already use multiplatform?"
