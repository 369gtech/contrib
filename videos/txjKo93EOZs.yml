description: "The Walking Dead - A Survival Guide to Resilient Reactive Applications\n\nThe more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war\"\" - the US marines certainly know how to deal with the unexpected. Building resilient distributed applications is not an easy task and you better prepare for failure during development. In this talk you will learn how to build event-driven applications that are resilient from the bottom up, allowing you to deal with remote services that are failing, slow or misbehaving. Even if you are just consuming data from a database over the network, this talk is for you.\n\nThe talk introduces different stability patterns and showcases them with real code, utilizing the fantastic RxJava and Hystrix libraries. Finally, you will see a resilient application in action, performing thousands of queries against a Couchbase Server 3.0 cluster while withstanding node failures and latency spikes."
