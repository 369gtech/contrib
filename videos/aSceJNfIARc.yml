description: "Who said games arenâ€™t educational? Learning a new language on your own is never easy, and you often find yourself stuck and frustrated. In this session I will talk about how through developing a simple 2D game I was able to wrap my imperative mind around a functional programming language and learn Clojure. Let me show you how your favorite arcade game can be an excellent tool to master a new programming language.\n\nAbout: Mey Beisaron, Backend Developer, Appsflyer\n\nMey is a public speaker, a backend developer and a Software Engineer. When she is not spending her weekends at hackathons, she experiments with algorithms or learns languages such as Russian, French & Clojure. Mey is also a sworn Star Wars fan. May the force be with you!"
