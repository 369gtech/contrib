title: 'The New Kid on the Block: Spring Data JDBC'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538586955
description: "Spring Data is mostly known as a way to create Repositories as described in Domain Driven Design (DDD) for persistence technologies like JPA, MongoDB, Redis, and others. We now support another technology: JDBC. Spring Data JDBC is an opinionated library for persisting your data to a relational database. This talk will describe the current state of Spring Data JDBC, its features and the underlying design decisions, especially how the Spring Data team attempts to walk the tightrope of offering a DDD-based API and at the same time allow precise control of each and every SQL statement issued to the database. After this talk, the audience will be able to make a well-grounded decision if Spring Data JDBC is worth to look into for their specific challenges and what to expect from it.\n\nSpeaker:\nJens Schauder\nStaff Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
