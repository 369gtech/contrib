description: "Erlang User Conference 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2013/talks \n\nBuilding Releases is harder then it needs to be. There is already so much useful metadata in any Erlang release that it should be a simple one line command to create almost any Release. With Relcool it is. Providing both a simple command line and intuitive integration with Rebar, Relx makes the standard Releases simple and hard Releases easy."
