description: "Speaker: Paul Dragoonis (@dr4goonis)\n\nThis talk covers the lessons learned on my journey of migrating small and large scale PHP platforms from PHP5 to PHP7. I will go into detail on preparing & analysing your current system to identify how ready your code is for the upgrade. Then I will show how to transition your local environment to PHP7 for testing and benchmarking. Lastly I will give tips and tricks on performing real-time deployments when upgrading your production infrastructure\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nPaul, from Scotland, is passionate about software quality, architecture and continuous delivery.
