description: "Don't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nSmooth Operator - A Rough Guide to Kubernetes Operators - Olive Power, VMware \n\nKubernetes Operators are key to the automation of complex containerised applications. They facilitate the encoding of post deployment configuration information into Kubernetes primitives. This means operational tasks like installation and configuration (day 1), update, reconfiguration and failover (day 2), can exist as software inside Kubernetes, with integration into the Kubernetes API. This integration makes these applications Kubernetes-native. In this talk we will discuss the genesis and evolution of Kubernetes Operators. In addition, we will discuss their use in some common complex applications being orchestrated by Kubernetes today. Finally, we will touch on the process of building an Operator and how that process pathway looks. Kubernetes Operators take the rough edges off a complex application, enabling smooth automation!"
