title: 'Using Java CompletionStage in Asynchronous Programming'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540508403
description: "Kuassi Mensah, Director, Product Management, Oracle\nDouglas Surber, CMTS, Oracle\n\nJava 8 introduced java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage and its concrete implementation, CompletableFuture. These types represent the notion of a monad, a design pattern useful in constructing asynchronous programs, among many other uses. This session demonstrates the use of CompletionStage in asynchronous code, using examples based on ADBA (the proposed Asynchronous Database Access standard) and AoJ (ADBA over JDBC). The session includes a live demo of ADBA."
