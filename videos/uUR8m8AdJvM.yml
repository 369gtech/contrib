description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nTesting Microservices\n\nThe microservice architecture has been growing momentum over the past few years, but once you've started down the microservice path how do you make sure that your applications are still fully tested? This session will give an overview of the trials and tribulations when testing microservices. It will cover the different testing types that are required, using a sample java-based microservice to highlight the reasons for the requirements. It will also reference this sample microservice as an example of some of the testing techniques that can be used. These techniques will include testing microservices with a Gradle or Maven build system and using testing tools such as JUnit.\n\nKatherine Stanley, IBM\n\nKatherine joined IBM in September 2014 on the Graduate scheme as a software developer for WAS Liberty. She participated in the IBM Extreme Blue internship programme in 2012 and graduated from Durham University with a Masters degree in Mathematics in 2014. Since joining IBM she has worked to deliver both product and test code for WAS Liberty and more recently has produced articles and samples around creating microservices using WAS Liberty."
