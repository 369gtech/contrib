description: "RubyConf 2018 - ROM: the final frontier of mruby by Masayoshi Takahashi and Yurie Yamane\n\nMemory is limited resource of physical devices. Although mruby is smaller than MRI, it’s not small enough for cheap and easily avaiable devices. But there is another frontier: ROM. Many boards has larger Flash ROM than RAM. However, Ruby is too dynamic to put into ROM just as it is. How can we use ROM to implement classes of Ruby, and how small can we make mruby? It’s a thirty-minutes mission to explore strange new worlds."
