description: "Changing Old Habits: Meetup’s Path to SRE\n\nRich Hsieh, Core Engineering Manager at Meetup\n\nBack in July 2016, I asked myself the question, “What would an SRE team look like at Meetup?” Given the opportunity to try SRE at Meetup, I came up with a 6 month roadmap to change Meetup’s current processes. Out of this came new approaches to incident escalation, postmortems and playbooks.\n\nOver the course of 6 months, I found unexpected allies in the company, improved broken processes and made strides toward a culture of learning, transparency and documentation -- changing old habits for the better.\n\nIf you’re looking to start SRE at your company or want to learn how small tweaks can lead to big wins, come hear how I created a pilot program of SRE at Meetup. I will go over a month-by-month breakdown of the SRE team’s tasks, including getting buy-in from leadership, rallying support from stakeholders, and identifying areas of impact, sharing anecdotes along the way.\n\nOf course, this is just the beginning. SRE at Meetup is by no means near it’s full potential and there are still some big problems to address, but hopefully these steps will inspire you and your team to get on the right track.\n\nView the SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
