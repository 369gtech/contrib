title: 'Debunking Myths About the Deep Links'
language: English
recordingDate: 1535559147
description: "\"Imagine a Web without URLs. That's how mobile apps world looks like without deep links.\" - VentureBeat. According to AppSight data, only 41% of top Android apps have deep links implemented. Why? It is not obvious how you can leverage them beyond basic cases and implementation is not as transparent as documentation states. In the first part of the talk, Vitaliy will show how you can use deep links to create an excellent on boarding experience, how to get more organic installs with app indexing and referral campaigns, how to authenticate users with no authentication and more. In the second part, we will talk about the inconsistency in the deep links implementation on Android and iOS, technical limitations of App Links, Universal Links, custom schemas and what are the missing parts of the deep linking ecosystem that you will have to build on your own. Do not expect step by step implementation guide, this part contains learnings you can not find in the documentation from 4 years of experience in building deep links.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDCBerlin 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nVitaliy Zasadny\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP9IvR9IvYA"
