description: 'espite the recent (over)flow of log processing tools logs are still highly problematic – they can clog your servers and bring your production down, they are hard to read and parse, and oh too often they miss out the key data you need but contain 3 billion lines of B.S. While log pipelines can help to some extent their value is limited when the source of data is low quality – and this talk is all about improving the quality of your logs. This talk will show various features of Log4j 1/2 and Logback, introduce tricks to get the information you want (and only the information you want) and explain how to do this in way that is truly ‘production grade’.'
