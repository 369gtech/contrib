title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode IoT Village - t1v0  - In Search of the Perfect UPnP Tool'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597627446
description: 'While researching UPnP vulnerabilities I became frustrated with the currently available UPnP tools. Some devices that I knew had UPnP just weren''t found with any of the tools I tried. Out of this frustration, came a new and improved BHunter extension for Burp Suite. In this lightning talk I''ll go over some of the issues I found and the improvements made to it, and I''ll give a demo of the tool in action.'
