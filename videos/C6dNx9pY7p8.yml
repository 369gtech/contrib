description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract:\nRust is a language with a new vision of systems programming. It gives you low-level control and predictability but also provides the safety and ergonomics of languages like Scala. The secret sauce is Rust's core notion of \"ownership\", which enables:\n\n- Memory safety without garbage collection.\n- Concurrency without data races.\n- Abstraction without overhead.\n\nIn this talk, I'll explain ownership and show how Rust uses it to guarantee thread safety, amongst other things. I'll say a bit about integrating Rust code with other languages. And I'll also cover some of the lessons the Rust community has learned in how to do open, consensus-driven language evolution, so that we also achieve:\n\n- Stability without stagnation."
