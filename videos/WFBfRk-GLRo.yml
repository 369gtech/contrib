Despite the importance of validating this, there are very few examples or frameworks for automating testing of mobile games, forcing game developers to resort to manual testing that doesn’t scale to the extent that gaming companies would need to cover their global market. One main reason is the unique nature of games as mobile apps because they are accessing the screen directly and bypassing all UI services provided by the OS and rendering most test automation frameworks useless since traditional objects are not exposed.\n\nLuckily there are ways to use standard mobile test automation frameworks to drive test automation on real mobile devices for games by using some creativity and publically available libraries. In his presentation, Jouko Kaasila from Testdroid will discuss three different approaches with real world examples and some sample code."
