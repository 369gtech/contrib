description: "Software is not just eating the world, it’s eating networking as well.  Staying at the forefront of the fast-paced telecom networking segment means delivering better software faster than the competition. But when builds and tests take hours – or days – how do you remain agile and empower your developers?\n\nLearn how a continual focus on engineer job satisfaction and productivity at Cisco, accompanied by tooling from Electric Cloud, allowed Cisco to dramatically accelerate builds and tests to\n- cut CI times from hours to minutes, \n- amplify and accelerate critical feedback loops\n- and help Cisco to maintain it’s position as a segment leader."
