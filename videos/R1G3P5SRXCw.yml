description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nWriting class templates and functions accepting a variable number of arguments has been a burden before C++11. With variadic templates, both class templates with a variable number of arguments as well as functions can be formulated much easier and more type safe way.\n\nNevertheless, the authoring of variadic templates can be challenging for the uninitiated. Even the interpretation of variadic template code can be a problem, as Olve Maudal's famous pub quiz shows.\n\nThis session will build up understanding and the ability to use and author variadic template functions and variadic template classes from easy examples up to more complicated applications such as employing std::forward correctly, std::integer_sequence and other upcoming language features such as a template UDL operator that bridges the gap between string literals and std::integer_sequence.\n\nUnderstanding pack expansion, sizeof... and other hard to get on first sight issues are my goal. In the end you should have seen guidelines that help you avoid the template instantiation trap from the pub quiz and correct usage of std::forward in your variadic templates.\n— \nProf. Peter Sommerlad is director of IFS Institute for Software at FHO HSR Rapperswil where he inspired the C++ IDE Cevelop. Peter is co-author of the books POSA Vol.1 and Security Patterns. His goal is to make software simpler by Decremental Development: Refactoring software down to 10% its size with better architecture, testability and quality and functionality. Peter is a member of the C++ standardization committee, ACCU, ACM, IEEE Computer Society.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
