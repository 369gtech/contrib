Analyzers are specified as a child of the fieldType element in the schema.xml \nconfiguration file that can be found in the solr/conf directory, or wherever solrconfig.xml is located.In normal usage, only fields of type solr.TextField will specify an analyzer. The simplest way to configure an analyzer is with a single analyzer element whose class attribute is a fully qualified Java class name. \nWatch this video to know more about analyzer and its types.\n\n\nRelated post:\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/apache-solr-shedding-some-light/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=solr-analyzer  \n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/solr19thoct/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=solr-analyzer  \n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/solr30thoct/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=solr-analyzer\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning \nenvironment, accessible from any part of the world.
