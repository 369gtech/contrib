description: "by Nicolas Frankel\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/securing_jvm.webm\n\n\nConsider a Java application in a private banking system. A new network\nadministrator is hired, and while going around, he notices that the app is\nmaking network calls to an unknown external endpoint. After some\ninvestigation, it’s found that this app has been sending for years\nconfidential data to a competitor (or a state, or hackers, whatever). This\nis awkward. Especially since it could have been avoided. \n\nCode reviews are good to improve the hardening of an application, but what\nif the malicious code was planted purposely? Some code buried in a commit\ncould extract code from binary content, compile it on the fly, and then\nexecute the code in the same JVM run… By default, the JVM is not secured!\nSecuring the JVM for a non-trivial application is complex and\ntime-consuming but the risks of not securing it could be disastrous. In\nthis talk, I’ll show some of the things you could do in an unsecured JVM.\nI’ll also explain the basics of securing it, and finally demo a working\nprocess on how to do it. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:50:00+01"
