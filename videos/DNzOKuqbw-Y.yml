description: "With the growth of connected “things”, industries are presented with huge opportunities to leverage sensor data to improve their operations, products and services. With the proliferation of these devices, competitive advantages will develop from appropriate leveraging of the deluge of data. From connected appliances to jet engines, industries are already undergoing massive transformations. Critical to success is the ability to not only collect data from sensors, but to also leverage big data technologies and data science expertise to extract actionable insights from the data.\n\nIt is critical to be able to model degradation of a machine to prevent catastrophic events and adjust maintenance scheduling. This is true in industries including oil and gas, transportation and even consumer products.\nIn this latest DSC webinar, the Pivotal Data Science team will present a data-driven approach to detecting and tracking jet-engine degradation using simulated sensor data. In particular we will focus on (1) data integration and cleansing, (2) transformation of time series data from sensors into meaningful features for modeling and (3) the algorithms used to build models to identify engine degradation patterns.\n\nSpeakers:\nSarah Aerni, Principal Data Scientist -- Pivotal\nApril Song, Principal Data Scientist -- Pivotal\nHosted by: Bill Vorhies, Editorial Director -- Data Science Central"
