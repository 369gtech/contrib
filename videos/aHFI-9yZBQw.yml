When combining it with software engineering practices it becomes a powerful tool in speeding up the build and release work done by DevOps teams.\nTemplates facilitate the creation of scalable, parameterized pipelines that can be unit tested and ensure pipeline immutability while remaining a consistent and transparent single source of truth.\nThe ING DevOps engineering team has created a way to build and deploy JVM applications in the cloud to be consumed by multiple teams from the entire tribe and more by using templates developed in Azure DevOps with the goal to automate a pipeline end to end, from code to runtime.\nTo achieve this, they wrote code to automate everything and also created a system to manage these pipelines. Some other objectives they set for themselves were:\n• maintenance of the pipeline must be low\n• the pipeline must have a versioning in place as to not break consumers pipelines when we update it\n• it must be flexible, for different languages and applications\n• any of their colleagues should [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n04:12 Agenda\n05:07 Pipeline problems & solutions\n10:26 Challenges of using templates: modularity & flexibility\n16:18 Challenges of using templates: quality & maintainability\n22:52 Challenges of using templates: Azure DevOps learning curve\n27:12 Final thoughts\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/february-2021/sessions/1687/kickstarting-your-azure-pipeline-with-templates\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Azure #AzurePipeline #CI #CICD #CD #ContinuousIntegration #ContinuousDelivery #DevOps #ING #Modularity #Flexibility\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
