In this screencast I'm starting WebSphere, WebLogic, Payara Server (patched GlassFish), WildFly, TomEE, nano (https://github.com/AdamBien/nano) and comparing the memory consumption of the entire docker image.\n\nSee you at: http://airhacks.com, http://airhacks.io and particularly at: http://javaeemicro.services"
