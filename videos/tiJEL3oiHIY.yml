description: "Reactive and asynchronous programming is the latest hype for Web development.  Why block a thread on a database query when the CPU could be looking at the next one? Although asynchronous programming can help improve total throughput on a multicore machine, the current state of the art lacks common patterns for how to define an asynchronous flow. Thatâ€™s all changed with JEP 155 and the new CompletableFuture in JDK8. This session covers the new patterns in asynchronous programming, from joining together a series of asynchronous operations to chaining a pipeline of asynchronous tasks. It presents a few core abstractions from functional programming that help define asynchronous workflow.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJosh Suereth\nJosh Suereth is a Senior Software Engineer at Typesafe and the author of \nView more trainings by Josh Suereth at https://www.parleys.com/author/josh-suereth\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
