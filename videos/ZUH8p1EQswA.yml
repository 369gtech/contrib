description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nAs a community we've tried many different ways to express, propagate and handle error conditions in our code over the years. Each seem to have different trade-offs, with none being perfect in all cases.\n\nThis presentation is the follow-up to my earlier talk, \"Option(al) Is Not a Failure\", where I surveyed existing error-handling approaches and score them against each other, leading up to the new proposal, p0709, \"Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions\".\n\nWe'll summarise some of that background so we're all on the same page, but in this talk we're going to dig into the proposal in more depth - and look at the supporting proposals, p1028 (std::error) and p1029 ([[move relocates]]) and others. We'll also comment similar mechanisms in other languages, notably Swift, to get an idea of how it might work out in practice.\n— \nPhil Nash\nDeveloper Advocate, JetBrains\nDeveloper Advocate at JetBrains, author of Catch/Catch2, co-host of cpp.chat, host of C++ London, chair and organiser of C++ on Sea.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
