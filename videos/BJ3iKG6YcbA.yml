description: "Pricing is hard: set your price too high, and nobody will buy from you. Set it too low, and you won’t cover the costs to service your customers. Startups need to “discover” their ideal price, a process few founders are comfortable with.\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn about the economics of pricing, you’ll be presented with 11 different pricing methods, we’ll discuss freemium vs. premium and give you tons of practical pricing advice for your startup."
