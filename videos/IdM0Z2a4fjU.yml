description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nC++20 introduced a nice formatting library with std::format(). This session will explain what the formatting library provides, how to use all of its functionality, and most importantly, how you can customize it so that you can use formatting strings that include your very own custom types and custom formatting parameters, and of course, how to handle errors.\n\n---\nMarc Gregoire is a software architect from Belgium. He worked 6 years as a consultant for Siemens and Nokia Siemens Networks on critical 2G and 3G software running on Solaris for telecom operators. This required working in international teams stretching from South America and the United States to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Now, Marc is a software architect at Nikon Metrology (www.nikonmetrology.com), a division of Nikon and a leading provider of precision optical instruments, X-ray machines, and metrology solutions for X-ray, CT, and 3D geometric inspection.\n\nHis main expertise is C/C++, specifically Microsoft VC++ and the MFC framework. He has experience in developing C++ programs running 24/7 on Windows and Linux platforms: for example, KNX/EIB home automation software. In addition to C/C++, Marc also likes C#.\n\nSince April 2007, he has received the annual Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) award for his Visual C++ expertise.\n\nMarc is the founder of the Belgian C++ Users Group (www.becpp.org), author of “Professional C++” 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Editions (Wiley/Wrox), co-author of “C++ Standard Library Quick Reference” 1st and 2nd Editions (Apress), technical editor for numerous books for several publishers, and regular speaker at the CppCon C++ conference.
