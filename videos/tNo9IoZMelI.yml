description: "Got an app that makes bookings, such as for dining, travel, concerts or other events? Enhance your usersâ€™ experience by inserting events into their calendars. The trouble with apps today is that users STILL have to do it themselves even if your app books the reservations. \n\nTake a load off their shoulders & have your app do it. It's easier than you think, and your users will be delighted: \"Yay! I don't have to do it!\" Bring about a higher rate of engagement and delight your users so they'll always bring up your app instead of the competition's.\n\nThe Launchpad Online series is a set of videos geared to get you, your idea, your startup, or your enterprise onboard building with Google tools and APIs.
