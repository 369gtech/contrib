title: 'Joel Jacobson - Data Types for Eventually Consistent Databases'
recordingDate: 1390838364
description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nEventually Consistent Databases, like Riak, buy you a lot: highly available, simple scaling, geo-replication: but the developer pays the price, with little to no guarantees, and only folklore for data modelling. This talk describes one weapon in the developers armoury: CRDTs. A CRDT is Data Type that converges to a single, deterministic value no matter how many replicas are modified concurrently. CRDTs offer a principled approach to Eventually Consistent data modelling, and greatly simplify the task of programming applications that use Eventually Consistent Databases.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Bring state based CRDTs to the attention of developers;\n\n- Describe the value of CRDTs;\n\n- Be realistic about their limitations."
