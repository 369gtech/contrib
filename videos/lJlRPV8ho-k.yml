title: 'Spring Experiments with Dr. David Syer'

recordingDate: 1592414346
description: "More often than not Spring moves forwards by reacting to demand, but sometimes it also tries to move first into a new area, anticipating demand in the community. In both cases, though, there are usually experimental stages, sometimes for quite long periods.\n\nThis has always been the case, but the Spring team has recently created a special place for those experiments to happen, and that gives us a chance to spy on what is going on. This talk will be taking a look at some of the current experiments, as well as reviewing some older ones, successful and unsuccessful.\n\n---\n\nFounder of Spring Cloud, Spring Boot, Spring Batch, and an active contributor to Spring Integration, Spring Framework, Spring AMQP, Spring Security."
