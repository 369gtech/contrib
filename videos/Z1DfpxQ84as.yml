description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nPresenter: Rob Winch\nCore Spring Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/hands-on-spring-security-41\n\nIt can be complicated learning the ins and outs of any technology stack. When this complexity is compounded by needing to understand how to secure our applications, it can be daunting.\n\nIn this talk we will discuss how to rapidly and correctly apply Spring Security to an existing application. Along the way we will demo security exploits and see how to mitigate them, answer frequently asked questions, and learn established best practices.\n\nWhether you are new to Spring Security or a seasoned Spring Security user, this presentation is a must."
