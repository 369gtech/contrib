description: "Speaker: Chen Hui Jing @hj_chen\n\nDo you cringe when you have to design and build layouts on the web? Do you get frustrated when things never go where you want them to on your page?\nCreating custom layouts is not a trivial task, no matter what your sales rep or account manager says. Fortunately, browsers now support a plethora of CSS properties that make building creative layouts much less painful than before.\nThis workshop will cover a range of techniques for building cutting-edge web layouts with fallbacks for older browsers as well. It will be a practical workshop with code examples you can refer to for your future projects.\n\nHui Jing is a self-taught designer and developer with an inordinate love for CSS. Reducing lines of code in her web projects makes her extremely happy. She used to play basketball full-time and launched her web career during downtime between training sessions.\n\nEvent Page: https://2018.jsconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: Zion Ng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/eoMX/"
