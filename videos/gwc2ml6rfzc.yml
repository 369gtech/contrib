description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nFaruk Ates - Founder of four53\n\nABSTRACT\nMaking any product is an exciting as well as challenging endeavor, especially in technology and software. As humans we are prone to let our creativity run free — but freedom is not always the best solution to solving problems. Sometimes we need constraints more than anything else to truly ignite our creativity.\n\nIn his session, Faruk will talk about the values and lessons learned from imposing (sometimes arbitrary) constraints on projects, applied against UI, software, and API design.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
