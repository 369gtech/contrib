description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\n基于Volcano的离在线业务混部技术探索 | Exploration About Mixing Technology of Online Services and Offline Jobs Based on Volcano - Leibo Wang & Lei Wu, Huawei\n\n为了保证服务SLA，集群需要大量冗余资源，这将导致集群资源利用率低下，资源浪费严重。为了提高资源利用率，Volcano将在线服务和离线批处理作业混合在同一集群上。kubelet使调度器感知到已分配资源和实际已有资源量的差距。Volcano还提供了资源超卖能力，可将已分配给低优先级作业的空闲资源加以复用。在操作系统维度，Volcano还通过cgroup提供任务隔离，以确保关键的在线服务QoS。\n\nTo ensure service SLA, a large number of redundant resources are required which resulting in low resource utilization and serious resource waste. To improve resource utilization, Volcano mix online service and batch jobs on the same cluster. And kubelet makes the scheduler aware of the gap between resource allocation and utilization. Volcano also provides resource oversubscription which is reserved but unused resource to low priority batch jobs. On the OS level, it also provides task isolation by CGroups to ensure critical online services QoS."
