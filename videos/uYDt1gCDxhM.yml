C++ is a complicated language full of arcane rules and complicated tangents - learn how it's all tied together in this basic model of locations, objects, and values.\n— \nNicole Mazzuca: None\n\nNicole Mazzuca is a C++ and Rust programmer who is very interested in object models - she is helping to write the Rust object model, and as such has studied other object models heavily, especially C++'s.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
