title: 'Managing Storage with a File System'
recordingDate: 1484714283
description: "Keith Packard\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/109/\nTraditional Linux storage is built using several block layers and\r\nadding a file system on top. You can construct a block device out of a\r\nfile system using the loop driver, but that interface loses some key\r\nfunctionality present in the block layer, most importantly the DAX\r\ninterfaces.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, we can squash some of the the loop driver\r\nfunctionality into a file system and present both file system\r\ninterfaces as well as block device interfaces from the same driver.\r\n\r\nThis provides a uniform storage management interface where a single\r\n'wholesale' file system aggregates a set of the available storage into\r\na single logical store which can then be arbitrarily dis-aggregated\r\ninto individual storage volumes which can then be used as traditional\r\nblock devices for 'retail' file systems within the host OS or\r\npassed to virtual machines for storage in that environment.\r\n\r\nThis technique is being used within The Machine, a project within\r\nHewlett Packard Enterprise, to provide convenient management of a pool\r\nof fabric attached memory shared among many Linux instances.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will show how the wholesale file system is managed\r\nand how the block layer is exported from it. Additional details about\r\nhow storage locality is controlled using extended attributes will be\r\nincluded."
