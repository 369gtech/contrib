description: "Serverless architectures have been touted as the next evolution of cloud-hosted software. Indeed, the promise of resiliency and scalability without the need for infrastructure management sounds too good to be true!\nBut what exactly does a serverless architecture look like? And what are the trade-offs to weigh up when considering using one on your next project?This presentation will give an introduction to the world of serverless architectures. Weâ€™ll look at their benefits and drawbacks, the existing tooling and service ecosystems, as well as learnings taken from our usage of AWS Lambda and API Gateway on a recent project."
