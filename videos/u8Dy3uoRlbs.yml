title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Accessibility as a Business Proposition'
recordingDate: 1506600826
description: "Being just the next ‘web specialist’ or the ‘best system integrator’ alone doesn’t convince clients to pick you as their development partner. Finding a small niche and excelling in it does: it can really make you stand out of the competition.\n\nAmsterdam-based LimoenGroen distinguishes itself from its competitors by offering ‘sustainable websites’. Sustainable websites deliver business value over a long period of time and at the same time reduce the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership). An important part of our process is that we make our websites as accessible as possible out-of-the-box.\n\nUnfortunately not all clients understand the added value of accessibility. Therefore we pitch accessibility as a way to reach a wider audience and have a better SEO-optimized website instead.\n\nBaris Wanschers (BarisW), LimoenGroen-founder and Drupal evangelist, presents how his company stands out from the crowd by selecting a niche, and how to sell it. This is a story about passion, believe and common sense.\n\nNo technical knowledge is required. Basic HTML skills help to understand the examples given, but it is not necessary.\n\nAfter attending this session, attendees know:\n\nhow to explain to clients why it is important to focus on accessibility;\nhow to let them pay for the extra hours needed, since it lowers the Total Cost of Ownership;\nunderstand the basic concept of stacked development (create proper HTML markup before adding interaction)."
