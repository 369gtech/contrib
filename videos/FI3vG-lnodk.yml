title: 'Egor Bogatov. How RyuJIT compiles a function'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619617893
description: "JIT in CLR has long been a black box due to the closed nature of its code and little information available about its inner workings. After the introduction of .NET Core it has become an open book so everyone can get a shot at improving it or adding new optimizations. In the presentation Egor will share the fundamental principles of his work with different functions as examples. He will tell how you can go ears deep into hardcore, taking you down the road of execution from C# code to machine code.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/EIe_htL4lD4p1g\n\nDotFest: https://2020.dotfest.ru/lecture/2"
