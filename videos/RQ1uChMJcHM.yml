description: 'Advertising-driven platforms have been coming under increased scrutiny recently for how they balance their revenue needs against the best interests of their users and their communities. On the flipside, online businesses have often struggled to get users to pay for their content and services. That could be becoming easier now though, thanks to up-and-coming Web Payment APIs. This talk will cover the Payment Request API which can provide a simple and fast checkout experience. It will also share the latest options for micropayments - including Brave’s Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) - and how companies like Medium are rethinking the UX of subscriptions. Could the latest standards help us to be less reliant on advertising and focus more on our users?'
