description: "Microsoft is in the middle of moving the majority of its own product development onto Git. Yes, that Microsoft. From small codebase to large. Over 15k developers are already using Git today, with 10â€™s of thousands yet to come. The journey to get there has been an interesting one, full of ups and downs. Saeed will discuss Microsoft's journey and the challenges along the way, both social and technical.\n\nSaeed is on the Visual Studio Team Services team at Microsoft, focused on helping some very large teams within Microsoft migrate to Git. Among other things, this means solving some hard scale problems in Git, which is a great source of fun. He also enjoys rock climbing, road biking, and music.\n\nAbout Git Merge:\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content, user case studies and training workshops for Git users of all levels.\n\nVisit: http://git-merge.com/"
