description: "Negativity surrounds the concept of existing code. This negativity is baked into the language we use. We work on 'legacy projects', 'dirt field projects', 'rescue projects', 'antiquated projects', 'ancient projects'. I'd like to use the construction metaphor to look at these projects in a different light. I've been inspired by the TV program, 'This Old House'. I think the care and attention that's given existing structures while making them do more for their inhabitants is a great model for how we can treat our software projects. This talk isn't JavaScript specific; it's themes and guidance will apply to anyone who's worked on a project that someone else left behind or anyone who is likely to do so in the future.\n\nScott Ford presents. Scott is the Founder and Chief Code Whisperer at Corgibytes, a software consultancy whose mission is to maintain and improve the worldâ€™s existing codebases. Scott specializes and thrives on breathing new life into existing projects"
