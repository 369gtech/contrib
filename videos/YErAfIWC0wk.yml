description: "PyCon Belarus 2019, Minsk\nPython Track \n\nEvolution of dependency management – Nikita Grishko\nIf you use Python, you most probably use virtual environments and pip to install packages. You may have requirements.txt with all dependencies; you may even have two of them, for example, requirements-dev.txt. But what if I tell you that this good old approach has apparent problems, and there is more than one instrument that tries to solve these issues? \nMy speech addresses the existing problems in managing dependencies. I will tell you as well on how the developers tried and still try to solve these issues, and we will take a closer look at a set of tools: pip-tools, pipenv, flit, poetry. Together we will decide if these instruments worth a shot, or is it just a trivial train of madness it's better to avoid. \n\nPresentation: https://github.com/Gr1N/talks/raw/master/2019-02-16_evolution-of-dependency-management/slides.pdf\n\nVideo Partner – Wargaming (https://wargaming.com/ru/)"
