description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/how-to-write-ui-tests-from-a-to-z/\n\nI am gonna show how to write UI tests from scratch, from A to Z. Itâ€™s gonna be a live demo, no slides, just hardcode. I would like to cover all aspects writing UI tests, including: infrastructure set up, test data management, complex code coverage, testing strategy, role of UI tests in automation, etc.\n\nTechnologies: Java, Spring Boot, React, Selenide, Docker, Docker Compose, TestContainers, Jenkins.\n\nIn overall, it would be just another story. Everyone will be able to take the code away. If you need to get an example how to start writing UI tests this talk would be way useful."
