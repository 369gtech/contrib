title: 'Localization with NLP: Global Empire-Building For Fun & Profit'
recordingDate: 1494276186
description: 'In order to establish a user base across the globe, a product needs to support a variety of locales. The challenge with supporting multiple locales is the maintenance and generation of localized strings, which are deeply integrated into many facets of a product. To address these challenges at Qordoba, we’re using highly scalable technologies and natural language processing (NLP) to automate the process. Specifically, we need to generate high-quality translations in many different languages and make them available in real-time across platforms, e.g. mobile, print, and web. The combination of Docker & various open source tools such as Scala, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra, & Apache PredictionIO (incubating) provides structure for a scalable localization platform with machine learning at its core. In this talk, we describe the techniques we’re using to provide: * Continuous deployment of localized strings * Live syncing across platforms (mobile, web, photoshop, sketch, help desk, etc.) * Content generation for any locale * Emotional response We will also share our architecture for handling billions of localized strings in many different languages. We talk about our use of Docker for the following purposes: * Local development * Continuous integration & continuous delivery * Auto-scaling for training, cross-validation, and prediction * Dependency management * Microservices We present our natural language processing (NLP) techniques in the context of a platform that makes it feasible to build products that feel native to every user, regardless of language.'
