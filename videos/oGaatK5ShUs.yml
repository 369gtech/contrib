title: 'JUnit 5 â€” The New Testing Framework for Java and Platform for the JVM by Marc Philipp, Sam Brannen'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510225563
description: "Over the last decade a lot has happened in the world of Java and testing, but JUnit 4 hasn't kept up. Now JUnit 5 is here to help shape the future of testing on the JVM with a focus on Java 8 language features, extensibility, and a modern programming API for testing in Java. Moreover, JUnit isn't just a Java testing framework anymore. Third parties are already developing test engines for Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, etc. that run on the new JUnit Platform.\n\nIn this session, core JUnit 5 committers will take the audience on an example-driven tour of the new Jupiter programming model and show how to migrate existing JUnit 4 based tests. Then, we will discuss the inspiration for JUnit 5, look more closely at its architecture, and discuss compatibility with JUnit 4. Next, we will explore the Jupiter extension model, learn about the extension points it provides, and see how custom extensions for conditional tests, method parameter resolution, lifecycle callbacks, etc. are authored and registered. To round off the session, we will look at the roadmap of what's still to come.\n\n# Marc Philipp\nMarc Philipp is a software engineer who works on cloud-based SaaS products for LogMeIn in Karlsruhe, Germany. He is a long-time core committer and maintainer of JUnit and initiator of the JUnit Lambda crowdfunding campaign that started what has become JUnit 5.\n\n# Sam Brannen\nSam Brannen is a seasoned enterprise Java and open source developer and co-founder of Swiftmind, a software consulting agency in Zurich, Switzerland. At Swiftmind Sam helps international clients achieve best practices in software development, architecture, design, implementation, and testing of enterprise Java applications using the Spring Framework, JUnit, and a plethora of open source technologies.\n\nSam is a popular speaker at conferences on Java and Spring. He is also an active core committer for the Spring Framework and JUnit 5 as well as the author and maintainer of the Spring TestContext Framework."
