Most users of Minikube, a tool to run Kubernetes locally, have; in fact, improved performance has been one of the most requested features since the project began. In this talk, Priya Wadhwa will discuss how we tackled reducing the start latency and CPU overhead of a Kubernetes cluster.  You will walk away with knowledge of frameworks and tools to identify where performance issues exist in your own cluster. We’ll cover how we used these tools to identify where overhead was coming from and how we came up with solutions to reduce it, all while maintaining a great user experience.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zerq"
