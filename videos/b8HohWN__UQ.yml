description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nHow to Effectively Manage Kubernetes in a Regulated Environment - Darien Ford, Capital One \n\nKubernetes plays an important role when scaling containerized applications in a highly regulated environment. Capital One understands this first hand, as they will complete a multi-year journey to exit on-prem data centers this year and move to the public cloud. As large enterprises look to shift to cloud architecture, Darien Ford will explain how Kubernetes container orchestration accelerates a safe and effective shift to cloud architecture with both developer experience and enterprise requirements in mind. As network boundaries broaden, he will cover ways container orchestration can help introduce workloads to the cloud while managing application development, testing, deployment and, of course, governance and policy compliance. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekAI"
