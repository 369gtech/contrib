description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/qafest/\nНаш сайт: www.qafest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции QA Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nA talk that looks into the role of acceptance tests, why we automate them, why it may be causing us more harm than good and what we can do to improve our use of acceptance tests. This is a new talk that I have been trying out as a lightning talk and tester meetups and it's getting good reactions as well."
