description: "An increasing number of projects starts incorporating reactive programming. On their journey, they start to discover that the only way to get the full benefit of that change is to ensure that they have a fully reactive stack.\n\nReactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) enables access to SQL database systems in a fully reactive way.\n\nThis talk explains R2DBC, how the API works, and the benefits for application developers that aim with Spring Data R2DBC for functional reactive access. You'll also learn how library authors benefit from a common standard for reactive database access, and how it contrasts with the ADBA project proposed as a successor to JDBC.\n\nSpeaker: Mark Paluch, Spring Data Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideshare Link: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/reactive-relational-database-connectivity-with-spring/SpringCentral/reactive-relational-database-connectivity-with-spring"
