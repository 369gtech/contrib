description: "by Fabien Chouteau\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.4.401/startup_gen.webm\n\nFor embedded developers using alternative programming languages, but also for anyone using third party driver frameworks such as libopencm3, one of the main pain points to start using a microcontroller is to make a Board Support Package.\n\n\nThings like linker script or startup code (crt0) not only require skills, but also information that are not always easily accessible.\n\n\nIn this talk we will present a tool that generates linker script, startup code, and low level hardware binding for 3000+ ARM microcontrollers using information extracted from archives provided as part of the ARM Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).\n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 08:00:00"
