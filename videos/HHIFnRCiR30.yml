description: "Unit testing is mostly a solved problem, but how do you write tests for the visual side of your web app—the part that your users actually see and interact with? How do you stop visual bugs from reaching your users? In this talk, we dive deep into \"perceptual diffs\" and visual regression testing, a fast-growing technique for testing apps pixel-by-pixel. Come learn how introducing visual reviews alongside code reviews can save you from launching unintentional visual changes to your users, and how we architected Percy.io to do visual testing at scale.\n\nSpeaker:  Mike Fotinakis, Co-Founder, Percy.io"
