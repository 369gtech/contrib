title: 'Creating a documentation site with AsciiDoc and Antora - Alexander Schwartz(Jfokus Brown Bag series)'
recordingDate: 1622481673
description: "Creating a documentation site for users with AsciiDoc and Antora\nAlexander Schwartz, msg system ag\n\nAbstract For developers it is normal to develop software in collaboration using their IDE and a version control system like Git. The same type of collaboration is possible when all documentation is versioned in a markup-format like AsciiDoc.\n\nThe tool Antora creates documentation websites from AsciiDoc sources stored in Git repositories. Users can browse the generated website and select the version matching the software they use. Navigation outlines, search and cross-references between pages allow users to find answers to their questions. Several open-source software projects like Camel, Debezium and Couchbase use this solution.\n\nThis talk presents the basics of an Antora setup and walks through all the steps from editing content in the IDE to updating the documentation site using continuous integration and delivery.\n\nRecorded Tuesday 8 December 2020 kl. 12:00"
