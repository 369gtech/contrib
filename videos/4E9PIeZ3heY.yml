description: "In this talk Simon Peyton Jones reflects on the key features of the language and its community that has led to all this creative development. Despite the title Haskell may not in the end dominate the world, but there are lots of interesting developments afoot, especially in (a) types and (b) parallelism.  Watch as Simon describe some of them, and speculate a little about the future.\n\nThis talk was recorded on 10 October 2012 in London at Haskell eXchange 2012."
