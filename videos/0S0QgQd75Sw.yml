description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nWhat does a vulnerability using signed integer overflow look like? Or a stack buffer overflow? How does code like this look and how can we change the way we program to reduce our risk? The first half of this talk will show examples of many different vulnerabilities and describe how these are combined to make the first steps of an exploit. Then we will discuss what kind of programming practices we can employ to reduce the chances of these kinds of bugs creeping into our code.\n— \nPatricia Aas, TurtleSec\nProgrammer\n\nPatricia has been programming C++ professionally for 13 years, she started out working on the Opera desktop browser and has looped back to browser making in the recent years, now working on the Vivaldi browser with many ex-opera colleagues. While away from the browser world she did a stint as a Java consultant coming back to C++ when working on embedded teleconference systems at Cisco. For the last couple of years she has begun doing public speaking, after only doing in-house speaking before. She is passionate about the tech industry and its impact on peoples lives. Since January she has been active in the #include＜C++＞ community where she is one of the admins.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
