description: "On July 19, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232 was en route to Chicago when a mechanical failure caused the plane to become all but uncontrollable. In this unsurvivable situation, the flight crew saved more than half of those onboard. How did they do it?\n\nFlight crews and software teams actually have a lot in common, and there’s much we can learn from how the best crews do their jobs. What can we learn from the story of United 232? While this talk won’t earn you your pilot’s license, you’ll definitely come away with some fresh ideas on how to make your team even more amazing.\n\nABOUT NICKOLAS MEANS\n\nNick hails from Austin, TX, the Taco Capital of the World. When he’s not busy eating tacos, he’s the VP of Engineering at Wellmatch Health, working with an incredibly talented team of developers to bring transparency to healthcare pricing. He’s a huge believer that software development is mostly human interaction and that empathy is the key to building great software."
