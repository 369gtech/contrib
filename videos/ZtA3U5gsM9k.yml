description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nLARGE SCALE DISTRIBUTED VIDEO PROCESSING WITH OTP\nby Haofei Wang\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nVideo processing, OTP\n\nTALK LEVEL: [\"Intermediate users\"]\n\nABSTRACT:\nVideo processing is both CPU and IO heavy. When it comes to Tubi, where the system need to process thousands of hours each week, it became a quite big challenge.\nThe Tubi team has created a way of breaking a single video process job to hundreds of tasks and distributed different tasks to different nodes that live in the same cluster. The cluster is built on OTP, the resources (CPU and IO) used by each task on each node are properly managed. Each task is doing a tiny bit of the whole thing, the input of each task may come from the output the task, both tasks may be running in different nodes.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/haofei-wang/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - HAOFEI WANG\nHaofei is a passionate software engineer who loves to build scalable distributed systems. Erlang OTP and video processing seem to be a natural fit for each other. He currently leads Elixir backend team at Tubi.\n\nMore on Haofei Wang: https://codesync.global/speaker/haofei-wang/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
