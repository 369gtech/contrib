recordingDate: 1539704996
description: "Every artist has their tools - paint, pens, canvases, or film - that they use on a daily basis. Have you ever wondered what a generative artist's box of tools looks like? What algorithms do we use? How do we deal with color? How do we make code-generated artwork appear natural?\n\nIn this talk, we will reach our hands into the toolkit of a generative artist together and discuss what we find inside. We'll touch on a variety of simple techniques that you can utilize and combine to produce interesting works of art, today!\n\n\nSpeaker: Benjamin Kovach"
