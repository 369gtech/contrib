description: "Concurrency and parallel computing play an important role in modern software development, whether one writes native applications or develops for the HTML5 platform. This session will give an overview of what JavaScript and the HTML5 platform have to offer. Learn what role actors play, how futures fit into the picture and what throughput computing in the browser looks like.\n\nStephan Herhut\nIntel Labs\n@herhut\n\n\nStephan Herhut is a Research Scientist at Intel Labs where he works on improving programmability of parallel architectures. He is enthusiastic about increasing programmers's productivity without sacrificing performance goals. Lately, he is working to bring the performance of parallel hardware to JavaScript without destroying its soul.\n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop conference (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Oct 2013."
