description: "AngularJS, React and other FrontEnd frameworks are perfor- mant enough for most apps, most of the time; But what happens when you’re trying to push every drop of performance out of your browser app? How would you handle a fire hose of data from socket pushes streaming to your UI while you’ve got mouse hover events firing? Reactive Programming is the answer to these questions. In this talk, we’ll learn first what Reactive Programming really means and then we’ll dive into practical examples on how Netflix is leveraging Reactive Programming to make performant, scalable and loosely coupled apps.\n\nForward 4 kicks off in Feb 2015!
