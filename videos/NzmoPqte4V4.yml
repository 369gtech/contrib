description: "I'm going to build a medical imaging classification app called SmartMedScan! The potential customers for this app are medical professionals that need to scale and improve the accuracy of their diagnoses using AI. From ideation, to logo design, to integrating features like payments and AI into a single app, I'll show you my 10 step process. I hope that by seeing my thought process and getting familiar with the sequence of steps I'll demonstrate,, you too will be as inspired as I am to use this technology to do something great for the world.
