description: "During 2018 I've been a contractor for the Italian Digital Transformation Team working on docs.italia.it (Docs Italia), a platform to collect and share the Public Administration documentation. Docs Italia is an Open Source platform based on the Read The Docs code.\n\nWorking in the open posed its own set of issues:\n\n    the good open source citizen while trying to deliver value dilemma\n    working productively with an Open Source community\n    managing an Open Source project fork\n\nIn this talk I'll share what we did and how it did go."
