title: 'DEFCON 29 IoT Village - Alexi Kojenov - I used AppSec Skills to Hack IoT and So Can You'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630443228
description: "We tend to think of AppSec and IoT as two separate infosec disciplines. Sure, the domain knowledge, attack vectors, and threat mitigation are not exactly the same in those two worlds. At the same time, as the hardware continues to evolve, we see more and more tiny general purpose computers around us. Many of these tiny computers nowadays run software that is written in a conventional programming language, listen on network ports, process data inputs, and communicate with the outside world. These devices can be attacked just like any other application running on a desktop, on a server, or in the cloud.\n\nIn this talk, I am going to tell you a story about my hacking journey that unexpectedly took me from device configuration settings to software reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, and six new CVEs. Together, we’ll go step by step through reconnaissance, firmware analysis, decompiling, code review, and remote debugging. I’ll also share my experience with the responsible disclosure process. I hope this talk inspires you to apply your general hacking skills to new areas such as IoT, even if you’ve never done that before."
