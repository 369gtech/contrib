description: "http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/troels-henriksen\n\nWe give a presentation of the purely functional array language Futhark, supporting regular nested data-parallelism.\n\nWe demonstrate its application to two complicated problems, computing cluster means and Sobol sequences, and demonstrate how Futhark permits the programmer to express simultaneously all degrees of parallelism and efficient sequential code, giving freedom to the optimising compiler in how to organise the generated code.\n\nWe also evaluate the performance of the Futhark compiler on several benchmarks running on two different GPUs."
