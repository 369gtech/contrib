description: "Automated Kubernetes Scalability Testing - Sebastian Jug & Naga Ravi Chaitanya Elluri, Red Hat \n\nKubernetes supports large clusters according to the docs, but how does it actually scale? Who came up with those limits? What are the actual numbers? To challenge this we built a CI/CD environment geared towards deploying, and testing, Kubernetes at Scale. Our stack consists of Kubernetes, OpenStack for IaaS, Jenkins Pipeline, Ansible for automation, pbench a performance benchmarking, and visualizing tool, Prometheus and other Open Source projects. The stack has pushed the performance and scale limits of Kubernetes with kubelet, control plane and cluster density focused tests. In this presentation we will explore the story and challenges on how we built and tested this stack. We will demo the test harness and share the latest performance and scale results. Attendees will learn what the real scalability limits of Kubernetes are, as well as how to scale-test their own infrastructure. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrYn"
