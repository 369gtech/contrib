description: "We’re so pleased to announce that we’ve teamed up with Dave Farley, author of “Continuous Delivery” and frequent GOTO Conferences speaker, for a monthly video series featuring ideas about continuous delivery, DevOps, test-driven development, BDD, software engineering and software development in general. \n\nFind plenty more from Dave on his Continuous Delivery YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfqyGl3nq_V0bo64CjZh8g\n\nDave Farley - Continuous Delivery & DevOps Pioneer, Award-winning Author, Founder & Director of Continuous Delivery Ltd.\n\nABSTRACT\nMicroservices are one of the most popular modern architectural approaches, but they are much more complicated to do well than most organisations think.

One of the biggest problems with this useful software development approach is that many, maybe most, organisations that try to build a microservices system, aren’t building microservices at all! It is more complicated than it looks!\n\nFind more information on Dave's Continuous Delivery YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfqyGl3nq_V0bo64CjZh8g\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOxDaveFarley #Microservices #DaveFarley #GOTO #GOTOcon #APIs #MicroserviceArchitecture\n\nDave's links\nhttps://www.continuous-delivery.co.uk\nhttps://twitter.com/davefarley77\nhttp://www.davefarley.net\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
