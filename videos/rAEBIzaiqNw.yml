language: English
recordingDate: 1601027645
description: "Spring Cloud has many opinionated defaults that allow you as the developer to get useful cloud native apps up and running as quickly as possible. Although these default opinions allow you to get started easily, youâ€™ll likely come across situations where you need to change things. Many of the Spring Cloud projects allow you to customize their behaviors to fit your needs and integrate with technologies you use. For example, maybe you want to provide another backend for the Spring Cloud Config server, or provide a new filter for Spring Cloud Gateway, or tweak the configuration of your Spring Cloud CircuitBreakers, or even add a new load balancing algorithm to Spring Cloud LoadBalancer. All of this is possible to do. This session will show you how to do all of the above and much more to help you unleash the true power of Spring Cloud!\n\nOlga Maciaszek-Sharma: Member of Technical Staff 3, VMware; \nRyan Baxter: Software Engineer, VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/unleash-the-true-power-of-spring-cloud-learn-how-to-customize-spring-cloud"
