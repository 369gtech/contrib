That doesn’t just mean delivering features to customers that allow them to observe and monitor Kubernetes, but also, embracing Kubernetes as the defacto standard for orchestrating workloads running on the entire New Relic data platform. \nThis lightning talk will cover the trials and tribulations of planning and migrating New Relic’s massively scaled distributed database (a database that processes up to 1.5 billion data points a minute) to Kubernetes. You’ll learn how monitoring and observability as well as the tooling created for spreading our workloads out over many heterogeneous clusters has been critical for the success of the migration thus far. We will also share our perspective about what to expect and be prepared for in the future of this fast-growing space."
