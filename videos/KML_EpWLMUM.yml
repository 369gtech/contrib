description: "We all know and love AB-testing, especially organisations with a large number of users. What happens when you want to test your idea either on a small sample? Say to test an over-the-line (OTL) ad campaign in different cities, or on partners, or on your customer support team that has “only” hundreds of member? AB-test by cluster, simulate the sensitivity of your test—and impress your stakeholders!\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
