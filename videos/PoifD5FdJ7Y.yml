language: French
recordingDate: 1557218560
description: "If you've developed in Java, you will most likely have used the mocking framework Mockito. While it is a superb framework for mocking in Java, it doesn't really seem to suit Kotlin that well and there are certain limitations or annoyances which you need to get around such as mocking final classes due to the way that Mockito creates its mocks.\n\nMockK is a mocking framework specifically for Kotlin developed by Oleksiy Pylypenko. MockKâ€™s main philosophy is offering first-class support for Kotlin features and being able to write idiomatic Kotlin code when using it.\n\nThis session will serve as an introduction to MockK, showcase its features and how to use it in your unit tests."
