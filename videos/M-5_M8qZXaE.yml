title: 'Testing The Tests: Mutation Testing for C++ - Seph De Busser'
recordingDate: 1569917839
description: "Do you know how good your tests are at catching bugs? Are you using approximate metrics that don't really show whether functionality is validated? What if you could actually test your tests’ bug-catching ability?\n\nInserting bugs into your code on purpose and seeing how many get caught is a way to do just that. This is the core idea of Mutation Testing. I’ll give an introduction to different ways of inserting bugs, the advantages of the technique and challenges in building the tools, finishing off with a deep dive into the design of a few new bug-inserting mutations for C++.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
