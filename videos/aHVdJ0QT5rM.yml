description: "This is a talk about the Open Source movement and the Free Software movement it grew out of, about its disregarded heroes and its flawed prophets, about what it’s doing for us and what it’s doing to us. I’d like to examine how it empowers us, and how it exploits us, and to show you why it’s really, really important that we figure out a way to make sure nobody can ever take it from us.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/bodil-stokke/"
