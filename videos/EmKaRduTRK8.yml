description: "We live in a world dominated by server-side MVC apps. Sometimes they produces a nice JSON API but often they spit out raw HTML. How can we keep working with those products with a nice and future oriented approach? I will present a way to integrate ReactJS into an existing RoR app focusing on a nice development experience and a smooth deployment chain.\n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
