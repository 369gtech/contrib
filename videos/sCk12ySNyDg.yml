title: 'Fireside Chat #8: How to measure quality?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628207386
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso and Mashooq Badar and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss how we can measure quality in software projects. How can we define quality? Quality to whom? What are the different perspectives and levels of quality? How do they relate to each other? What is the impact of metrics on behaviours? Are they always positive? Are there trade-offs when discussing quality? \n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything else related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
