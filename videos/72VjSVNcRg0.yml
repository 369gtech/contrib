description: "Machines are doing things today that were unthinkable even a few years ago. From computer vision, to understanding human conversation, to translating text, or even generating art; they're encroaching on domains previously thought to be strictly human realms. The technology behind this is actually fairly old; neural networks have been around for decades. However, modern hardware capabilities have made them technology feasible to such a degree that they can now drive cars.\n\nTensorflow is Google's open source framework for deep learning. It makes it relatively straightforward to apply these techniques. In this session, we'll cover the basics of image recognition, and use Jupyter Notebooks, and Tensorflow to apply it.... with a dash of GPU processing to boot.\n\nKey takeaways\nYou'll learn how machines can be endowed cognition.\nYou'll also see the basics of using Tensorflow.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
