description: "Talk \nIn Computer Vision, we often find data is either never enough, or expensive to label, or not relevant to the problem. There isn’t an Imagenet for every sensor. What tools can you use on little (or no) visual data, what purpose do they serve and what risks do they have?\n\nSpeaker \nElectrical Engineer & Biomedical Engineer who specialised in Machine Learning & Vision. Seasoned in different industries - from optical biopsy systems in France to surgical planning tools and Augmented Reality apps in the Berlin start-up scene-, she now works in Siemens Mobility’s Computer Vision & AI team. Even more than waking up Skynet, she’s interested in the limits of Natural Intelligence and its decisions over our data.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
