recordingDate: 1568813203
description: "Today whole business models are build on telematic solutions that send data from a moving vehicle to the cloud. Where in the past only few data could be processed in an onboard device, today we see solutions that stream lots of data in real-time. The complexity and the demands to security of these solutions increase rapidly.\n\nIn this talk we will have a look at technics from a real world solution that fulfill the needs of a modern telematic system build into trucks. We will see how an onboard unit and the backend can be secured against unauthorized access and how data can be transferred from the device to the backend efficiently.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
