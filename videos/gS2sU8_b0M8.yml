title: 'Ajay Gopal: "Full-Stack" Data Science with R'
recordingDate: 1542845371
description: "In the past 5 years, there has been a rapid evolution of the ecosystem of R packages and services. This enables the crossover of R from the domain of statisticians to being an efficient functional programming language that can be used across the board for data engineering, analytics, reporting and data science. I'll illustrate how startups and medium-size companies can use R as a common language for engineering functions such as ETL and creation of data APIs,\nanalytics through scalable real-time reporting dashboards and\nthe prototyping and deployment of ML models.\nAlong the way, I'll specifically identify open-source tools that allow scalable stacks to be built in the cloud with minimal budgets. The efficiency gained enables small teams of R programmers & data scientist to provide diverse lateral intelligence across a company. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/JUMjvCF2ucj"
