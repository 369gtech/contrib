description: "Lightning Talk: Ready, Steady, CKA! - Olive Power, VMware \n\nIt’s a race with time to pass most exams, and the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) is no different. The CKA was developed by the CNCF, and is fast becoming one of the most strategic certifications to acquire in terms of establishing a credible posture in kubernetes standings. This talk covers topics on how best to combat the screaming passing of time during the exam. How to accelerate getting resources up and running in kubernetes with Kubectl command options, how to optimise the shell environment for speed, and also how to optimise the vim text editor for use with yaml files will all be covered. Some protips on study resources that help you prepare, and how to organise your time during the exam will also be presented. This talk will cover as much as possible in the allocated time.  We will keep going until time runs out – just like in the exam. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPg8"
