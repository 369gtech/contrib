recordingDate: 1493318873
description: "How long does it take to deploy a feature to production? How sure are we that it worked and nothing broke?\n\nIt hasn't been easy to deploy new functionality\_into production yet creating \"continous delivery\"\_is a goal for teams working on building new projects as well as teams maintaing projects. There are many benefits of increasing automation to quickly and predictabley deliver software. In this talk we'll cover continous delivery concepts and share many painful and not-so painful lessons we've learned over the years honing our process, which is still changing.\_\n\nWe'll start by discussing why we decided to make the investment and what are the benefits of being able to deploy with confidence. We build the concepts of CI and how we've modified them for our Drupal deployments.\n\nWe touch on \"configuration management\" and talk through our lessons learned (Chef, Ansible), talk through severl iterations of our build scripts (briefly touching on Composer) for both D7 and D8.\n\nFrom there we'll tackle \"continous integration\" with Jenkins (vs. Travis CI) and other scroptis. We'll talk about how we've managed to deploy to different target environments such as Pantheon, Acquia, AWS, Rackspace etc.\_\n\nFinally we'll touch on our journey of automated testing from Behat to the Robot framework. We pull it all together by discussin how to make these bettery by integrating the results into common team communication tools.\_\n\nWe'll share Promet Source's lessons learned, risk management and maturity model steps.\_\n\nThis presentation is for anyone who would like to deploy faster, would like to know why deploying with automated testing is better and how to build a business case for this as well as look at a high level of technical approaches to make this a reality in your environment"
