description: "The talk from JS Fest conference 2019 Autumn\nin Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/2ryAU2D\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/JSFestua/\nWebsite: https://jsfest.com.ua\n\n\nDid you know that the beginnings of data visualization are strongly tied to solving some of the biggest problems humanity has ever faced? Wouldn’t it be more interesting to say that you’re not a doctor, but you do save lives than to say you’re just a developer?\nWhen talking about data visualization and JavaScript your mind usually goes to D3.js. But if our data has a location-based representation, we are faced with a limited choice. The main topic of this talk is to introduce the audience with deck.gl, an open-source WebGL-powered library developed by Uber that allows us to create beautiful data visualizations of large datasets and raise the level of interactivity for the user on a whole new level. We’ll see how our code can tell a story and how that story can potentially save lives. A short introduction to the library and it’s API will be demonstrated along with practical use-cases, live-code examples and it’s integration with popular frameworks such as Angular and React."
