description: "by Thomas Munro\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.401/walking_through_walls.webm\n\n\nA talk about past changes and potential future changes in PostgreSQL and FreeBSD that aim to make this combination the best relational database platform. PostgreSQL and FreeBSD have many things in common, including ancestry at Berkeley, similar project structures and a pesky more popular rival.  The talk will cover some recent changes made over the past years on both sides of the \"wall\" to improve the performance and user experience of this pairing, some ongoing work and many ideas for future improvements.  In many cases it's a matter of catching up with Linux, and in others it's entirely new possibilities.  The talk will finish with a question: \"what would you change if we could change anything?\", because, well, we can! \n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 17:45:00+01"
