description: "Speaker: Yeo Kheng Meng\r\n\r\nI built a Win 3.1 app during a company hackathon.\r\n\r\nWithout the benefit of modern libraries and languages, I had to read up and take care of many low level details, socket programming, HTTP, JSON parsing, UI design in code all under tight memory constraints. Nevertheless, it was a terrific lesson in understanding how things work under the hood.\r\n\r\nI'll share my learnings and process for how an old-new app can be created with the aid of modern tools and hindsight of old technologies. And perhaps what lessons can it offer us today.\r\n\r\nhttp://yeokhengmeng.com/2019/12/building-a-new-win-3-1-app-in-2019-part-1-slack-client/\r\nhttps://github.com/yeokm1/w31slack\r\n\r\nIt was Number 1 on Hacker news for a few hours! :)\r\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21831951\r\n\r\nProfile:\r\nI work as an IoT Engineer as SP Digital in the day. Outside of work, I like to repair things and fly private planes for fun. Occasionally, I dabble with retrocomputing stuff.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/yeokhengmeng/\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/267507133/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael"
