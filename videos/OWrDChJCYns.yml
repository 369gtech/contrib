description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nDeveloping Edge with Kubernetes - Dejan Bosanac & Ted Ross, Red Hat \n\nWhile its original intent was to solve cloud-centric architecture challenges, Kubernetes can be used as a platform for developing Edge and IoT applications. The session will take a look at this topic from the developer's point of view. It'll focus on special aspects of developing services for IoT and Edge environments, like autonomy, locality and secure communication to name some. What Kubernetes features can be used to address IoT and Edge aspects of developing microservices? What other projects in the ecosystem can developers use to achieve their goals? We'll try to answer those questions and demonstrate the flexibility of the platform by demoing an Edge application consisting of services deployed into various environments (like Edge clusters and Edge nodes) working autonomously and communicating securely with each others and the central cloud services. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaXg"
