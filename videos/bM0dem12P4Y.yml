description: "API security sounds simple - keeping the applications and microservices that businesses rely on safe from cybercriminals and without vulnerabilities. But it is much more complicated than that in practice. Especially in the past year as traditionally brick and mortar businesses flocked to virtual environments, the sheer number of APIs in operation vastly increased - often to the point where it is difficult for a business to truly know and have visibility into every API that interacts with their organization.\n\nA recent report by Salt Security shows that 91% of organizations suffered an API-related problem in the last year, and more than half (54%) reported finding vulnerabilities in their APIs, 46% pointed to authentication issues, and 20% described problems caused by bots and data scraping tools.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
