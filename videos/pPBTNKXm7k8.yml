description: "Filmed at http://js-kongress.de on November 28-29 in Munich\n\nThe world of web technologies and tiny wireless embedded devices are coming closer than ever with the Internet of Things. In this talk, we will explore some common ways how a JavaScript code can communicate with a microcontroller.\n\nJust like Alice, we will dive deep into the magical world of a protocol to communicate with microcontrollers, Internet protocols to talk to a web server and embedded JavaScript that can run directly on a microcontroller. There will be adventures with pings, requests, runtimes and your participation at Mad Hatter's hardware demo party might be needed.\n\nSo let's unravel the magic of JavaScript and microcontrollers, understand this magic, and most importantly learn to recreate this magic!\n\nSlides: https://talks.sayan.ee/alice/#/\nCode on Github: https://github.com/sayanee/talks/tree/gh-pages/alice/code"
