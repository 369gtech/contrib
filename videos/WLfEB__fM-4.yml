description: 'We have learnt that common data model can be reused for different purposes - the most important one is real time fraud detection. Today we’re processing billions of events daily from more than dozen of sources with 40 processes running in production. I’ll also talk about our current architecture, where it seems applicable and what are our plans for the future.
