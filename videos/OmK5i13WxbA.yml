description: "RejectJS 2013 - http://rejectjs.org - Berlin, September 12, 2013\nSlides: http://docs.bonsaijs.org/slides/rejectjs2013\n\n\nTalk description: \"Developing interactive and beautiful apps and websites has been difficult and limited in the past - if you wanted to go fancy, Adobe Flash was the way to go.\n\nWith BonsaiJS, an open-source Graphics and Animation Library built in JavaScript, you now can create stunning content similar to Adobe Flash. BonsaiJS's simple API makes optimal use of different \"HMTL5\" technologies such as SVG, CSS3, WebWorkers and even nodejs.\n\nDuring this talk we will look into the unique architecture of BonsaiJS, including the separation of rendering and script execution. We will explore the rendering engine(s), such as the SVG renderer and the environment agnostic script runner (running in the window thread, WebWorker or even on nodejs). BonsaiJS is also the JavaScript-Library that powers Pixelplant, our new Flash (including ActionScript 3) to JavaScript Converter.\n\nAfter this talk you will have a good overview of BonsaiJS's intuitive and simple JavaScript API and how we use the open web to draw interactive graphics.\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
