This video workshop shows you how. Using various mapping techniques from UX design, you’ll learn how to turn customer observations into actionable insight for product design.\n\nHost Jim Kalbach, Principal UX Designer with Citrix, introduces you to the principles behind alignment diagrams—a class of deliverable also known as experience mapping—using several examples. You’ll learn how to visually map your existing customer experience, based on user research, and demonstrate how and where customer perspectives intersect with business goals\n\nUsing alignment diagrams, you’ll not only be able to orchestrate business-customer touchpoints, but also gain stakeholder support for a product or service that provides value to both your business and your customers. \n\nThrough several exercises, you’ll learn how to:\n\n• Initiate a project\n• Select an appropriate diagram type\n• Conduct user research\n• Identify different touchpoint types\n• Format your information and create your diagram\n• Create an action plan with a pitch to stakeholders\n\nJim Kalbach is a speaker, writer, and instructor on user experience, information architecture, and business design.
