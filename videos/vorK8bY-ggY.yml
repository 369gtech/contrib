title: 'OpenPiton: An Open-Source Framework for EDA Tool Development'

description: "by David Wentzlaff\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2213/openpiton.webm\n\nAs contemporary industrial ASIC designs have reached hundreds of billions transistor count, EDA tools must have the scalability to handle such large designs. However, few open-source RTL designs reflect the scale that industrial ASICs have reached. In this talk, we will present OpenPiton, a scalable, tiled manycore design that can reach as many as 65,536 cores in a single chip, and up to 500 million cores on a multi-chip design. The modularity and scalability of the OpenPiton design can enable EDA tool developers to test their tools' functionality at contemporary scales and adapt their development for future larger designs. With its many configurability options, extensive scalability, and heterogeneity, the OpenPiton platform is well placed to supercharge open-source EDA tool development and pave the way for a completely open-source ASIC synthesis and back-end flow tested using open-source designs.\nTitle:\nOpenPiton: An Open-Source Framework for EDA Tool Development\n\n\nAbstract:\nAs contemporary industrial ASIC designs have reached hundreds of billions transistor count, EDA tools must have the scalability to handle such large designs.

Wentzlaff's research has earned several awards, among them an NSF CAREER award, DARPA Young Faculty Award, AFOSR Young Investigator Prize, induction into the MICRO Hall of Fame, and the ASPLOS WACI Test-of-Time Award.  He received his M.S. and Ph.D. from MIT and received a B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  He was Lead Architect and Founder of Tilera Corporation, a multicore chip manufacturer now owned by Mellanox.  David's current research interests include how to create manycore microprocessors customized specifically for Cloud computing environments, how to design computer architectures in a post Moore’s Law world, and how to reduce the impact of computing on the environment by optimizing computer architecture for fully biodegradable substrates.  Many of the research projects created by Wentzlaff’s group have been open-sourced including the PriME simulator, OpenPiton, and PRGA.\n\n\nLink to any hardware / code / slides for the talk:\nhttps://parallel.princeton.edu/openpiton/\nhttps://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/openpiton\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 16:30:00"
