description: "In this talk, we'll look at some examples of tradeoffs between expediency and correctness in programming, and the Pros and Cons on each side of the spectrum.\nWe'll also discuss what this has to do with Elixir, and how it plays into another language that I feel pairs very nicely with Elixir"
