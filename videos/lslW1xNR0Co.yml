title: 'Deep Learning, Not Deep Creepy'
recordingDate: 1548365047
description: "Jack Moffitt\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/116/\n\nMassive amounts of data have accelerated advances in machine learning, and companies are collecting as much as they can to power their algorithms. Deep learning has many amazing and practical use cases, but the privacy and social implications of current machine learning systems leave much to be desired.\r\n\r\nAt Mozilla, we're trying to make machine learning systems that empower people and ensure their privacy. I'll give an overview of deep learning, its applications, and how it all works. Then I'll demo and talk about several machine learning projects at Mozilla, including Deep Speech, speech synthesis, grammar checking, and more. At the end, you'll know what the hype is about, and how you can use these technologies for good.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
