description: "We're going to use the policy gradient technique from reinforcement learning to beat the game of Pong. We'll use OpenAI's Universe as an environment for our agent and I'll go over the process of setting it up as well as the math behind the PG method in detail.\n\nMicrophone popping issues end at 11:15 . That cannot happen again. Udacity is aware of this and will be more prepared next time.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Policy_Gradients_to_beat_Pong\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nMore Learning resources:\nhttp://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Policy_gradient_methods\nhttp://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14.pdf\nhttp://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/\nhttp://home.deib.polimi.it/restelli/MyWebSite/pdf/rl7.pdf\nhttp://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Teaching_files/pg.pdf\nhttps://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/PolicyGradient\n\nPlease Subscribe!
