title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Everything about Unicode all PHP devs should know'
recordingDate: 1493259621
description: 'UTF-8, charsets, code points, glyphs, CLDR, etc. Everyone knows some words of the Unicode vocabularies. This global standard gathers together almost all scripts spoken and written by human beings over the Earth and ages. I propose you to dive into this fantastic project that snapshots some important linguistic and cultural bits of our times. Let''s see how we, as developers, have been given the privilege to play with these at the technical level. How does this work? How does that apply to the apps we create? Have you heard about collations? translisterations? grapheme clusters? NFC? Let''s have together a nice eye-opener journey into the core Unicode concepts.'
