title: 'GraalVM and MicroProfile: A Polyglot Microservices Solution (Roberto Cortez, Portugal)'
recordingDate: 1557782772
description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/graalvm-and-microprofile-a-polyglot-microservices-solution/\n\nMicroservices need to support many programming languages, requiring both a language-agnostic network protocol and a polyglot runtime environment. In addition, microservices written in one language may need to use APIs written in some other language. Using the MicroProfile conference sample architecture implemented as a polyglot solution (Java, JavaScript, Python) on GraalVM, this presentation demonstrates how MicroProfile JWT, MicroProfile Metrics, MicroProfile Rest Client, MicroProfile Health Check, and more can provide architecture-level interoperability across concerns. Attendees interested in creating a polyglot solution on GraalVM compatible with MicroProfile will get a demo-heavy introduction with occasional dives into the code and leave with read-to-run samples in GitHub."
