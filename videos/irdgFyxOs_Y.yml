description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nIf this lightning talk we will follow the Beyonce Rule - 'If you liked it then you \"should put a\"_test on it' and explore the capabilities of a new C++20 single header/module, macro-free Unit Testing Framework (https://github.com/boost-ext/ut).\n\n---\nKris is a Senior Software Engineer passionate about programming and has worked in different industries over the years including telecommunications, games and most recently finance for Quantlab Financial, LLC. He has an interest in modern C++ development with a focus on performance and quality. He is an open-source enthusiast with multiple open-source libraries where he uses template meta-programming techniques to support the C++ rule - \"Don't pay for what you don't use\" whilst trying to be as declarative as possible with a help of domain-specific languages. Kris is also a keen advocate of extreme programming techniques, Test/Behavior Driven Development and truly believes that 'the only way to go fast is to go well!'.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
