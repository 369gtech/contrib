description: "Building a custom image on your own can involve tons of tedious work: figuring out the right tooling, building the right pipeline — and then all that maintenance starts. Developers customize VM images for three main reasons: to fulfill security needs, to meet corporate and regulatory compliance rules and to preconfigure VMs with apps for fast deployment.\r\nNow we’ve added Azure Image Builder service, combined with Azure Shared Image Gallery, and integration with Azure DevOps to give you a full image management system. Come to this session to hear and see how easy it is to use Azure Image Builder service plus what’s in the planning and your feedback."
