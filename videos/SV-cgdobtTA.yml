description: "It’s clear by now that the robots are coming for us.\n\nBreakthroughs in AI fill our streams and news feeds, themselves the products of AI, the echoing algorithmic screams of a new kind of mind being born.\n\nUsing deeplearn.js, we’ll find out how deep learning systems learn and examine how they think. The fundamental building blocks of AI have never been more accessible. Let’s explore the architecture of these new minds, which are growing to mediate our every interaction.\n\nJSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
