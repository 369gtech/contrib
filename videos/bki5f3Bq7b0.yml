title: 'Asynchronous & Non-Blocking Scala - A look at Netty & NIO for Async Networking via Scala'
language: English
recordingDate: 1334083358
description: "Asynchronous and non-Blocking network frameworks have become a big deal: tools like node.js and BlueEyes have set the pattern for new projects.\n\nMany Scala developers don't understand these approaches though.  In this talk Brendan will introduce Async/Non-Blocking IO and demonstrate both Netty & Raw NIO -- and discuss strengths and weaknesses of each.\n\nHe'll also discuss patterns and concepts around this: The use of callbacks, Either[E, T] to pass errors, implicit tricks to simplify them and even the Iteratee pattern.\n\n** Videos sponsored by Typesafe (http://typesafe.com) and Marakana.\n** Get the slides at http://mrkn.co/hxm3z"
