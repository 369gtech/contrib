title: 'Living on the Cloud''s Edge by Rustam Mehmandarov and Tannaz N. Roshandel'
recordingDate: 1581884607
description: "Edge computing helps to break beyond the limitations imposed by, now, traditional cloud solutions. Some of the reasons might be privacy concerns, reducing the need for heavy processing resources, reducing the amount of data that is sent over the network â€“ just to mention a few.\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce the concept and benefits of Edge Computing, how such devices can be built using affordable hardware and we will look at examples on how IoT Edge devices are in practice as well as comparing Edge Computing with other options.\n\nAs a live demo, we will be using a system built using Google Coral IoT Edge device. This is an example to process video streams on the Edge and designed to keep the privacy of the people intact; without leaking faces and identity of the people to a 3rd party. In addition to standard video processing, we will show advanced ML techniques and models that are processed on to the device to demonstrate the power and flexibility of the Edge devices nowadays.\n\nRustam Mehmandarov, Computas AS\nTannaz N. Roshandel, University of Oslo\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
