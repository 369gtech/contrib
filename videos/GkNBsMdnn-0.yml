recordingDate: 1486917478
description: "Continues Integration is essential, but is it enough to have Jenkins or TeamCity? Unfortunately no â€“ we need tools and methods to get efficient delivery workflow. Three stones, such as monolithic code + test suites + deployment pipeline should be faced.\n\nWe will speak about Test Pyramid and Trunk based development. Why may automated tests does not work in reality? Do we need Manual testing and in which step? What about Acceptance and Capacity test? How to put all of this in one deploy pipeline?"
