description: "Speaker: Ian Lewis\n\nPython has lots of scientific, data analysis, and machine learning libraries. But there are many problems when starting out on a machine learning project. Which library do you use? How can you use a model that has been trained in your production app? In this talk I will discuss how you can use TensorFlow to create Deep Learning applications and how to deploy them into production.\n\nIan Lewis is a Developer Advocate for Google Cloud Platform based Tokyo, Japan. Ian is a Python and Go developer who is passionate about developer communities. He previously co-founded PyCon JP, the largest Python event in Japan. Ian loves learning about how systems work end-to end and spends his time writing and deploying distributed web apps for his favourite container orchestrator (Kubernetes).\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/PyData-SG/events/235981769/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/42L4/"
