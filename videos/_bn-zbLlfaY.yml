description: "When Governments Attack: Malware Targeting Activists, Lawyers, and Journalists\n\nEva Galperin, Electronic Frontier Foundation\n\nTargeted malware campaigns against activists, lawyers, and journalists are becoming extremely commonplace. These attacks range in sophistication from simple spear-phishing campaigns using off the shelf malware, to APT-level attacks employing exploits, large budgets, and increasingly sophisticated techniques. Activists, lawyers and journalists are, for the most part, completely unprepared to deal with cyber-attacks; most of them don't even have a single security professional on staff. In this session, Eva Galperin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation will discuss the technical and operational details of malware campaigns against activists, journalists, and lawyers around the world, including EFF employees and clients, as well as what the security community can do to protect these highly vulnerable populations.\n\nEva Galperin is a Global Policy Analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Her work is primarily focused on privacy and security for vulnerable populations around the world. To that end, she has applied the combination of her political science and technical background to everything from organizing EFF's Tor Relay Challenge to writing privacy and security training materials to publishing research on malware in Syria and Vietnam.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '16 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions"
