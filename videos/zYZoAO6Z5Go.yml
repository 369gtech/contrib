language: English
recordingDate: 1499693907
description: "Businesses rely on getting valuable new software into the hands of users as fast as possible, while making sure that they keep their production environments stable. Continuous Delivery is a revolutionary and scalableagile methodology that enables any team, including teams within enterprise IT organizations, to achieve rapid, reliable releases through better collaboration between developers, testers, DBAs and operations, and automation of the build, deploy, test and release process. We'll start by discussing the value of CD to the business, inspired by the lean startup movement. We'll then present the principles and practices involved in continuous delivery, including value stream mapping, the deployment pipeline, acceptance test driven development, zero-downtime releases, and incremental development. We'll cover how CD is enabled by an ecosystem including Devops, cloud computing, agile testing, and continuous deployment. Finally we'll talk about how continuous delivery can co-exist with ITIL and compliance in an enterprise environment.\n\nMartin Fowler is an author, speaker, consultant and general loud-mouth on software development. He concentrates on designing enterprise software - looking at what makes a good design and what practices are needed to come up with good design.

He's the Chief Scientist at ThoughtWorks - an international application development company, and has written five books on software development: Analysis Patterns, UML Distilled (now in its 3rd edition), Refactoring, Planning Extreme Programming (with Kent Beck), and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. I also write articles regularly on my site at Martin Fowler\n\nJez Humble is a Principal Consultant with ThoughtWorks, and author of Continuous Delivery, published in Martin Fowler's Signature Series (Addison Wesley, 2010).
