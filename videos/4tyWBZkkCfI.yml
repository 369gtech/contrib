This is their secret sauce for managing concurrency.\n\nHTTP is the primary means of communicating between clients and servers, and often between servers and other servers, it is a protocol for message passing.\n\nRaxx is an Elixir toolkit that treats HTTP interactions as just another kind of message. These external messages are handled in a way completely analagous to internal messages between processes.\n\nThis talk will start with an explanation of the core concepts and getting started with Raxx.\n\nExtending message passing to all parts of a system provides a uniform model to describe it.\n\nThis talk will explore how to use this model to reason about interactions in an extended web application, from server to browser to human.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/peter-saxton/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - PETER SAXTON\nElixir developer at Pay with Curl\n\nA regular participant in hacknights and meet-ups in London I always enjoy learning something new. Now a full time Elixir developer, at paywithcurl.com, I get the joy of using it everyday. Currently I am interested in the topic causality and consistency and looking into how these concepts can be part of our languages.\n\nMore on Peter Saxton: http://codesync.global/speaker/peter-saxton/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
