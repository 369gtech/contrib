We'll use a pre-trained model, load it up in the browser, and build a Web application that allows us to query the IMDB dataset - all without going to a server. We'll use Tensorflow.js, take a standard HD5 Tensorflow trained model, and use it right in the web browser!\n\nPratik Patel \nFrom TripLingo\nPratik Patel is is a software and hardware nerd that loves to build things. He has spoken at various conferences and participates in several local tech groups and startup groups and never met a programming platform he didn't like, except for Perl. He currently works at IBM, mostly because of the free cloud credits to mine Bitcoin."
