recordingDate: 1553169459
description: "Think back to a time when you were in a conversation that could have gone better. Perhaps you said something the wrong way, or you walked away from the conversation not fully knowing if the other person even understood what you were trying to convey.\nTechnical trainers rely on effective communication as the foundation of everything that we do. We help end users to learn how to use software and adjust to new workflows, through the process of constantly adapting to different backgrounds, skill levels, and learning styles.\n\nIn this session, youâ€™ll learn actionable strategies to begin thinking like a trainer, including:\n\nUsing active listening techniques to communicate with empathy.\nBest practices for explaining technical concepts in non-technical terms.\nAdjusting your communication approach for different communication styles.\nUsing problem solving skills to help you get unstuck during difficult conversations.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
