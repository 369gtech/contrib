The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nEpisode IV: A New Network Service Mesh - Frederick Kautz, Doc.ai & Nikolay Nikolaev, VMware \n\nIt is a time of exploding networking complexity. Members of the Network Service Mesh Community, hacking furiously around the clock, have won their first victory for network simplification. During the development, community members discovered a new way to think about Cloud Native networking with enough power to meet the needs of multi-cloud enterprises and telcos alike. Racing across… Frederick Kautz and Nikolay Nikolaev bring you Network Service Mesh, which can unchain developers from legacy networking and restore freedom to networking. Come learn about Network Service Mesh and get the latest updates on the latest features including Inter-Domain connectivity, identity (SPIFFE) and policy (OPA) support!\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZevK"
