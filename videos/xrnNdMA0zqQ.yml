title: 'Tanzu Talk: kubernetes for VI admins, part 2'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604502910
description: 'In this episode, Boskey  (@boskey) and I discuss how being a VI admin differs from being a kubernetes admin, and vice-versa. We discuss a lot about how vSphere “wants” to manage applications and the app life-cycle compared to kubernetes. Hopefully, as with our first discussion on this topic,  if you’re a VI admin you’ll get a better understanding of kubernetes and how to manage it.'
