description: "Microsoft has rebuilt it's build system from the ground up with the goal of making it genuinely cross platform and much, much easier to work with. The results are pretty amazing.\nIn this session we'll be taking a look inside these changes and see how you can customise the build system to build anything you like. Apart from building .NET code, we'll also show you how to build Java code, how to integrate with tools like SonarQube and what you would need to do of you wanted to create your own build tasks for those times where you want to do something a little, ahem, unusual."
