description: "Johannes Edelstam is both a developer and designer with to much experience from working with web and mobile in various contexts. One of the organizers behind sthlm.js and Nordic.js. It began with founding sthlm.js a few years back while working as a consultant for Valtech. Since then Johannes Edelstam have joined Tink (http://tinkapp.com) as their first employee, organized the first Nordic.js (http://nordicjs.com) plus lots of sthlm.js (http://sthlmjs.com) and starting the event management tool Confetti (http://confetti.events). \n\nThe talk: One of the big challenges in building an API is predicting how itâ€™s going to evolve. How will we handle big breaking changes? And how do we share a model layer without code duplication? This talk will demonstrate the JSON API approach (http://jsonapi.org). JSON API is not only the missing standard you can rely on to settle endless arguments in how the JSON API should be structured. It also a standard for creating self explaining JSON APIs, also called hypermedia APIs. This will be demonstrated through a JavaScript library we have created at Confetti called YAYSON for communicating between our apps through JSON API. We aim to separate logic in lots of smaller services, there JSON API has proven to be an important tool to boost productivity.\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
