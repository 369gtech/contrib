description: "2015 and 2016 have seen a huge number of high profile breaches in tech product security and reliability. Data loss and reputational damage have occurred, as have actual customer harm and business destruction is a real risk.\n\nI will cover de-risking security and reliability simultaneously, since at the organisation or product management level the approach and implications are very similar (but of course security is the title sure to get more attention ?\n\nIn this talk I will look at why leaders need to be tough on security, and how leaders who believe they are tough on security will find reality across all aspects of their products quite different to what they might think. In this post-censusfail world escaping by pointing the finger at teams or contractors who were saying all the right things is coming to an end.\n\nAfter creating a reasonable level of fear, including some very brief case studies of major public tech security/reliability failings, I will look at a case study from a recent project where security issues raised in a new unreleased product were taken seriously by the tech leadership, and the implications across as many as five different departments.\n\nMark Aufflick is the founder of The High Technology Bureau, a software development consultancy based in Sydney, organiser of Sydney CocoaHeads and has been co-organiser of Swipe Conference. The fact that he is on the YOW! Connected Program Committee has nothing to do with his talk being accepted. Markâ€™s work spans finance, healthcare, realestate, social media and geological research. He has been consulting on software development for over two decades and has been involved in the Internet and Apple industries since the mid-90s.\n\n\nFor more on YOW!
