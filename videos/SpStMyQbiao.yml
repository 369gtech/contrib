description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nA year ago, I challenged myself to practice TDD on my React Native application all the time for two weeks.\n\nAt first, I was afraid, then I was petrified. \nI kept thinking I could never write tests that my code would abide. \nBut then I spent so many nights thinking about what testing is and how I was doing it wrong. \nAnd I grew strong. \n\nI became more confident writing tests with React Native Testing Library. After two weeks I realized that it was one of the best decisions I had ever made. One year later I would never go back, and I believe a lot of developers would benefit from it as well. \n\nIn this talk I am going to cover:\n- a quick reminder of what TDD is\n- how to use 100% TDD (yes, even with components!) on a React Native app by developing a HackerNews clone in RN\n- why switching to TDD made me a lot faster\n- why TDD made my code healthier\n- in which conditions I would recommend not using TDD\n\nMy goal is to lower the barrier to start using TDD with React Native and to convince other developers to give it a try!\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\"Louis Zawadzki has been developing React Native apps of different sizes and shapes since 2017. \nHe became a developer after he heard that \"a server is like a computer, but without a mouse nor a screen,\" and was intrigued to know what kind of superpowers developers had to do something with no mouse and no screen.\n\n\"Life is too short to click on simulators\" could be his motto, hence his love for TDD and building easily changeable and testable architectures.\n\nHe is also passionate about many things such as German rock music from the 70s, storefront typography and fig rolls.\"\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zawadzkil\nGithub: https://github.com/louiszawadzki\n\nAdditional links:\n\"A catalog of TDD recipes for React Native: https://louiszawadzki.github.io/react-native-tdd/\n\nAn article I wrote about how TDD had such an impact on my career: https://blog.bam.tech/developer-news/software-development-learning-path\""
