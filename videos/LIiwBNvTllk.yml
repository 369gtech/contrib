description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nCopperSpice is a collection of cross platform GUI libraries derived from Qt 4.8. Our libraries use current C++11 technology to implement Reflection, without requiring moc (a code generator) or any preprocessing. We will discuss what Reflection is, how this technology can be used, and why it can be difficult to implement. \n\nThe focus of this presentation is to show the core implementation of CopperSpice. Source code from CopperSpice will be shown to explain how we implemented Reflection using pure C++11. We will also demonstrate small samples of code which use the CopperSpice libraries. \n\nTechnologies covered in this presentation will include templates, variadic templates, and template specialization. \n\nNo prior knowledge of CopperSpice or Qt is required. A working knowledge of templates in C++11 would be helpful.\n— \nBarbara Geller: I am an independent consultant with over twenty-five years of experience as a programmer and software developer. I have worked with numerous smaller companies developing in-house applications. I have also designed and developed Windows applications for several vertical markets including medical billing, transportation, and construction.\n\nMy degree is in Electrical Engineering from Cal Poly Pomona with additional studies in Computer Science.\n\nI am a Co-founder of CopperSpice, a C++ library derived from the existing Qt framework. I designed the Diamond Editor, a cross-platform programmers editor using the CopperSpice libraries. I have programmed in C++, Qt, Visual Objects, Clipper, PHP, and Java.\n\nAnsel Sermersheim: I have been working as a programmer for over fifteen years. My degree is in Computer Science from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. \n\nCurrently I work as a software engineer designing scalable, high performance, multi-threaded network daemons in C++. The daemons I have developed are used at a Tier 1 carrier serving static and live content to customers around the world. I am a Co-founder of CopperSpice, a C++ library derived from the existing Qt 4.8 framework. I have programmed in C++, C, Lisp, Java, and Perl. I am an avid follower of the C++ standard.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
