description: "A much-hyped feature of HTML5 is native multimedia. In this session we'll look at embedding multimedia into your pages, and how to make it work cross-browser and degrade gracefully in older browsers. Sound too good to be true? It's not!\n\nWe'll look at the pros and the cons of HTML5 multimedia and see how to write controls with JavaScript and CSS. We'll also look at how HTML5 builds in support for subtitles and captions for multimedia accessibility. We'll build up a working example, and look at what's coming just around the corner in HTML.next - and you might pick up a Turkish dancing tip on the way.\n\n** Find more educational resources on HTML5 and Open Source Development at http://marakana.com"
