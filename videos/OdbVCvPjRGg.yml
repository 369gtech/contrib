title: 'Building WebGPU with Rust'
language: English
recordingDate: 1599580805
description: "WebGPU is a new graphics and compute API designed from the ground up by a W3C community group. It's a successor to WebGL, which also has a chance to become a standard on native platforms. We are going to talk about the API itself as well as our Rust-based implementation \"wgpu\".\nExpected prior knowledge / intended audience: basic familiarity with one of the graphics APIs is good but not required. We'll explain in details how this is different from existing APIs.\n\n\"wgpu\" is the native implementation of this API in Rust, running on top of Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, D3D11, and potentially OpenGL.\nThis is a talk about the API architecture being designed as well as our implementation of it.\nWe want to share the experience of leveraging the power of Rust ecosystem and language in order to build this level of abstraction.\nWe'll show a few demos and spread excitement about the new API.\n\nSPEAKER:\nDzmitry Malyshau\n\nEVENT:\nFosdem 2020\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV8mwo65kR8"
