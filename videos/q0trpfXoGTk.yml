description: "Cassie Breviu and Bea Stollnitz are back for part two of the AI Show series, Azure Percept – AI IoT Edge Made Easy (https://aka.ms/AzurePrecept_AIShow). They'll be playing with the Azure Percept DK which provides simple IoT edge hardware, model building solutions and deployment. It has three separate parts: Azure Percept DK (board), Azure Percept Vision (Camera) and Azure Percept Ear (microphone). From there we can use the Azure Percept Studio to create and deploy models (with and without code)! Be sure to tune in!
