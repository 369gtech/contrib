title: 'GeeCON Prague 2019: Karolina Garbacz - Let''s chat about chatbots'
recordingDate: 1574262736
description: 'In the last couple of years, the popularity of messaging apps has grown rapidly. Because of that fact, chatbots, computer algorithms with the ability to communicate with people in their natural language, became a big thing as well. Nowadays, one can talk to chatbots in a variety of websites, messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, and others. There are a lot of applications where chatbots can be valuable: customer service, handling minor daily tasks, updates and content delivery, e-commerce bots, event reservations, agenda/scheduling, virtual assistants, project management, data gathering, and analysis. One of the most important questions that can be asked considering this topic is: how does chatbot actually work? There are two general types: those that use pattern matching (simpler to implement, usually use the combination of if-else statements and basic statistics), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Natural Language Understanding (NLU) based algorithms, but only the latter type can be really considered as an artificial intelligence due to its complexity. NLP is mostly used for text analysis purposes such as Information Retrieval, Information Extraction or Text Mining. To actually achieve those goals, some necessary steps need to be followed: tokenization, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, discourse analysis, and pragmatic analysis. All of them will be discussed during the presentation for beginners.'
