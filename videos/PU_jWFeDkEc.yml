description: "Peter Jausovec\nOracle\n\nTommy Su\nOracle\n\nWith the rise in popularity of microservices architectures and, subsequently, the rising number of production services, it's paramount to develop resilient and observable services. This session will present some techniques that can help you test and validate services resiliency. With the help of the service mesh, we will also show how to apply common configuration across the whole mesh and explain how to read the numerous metrics collected by the mesh and detect anomalies sooner. After this session you should be on a good path to more resilient and observable microservices, which means more confidence in quality and that translates to faster time to production."
