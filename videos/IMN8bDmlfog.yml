title: 'Alexey Kureev - Network layer in React Native'
recordingDate: 1536920876
description: "React Native provides us with a set of primitives for building mobile applications. A few of these can be aggregated into a \"networking\" layer that manages the transfer of data. This layer was designed to mimic an API we have in the Web, but despite all the similarities, it has its own *qualities* and caveats every good React Native developer should know about. In this talk I'll try to guide you through the networking layer in React Native and share some tips and tricks I've learned along the way.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
