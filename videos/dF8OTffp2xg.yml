title: 'GeeCON 2018: Cliff Click - A War of Words: Self-Awareness for Introverts'
recordingDate: 1532330769
description: 'I take a deep look at my (emotional) insides - which I suspect are a lot like yours - and introverts and conflict-avoiders everywhere. I don''t take verbal assaults or even verbal sparring well... if it''s outside of my ''comfort zone'' (I totally rock it in my zone). We''ll work through a common enough situation (an angry co-worker screws up and blames me), paying special attention to emotional states during the encounter. We then go through the post-analysis: getting emotionally jarred/hurt/wrecked, why I didn''t stand up verbally, stewing on the attack, and finally recovering. And then we''ll go through what *can* be done. We''ll look at some key insights into common introvert thinking patterns (verbal vs emotional processing) - and what you can do about it, how to bring your strengths to bear, and how to compensate for your emotional weaknesses. How to spot and avoid Dangerous people, and to surround yourself only with Good people. We''ll cover Love a bit also: unmet expectations, and why you can''t Change your Lover... but you can change who you Love, and how you talk about Love to your Lover. This will be an emotional talk, NOT a Tech-Talk at all, but geared for techie people who might want to beef up their EQ (Emotional Quotient). Along the way, we''ll figure out why programmers suck at salary negotiations... and what you can do about it.'
