recordingDate: 1213119116
description: "Best Practices for Spreading Your App without Ruining the User Experience\r\nVivian Li, Chris Schalk and Kevin Marks (Google)\r\n\r\nThe OpenSocial API provides features that application developers can use to help their users share the application with their friends. We'll review other social application architectures that allow apps to spread virally. We'll then discuss the sharing features in OpenSocial in detail including a review of requestSentMessage and requestShareApp. We'll also go over programmatic best practices for such things as determining if an app is already installed, and we'll look at example apps that have successfully used these features."
