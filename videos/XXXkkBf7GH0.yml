description: "Frontend Love Meetup\nMonday 13th July - 5 pm CEST\n\nRobert Boedigheimer - Advanced Fiddler Techniques \n\nFiddler is a great free web diagnostic tool that nearly everyone uses, but typically only for very basic things.  If all you need is to see the requests made between the browser and web server, the browser devtools can do that.  Fiddler has many more advanced features that most developers are unaware of.   It can be used to capture traffic from smartphones, tablets, and non-Windows platforms!  Discover the power of manipulating requests and responses with breakpoints, the auto responder, and a visual composer.  Review popular extensions for formatting JavaScript, syntax highlighting, and detecting image bloat.  Go beyond the basics and learn the full capabilities of the tool and how it can improve your web development and debugging techniques today!"
