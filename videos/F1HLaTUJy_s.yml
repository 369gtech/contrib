description: "Confessions of a Systems Engineer: Learning from My 20+ Years of Failure\n\nDavid Argent, Amazon\n\nThere's no holy book of best practices for running large online services. We rely on what we've learned along the way, often taught to us by having things break. Failure is a great but expensive teacher, and it's usually better to learn from someone else's mistakes. I've had a long career of mistakes I've made or experienced first hand to draw on, and built a list of conceptual lessons to be learned from them. This is a non-exhaustive list of things to think about when designing and running a large scale online service, rather than a prescriptive checklist.\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in the tech industry, and job titles ranging from Technical Writer, to Systems Engineer, to Program Manager, to Lead Problem Engineer (his personal favorite), David's worn more than a few hats and been victimized by more than a few badly designed online services. Nineteen years at Microsoft had him working on various TV-division projects, Windows Phone, Cortana, and Bing until his new adventure with Amazon, where he helps run what, depending on who you talk to, is the largest no-SQL installation in the world."
