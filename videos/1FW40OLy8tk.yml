description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\nML.NET is still fairly fresh Microsoft venture into deep learning. It's written in .NET Core and a lot of good thinking went into it. It's definitely the best hope for .NET developers to do machine learning natively and easily incorporate it into existing apps. CNTK is another venture into ML for Microsoft, that allows you better control over what you're doing.\n\nAnd to show the power of both of them, we'll harness deep learning to help a metal band to get out of their rut by writing for them some awesome new riffs.\n\nFrom this talk, you'll learn how to use ML.NET and CNTK, how some deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks work and how to write a metal songs!"
