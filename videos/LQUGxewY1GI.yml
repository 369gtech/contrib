title: '"How to write your first kernel selftest" - Michael Ellerman (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612051205
description: "Michael Ellerman\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/101/\n\nThis will be a short introduction to the Linux kernel selftests, what they are, why they are and where they are.\r\n\r\nThen we will cover the mechanics of writing a selftest, and why it's not that hard, even if you have no kernel development experience.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk hopefully the viewer will feel capable of writing a simple kernel selftest. I will also offer to assist anyone who wants to try and submit a selftest upstream.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSat Jan 23 16:40:00 2021 at Tux Theatre"
