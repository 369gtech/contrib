description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotjs.io on December 5-6, 2019 in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nWebAssembly, the new\_low-level bytecode format for the Web, could seem like a complicated topic to some. Vlad provides you with required WebAssembly knowledge, so you can use the power of WebAssembly to optimize your own JavaScript web applications. He also takes a glance at the future of WASM and how it can improve the speed and security of the software we write on a daily basis."
