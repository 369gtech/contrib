description: "Peter Meyers (Independent)\n\"Breaking The Page: Content Design For An Infinite Canvas\"\n\nAuthor and digital book architect. I write about and help companies create reader-friendly digital books. Author of \"Best iPad Apps\" (O'Reilly, 2010). Currently writing: \"Breaking the Page: Transforming Books and the Reading Experience\" (O'Reilly).\n\nI co-founded one of the first multimedia textbook publishers (Digital Learning Interactive, sold in 2004 to Thomson Learning). I've also written extensively about the strange and wonderful effects of computers on mainstream culture for many publications, including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Wired, Salon, and the Village Voice. Some of my favorite pieces include a profile of Norwegian programmers who used pigeons to transmit information between computers http://bit.ly/bXtkAi, the evangelism of Edward Tufte's information design seminars http://bit.ly/cwPvvJ, and one of the earliest articles on Wikipedia http://bit.ly/aXq3Vj. I also did a tour of duty at O'Reilly Media, where I served five very happy years in the Missing Manual group, finishing up as the series' associate publisher.\n\nMy undergraduate degree is from Harvard, where I studied American history and literature, and I have an MFA in fiction from the Iowa Writers' Workshop. I live with my wife and two daughters in \"upstate Manhattan\" (aka Washington Heights)."
