description: "Speaker: Mikko Lammi, Upcloud\n\nIn the modern cloud environment CPU and memory are cheap resources which can easily be increased to scale up applications. However the local storage can still be the bottleneck and predictable performance might come with a high price. We will demonstrate some ways on how developers can overcome IO limitations and design applications that will scale horizontally in cloud environment.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nMikko wears several hats at UpCloud which includes R&D , development for the last five years with cloud hosting backend automation and operations support. He has more than 15 years of experience with different programming languages/ backend operations while working on other functions such as network administration and telecom systems. His most memorable stint is the time he spent at Finnish military mostly coding with PHP.\n\nEvent Page: https://2018.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/lcA7/"
