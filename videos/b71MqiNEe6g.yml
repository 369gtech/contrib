Before joining Facebook, Justin ran the Data team at foursquare. In addition to building their core data-driven products Explore and Radar, he built a team from the ground up that consisted of Engineers and Data Scientists to solve large scale data problems as foursquare's dataset grew from half a million check-ins to over 1.5 billion. Before that, Justin worked at a hedge fund as a quantitative analyst, building custom portfolios for their asset management division and doing modeling and analysis for their risk team, specializing in high-frequency, derivatives, and commodities trading. Prior to that, he worked for Bear Stearns as a Vice President in their fixed income analyst group, building applications and models to help value agency pass-thru securities and building loan-level pricing applications and models. Justin holds a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Rochester and has studied graduate-level Math and Computer Science at Columbia University. He is constantly chasing the biggest and most interesting datasets and trying to make amazing things happen with them."
