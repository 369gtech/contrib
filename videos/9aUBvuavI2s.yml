description: 'Sure, AI offers endless opportunities. These new challenges are both exciting and scary. However, it’s important to remember what’s at the heart of it all: people. Forget AI-first, and lead with your heart. Compassion is the key to fostering meaningful and symbiotic human-AI relationships steeped in intimate emotionality and understanding. Thanks to AI-powered conversational environments and zero interface technologies, humans will be immersed in the most interconnected and intuitive of ways. But, how do we move away from creating these fragmented moment-based user experiences? Is the term “experience” still relevant in regards to these new immersive realities? It’s simple: compassion; it has no boundaries and is universally understood by all. That, and contextual personalization will empower us, as industry leaders, to make the shift from technology-enabled user experiences, and allow us to connect within our new immersive reality. But, that does beg the question: If compassion can be taught to machines, could we not teach it to humans? And, if we can create emotionally intelligent machine does that mean AI could potentially save humanity?'
