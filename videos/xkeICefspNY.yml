description: "Delivering Business Value by Migrating & Modernizing .NET - Naveen Babu, Travelers & Zach Brown, Pivotal\n\nDevelopers choose to use .NET when building new and modernizing existing business applications for a variety of reasons including skills/knowledge, personal preference and existing portfolio/investment. In this session, Naveen (Travelers) and Zach (Pivotal) will share real-world experiences of migrating and modernizing .NET applications on Cloud Foundry.\n\nCloud computing encourages a new set of patterns and best practices, such as microservices, 12-factors, service registry, and circuit breakers, to name a few. Using tools like Steeltoe and Cloud Foundry, developing new greenfield .NET apps that embrace these cloud-native patterns has become relatively easy. On the other hand, migrating and modernizing existing brownfield .NET apps is the elephant in the room. Practices that developers commonly used in the past (e.g. dependencies on the registry, GAC, and local file system) have become cloud anti-patterns. From their experience developing and migrating .NET applications at Travelers, the speakers will share some of the challenges faced and lessons learned with a focus on delivering business value.\n\nThis session is for developers and architects who want to unlock business value in their existing .NET application portfolio by migrating and modernizing their apps on Cloud Foundry. \n\nAbout Naveen Babu\nNaveen Babu is a lead architect in Claim Technology, Travelers. Co-chairing Cloud Native domain team at Travelers, he is a cloud evangelist architecting, coaching, mentoring and delivering cloud applications. He conducts workshops, speaks at forums like Speaker Series to promote/teach cloud and other architectural concepts/patterns. Prior to Travelers, since early 90s he has been actively involved in various roles of Information Technology and SDLC at Fortune 500s and Startups. \n\nAbout Zach Brown\nZach Brown starting building web sites in the 90s using Netscape-optimized HTML, cgi, and lots of Photoshop lens flares. He spent many years as a developer on the Microsoft stack, then as an architect and manager of dev teams. Currently he's responsible for product strategy and marketing for Steeltoe and the Pivotal Cloud Foundry .NET developer experience."
