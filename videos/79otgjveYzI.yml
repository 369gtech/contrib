description: "Europe’s Leading Laravel Conference\nBlind-bird Tickets 2020 Available\nhttps://laracon.eu/2020/tickets\n\nWorking with companies from early-stage startups to Fortune 500, I’ve seen first hand how the architecture approach affects team performance. It’s as easy to overengineer a simple app if you rely too heavily on good design principles, as it is to create a very coupled architecture if you don’t. In this presentation, we’ll cover different scenarios and try to choose the proper architecture depending on the business requirements. We’ll see how the time we spend on development is defined by our design choices and how that impacts the overall performance of the team."
