description: "Full title - Marcin Kowiel: How to numerically represent semi-structured log data for anomaly detection?\n\nRepresentation of text data from semi-structured log records is a challenging problem that is crucial for the quality of anomaly detection engines. In the presentation, I will show a pipeline to create vector embeddings and normalization rules on semi-structured, text data that could be used in anomaly detection problems.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
