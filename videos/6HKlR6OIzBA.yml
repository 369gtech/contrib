title: 'Clustering Architecture for Developers - Max Sumrall'
recordingDate: 1505226345
description: "In this talk you’ll learn about Raft consensus and Neo4j's new Causal Clustering. \n\nNeo4j uses the Raft protocol for a robust underlay for intensive write operations. This will be shown during the presentation together with how the new scale-out mechanism provides enormous power for very demanding database workloads. \n\nFurthermore the cluster architecture's new consistency model will be introduced. This new model makes it convenient to write applications that use the full capacity of the cluster. \n\nYou’ll see how all works by following along as we develop an application using the new official Neo4j Drivers (We’ll be using the Java driver in this demonstration). In Neo4j 3.1, the official drivers are optimized for clustering. This makes it easier than ever to write applications that scale smoothly from a single server to a large, distributed cluster. \n\nMax Sumrall is a software engineer at Neo4j, working in the distributed systems team building the clustering architecture of Neo4j. \n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
