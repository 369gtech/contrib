description: "Mobile operators are starting to offer new low power wide area networks (LPWAN). This opens up new opportunities for IoT devices with direct Internet connection outside Wifi or Bluetooth range and/or without building your own LPWAN network.\nThe new protocols are called NB-IoT and LTE-M. This session will cover the basics of each, give examples what you might use them for and go in to practical considerations for both device firmware and backend."
