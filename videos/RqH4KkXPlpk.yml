description: "Slides - https://github.com/thampiman/interpretability/blob/master/PyData%202019%20-%20Interpretable%20AI.pdf\n\nOne of the main reasons why companies are blocking the deployment of AI across the enterprise is trust. The lack of understanding of complex machine learned models is hugely problematic. In this tutorial, I will cover various data science techniques that have been successfully applied at Microsoft to gain customer trust and improve model understanding.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
