description: "Bob Quillin\nVice President, Developer Relations\nOracle\n\nWe are now living in a golden age for developers being shaped by three forces coming together and creating unlimited potential: DevOps culture, open source code, and cloud computing. But despite all the progress, we are also facing new challenges that threaten all of this. Many developers and teams are being left behind as cultural changes accelerate, open source complexity grows, and cloud lock-in eliminates choice and drives up costs. This keynote explores these tectonic changes, the challenges they present, and how development teams can navigate through the waters ahead."
