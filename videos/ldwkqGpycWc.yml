description: "\"From support for Streams and Kubernetes to enhanced extensibility, Steeltoe has loads of new functionality. This session provides an overview of what’s new and different in Steeltoe’s latest releases and what features are coming soon.\n\nThe Steeltoe .NET project, like our peer project Spring Cloud, is all about providing developers with the tools they need to quickly implement some of the common patterns (such as configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, distributed tracing, and others) used in building highly scalable, enterprise-quality microservices.\"\n\nTim Hess, Software Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/state-of-steeltoe-2020"
