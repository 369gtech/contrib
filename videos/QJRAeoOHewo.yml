title: 'YOW! 2019 - James Shore - Evolutionary Design Animated'
recordingDate: 1582161322
description: "Modern software development welcomes changing requirements, even late in the process, but how can we write our software so that those changes don’t create a mess? Evolutionary design is the key. It’s a technique that emerges from Extreme Programming, the method that brought us test-driven development, merciless refactoring, and continuous integration. James Shore first encountered Extreme Programming and evolutionary design nearly 20 years ago. Initially skeptical, he’s explored its boundaries ever since. In this session, James will share what he’s learned through in-depth animations of real software projects. You’ll see how designs evolve over time and you’ll learn how and when to use evolutionary design for your own projects.\n\nJames Shore teaches, writes, and consults on Agile development processes with an emphasis on technical excellence. He is a recipient of the Agile Alliance's Gordon Pask Award for Contributions to Agile Practice, co-author of /The Art of Agile Development/, host of \"Let's Code: Test-Driven JavaScript,\" and co-creator of the Agile Fluency™ Model. InfoQ has named him one of the \"most influential people in Agile.\" You can find his screencasts at letscodejavascript.com and essays at jamesshore.com.\n\nFor more on YOW!
