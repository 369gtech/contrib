description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nRyan Pierce - Android Developer at Capital One\n\nABSTRACT\nAsynchronous programming is tricky. As new tools to approach concurrency emerge, it’s easy to become overwhelmed. However, the engineers at JetBrains took a pragmatic approach by making asynchronous coding simple yet purposeful. Built in the coroutine library, Flows and Channels help you gracefully process streams of data. They let you focus on developing seamless features while forgetting about verbose syntax and unreliable concurrency.\nIn this talk, I’ll break down the similarities and differences between Flows and Channels. You will learn where to use them, the problems they solve, and how they help write reliable apps. I’ll present examples that show how to handle reactive streams in Kotlin and when to use Flows over Channels. After this talk, you’ll see why Kotlin Flows and Channels have redefined the way I develop on Android and how they can strengthen your app development [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:37 Challenges\n02:23 Coroutines\n05:10 Channels\n08:53 Flow\n12:51 Flows & Channels Android demo\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1412/kotlin-flows-and-channels-for-android\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Kotlin #Android #KotlinFlows #KotlinChannels #AsynchronousProgramming\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
