title: 'Using NoSQL with JPA, EclipseLink and JavaEE'
language: English
recordingDate: 1431331433
description: 'This session explores how NoSQL solutions like MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, HBase and CouchDB can be used with JPA and Java EE. Although the primary focus is on EclipseLink NoSQL, we will also cover Hibernate OGM, EasyCassandra, Morphia, etc as well as seeing how and when NoSQL can be used natively via basic CDI injection without JPA.'
