description: "JavaScript is, byte-for-byte, the most expensive resource on the web and we’re using more of it than ever in our sites. You can optimize the delivery, the parsing and the execution until you’re blue in the face but you’ll never make it as performant as simply not using it in the first place.\n\nBut what do you do if you’re already staring down a pile of scripts?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss practical ways to reduce the amount of JavaScript we’re sending down to the people using our sites. We’ll look at techniques for shaving excess bytes off our bundles and, just as critically, tools and approaches we can use to make sure those bytes stay off.\n\nSlides: https://noti.st/tkadlec/MC0Bvy/when-javascript-bytes\nAbout Tim: https://timkadlec.com/\n\nMore about performance.now(); https://perfnow.nl or https://twitter.com/perfnowconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://perfnow.nl/subscribe"
