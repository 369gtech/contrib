description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nOle Caprani - Associate Professor,Department of Computer Science Aarhus University\n\nABSTRACT\nAt the Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University we have used the Lego Mindstorms NXT Robotics set to teach a master course in embedded Java programming like simple regulation systems and robotics programming like flocks of robots building a map of an unknown environment. The Lego sensors and actuators connected to the NXT microcomputer unit are controlled by programs written in the leJOS Java system. Through a number of lab sessions the students get comfortable with sensor input interpretation and actuator control. At the end of a half year course the students finish a project of their own choice. Examples of projects will be demonstrated.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
