description: "Erlang-Lua: How to write an Erlang C Node\n\nhttp://www.erlang-factory.com/berlin2014/robby-raschke\n\nIt is quite straightforward to integrate Erlang with other technologies, several mechanisms exist: NIF, linked-in drivers, port programs, C and Java Nodes.\nThis presentation will outline how you can combine the port program and C Node mechanisms to provide a coupling between Erlang and the Lua programming language. The following details will be covered (albeit briefly): starting and stopping the integration, message marshaling, error handling, communication difficulties.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n    Show how to write an integration to a C programming language interface\n    Show some pitfalls and their solution\n\nTarget audience:\n\nDevelopers interested in integration"
