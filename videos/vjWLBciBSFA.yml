With careful application of these technologies you can create magical multi-screen installations with the languages and tools you already know and love. Smart phones that control LED art, tablets that control whole rooms of screens, touch tables that can flick content to the wall – it’s all possible, and pretty darn easy, right now.\n\nBranden Hall\nhttps://twitter.com/waxpraxis\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
