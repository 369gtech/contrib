description: "AI allows for apps that can handle the complexity of scheduling a meeting between one person or a group of people. This is useful for recruiters and all sorts of teams. Natural Language processing, a subset of AI, focuses on learning from linguistic constructs and deriving meaning from it in a structured way. We'll build a slack bot that uses NLP to read the intent of the user and schedule a meeting accordingly. I talk about the architecture, code, and need for this software in this video. I also give some tips on how I use github near the end.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/AI_for_Scheduling\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
