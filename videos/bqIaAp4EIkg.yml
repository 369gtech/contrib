description: "Building idiomatic Envoy SDKs for Rust and Go - Yaroslav Skopets, Takeshi Yoneda\n\nSupport for WebAssembly is slowly coming into upstream Envoy.\n\nEager to get our hands dirty, we've embarked on a journey to develop our very first Envoy extensions in Rust and Go - languages beloved by the Cloud Native Community.\n\nIt's been a bumpy ride and we're happy we've made it :)\n\nIn this session we will share our learnings from building Envoy SDKs for Rust and Go:\n* what challenges we've met\n* what issues remain open\n* what makes SDK ergonomic\n\nWe will give a demo of practical extensions that have been made possible so far and, most certainly, will beg Envoy folks to give us even more features we miss so much :)\n\nOur goal is to raise awareness in the community about the current state of Wasm, and to invite everyone to collaborate on the SDK for the language of their choice."
