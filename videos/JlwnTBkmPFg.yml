description: "As you know, Java EE is old-fashioned, heavyweight, cumbersome, and made mostly of boilerplate code. Who would develop a modern Web application with such a technological stack? Who would start an heavy application server, deploy some EJBs, and wait ages for integration tests to run—only to end up with an ugly Web page? You? So if you like HTML5 front ends with responsive design, sexy graphical components, manageable REST interfaces, easy asynchronous processing, reliable messaging, and transactional databases, come to this session to see two developers writing and testing a real Java EE 7 Web application within 50 minutes.\n\n\nAuthors:\nArun Gupta\nArun Gupta is Director of Developer Advocacy at Red Hat and focuses on JBoss Middleware. As a founding member of the Java EE team at Sun Microsystems, he spread the love for technology all around the world.\n\nAt Oracle, he led a cross-functional team to drive the global launch of the Java EE 7 platform through strategy, planning, and execution of content, marketing campaigns, and program.
