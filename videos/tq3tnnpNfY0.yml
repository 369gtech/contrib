language: English
recordingDate: 1433232905
description: "Surviving as a zombie is tough: with the constant risks of sunlight, fire, and pesky mobs, doing your job of infecting the local villagers can be deadly. Fortunately, with the new JavaFX ZombieTime app, powered by the JSR 310 Date and Time API, you can rest easy. With its built-in time zone and DST support, you no longer have to worry about roaming around under the scorching hot sun. Accurately calculate how long you have to infect the villagers before you decompose, using Durations. And coordinate global attacks on the humans by syncing with your undead brethren on Instants. With the power of Java 8, eradicating the human race with a highly infectious virus has never been easier!\n\n\nAuthor:\nStephen Chin\nStephen Chin is a technical expert in RIA technologies, and Chief Agile Methodologist at GXS.
