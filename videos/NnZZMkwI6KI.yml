language: English
recordingDate: 1524484802
description: "When you are writing code, are you doing it right? That is a question that worries a lot of people, and it should probably at least be something every developer thinks through. Design patterns are best-practice concepts that we can implement into our code to make it better in some way. Think of them as guardrails that keep our code safe. In this video, we are going to look at the fifth entry in the famous SOLID principle. The D stands for Dependency Inversion Principle. This isn't the same thing as Dependency Injection but it is what powers it.\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/ (your email will be kept safe and you will not be spammed).\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=DInSOLID"
