description: "How NOT to Build a Pipeline - Mirah Gary, Pivotal\n\nPipelines are the infrastructure we use to test and deliver our code. We work with them every day, but sometimes they behave in unexpected ways. \n\nWe will go over common failure modes and issues encountered in Concourse pipleines, and understand what we can do to prevent and solve these pain points. \n\nBeing able to build pipelines that work for you is critical for effective dev/ops. By sharing our own mistakes, we hope that the audience will be able to recognize them when they happen and know what to do to fix the problems. \n\nAfter this talk, attendees will:\n- be familiar common mistakes found in pipelines and how to recognize and correct them\n- be able to build pipelines that facilitate the development process rather than hinder it\n- understand how to refactor and improve their pipelines\n\nAbout Mirah Gary\nMirah is a senior software engineer at Pivotal, where she works on the Platform Recovery team, where she builds pipelines and products to help operators prepare for and recover from disasters. Prior to coming to Pivotal, Mirah was a theoretical physicist and pondered the deepest mysteries of the universe.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
