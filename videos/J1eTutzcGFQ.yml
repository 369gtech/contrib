description: 'We explore the use of Asynchronous MicroServices to implement a home IoT environment of heterogeneous devices, including lights and motion sensors. We explore a J2ME­like environment where we assume unreliable device connectivity. On this platform, we implement action services to tie these devices together. This configuration also offers superior network security over the default connectivity of these same devices.'
