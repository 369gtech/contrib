A multi-faceted approach to CTV inventory identification\n\nPresentation Overview:\nThe world of digital advertising is messy. Connected TV advertising, as ad tech's newest frontier, is even more so. Standardization around CTV has been slow in arriving, even as millions of Americans drop their cable subscriptions for streaming services. Vericast, an advertising technology company, has spent the past year and a half untangling the CTV space to create scalable targeting solutions. In this talk, we will explore how we have developed a framework of data pipelines, algorithms and good old fashioned manual processes to ensure that we are only serving our clients ads to legitimate, high-quality CTV inventory.\n\nBio:\nAmanda Newport-Foster is a Senior Data Scientist at Vericast, a marketing technology company. She is the data science technical lead on the digital advertising optimization team and over her past 6 years with the company has had a hand in improving performance on everything from display, video and rich media to CTV and OTT. In 2018, Amanda won the IABâ€™s Data Rock Star - Rising Star Award for her work on revamping Vericast viewability solutions and turning the company into a market leader in viewability performance.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nPresenter: Harsh Parikh\n\nTitle: Introducing MALTS & PyMALTS\n\nPresentation Overview:\nMALTS - Matching After Learning to Stretch\nUses exact matching for discrete variables and learned, generalized Mahalanobis distances for continuous variables. Instead of a predetermined distance metric, the covariates contributing more towards predicting the outcome are given higher weights.\n\nPyMALTS is a Python implementation of the MALTS algorithm.\n\nBio:\nHarsh is a Ph.D student in the Almost Matching Exactly (AME) Lab at Duke University. He has received 2020 Amazon Graduate Research Fellowship (Sept 2020 - Jan 2022) for working on 'Evaluating Causal Methods'.\n\nAME Lab's goal is to develop and apply interpretable machine learning algorithms to estimate causal effects using observational data. In general, our algorithms match units with similar covariate distributions, creating high quality, exact, or almost exact matches for treatment effect estimation.\nhttps://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/\n\nThe AME Lab algorithms:\n* Dynamic Almost Matching Exactly (DAME)\n* Fast Large-Scale Almost Matching Exactly (FLAME)\n* Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS)\n* Adaptive Hyper-Box Matching (AHB)\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
