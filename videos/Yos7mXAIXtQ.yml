title: 'Integrating Containers in JavaScript: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'
language: English
recordingDate: 1626283955
description: "Docker has become an increasingly important subject when we talk about containers. However, it's made to be used by humans. What if we needed containers to be controlled by other applications? Is it possible to do it by using JavaScript? In this talk, we'll build a container control application that will communicate with a container runtime through gRPC and will manage all our containers. Welcome to the new era of container management!\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
