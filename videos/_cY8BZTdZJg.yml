title: 'Organisation Refactoring and Culture Hacking - Lessons from Software by Andrew Harmel-Law'
recordingDate: 1581886464
description: "Marc Andreessen famously said “software is eating the world”; yet most of our teams and organisations simply aren’t set up for us to take part in this revolution.\n\nWhy? Our organisational surroundings are directly responsible for inefficient design and delivery – locally-optimised silos, opaque/ossified power structures, multi-layered middle management, command-and-control execs – the failings are well known. For us makers this is incredibly frustrating, when all we want to do is ship great product.\n\nIn this session I'm going to show how your software engineering skills make you ideally suited to fix these org and cultural problems. How do I know? Because I've done it myself, and want to tell you what I learned.\n\nI'll show you tried and tested ways to identify and fix these problems - fast-moving culture hacks, and safe org-refactorings - so you can drive effective incremental change from the bottom up; change that responds to the specifics of your organisation and focusses on efficient delivery of software; change that take its inspiration from the software techniques which we know so well.\n\nAndrew Harmel-Law\nThoughtWorks\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
