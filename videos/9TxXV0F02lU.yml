title: 'Interoperability enables the next wave of intelligent service-rich applications by Jon Payne'

recordingDate: 1557993637
description: 'The next generation of digital solutions will be increasingly complex, as they leverage more data and a growing array of intelligent services. I will review how these trends shift the challenges from custom software and model development to integrating myriad services and ensuring they interoperate. With traditional programming environments and even dedicated low-code platforms, managing more than a few connected services becomes complex and unwieldy. Also, the volume, velocity and variety of data compounds these integration problems since traditional databases cannot efficiently provide transactional and analytic workload support at scale. Then we will see how developers in logistics, finance and healthcare fields are composing data-intensive, intelligent applications that overcome these obstacles, using new methodologies and platforms specifically designed for this latest phase of technology evolution.'
