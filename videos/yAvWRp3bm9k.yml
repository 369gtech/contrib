title: 'Dealing with software dependencies - Kiki de Rooij, Peter Bindels - Meeting C++ 2017'
language: English
recordingDate: 1518093511
description: "Software dependencies are not always obvious in the code, however, they can reduce the quality of your code and increase your build-time enormously. For this reason it is important to understand when dependencies occur and how you can deal with them.\n\nThe first important thing to know is what dependencies are and how they can influence your code. We will start with an introduction to dependencies, different dependency types and the limitations that dependencies can bring.\n\nThis introduction will be followed by more in depth concepts such as pImpl, C++20 modules, impact of templates, dependency injection and the SOLID principles.\n\nOur goal of this session is to create more awareness about software dependencies, and teaching you how to handle them."
