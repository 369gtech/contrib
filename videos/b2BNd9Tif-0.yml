title: 'Debugging and Profiling Robots with James Gosling'

description: "James Gosling recently stated that  being able to debug and profile robots out at sea is a truly life-altering experience.  He uses a set of tools—consisting of editors, debuggers, and profilers—that are part of the NetBeans IDE. In this session, Gosling and other speakers introduce you to these tools and show you how easily and quickly you can program and interact with devices via Java tools. Come see how well integrated embedded devices are with the Java ecosystem.\n\n\nAuthors:\nGeertjan Wielenga\none of the Oracle product managers on the NetBeans Team\nView more trainings by Geertjan Wielenga at https://www.parleys.com/author/geertjan-wielenga-1\n\nJames Gosling\nJames Gosling received a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Calgary, Canada in 1977. He received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1983. The title of his thesis was \"The Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints\". He has built satellite data acquisition systems, a multiprocessor version of Unix, several compilers, mail systems and window managers. He has also built a WYSIWYG text editor, a constraint based drawing editor and a text editor called 'Emacs' for Unix systems. At Sun his early activity was as lead engineer of the NeWS window system. He did the original design of the Java programming language and implemented its original compiler and virtual machine. In February 2007, James was named an officer of the Order of Canada. \nView more trainings by James Gosling at https://www.parleys.com/author/james-gosling\n\n Jens Deters\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by  Jens Deters at https://www.parleys.com/author/jens-deters\n\n Jose? Pereda\nJosé Pereda, PhD in Structural Engineering, works as an Assistant Professor in the School of Engineers at the University of Valladolid in Spain. His passion is related to applying programming to solve real problems. Being on Java since 1999, now spares his time between JavaFX and the Embedded world, developing commercial applications and open source projects (JFXtras, https://github.com/jperedadnr), co-authoring a JavaFX book (JavaFX 8 Introduction by Example), blogging (http://jperedadnr.blogspot.com.es/), tweeting (@JPeredaDnr) or speaking at conferences (JavaOne, W-JAX, JFokus). \n\nJosé lives with his wife and kids in Valladolid, Spain.\nView more trainings by  Jose?
