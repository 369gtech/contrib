title: '[Online Meetup] Principles on how to build fast at Scale- Or Shachar'
recordingDate: 1604593957
description: "Three years ago, we were given a big challenge - Transform Wix Build System, then based on Maven and Teamcity, to a new system that will support our exponentially growing scale. We ended up choosing a build tool that originated at Google and completely revolutionized our builds.\n\nNowadays - the system builds in a fracture of the time - even with our largest codebases.\n\nIn this talk, Or breaks down the key-principles that made the new build system so fast, how each one enables a faster, more efficient, and more stable build system, and touches upon how this was implemented using Bazel.\n\n// Bio:\n\nOr Shachar is a build-passionate backend engineer. He started his professional career as a classic Build manager in Hewlett Packard ALM team. Starting from build configurations written in Ant, moving to Maven, and falling in love with Jenkins - build became a sort of a passion. After 3 years he left to pursue the startup dream and started doing intensive system design and development. 4 years ago, he joined Wix backend group and was given the opportunity to combine his two passions - backend engineering and build systems. Today Or is the Server build team lead and part of the Wix DevEx group."
