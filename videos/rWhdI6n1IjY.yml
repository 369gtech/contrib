description: "You've probably heard the term \"data driven\", but what does that even mean? Data is a vital piece of the choices we make, from important business decisions to what we eat for dinner (yes, seriously!). Data affects the world around us and can come in many shapes, sizes and formats. In this session you will learn the fundamental concepts around storing and working with data. We will learn how to create a SQL database in the cloud, run basic queries and connect to your database from an application. After this session you will understand how you can organize and process data, the difference between relational and non-relational databases, and how data is handled through transactional processing.\n\nAzure SQL Fundamentals: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-sql-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=8397-SDC-jasmineg"
