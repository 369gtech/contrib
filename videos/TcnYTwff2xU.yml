description: "Scala vs. Java\nAround eight years ago I started my journey as a developer. Since then, I've played around with many languages and thought that C# offers the best developer productivity. But after joining Wix two years ago, I was exposed to the amazing world of Scala and Functional Programming and never looked back. While the maturity and wide range of tools Java offers is great, the language doesn't seem to keep up with market requirements as other languages do.\n\nIn Scala the code is much more concise, less ceremonious, immutable by default, combines functional with object oriented, seamlessly interoperates with Java and the JVM ecosystem, and many software engineering patterns are already baked into the language. Most importantly - Scala is FUN.\nBy the end of the session you too will, hopefully, convert to Scala and never look back."
