description: "Boost your Cloud Foundry Edit-Build-Deploy-Test-Debug Speed! - Andrew Lunde, SAP\n\nOne of the first things you notice when developing with Cloud Foundry is the time it takes to deploy a multi-node application and how that delay impacts productivity. This is one of the trade-offs we incur in order to gain all the benefits of a micro-services environment. However while much of this unavoidable, there are tips and tricks that can be employed to shorten your round-trip time considerably. \n\nIn this talk, Andrew will give an explanation of the root cause of this issue and what can be done to address it including localizing your development environment, piecemeal deployments, and editing/testing after deploy. He will also demonstrate how set up full step-trace debugging of a python application running in Cloud Foundry and how to generalize this approach to other programming languages.\n\nAbout Andrew Lunde\nAndrew is a member of SAP's Indepenent Software Vendor partner program and works with strategic partners as a solution architect. His focus is currently on application development on HANA(SAP's in-memory DB) and SAP's Cloud Foundry service. Always on the look-out for what SAP's partners and customers are strategically interested in, most of Andrew's current projects center around bringing machine learning solutions from the open source stack into SAP's environment and how to best utilize python in a way the is familiar to machine learning practitioners. Andrew actively influences and presents at SAP's TechEd annual technical conference as well as at local data science events.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
