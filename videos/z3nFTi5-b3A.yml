description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.    \n\nKeynote: More Power, Less Pain: Building an Internal Platform with CNCF Tools - David Sudia, Senior DevOps Engineer, GoSpotCheck, Inc.\n\nLast year GoSpotCheck migrated from a PaaS to Kubernetes, and devs asked \"Does it have to be this hard?\" The engineering organization's major initiative this year was to be able to say \"no,\" by building an internal Platform-as-a-Service...with no platform team. And keeping to a goal of using as many open-source and CNCF technologies as possible.  Learn how GoSpotCheck used and put together tooling around Buildpacks, Helm, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Envoy, LinkerD and gRPC to make a much smoother experience for developers, from \"local\" development (which now happens in the cluster) through the first SLO alert. Also learn guidelines about where to make the strategic trade-off of what to do in-house and when to go with a vendor.  Most of all, learn how to make a pleasant user experience for developers with Cloud Native tech. \n\nhttps://sched.co/eoFV"
