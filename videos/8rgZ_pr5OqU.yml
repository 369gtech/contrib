Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: New matchers in the Alertmanager config and silences - Atibhi Agrawal, Grafana Labs\n\nIn this lightning talk, I talk about the newly added matchers in Prometheus Alertmanager. The matchers were added for Silences and in the Alertmanager config for inhibition and routing. Apart from reducing the number of config options for inhibition and routing, these new matchers support negative matching and add consistency to the Silences UI. This talk compares the new style and old style matchers, as well as walks you through an example to show you how to use it."
