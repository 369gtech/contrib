description: "This talk will tour one of the most understated resources in the Android developer arsenal: the support tools.\n\nLearn how to enrich your methods and classes using annotations, so that Lint and Android Studio will be able to spot errors for you. Or use IntelliJ annotations to define contracts, and let the IDE warn you of potential issues before you even run your code once. Take advantage of the tools namespace to bend even the most cryptic XML resource to your will."
