recordingDate: 1449578951
description: "\"Java has lambdas\" is such an understatement. Sure, as programmers, weâ€™re interested in learning how to use lambdas. However, as curious programmers, we like to learn far more than that. How are lambdas implemented, and why are they implemented that way? This example-driven presentation discusses how to use lambdas and method references and takes a peek under the hood to reveal the internals and the consequences.\n\nSpeaker:\nVenkat Subramaniam, President, Agile Developer, Inc.\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., and an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with agile practices on their software projects. Venkat is a (co)author of multiple books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer. His latest book is Functional Programming in Java: Harnessing the Power of Java 8 Lambda Expressions. You can reach him by email at venkats@agiledeveloper.com or on twitter at @venkat_s."
