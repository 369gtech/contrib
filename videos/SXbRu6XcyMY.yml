description: "Pair programming is a really powerful way to greatly improve your development skills and make an application better. The idea is that two people working together are more focused, come up with better ideas, and fill in the gaps for each other. In fact, there have been studies that prove that two people working together increase productivity over working separately. The problem is that working together has historically meant being in the same office. So what do you do if you work remotely? Or if you are a solo developer? Or if you are working on an open-source project? Microsoft has tackled these issues by creating Live Sharing, a free tool built into Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. In this video, we are going to look at how to use Live Share, how to configure it, and what some of the advanced features are.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
