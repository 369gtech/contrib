recordingDate: 1577305873
description: 'It is pretty simple to design a back-end API, a demo UI for the API or wrap an existing web app into a mobile app. However, building a complex consumer solution requires much more. In this talk we will walk through the steps of design of such complex solution based on real-life examples from personal experience. This will be a no-code session. We will be focused on the work of an architect in the life-cycle of the product, spanning to various areas that should be covered in order to gain success.'
