title: 'Probabilistic programming and meta-programming in Clojure - Vikash Mansinghka'
language: English
recordingDate: 1543684324
description: 'Do you want to learn modern data science, without having to first learn advanced mathematics and statistics? The MIT Probabilistic Computing Project is developing new, open-source, Clojure-based probabilistic programming languages: Metaprob and BQL. BQL is an SQL-like language that aims to make it possible for millions of developers to solve challenging data science problems, by extending ordinary database concepts. Metaprob is a probabilistic meta-programming language that aims to make it possible to teach anyone who can learn Clojure the key principles of probabilistic artificial intelligence. This talk will give a gentle introduction to both BQL and Metaprob, describe ways to contribute to both projects, and showcase applications in improving mental health and respiratory care for children.'
