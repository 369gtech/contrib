description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nGhosts in the Runtime: Who Ate My Capabilities and Other Mysteries - Laurent Bernaille & Eric Mountain, Datadog\n\nIn the last 3 years Datadog migrated most of its workloads to dozens of Kubernetes clusters, many of which consist of thousands of nodes each. At this scale, our engineers encounter strange and surprising bugs on a regular basis. Some of the most difficult bugs to investigate are those related to the kubelet and its interactions with the container runtime.\n\nIn this talk we will share some of our favorite investigations on this front, such as the container image that only worked when built on our laptops, rather than by our CI. You'll leave with a stronger understanding of the low level components that are responsible of a critical task: running your containers."
