title: 'YOW! 2016 Trisha Gee - Java 8 (and 9!) in Anger'
recordingDate: 1486511858
description: "Java 9 is just around the corner, but many of us developers are still getting to grips with thinking in terms of Java 8 idioms. This presentation shows how use lambda expressions and the streams API to to build a fully working end-to-end application using minimal external dependencies and the very latest version of Java. In fact, since we’ll be using the OpenJDK Java 9 build, we’ll even sneak in some of the lesser-known Java 9 features and see how these are going to make developers’ lives easier.\n\nIn this session, Trisha will build, live on stage, an application that consumes a real-time feed of high velocity data, architected as small (possibly micro-sized) independent services that make sense of the data, and present it in a JavaFX dashboard. Along the way, we’ll encounter Java 8 streams, lambdas, new ways of working with collections (from Java 8 and 9), and bump into the new date and time API. As we design and build the application, we’ll see how to slice up our application into small, independent services, and almost certainly encounter some of the common issues around running a system in this fashion.\n\nTrisha has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing, software and non-profit, for companies of all sizes. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and dabbles with Open Source development. Trisha is a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group and a Java Champion, she believes community and sharing ideas helps us learn from mistakes and build on successes. She’s a Developer Advocate for JetBrains, which means she gets to share all the interesting things she’s constantly discovering.\n\nFor more on YOW!
