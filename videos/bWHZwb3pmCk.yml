description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #26\n14 August 2019\nSponsored and Hosted by booking.com\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nPsychotherapy can greatly improve patientsâ€™ mental health. Nevertheless, it is lengthy, costly, and often unsuccessful. While in great demand, current predictive models of treatment outcome are extremely imprecise and prone to biases. The MATRIX is a newly developed research tool for transforming sessions transcripts into sequences of code. Based on fixed algorithms, which make it ideal for ML, it allows us to model elements involved in therapeutic change and predict treatment outcome based on single therapy session. By incorporating clinical data with state-of-the-art methodology, The MATRIX initiative wishes to promote cutting-edge medical research, while contributing to the emerging interest of implementing NLP technologies into new fields.\n\nMor is a clinical psychology resident at Sheba Medical Center, and a PhD candidate at Tel-Aviv University.\nShe knows a lot about the human soul and much less about computer science, but she hope we could be friends.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
