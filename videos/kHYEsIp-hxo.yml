recordingDate: 1321062852
description: "Performance has always been something we at SPIL within Technology had thoughts about, but never really had full focus on. Within Development, the main focus has always been delivering features that the business requires from us; performance was never a mindset that we had during the creation of these features. As we have a global audience of 130 million unique visitors visiting our portals daily, we came to the conclusion that we needed to have more focus in the field of performance. We could get so much more out of our current users, by increasing their browsing experience not only from well connected broadband countries but also from countries that have more scattered performance.\n\nWe'll share with you what we had to do to get Performance on the map, challenges we faced, what we've been able to achieve so far and the lessons we've learned up until this point. Performance is now fully on our radar and we still have many things we can and will improve."
