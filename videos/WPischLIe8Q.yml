We will go through \"\"a day in the life of a message\"\" to explore the different patterns used by RabbitMQ to handle message ingres, routing and message delivery.\n\nWe are going to go over areas like:\n\n- How Erlang Pattern Matching is used to implement the AMQP protocol.\n- RabbitMQ Boot System: How does the broker boots until it's ready to accept messages.\n- A day in the life of a message: The path a message takes while passing across RabbitMQ.\n- Flow Control for Erlang Processes and the Credit Flow implementation.\n- Supervisor Trees, RabbitMQ own behaviours and more."
