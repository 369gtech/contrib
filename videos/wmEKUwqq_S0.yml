recordingDate: 1634412541
description: "The third episode of the podcast is devoted to the broadly understood front-end technology, in particular the beloved Angular.\n\nToday we're focusing on Ivy.\n\n1. What exactly is Ivy and what does it do differently than the previous Angular compiler?\n\n2. What do we have to do, to use Ivy?\n\n3. Ivy allows to shrink an Angular-based Hello World Application to just 14 KB. How is that possible?\n\n4. What’s with real-world-applications?\n\n5. Ivy allows lazy loading of components? Why is this great and why hasn’t this been possible before?\n\n6. Are there any other things that Ivy enables?\n\n7. How will optional NgModules work?\n\n8. Zone-less Change Detection - why do we need Ivy for it?\n\n9. How does Ivy enable meta programming and dynamic components?\n\n10. Do we need to migrate to Ivy?\n\nAnd a lot more!\n\nhttps://angularmaster.dev \n\nhttps://ng-poland.pl\n\nhttps://js-poland.pl"
