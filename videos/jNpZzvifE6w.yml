description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nTill Rohrmann, Engineering Lead at data Artisans (Jörg Schad, Core Developer at Mesosphere couldn't make it to the talk)\n\nApache Mesos allows operators to run distributed applications across an entire datacenter and is attracting ever increasing interest. As much as distributed applications see increased use enabled by Mesos, Mesos also sees increasing use due to a growing ecosystem of well integrated applications. One of the latest additions to the Mesos family is Apache Flink. Flink is one of the most popular open source systems for real-time high scale data processing and allows users to deal with low-latency streaming analytical workloads on Mesos. In this talk we explain the challenges solved while integrating Flink with Mesos, including how Flink’s distributed architecture can be modeled as a Mesos framework, and how Flink was integrated with Fenzo. Next, we describe how Flink was packaged to easily run on DC/OS.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-berlin-2017-jrg-schad-till-rohrmann-apache-flink-meets-apache-mesos-and-dcos\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
