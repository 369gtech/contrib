The API made it possible for developers to create high performance, rich, geospatial web applications purely in JavaScript and HTML. This year, we'll discuss advanced Earth API topics such as programmatic regionation for visualizing large datasets, user interaction techniques, and 3D animation.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
