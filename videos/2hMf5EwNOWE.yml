description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/mploed/ddd-strategic-design-with-spring-boot-examples\n\nOne of the most precious parts of Domain Driven Design are the concepts of Strategic Design. These concepts include the Bounded Context, the Context Map and the patterns that are being documented in the Context Map.\n\nThis talk explains all of the topics mentioned above as well as practical usage scenarios such as migrating a monolithic landscape to Microservices. In order to get hands-on I will also demonstrate the concepts surrounding Strategic Design with an application landscape of various Spring Boot Applications."
