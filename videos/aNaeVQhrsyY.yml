description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMartin Fowler - Author, speaker, consultant and general loud-mouth on software development\nErik Doernenburg,\nHead of Technology Europe at ThoughtWorks\n\nABSTRACT\nOur talk will begin with one of the core themes of the early development of agile software - that  those involved in software development should take a more collaborative role, not just building software but helping to determine how software can help its users. We believe that this engagement requires greater knowledge of a user’s goals and also responsibility for the user’s welfare and our impact on the world. While the internet has brought great benefits in communication, it’s also led to an unprecedented opportunity for mass surveillance, both by states and private corporations.\n\nWe’ll discuss how defeating such surveillance requires greater security in our communication, reversing recent centralization, and attention to user experience. For the last year Erik has been leading a team to apply these principles to email. We will explain why the argument of “I have nothing to hide” is flawed and why it is our our responsibility to take up this task.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
