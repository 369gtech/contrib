description: "If you are part of a team which seems enslaved by their leader, or if you are a leader who sees the team as your little disobedient minions, this talk is for you.\n\nIn this talk we will learn some of the common leadership pitfalls that can lead to the perception of a system described above.\n\nWe will see why some teams detach themselves from their leader, and why some leaders do the same.\n\nAnd finally, we will learn two important things: how to be a team member that doesn’t disappoint the leader, and how to be a leader that is also a team player."
