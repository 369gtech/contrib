title: 'Managing Animations (Sanely) in (Insanely) Complex Apps'
language: English
recordingDate: 1557865086
description: "So you’re done writing the core of your app. It got pretty hairy but you pulled through. You abstracted the business logic, broke down everything into components and mastered the flow of your app state. Good job! Go get yourself a victory cookie. Oh wait, you can’t, because a legion of designers and motion artists are headed your way chanting something about “storyboards” and “microinteractions”. How will that even fit in with your beautiful architecture? Unlike state changes which can be instantaneous, animations inherently take time to complete - and that’s a big problem. In this talk we’ll tackle the challenges of adding animations to apps with complex state management. We’ll learn how to orchestrate animations across multiple components while tying it neat and tidy to the app state while working with frameworks like React, Vue and Angular.\n\nEVENT:\n\nYou Gotta Love Frontend Code Camp 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPher Vishnia\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqClaDilv90"
