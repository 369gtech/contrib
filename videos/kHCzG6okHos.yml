description: "Get the Diagrams: http://goo.gl/eGk21\n\nWelcome to the 4th part of my Object Oriented Design tutorial. I show you how to plan your first iteration. I explain all of the parts of the Elaboration phase of Object Oriented Design.\n\nThen I take the Usage Case I made in part 3 of this tutorial, and convert it into a Domain Model. I cover all of the following: conceptual classes, how to build domain models, turning nouns into classes, associations and how to tell an attribute from a class.\n\nThis is a big tutorial, but the diagram linked to above will help you learn this stuff."
