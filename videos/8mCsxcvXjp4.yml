recordingDate: 1631118046
description: "Ближайшая конференция: \nDotNext 2021 Moscow — 21-22 октября, онлайн.\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/3BTQype\n\n. In this talk, Oren Eini, founder of RavenDB, is going to take apart a database engine on stage. We are going to inspect all the different pieces that make for an industrial-grade database engine, from the way the data is laid out on disk to how the database is ensuring that transactions are durable. We'll explore algorithms such as B+Tree, write-ahead logs, discuss concurrency strategies and how different features of the database work together to achieve the end goals."
