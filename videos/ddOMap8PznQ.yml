language: English
recordingDate: 1526038966
description: "Held on April 20 2018\n\nAndy Rivenes (@TheInMemoryGuy) and Maria Colgan (@SQLMaria) focused on a deep dive into hash joins and how they are used with Database In-Memory to make joins lightning fast. The session began by reviewing how traditional hash joins work and then addressed Bloom filters and how Database In-Memory uses them to effectively turn hash joins into scan and filter operations. The use of Join Groups was then discussed as a way to further enhance join performance in 12.2 and beyond.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n\nmusic: bensound.com"
