title: 'Anton Rutkevich – Writing a truly testable code'
recordingDate: 1481037740
description: 'Many developers understand why testing is so important, but not everyone is writing tests on a daily basis. One of the most common issues is that it’s hard to test a codebase that was not designed to be testable. This talk will cover how to write code that can be tested easily. We will also talk about how to introduce testing to an existing not-test-ready codebase. While things like Android, MVP, Kotlin, Rx will be used in examples, understanding of these technologies is not strictly required. Also, the approach itself is generic enough to be used on any platform or with any language.'
