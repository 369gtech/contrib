language: English
recordingDate: 1609866593
description: "Talk\nNetworkX is an established fundamental Python package for the analysis of complex networks; using real-world examples, I will describe our basic data model, provide an overview of features including supported data formats and algorithms, and discuss recent improvements.\n\nSpeaker \nJarrod Millman is a PhD candidate in biostatistics at UC Berkeley. He received a BA in mathematics and computer science from Cornell University in 1998. After working at the Center for Neuroscience at UC Davis, he came to UC Berkeley in 2000â€”first to design the data analysis system for the Brain Imaging Center and then as the director of research computing for the Neuroscience Institute. At Berkeley, Jarrod cofounded the Neuroimaging in Python project. He was the NumPy and SciPy release manager from 2007 to 2009. He cofounded NumFOCUS and served on its board from 2011 to 2015. Currently, he is the release manager of NetworkX.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
