title: 'Winning The Performance Race- Gil Eckstein'
recordingDate: 1630403835
description: "For the past 2 years, Gil's team has been rewriting one of the most important applications in Wix - the Wix site rendered. A generic renderer for all Wix websites that can render almost any kind of website you can think of.\nOn that scale, just making it work is a huge challenge, let alone making it work fast.\nAs our user's expectations of performance increased, they had to focus on making the fastest site renderer in the world.\n\nIn this talk, Gil discusses the most critical design decisions his team took to make their application as performant as possible. Gil dives deep into the performance issues they had in their previous applications, describes how they fixed them, and also explains how you can apply the same concepts in your web application.\n\n// Bio:\n\nFor the last 4 years, Gil has been a part of building the application that renders Wix websites. As a member of the platform team, he creates the ability for Wix and non-Wix developers to extend Wix capabilities. With over 6 years of experience in software development, he started his career in networking and linux, but was always passionate about web development. In his free time, you can find him working out at the park, playing basketball, and also working and maintaining his own NBA website webisports.com."
