title: 'Aaron Greenwald - Scaling Mobile Development with React Native'
recordingDate: 1536920885
description: "React Native is great for developing large applications across multiple teams, but only if you architect your app well. See the code and architecture that allows us to have disconnected teams working on separate modules but delivering a cohesive product that users feel is just one unified app. How many developers do you have working on your React Native app? One? Less than five? 15? What if you had over 40? React Native is a good fit for developing large applications across multiple teams in a company, but only if you architect your app correctly. Less than two years ago, I could count all of the developers working on our app on one hand. Now, I don’t even know everyone’s names. Learn how we architected the Wix app in a way that allows us to have multiple teams on multiple continents working on separate modules but delivering a cohesive product that users feel is just one unified app.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
