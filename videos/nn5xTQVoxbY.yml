description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nMurray Thom - VP of Software and Quantum Cloud Services at D-Wave\n\nABSTRACT\nIn the past, quantum computing was largely reserved for researchers, physicists, and scientists with direct access to physical quantum computing systems. But the game has changed, thanks to the cloud. Barriers to quantum computing are coming down quickly.\nToday, cloud access (like D-Wave’s Leap quantum application environment) and improvements in quantum computing hardware, software, and developer tools are allowing programmers around the world to code on live quantum computers in real-time. Developers, students, and researchers around the world can now tap into the power of a quantum via their browser — quantum mechanical knowledge not required. Users and private companies have already built over 150 early applications on D-Wave’s computers in industries ranging from automotive to machine learning, aerospace, finance, and beyond. The quantum application era is here, and the growing quantum developer community is making it a reality.\nIn this session, Murray Thom, Vice President of Software and Cloud Services at D-Wave, will talk about the burgeoning quantum application development ecosystem, and how developers can start learning to code on a quantum computer today. Murray will also explore some of the early [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/983/fueling-the-quantum-application-era-with-the-cloud\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\n#QuantumComputing #QC #QuantumComputers #Cloud\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
