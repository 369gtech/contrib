description: "by Olivier Courtin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.126/geo_osmdeeplearning.webm\n\n\nQuality Analysis on a wide dataset, is always a gageure.\nAnd automatic semantic segmentation from imagery is still an open subject since decades.\nBut.\nNowadays with latests DeepLearning techniques, we can use new kind of techniques,\nto easily extract patterns from our dataset, and therefore help humans to be that more efficient to take the right decision (think filtering). \n\nTwo main points on this presentation:\n- How to produce high quality results, while you start with noisy/creapy/real world data ?\n- How to predict, at scale without huge hardware infrastructure ? \n\nRoboSat.pink as the ecosystem to do so. \n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:00:00+01"
