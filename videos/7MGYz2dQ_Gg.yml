description: "https://media.ccc.de/c/asg2017/ASG2017-122-software_updates_for_connected_linux_devices_key_requirements\n\n\n\nA key requirement for connected Linux devices is the ability to deploy remote software updates to them so that bugs, vulnerabilities and new features can be addressed while devices live in the field for up to 10 years.\n\nAs part of the Mender.io project, we have interviewed more than 100 embedded developers to understand best practices and the current state of enabling software updates for connected devices today. The key requirements found during this study can be split into the following areas we cover:\n\n- Robustness\n- Ease\n- Performant\n- Secure\n- Extensible\n\n\n\nDrew Moseley"
