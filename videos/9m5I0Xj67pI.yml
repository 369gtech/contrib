title: 'Oracle On Demand Lab   Microservices on Kubernetes and Autonomous Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604500047
description: "The topic of containers and microservices is a subject on its own but suffice to say that breaking up large, complex software into more manageable pieces that run isolated from each other has many advantages. Itâ€™s easier to deploy, diagnose and provides better availability since failure of any microservice limits downtime to a portion of the application. \n\nThis lab on-demand will walk you through the steps to set up a CI/CD environment for developing Microservices, based on the automation possible in Developer Cloud and deploying all components on Oracle's Managed Container platform and the ATP database.\n\nLab Guide link: https://oracle.github.io/cloudtestdrive/AppDev/ATP-OKE/livelabs-trial/?customTrackingParam=:so:yt:or:awr:odv::RC_WWMK200730P00046:OnDemandhol\n\nFree Tier Account Link: https://signup.oraclecloud.com/?sourceType=:em:lw:ie:pt::RC_WWMK200730P00046:EMEAHOL20OCT\n\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
