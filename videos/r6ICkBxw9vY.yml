description: "http://topconf.com/university/ & http://topconf.com/\nBy Gert Post & Tiit RÃ¤tsep\nCisco IBSG predicts the number of Internet-connected things will reach 50 billion by 2020, which equates to more than six devices for every person on Earth. Many of us in the developed world already have three or more full-time devices connected to the Internet when factoring in PCs, smartphones, tablets, television devices and the like. Next up are sensor networks, using low-power sensors that collect, transmit, analyze and distribute data on a massive scale.\nWe will give an overview how to create such networks, what have we done in the past, what are the benefits of such networks, how much software is in every sensor, what are the challenges, security issues, use cases for smart cities and more."
