description: 'Develop a robust RESTful web API is not a simple task. How to manage the error handling? Which format to use for the data exchange? How to manage the content negotiation? What about the versioning? How to build an authentication system? How to produce the API documentation? In this talk we will show how to design and implement a REST architecture using Apigility, the open source API builder for PHP (http://apigility.org).'
