description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\n“Modules” are a frequently requested and long-awaited feature by C++ programmers.  In a nutshell, the idea is to have a direct language support for (a) expressing the boundaries and dependencies of a program component; (b) isolating source codes from macro vagaries; (c) scaling compile time, especially for large projects, given the ubiquity of “headers-only” template libraries; (d) spur innovation and deployment of semantics-aware developer tools.\n\nThis presentation will focus on three major points: (1) the design of the module proposal currently being considered by the C++ standards committee (design goals, properties, constraints); (2) implementations currently under way; and (3) early user experience and migration.\n\nModules directly address a problem (scalability) listed as one of the three major areas where C++17 is expected to significantly improve daily experience of the working C++ programmer.  Naturally, this feature is  also on the top ten list of C++17 functionalities Bjarne Stroustrup put forward in his “Thought on C++17.” \n— \nGabriel Dos Reis is a Principal Software Development Engineer at Microsoft. He is also a researcher and a longtime member of the C++ community.  His research interests include programming tools for dependable software. Prior to joining Microsoft, he was Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University.  Dr. Dos Reis was a recipient of the 2012 National Science Foundation CAREER award for his research in compilers for dependable computational mathematics and educational activities.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
