description: "by Sławomir Maludziński\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.201/neverlanguage.webm\n\n\nNever is a simple functional programming language. Technically it may be classified as syntactically scoped, statically typed, call by value, functional programming language. In practise Never offers basic data types, assignment, control flow, exceptions, arrays, first order functions and some mathematical functions to make it useful to calculate expressions. The language itself is an example how minimalistic language can be created as a hobby project in several months and used to solve interesting problems. \n\nThe presentation outlines Never language features and presents its capabilities by demonstrating simple neural network supervised learning algorithm. During the talk audience will learn why the language was created, which solutions are used under the hood and about its possible future extensions. \n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:10:00+01"
