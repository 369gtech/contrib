It’s a very powerful abstraction provided by many programming languages such as Haskell and OCaml, and more recently, Rust, Scala, and Swift.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss the proposal in flight (https://wg21.link/p1371) to add pattern matching as a language feature in the C++. We’ll discuss why pattern matching is more relevant today to C++ than ever before, examples of how pattern matching simplifies the structure of code, and discuss the details of the concrete features being proposed.\n\nThe goal of the talk is to build an intuition for pattern matching, and gather feedback of the state of an early stage proposal.\n— \nMichael Park\nSoftware Engineer, Facebook\nI'm a software engineer at Facebook, working on the C++ libraries and standards team. My focus for C++ is to introduce pattern matching to facilitate better code.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
