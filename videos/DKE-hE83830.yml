description: "Viktor Gamov, Solutions Architect, Confluent\nBaruch Sadogursky, Developer Advocate, JFrog\n\nCan you find a malicious activity needle in the haystack of events on one of the busiest distribution hubs in the world? Processing the streaming events from the Bintray Firehose API with Kafka Streams can give you the superpower to do that.
