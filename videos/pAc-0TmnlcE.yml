description: "Everything you always wanted to know about Scala but were afraid to ask. If you want to be able to optimize your use of the Scala programming language to solve real world problems without explosions, broken thumbs or bullet wounds then this is the session for you. During the presentation there will be a lot of do’s and don’t’s in order to guide you into how to become a better Scala developer.\n\nCo-founder of Triplequote, a company aiming at boosting Scala teams' productivity. Mirco has 10+ year experience with Scala, and he has contributed to several open source projects such as Lagom, Playframework, Scala IDE for Eclipse, and the Scala language. Before founding his own company, he worked at Lightbend (formerly Typesafe), where he wore different hats: from engineering, to consulting, and, fun fact, even sales! He is a certified Lightbend trainer for Akka, Playframework, and Scala. He loves meeting people and sharing experiences. In his freetime, he plays chess and studies wine - both theory and practice! :)"
