description: "Presented by Feross at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday May 29th 2014 -\nWebRTC changes everything! For the first time, we can do peer-to-peer, or client-to-client, communication in the browser without plugins, extensions, or a software installation. This enables an entirely new class of applications to be built for the web!\nThis talk will look at WebTorrent, a BitTorrent client for the browser that fully-interoperates with the regular BitTorrent network. WebTorrent uses WebRTC Data Channels and special \"hybrid clients\" to connect to the wider BitTorrent network. By making BitTorrent easier, we're making it accessible to new swathes of users who were previously intimidated, confused, or unwilling to install a program on their computer to participate.\n\n* twitter.com/feross\n* github.com/feross"
