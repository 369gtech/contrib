title: 'YOW! 2020 Online - Felienne Hermans - How to Read Complex Code without Getting a Headache'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624249222
description: "Research shows that on average developers spend about 58 percent of their time on reading code! However, we are not explicitly taught reading code in school or in boot camps, and we rarely practice code reading too. \_\nMaybe you have never thought about it, but reading code can be confusing in many ways. Code in which you do not understand the variable names causes a different type of confusion from code that is very coupled to other code. In this talk, Felienne Hermans, associate professor at Leiden University, will firstly dive into the cognitive processes that play a role when reading code. She will then show you theories for reading code, and close the talk with some hands-on techniques that can be used to read to any piece of code with more ease and fewer headaches!\nFelienne\_is associate professor at the\_Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science\_at Leiden University, where she heads the\_PERL research group, focused on programming education. She also works at the\_Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\_for one day a week, where she teaches\_prospective computer science teachers.\nFelienne is the creator of the\_Hedy programming language, and was one of the founders of the\_Joy of Coding conference. Since 2016, she has been a host at\_SE radio, one of the most popular software engineering podcasts on the web.\nFelienne is a member the board of\_I&I, the Dutch association of high-school computer science teachers, and of\_TC39, the committee that designs JavaScript.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
