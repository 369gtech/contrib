description: "DOES19 Las Vegas â€” Your organization is successfully transforming to DevOps but part of the environment seems to be slowing everything down. The back end mainframe systems continue to take longer to change, and have limited ability to innovate and experiment. What if you could use the same practices and even many of the same open source tools to apply the same dynamic environment practices to the mainframe.\n \nThis session will show how it is possible to use the same open source tools to build a pipeline for z/OS including dynamic provisioning of resources, isolated testing environments and production deployment. See infrastructure as code practices applied to the mainframe environment and learn how the transformation is possible.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
