description: 'Griffon 2.0 has fully embraced the Groovy ecosystem by leveraging many Groovy related projects such as Gradle, Lazybones, Spock and Groovy itself of course. This session presents lessons learned by using all of these projects to build and maintain the Griffon build, a large multi-project setup with interesting constraints and needs. We''ll also visit the new features brought by the latest Griffon release.'
