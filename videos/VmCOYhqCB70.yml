recordingDate: 1357761475
description: "In the support community, there is a common misconception that \"support\" and \"social media\" are different things. In the Zendesk customer support tool, that line is blurred, as Twitter and Facebook are integrated right into the product. This webinar explains the Twitter and Facebook channels of support, empowering users of Zendesk to connect with customers directly through these social media channels. The benefit to your support team is that conversations are captured, and the benefit to your customers is that they will feel like their voice is valued by your organization. The webcast explains how to set up Twitter and Facebook in Zendesk, and explains many of the best practices for using them effectively.\n\nIn this webcast you will learn:\n\nFirst steps for your social media integration\nConnecting a Twitter account with Zendesk\nCapturing Twitter conversations\nEngaging with the Twittersphere\nChanging channels\nLinking Zendesk with Facebook\nPublic support conversation best practices\nSocial media user management\nPrioritizing social media conversations\nBest practices for responding efficiently\nAnalyzing your social customer care platform\n\nAbout Stafford Vaughan-\n\nStafford Vaughan started computer programming at an early age.
