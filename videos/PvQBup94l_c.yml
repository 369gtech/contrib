description: 'What can machine learning actually do for your game? In this talk, I’ll discuss the matches (and mismatches) between research and the realities of publishing games. I’ll introduce TensorFlow -- an open source machine learning library -- in a game-developer friendly way, and look to the future of where machine learning can help developers create fresh, exciting games. This talk is suitable for developers without prior experience in ML.'
