In this talk, Matthias and Bernd will describe SAP’s journey from its first steps with Cloud Foundry to amending SAP Cloud Platform public PaaS with Cloud Foundry. From a pure consumption of Cloud Foundry to an active involvement in the Cloud Foundry foundation and open source activities. From a small AWS deployment to a multi-cloud strategy. Additionally, they will talk about the challenges and gaps that needed to be filled to cover Enterprise requirements that SAP’s customers demand and the additional challenges they see when moving a Cloud Foundry deployment towards the currently known limits."
