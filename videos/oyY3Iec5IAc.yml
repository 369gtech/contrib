title: 'Splitting the monolith | Jimmy Bogard | #LeadDevAustin'

description: "After years—even decades—on the existing legacy mainframe, we pitched a plan to migrate a company to a new, microservices-based architecture. Convincing management seemed easy, but now we have to deliver: Take the years-old legacy system and break it apart into smaller services and systems we can actually maintain.\n\nBut where to start? How do we decide what gets migrated first? How do we define our service boundaries? And how do we make sure everyone involved—from users to operations—is on board and excited about the new system when we’ve most certainly moved their cheese?\n\nIn this session, we’ll look at strategies to bust apart the monolith, from the front-end to the back. We’ll also review database refactoring techniques that help us keep our risk down. Finally, we’ll explore analysis tools that guide us through the tangled web of dependencies in legacy code so we can deliver robust new systems without breaking the old.\n\nAbout Jimmy Bogard\nJimmy is Headspring’s Chief Architect, evaluating potential technologies and bringing the most cutting edge to the table.
