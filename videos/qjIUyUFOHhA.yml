recordingDate: 1460792089
description: 'ClojureBridge is a nonprofit organization that provides free, inclusive workshops in Clojure to women. Over the past two years, the Clojure community has written a curriculum, developed an organizing guide, and started teaching workshops--but, how have those workshops played out in practice? In this talk, we''ll look at what it takes to organize and run a successful ClojureBridge workshop, hearing from those who have done it, themselves!'
