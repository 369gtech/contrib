description: ".NET Core includes a powerful functional programming language called F#. But how do you use it well?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll talk about examples of F# code I love and why. Along the way, I’ll talk about how it relates to doing language design, functional programming, object programming, language features and the “sweet spot” for using functional-first programming both as an individual and in teams. Much of it will be other people’s code.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
