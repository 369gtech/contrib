description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Etienne Caron, Shopify.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=171059\n\nManaging state in client-server applications is challenging. User operations spanning multiple screens, flaky network calls, rolling back stale transactions, offline mode support, the list goes on and on.\r\n\r\nFunctional-Reactive architectures have become a popular choice over the last few years to solve these types of problems. But, whether you choose MVVM or MVI, Redux or Flux, RxJava or Flow, React over Flutter over Native development, it shouldn't matter. Aren't there some core ideas you could reuse everywhere?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll be focusing on Unidirectional Data Flow, Immutable Data Stores, State Machines, and error handling strategies. Using these core ideas, we'll build a mental toolbox that you can use in your own Kotlin multi-platform projects."
