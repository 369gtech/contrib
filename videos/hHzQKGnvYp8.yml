description: "The “out of the box” template has some lowest common denominator / simplicity tradeoffs that make it easy to understand and work with in a variety of scenarios, but there are lots of performance and deployment tweaks that experienced developers should make before deploying.\n\nIf you had one hour to tweak a new project, what would you do? I'll include some top open source libraries, best practices from ASP.NET Community Standup links, recommendations from the ASP.NET Core team, etc.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
