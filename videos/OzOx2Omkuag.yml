description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nStaying agile as businesses scale is tough and filled with conflicts -- data models and processes become more rigid, while new use cases for data keep showing up. On top of this, your clients (and co-workers!) will find new ways to break things, ways that you could never have imagined in your wildest dreams.  This is the domain of The Erlang Way - not just for your application and/or your systems, but for your entire organization.\nJoin me as I take you through the application of the Erlang mindset to all aspects of your business (with pictures!)"
