Without proper protection & monitoring, your microservices are vulnerable to hackers, self-inflicted denial of service attacks, and extremely high infrastructure costs. Furthermore, as internal data centers begin to mirror the Cloud itself, developers and architects need to rethink services monitoring and protection for both externalized microservice APIs and internal APIs. Attend this session to learn what is the right type of protection (OAuth / Throttling) and monitoring (e.g. bot monitoring) you need to put in place to avoid your microservices becoming a mega-disaster.\n\nSpeakers: Alan Ho; Head of Developer Programs, Apigee. Sandeep Murusupalli; Solutions Architect, Apigee."
