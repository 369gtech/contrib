description: "Let’s assume you’ve already had every *Docker 101 tutorial* for breakfast. You’re now ready to take that brilliantly crafted application into production. But wait… first you need to test your container-based microservices architecture. What does the whole DevOps workflow look like? What about performance and security? And last but not least; how the hell do I run my microservices in production, and will it scale?\n\nLet Daniël guide you through the wonderful world of container-based development and running microservice architectures at scale. By attending the talk*, you’ll gain insight into how to bootstrap and dive straight into learning what DevOps workflow should look like when using containers.\nDevOps Pro Vilnius 2016 - http://goo.gl/D9eDT7"
