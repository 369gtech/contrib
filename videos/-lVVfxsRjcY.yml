description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nA core part of any code is the ability to know at any given time the set of conditions that make up its current operations. As developers, we need to know this for a variety of reasons, including because knowing this tells us whether we should be queuing any changes and gives us the ability to return a user to their current experience should the program be interrupted. But despite its crucial nature, codifying the state of an application at any given point in time can often be messy and error prone work. In this talk, we'll look at the reasons representing state can be problematic, and some practical ways we can leverage Kotlin to make it better. This talk is both a theoretical look at how the types we choose influence our ability to validate programs, and a practical exploration of concrete steps we can take to rectify these issues with Kotlin.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nChristina Lee is a software engineer and GDE at Pinterest, where she works on UI frameworks."
