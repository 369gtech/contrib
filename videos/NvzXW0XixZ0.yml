description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v\n\nNerves of steel | Jon Carstens - Software Engineer\n\nABSTRACT\nNerves is an up-and-coming framework combining Elixir & Linux for powerful embedded development. Feature packed, backed by the BEAM, and simple to get working on a device. But what about when it doesn’t work? When your flawless code has made your device inert? What if it's unreachable by a human? Guess it’s a brick now… Or We leverage the awesome power of Nerves+BEAM to make ultra-resilient embedded devices! In this talk, we dive into some useful practices for ensuring your Nerves device stays up.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nDiscuss some best-practices for using Nerves+Beam on embedded devices to make them more resilient and fault-tolerant. Practices that will help ensure your device is always up and reachable, even if some bad firmware gets applied, which will greatly reduce hardware troubleshooting burdens.\n\nThis will be especially useful for those looking to use Nerves devices in production/industrial applications.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE\nHardware enthusiasts, hobbyists, or individuals looking to use Nerves in a more industrial application.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\n  LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/27159258\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
