title: 'Yolo V5 Snowboarding LIVE'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609092297
description: "I like to snowboard and i like to code. Guess it's time to combine these 2 interests into one live video!! I'm going to strap a GoPro to myself as i snowboard to record training data. Then, we're going to use the latest version of the popular YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect other snowboarders automatically. We'll look at the history of Object Detection and algorithms, then come to interesting conclusions about what makes the latest version of YOLO unique. Using the bounding boxes will help me improve my own ability to navigate and analyze different snowboarding techniques effectively. AI tech is amazing, but let's talk less about it and just build it for our own day to day uses. I'm going to ask you 3 questions about Object Detection, so i'm going to need you to start studying from my list of curated learning resources below. 3 Data Wizards will win $50 in BTC each this week, everyone on Earth is eligible, get hype!  \n\nAnswer live questions here:\nwww.itempool.com/llSourcell/live\n\nTrain custom data on YOLO: \nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data \n\nSubscribe for more educational videos!
