description: "Devoxx4Kids is a global effort to inspire teenagers and kids in computer programming, robotics, and electronics. This is achieved by delivering workshops on Scratch, Minecraft modding, Java programming, Greenfoot, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, NAO robots, and a variety of other topics. This hands-on lab shares the materials used in these workshops and provides guidance on how to use them. The attendees will experience several simulated workshops and learn tips on how to allocate time for different activities to provide a joyful and fun experience. The lab also provides tips on how to open a local Devoxx4Kids chapter. If you are a parent or would like to run these workshops in your local neighborhood, this workshop is for you!\n\n\nAuthors:\nArun Gupta\nArun Gupta is Director of Developer Advocacy at Red Hat and focuses on JBoss Middleware.
