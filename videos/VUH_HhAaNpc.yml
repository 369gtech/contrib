description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nJohn Napier - Works with Developers on Software Fundamentals for DRW\n\nABSTRACT\nFor years, the conventional wisdom around attempting pure functional programming in Java has been \"don't\", and for plenty of good reasons: lambdas weren't supported until the eighth major release of the language specification, creating value types is a verbose, ceremony-riddled exercise devoid of any first-class syntax, and neither are the majority of the data structures shipped in the JDK immutable, nor are interfaces a proper substitute in general for type classes.\nStill, it's a shame for developers to have to seemingly choose between the myriad benefits of functional programming and the maturity of the java compiler, the investments made into the ecosystem by major organizations, and the ease of hireability especially when some of these short-comings can be addressed externally.\n\nIn this talk I'll present Lambda, a Java library that offers:\n\n• A first-class model for functors, applicative functors, monads, coproducts, and more algebraic and category theoretic structures\n• Lazy evaluation\n• Profunctor optics\n• Semigroups and Monoids\n• Type-safe heterogeneous structures like HLists and HMaps\n• and more...\n\nThe goal of this talk is to present this library as a viable option for experienced Java development teams that wish they could use some of the functional programming capabilities [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/830\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#Java #FunctionalProgramming #HLists #HMaps #Lambda"
