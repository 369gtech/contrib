description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2019 Conference: https://jsnation.com\n\n# Webpack 5 - Why Breaking Changes? What is next?\n\nA changelog only tells half of the story. In this talk I want to talk about the reasoning behind some of the breaking changes in the next webpack version. I try to convince you that doing these breaking changes is worth it and we are not randomly trying to make migration harder."
