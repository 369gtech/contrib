We care about continuous learning and found out that remote working platforms and collaboration tools won't cover all the features we expected, because they are too broad or too specific. So we are building Tich to bring the best experience for students and instructors into a virtual classroom using awesome technologies like Elixir, Phoenix Channels, Janus WebRTC, Vue.js, Elm and Apple Pencil.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/anayeli-malvaez/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ANAYELI MALVAEZ\nElixir passionate programmer\n\nAnayeli Malvaez is a Senior Backend Developer at Bunsan. For some years, she tried to learn how to code without success until she got to know Elixir. She found her true passion for coding using that language. With the help of the community she met at the Mexico city's Elixir meetup, she improved her skills and became a programmer.  For the last two years, she has been using Elixir and now she would love to be able to transmit what she has learned.\n\nMore on Anayeli Malvaez: https://codesync.global/speaker/anayeli-malvaez/\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER - PEDRO HERNANDEZ\nCyberpunk enthusiast\n\nPedro Hernandez is a Software Engineer at Bunsan.io passionate about computer science education.
