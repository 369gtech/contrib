title: 'Geospatial Analysis for the Smart City | Prof. Martin Christen FHNW  [PyData Südwest / Big Data BBQ]'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634673607
description: "Geospatial data is data containing a spatial component – describing objects with a reference to the planet's surface. This data usually consists of a spatial component, of various attributes, and sometimes of a time reference (where, what, and when).\n\nIn this talk it is shown how to do spatial queries and routing in a city using open data and how to display the results on a map. We will calculate various routes in Mannheim and retrieve points of interest and interact with them using Python.\n\nProf. Martin Christen\nUniversity of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland FHNW\nEuroPython board member, Vorstand Python Software Verband e.V.\n\n\n\nPyData Südwest: https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/PyData-Suedwest/\nEvent website: https://www.koenigsweg.com/big-data-bbq2021-community/index_eng.html\n\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
