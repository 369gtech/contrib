description: "Andreas Stefik\nChad Fowler\nJessica Kerr\nSteve Vinoski\nViktor Klang \n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel once said that \"The only thing we learn from history that we learn nothing from history\". While the context and era was different, these wise words can also be applied to the software industry. Why are we repeating the same mistakes done by others decades ago? Why are we reinventing the wheel when tackling problems already researched and solved, and in doing so, reinventing them badly? We are trying to reach nirvana, where programming languages are not only beautiful, but also useful. Compact, easy to maintain and predictable.\n\nBut in our quest to do so, we seem to be taking two steps forward and one step back. In this panel debate, representatives from the industry will be discussing and debating with the audience (and language inventors) on the reasons we are in the mess we're in and what we need to do to get out of it"
