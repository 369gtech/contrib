description: ".NET Summit 2020 Online Edition https://dotnetsummit.by - the 4th community driven .NET conference dedicated to practical experience of solving business challenges with .NET and technical challenges in .NET application\n\nMichael Yarichuk, Why Databases Cry At Night [EN]\n\nIn the dark of the night, if you listen carefully enough, you can hear databases cry. But why? As developers, we rarely consider what happens under the hood of widely used abstractions such as databases. As a consequence, we rarely think about the performance of databases. This is especially true to less widespread, but often very useful NoSQL databases. \n\nIn this talk we will take a close look at NoSQL database performance, peek under the hood of the most frequently used features to see how they affect performance and discuss performance issues and bottlenecks inherent to all databases.\n\nGeneral Partner - ISsoft - https://issoft.by"
