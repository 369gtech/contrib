description: "Pixel Perfect Code: How to Marry Interaction and Visual Design the Android Way\r\n- Chris Nesladek\r\n\r\nA great user experience incorporates three pillars: structure, behavior, and expression. In this preview, Chris Nesladek talks about the wide variety of interaction design patterns built into the Android system framework. He also demos an example of a well-designed Android app that illustrates how these three pillars can be used together.\r\n\r\nFor those who are attending I/O, we thought it might be useful to hear from some of the speakers in advance. These videos provide a preview of one or more topics that will be covered in their talks."
