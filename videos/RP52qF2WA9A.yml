language: English
recordingDate: 1604367984
description: "With the new release cadence, programmers can enjoy new features at a much faster rate. Java has been evolving rapidly, but in a responsible manner. While some of the new recent features in Java have been around in other languages for a while there are some coolness for them being introduced in Java. First, programmers who are maintaining large legacy systems can make use of these exciting features, right there in Java as they move forward to adopting newer versions. Second, Java brings its own twist and innovation to how these features are used in the language. Learning these is not only an exciting journey but can also make us more productive when writing Java code. In this presentation we will take a live coding, example driven approach to look at a few features that have been added to Java in the most recent releases of the language.\n\nAdditional Resources:\nJava Programming MTA Certification: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/mta-introduction-to-programming-using-java?WT.mc_id=events_jdconf\nReasons to move to Java 11: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/reasons-to-move-to-java-11?WT.mc_id=events_jdconf"
