description: "Choosing to create a cross-platform GUI presents different challenges from other kinds of applications. I'll talk about why I chose that path, what I learned/built along the way, and the (Perl) tools I had to write to make it manageable.\nI want you to write native GUI applications (in Perl) and I'll show you how you can\n\n- Fight for the `$USER`.\n- Act on `localhost`.\n- Own your data.\n\nWith native applications you can use all the capabilities of your snazzy computer — this is computing without artificial limits.\n\n- Learn why I think you should consider writing a native GUI app in 2021. No, I don't mean make a web application and wrap it in a standalone browser — though what you learn from my talk will make that easier too.\n- Are we deploying once on homogeneous infrastructure? You wish. Learn from all the nerve-racking build failures I slogged through.\n- We're going retro and bringing back the 90s. The good parts hopefully.\n- A wild PDL appears! But how? You'll have to attend to find out."
