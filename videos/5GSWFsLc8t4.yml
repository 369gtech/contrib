description: "Annyce Davis, Android Development Manager, Off Grid Electric\n\nGETTING A GRIP ON GRAPHQL\nBeginner / APIs / Talk\n\nGraphQL is a query language for your API. This allows you to interact with your existing web services and databases in a new way. Instead of relying on a predetermined output structure from your API, you can “query” it and choose only the fields that you’re interested in. In this talk, learn what GraphQL is all about and how you can take advantage of it in your applications. A few key GraphQL terms we'll cover are: * Fields/Types * Variables * Queries/Mutations Then we'll take a look at how you can integrate the Apollo Client library inside of an Android application. GraphQL isn't going away, so here's your chance to get a grip on this exciting technology!"
