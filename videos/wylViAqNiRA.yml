description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeaker: Ben Hale\nIn the course of creating VAS, we did a lot of work to design a useful REST API. REST is generally a very loose collection of principals that can be interpreted in many ways, so this talk would describe a more concrete idea of what a REST-ful API should look like.  In addition, the implementation of this API was done with many of the new features in Spring 3 and are a good demonstration of the power it provides."
