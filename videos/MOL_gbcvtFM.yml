language: English
recordingDate: 1572552133
description: "Control Theory for SRE\n\nTed Hahn, TCB Technologies, and Mark Hahn\n\nControl Theory is a long and well-studied discipline in engineering. Nearly every large scale industrial process has dedicated control engineers, creating and maintaining safety and quality systems by assuring that parameters remain within boundsâ€”or alert appropriately.\n\nThis session will teach you how to create a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controller to autoscale your Kubernetes deployment based on a custom target. This controller ensures smooth scale-up and scale down.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
