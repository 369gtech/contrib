description: "Scala's type system provides generics in two ways: type members and type parameters, and most advanced Scala developers will use both in their code at different times. But how do we choose between them? Usually one or the other will feel \"right\" for a particular use case, and—if not—we can usually refactor and take the alternative approach. But could we learn to be better at making the \"right\" choice first time?\n\nI'll explore the most important considerations when choosing between them, and look at whether they are completely interchangeable in all cases, or whether certain scenarios force us down one path or the other.\n\nTalk by Jon Pretty\nMarch 4th, 2016\n\nhttp://www.nescala.org/\n\nProduced by NewCircle - Training & Resources for Developers:\nhttps://newcircle.com/"
