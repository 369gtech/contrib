title: 'Technical debt: Symptoms, root causes and remedies by Martin Bäumer'
recordingDate: 1581886502
description: "Technical debt has different facets which is why it can easily be misunderstood by both technical and non-technical people. Since we lack a clear and simple definition of technical debt, we might not always be aware of the risks of badly managed debt.\n\nWe need to understand the various factors that affect technical debt and cause problems in the software we deliver. If these factors are ignored or not taken seriously, development organizations will have a hard time delivering value to their customers efficiently. Another effect is that it will be difficult to keep and attract qualified engineers. In the long run such organizations will run out of business.\n\nThis session will give you a broader understanding of technical debt and its root causes so you - be it as developer, product owner, business analyst, or Scrum master - can make better choices to contribute to more stable and sustainable software.\n\nMartin Bäumer\nSqueed\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
