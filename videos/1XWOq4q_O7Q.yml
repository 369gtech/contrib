description: "Serverless has captivated the IT community at an incredible pace, and for good reason.  It has tremendous power to liberate productivity, increase innovation and reduce overhead.  However, adopting serverless technologies is still not well understood.  As the ecosystem grows around serverless, we’re empowered with options, yet further distanced us from a clear path to adoption.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll break through the clutter to investigate use-cases, adoption methods, the power of serverless now and it’s capacity to meet the demands of the future.  We’ll also look into open-source, community-led projects within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation that aim to advance the adoption of serverless technologies, while enabling interoperability and an open ecosystem.\n\nTalk by Austen Collins, Founder & CEO, Serverless Inc. \n\nTalk given at the 2018 Open Source Leadership Summit.\n\nThis talk is under the creative commons license. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
