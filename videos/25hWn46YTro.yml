description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012.\nSpeakers: Jennifer Hickey and Ramnivas Laddad\nCome to this session to get an in-depth view of the latest and greatest in Cloud Foundry. It's easier than ever before to build and deploy your distributed polyglot applications. You will see some exciting new options, including new Java and Node runtimes and support for background workers and container-less web apps. These features allow you to create distributed apps comprised of many smaller, focused apps each written in the framework that fits its purpose best. We will also explore the latest in tooling, including new features in the STS plugin and the brand new \"next gen\" VMC client. We will peek under the hood to see what's new in the Cloud Foundry architecture. From Cloud Foundry beginner to expert, this session has something for everyone."
