Now, however, AdMob has launched its own rewarded video demand, which means publishers can get ads directly from AdMob, no mediation required.\n\nIn this episode, we'll cover how to take advantage of these new ads in Unity. In addition to the APIs for Android, iOS, and C++, AdMob maintains an open source plugin for Unity developers. With its consistent C# interface, publishers can code once and deploy for both Android and iOS devices. In this episode, you'll see how to import the plugin, how to request ads, and how to use C# events to tap into the rewarded video ad lifecycle.\n\nWatch more episodes of Mobile Ads Garage here: https://goo.gl/BDQvw6\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
