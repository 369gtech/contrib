description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Jose Alcérreca, Google.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=MKQ-2052\n\nData binding is great for eliminating boilerplate and keeping UIs in sync with your state… but there's a lot more that it can do. This talk will take you through the more advanced features of Data Binding, beyond the basics. It will cover using custom binding adapters, two-way binding, animations and testing considerations. Moreover it examines how using Data Binding influences your app's architecture. You'll learn how to get the most out of Data Binding so that you can write less repetitive, safer, efficient apps.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
