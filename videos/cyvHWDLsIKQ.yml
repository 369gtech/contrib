description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by David González, Mixtiles.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=KSG-3809\n\nSharing code between platforms is a powerful technique, but it may be hard to accomplish without rich APIs that we have in Android, JVM, or iOS platforms. Kotlin Multiplatform libraries can be used to fix that, bringing rich APIs directly in the common Kotlin code. \n\nWhat an exciting frontier!\n\nIn this talk we'll go over the creation of a Kotlin Multiplatform library. You'll learn how modules for each platform work, decide what parts of the code makes sense to share and what doesn't. All based in the experiences gathered after creating a library at Mixtiles used to fetch images from different cloud providers.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
