description: "In this video, we'll explore building a semantic component system to create declarative 3D web content. You'll see what goes into WebGL and how it can lay out the architecture to allow authors to create 3D applications from a set of small components. You'll learn more about 3D rendering as well as component architecture.\n\nCheck out the rest of the Polymer Summit session videos here: https://goo.gl/KuiAXd\nSubscribe to the Google Chrome Developers channel: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
