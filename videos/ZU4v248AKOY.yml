title: 'NSDI ''15 - Making Sense of Performance in Data Analytics Frameworks'

description: "Making Sense of Performance in Data Analytics Frameworks\n\nKay Ousterhout, University of California, Berkeley; Ryan Rasti, University of California, Berkeley, International Computer Science Institute, and VMware; Sylvia Ratnasamy, University of California, Berkeley; Scott Shenker, University of California, Berkeley, and International Computer Science Institute; Byung-Gon Chun, Seoul National University\n\nThere has been much research devoted to improving the performance of data analytics frameworks, but comparatively little effort has been spent systematically identifying the performance bottlenecks of these systems. In this paper, we develop blocked time analysis, a methodology for quantifying performance bottlenecks in distributed computation frameworks, and use it to analyze the Spark frameworkâ€™s performance on two SQL benchmarks and a production workload. Contrary to our expectations, we find that (i) CPU (and not I/O) is often the bottleneck, (ii) improving network performance can improve job completion time by a median of at most 2%, and (iii) the causes of most stragglers can be identified.\n\nView the full NSDI '15 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi15/technical-sessions"
