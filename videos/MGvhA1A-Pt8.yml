description: "Logs are one of those things that you might only start worrying about when you really need them. A product might be developed by multiple teams and each one usually ends up defining their own logging policy but in this talk some common patterns and some tips on what to log and what not to (credit card numbers: big no no). Joaquín explores the value (and costs!) of logs, what tools to use for logging and the value proposition of each of them.\n\n Joaquín Fernández Campo\nSysOps - BBVA Next Technologies"
