description: "When you're rewriting an application to a new modularised & microserviced environment with several Bounded Context's and Unicorns flying around dancing and singing out loud. Then there are several approaches to migrate or synchronise the data from the dirty, old brown legacy system to your new state of the art solution. I'll present several scenario's each with their pro's and con's.\n\n# Stijn Vanpoucke\nStijn's has been developing Java applications for more then 10 years and today he's a Technical Architect at A.C.A IT-Solutions in Ghent (Belgium).
