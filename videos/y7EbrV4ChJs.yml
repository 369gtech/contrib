description: "Europeâ€™s Leading Laravel Conference\nBlind-bird Tickets 2020 Available\nhttps://laracon.eu/2020/tickets\n\nThe goal of this talk is to explain how dependency containers work by building our own. We start out by building the simplest DI container possible to demonstrate the underlying concept. Most people will be surprised about how little code this actually takes (3-4 effective lines of code). From there, we gradually add more sophisticated features like autowiring to create a container that more closely resembles what we are familiar with from Laravel. After listening to this talk, you will know how DI containers work at their core. You will also know how autowiring works and why it doesn't work under certain circumstances."
