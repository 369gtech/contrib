description: "Do you take notes at conference talks, meetings, workshops, in class or to capture your own thoughts? How often do you look back at your notes? How useful are they to review the material and how easy is it to find a particular piece of information when you are looking for it?\n\nIn this talk, Eva-Lotta will share her approach of taking visual notes – also called sketchnotes – and guide you through 5 steps that lead you from regular written notes to a more structured, visual and engaging way of mapping out information.\n\nThis is a hands-on session for everybody to sketch along, have fun and pick up the 5 basic principles of sketchnoting by trying them out themselves out the talk. If you think you are rubbish at sketching, never go back through your notes and want to get a fun kick-start into using pen and paper, this session will be just right for you.\n\nGet your pens ready!\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/amuse\n\nSave the date!
