description: "I've finally started my coding Blog using CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript.\nIf you want to witness how to create a blog from scratch, how to code a blog using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript without preparing anything, joing me in this journey. We'll need NodeJS for our tools to run.\n\nI've always recommended my students and every beginner to build a blog and what better way to encourage them than leading by example. Now I've stopped procrastinating, I stopped having excuses and you should start your coding blog too, right now is a good idea. All you have to do is create a basic HTML5 structure, apply some basic CSS3 styling and start documenting and sharing your experience with the world. Share your pain and share your excitement too!\n\nSo we build the blog as we go, we come up with ideas and we try them out. If it's a fail we move on, if it's a good idea, we impement it and keep it. You can be part of this process and shape it by using the live chat.\n\n# Development\nIn development GulpJS will automate our process and run tasks to:\n- convert PUG to HTML5\n- convert SASS/SCSS to CSS3\n- copy static files\n- use Browserify to automatically refresh our browser when needed and keep the website scroll, clicks etc in sync over different devices like: mobile, tablet, desktops etc.\n- provide error messages on screen and in the console\n\nWe'll also make use of Git and GitHub to manage our project files.\nPug is providing us with template powers as it's a template engine for HTML.\n\n# Production\nYou can host this project on GitHub.io pages however I chose to host it on my VPS that I run on DigitalOcean (you can check it at https://m.do.co/c/1d138e0259b0 ).\nI'm serving the static files using Nginx server across lots of projects. The server is setup using Ubuntu server.\n\nSupport the stream: https://streamlabs.com/marianzburlea\n\n\nThis setup needs NodeJS and Gulp to run correctly so if you haven't got those ones check the “required tools” playlist and get it done.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlgRhtOkjmmCI1l-jZhq_z93omN7USqUC\n\n# Powered by \nhttp://codetap.io\n\n### What do you get with CodeTap? ###\nBuild websites and get paid $30,000 - $40,000 and reach as much as $200,000 per year as a senior web developer with or without any knowledge of coding.\n20 years of experience crammed into one master plan will be revealed to you, full of shortcuts to empower you to build websites from day one and learn how to while you do it. \n\nSubscribe and I'll see you in class!"
