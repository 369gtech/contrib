description: "Using C# on the web is a great way to expand your audience. However, this requires you to learn more than just C#. You need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to complete your user interface design. In this video, I am going to get you started by walking you through the basics of Bootstrap, which is the web framework of choice for both ASP.NET MVC and .NET Core MVC.
