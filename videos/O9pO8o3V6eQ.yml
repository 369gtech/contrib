description: "Ivan Krylov, Programmer / Developer, Azul Systems\n\nOver the last 20 years of JIT compilers development, the focus has been on generating good throughput in the long run. Zing VM helps eliminate most cold warmup time. This session demonstrates how to observe the application warmup problem and how persistent application profiles produced with ReadyNow help eliminate startup problems. It also presents an overview of Azul Systemsâ€™ new LLVM-based JIT compiler and how the compile stashing technology makes it possible to reuse previously compiled methods, reducing warmup costs even further."
