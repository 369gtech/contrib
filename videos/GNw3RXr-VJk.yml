description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nThe main focus of this talk will be about the importance of lockless containers and RCU technology. The value of this approach will be explained and why it was added to libGuarded. I will also cover recent changes made to the RCU containers. \n\nI will explain the importance of libGuarded and how it was used in the CsSignal library to prevent deadlocks. \n\nEither basic familiarity with multithreading or attendance in Part I of this talk is suggested.\n— \nAnsel Sermersheim: CopperSpice, Co Founder\n\nI have been working as a programmer for nearly twenty years.
