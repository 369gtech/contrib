description: "How does Rust hold up when developing complex real world applications?\n\nThis talk is a case study based on building a scalable real time video analysis pipeline in Rust using:\n\n* GStreamer - a real time video processing framework\n* Pravega - a streaming data storage system\n\nThis talk covers:\n\n* The challenges involved in creating a scalable video processing pipeline\n* How and why Pravega, GStreamer, and Rust fit together\n* How to take advantage of the language features of Rust to manage complexity\n* Patterns we learned during development\n\nTom Kaitchuck\nDell\n\nTom Kaitchuck is one of the original developers who started the Pravega project and is currently a core contributor. Tom has been using Rust since 2015 and is the author of the popular aHash crate. He holds a degree in Computer Science from Valparaiso University. Currently working at Dell, Tom previously held software engineering positions at Google and Amazon. His interests include: Concurrency models, Consistency algorithms, Distributed system design, and Effects of language design.\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop 2021\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"
