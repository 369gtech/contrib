Claude Shannon is one of the foremost intellects of the twentieth century and the architect of the Information Age, whose insights stand behind every computer built, email sent, video streamed, and webpage loaded. He was a groundbreaking polymath, a brilliant tinkerer, and a digital pioneer. He constructed the first wearable computer, outfoxed Vegas casinos, and built juggling robots. He also wrote the seminal text of the digital revolution, which has been called “the Magna Carta of the Information Age.”\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/jimmy-soni/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JIMMY SONI\nAward-winning Author\n\nJimmy is a New York based author, editor, and speechwriter.
