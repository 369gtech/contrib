title: 'The Functional Tao of Bash - Garrett Smith'
language: English
recordingDate: 1448291326
description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/garrett-smith\n\nThe gist of the talk would be to apply functional principles to a bash program and refactor it during the talk. It'd be either live coding or I'll have each step laid out in slides.\n\nThis is both practical (people use bash) and has principles that can be applied to other crappy languages like Ruby and Python.\n\nThis could be an infrastructure talk, but really, for all the sentiment about not having hard-wired tracks, we sure are hung up on them.\n\nAbout Garrett\n\nGarrett is programmer at CloudBees, the company behind Jenkins CI and industry leading Java platform-as-a-service. There he leads the use of Erlang to manage platform services and infrastructure. He has over 20 years development experience and specializes in distributed systems and reliable software. Garrett organizes the Chicago Erlang User Group, teaches Erlang, and is a frequent speaker at alternative technology conferences. He is the creator of the popular videos MongoDB Is Web Scale, Node.js Is Bad Ass Rock Star Tech, and recently Erlang The Movie II The Sequel. He is the author and maintainer of e2, Psycho, Erlang CZMQ bindings, Erlang Redis client, and many others."
