description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2018. #gotocon #gotocph\nhttp://gotocph.com\n\nMourad Sidky - iOS Tech Lead at Groupon\n\nABSTRACT\nMobile devices are getting more and more powerful, with not-only advanced hardware, but also intelligent operating systems and high-performance compatible set of native frameworks. Mobile devices are capable of doing expensive on-device processing to achieve augmented reality and machine learning, without the need to communicate to any other external services.\nApple exposed them in ARKit and CoreML. Both frameworks are implemented in a way to achieve correctness, best performance, energy efficiency and data privacy. Apple solves lots of problems and gave us the solutions in these frameworks.\nI’ll be speaking about augmented reality, step into augmented reality for iOS, then I’ll speak [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2018/sessions/576\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocph\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#mobile #AR #ML #AugmentedReality #MachineLearning #AdvancedMobile"
