description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPinniped: A Unified Framework for User Authentication to Kubernetes Clusters- Mo Khan & Anjali Telang, VMware\n\nIf you are a Kubernetes Administrator, IT Administrator or Community User, who manages user access to multiple Kubernetes clusters, you not only understand the pain of configuring user authentication to multiple clusters, but also the pain of managing and supporting multiple Identity Providers (IDPs). For user authentication, there are various cluster providers that offer vertically integrated solutions but there is still a need for a generic solution that can work across kubernetes clusters. Further, many IDPs offer Web-based administration interfaces that are not command-line/kubectl friendly. In this talk, we introduce Pinniped, a One-size-fits-all, completely Open Source User-Authentication solution to all Kubernetes clusters! Our architecture is designed to not only support Day0 Ops for configuring clusters during deployments but also Day2 Ops for managing user access after clusters are deployed. During our session we will elaborate on the various configurations supported by Pinniped,such as multiple Identity Providers, multiple kubernetes platform providers and different deployment configurations (Edge, Core)."
