recordingDate: 1551670200
description: "Return of the Fat Client\n\nIf you have been around for long enough in IT you have seen trends come and go. Only to reappear a few year later only slightly changed. Created by a new generation of software developers seemingly blissfully unaware of the problems of the old solution.\nWith the advent and increasing popularity of Angular, React & Vue, we are currently well on our way to reinvent the fat client, but now in the browser.\n\nBut what is the same? What is different? What should these young’uns learn from us grey-haired? And what can we learn from them?\n\nErwin is the founder of Bitgenics.io, a hosting platform for Single Page Apps. In the late '90's, Erwin was introduced to XP as a software developer and has since filled every imaginable Agile delivery role – Scrum Master, Product Owner, Architect, Coach and, most recently, as a Scrum.org-certified Professional Scrum Trainer. He has worked with organisations ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies all over the world.\n\nHe regularly speaks at conferences in Australia, Europe, and the US on his current passion: the intersection of Agile, complexity, technology and business.\n\nFor more on YOW!
