recordingDate: 1395200522
description: 'You can use the Google Maps JavaScript API to mark up a map with a variety of annotations, such as markers, polylines, polygons, etc. The google.maps.Data class is a container for arbitrary geospatial data that has no predefined settings about how data should be rendered. The google.maps.Data follows the structure of GeoJSON in its data representation and makes it easy to display GeoJSON data. Here we present a short introduction to the feature and show some examples using it.'
