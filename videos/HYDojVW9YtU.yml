description: "Monitor the World: Meaningful Metrics for Containerized Apps and Clusters - Nicholas Turner, Amazon & Nic Cope, Planet Labs \n\nIn this talk, Nick and Nic dive into key metrics and tooling that you should be using to monitor your Kubernetes control plane components and your containerized applications.  Nick will disect the metrics that have shown to be critical for Kubernetes cluster operations, experience gained while helping to build and operate Amazon's EKS platform. Topics covered will include monitoring etcd and the Kubernetes control plane components.  Nic will discuss Planet Lab's Kubernetes deployment and the application metrics that have proven to be most critical for operating large scale clusters, including how they utilize Linkerd and Prometheus for visibility.   Two themes that will persist throughout the talk are how use the minimum number of necessary metrics to still have a complete picture while avoiding noise, and how to do it with open source technology. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrXU"
