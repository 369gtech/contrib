description: "Slides - https://www.slideshare.net/MariaIsabelNavarroJi/py-data19-final\n\nIt is common practice to test the performance of ML models, but it is not so common to test the reliability of the predictions. Training a model, test its performance and hoping that it will produce good quality predictions is not the right approach if we are concerned with reliable ML. Hence, in this talk, we will discuss the concept of conformal predictions which quantify quality in predictions.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
