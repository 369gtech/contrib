description: "Speaker: Filipe Silva\n\nTrack:PyData\nAs a practical example, this tutorial uses machine learning models to predict where to best place the apple in Snake. By using datasets that contain different plays we can obtain different game experiences or models that can adapt to the style of a player.\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2019 conference.\nhttps://pycon.de\n\nMore details at the conference page: https://de.pycon.org/program/VCSBUY\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pyconde"
