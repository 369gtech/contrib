description: "https://github.com/toidiu/talk_rust_belt_rust_2019\n\nI will be presenting Fin, a non-trivial web server. In the process of creating Fin, I have had to think about and solve many common challenges one would face when writing a web application or even a general Rust program. A few of the topics include database testing, hardening SQL queries, auth, module isolation, error handling, logging, and more."
