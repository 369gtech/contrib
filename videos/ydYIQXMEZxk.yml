description: "Language Paradigms are intriguing, some languages are pure and enforce a particular paradigm, and yet some languages are hybrid. A single paradigm language is consistent, easier to use, and often favored by the proponents of the promoted paradigm. Hybrid languages often appear confusing, seem harder to use, and yet there are so many of them. From the programming point of view should we stick to one paradigm or should we dabble into the mixed paradigm arena? It turns out, that is not an easy question.\n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on FullStack Stage during Infoshare 2019."
