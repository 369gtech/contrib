title: 'Future of Serverless - Yoav Abrahami'
recordingDate: 1531991256
description: "5 years ago, mid 2013, we identified a gap in the cloud echo-system. The landscape of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS provides solutions for VMs, Container and Networking, platforms of different types for backend developers, Backends for mobile developers and ready-made software for individuals and enterprises. What is missing in the middle is the platform for web-sites and web-apps.\n\nFive years down the line, with the emergence of Serverless, there are still no players in this gap. Yoav talks about what makes a platform for web-sites and web-apps. Think about frontend optimized javascript, SEO, visual builder, web methods & backend javascript as well as request time container boot.\n\nWe have built Wix Code over the last five years targeting this exact gap – a serverless platform for website and web applications, and so… Wix is taking the risk of predicting the future of serverless computing and where it should be 5 years from now.\n\nYoav Abrahami is the Chief Architect at Wix.com, working with developers and operations on building Wix future products as well as accelerating and improving development processes. Yoav has a MS in Physics and BS in Computer Science from Tel Aviv University."
