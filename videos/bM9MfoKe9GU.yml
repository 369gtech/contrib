recordingDate: 1476544308
description: "In this Live Stream, I cover additional features of the p5.js sound library.  I demonstrate how to analyze inputs (microphone or sound file) and control the elements of a sketch with volume / amplitude. I also discuss FFT analysis (Fast Fourier Transform) and visualize the spectrum / frequency array. Finally, I modify one of my previous Coding Challenge, Flappy Bird, to make it respond to sound. \n\nI also answer a viewer question about how to make a p5.js sketch the background of a web page.\n\n23:30 - Presenting today's topic\n27:55 - Sound in p5.js: Using Microphone in sketch\n45:11 - Sound in p5.js: Volume Visualization\n1:06:06 - Sound in p5.js: Circular Volume Graphing\n1:19:43 - Sound in p5.js: FFT\n1:43:30 - Clappy Bird!\n2:16:26 - Q&A: p5.js Sketch in Background\n2:26:56 - Q&A/Conclusion\n\n\nVideo recorded at http://sfpc.io/\n\nSupport this channel on Patreon: https://patreon.com/codingtrain\n\nSend me your questions and coding challenges!: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Topics\n\nContact: https://twitter.com/shiffman\n\nGitHub Repo with all the info for Programming from A to Z: https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F16\n\nLinks discussed in this video:\np5-manager on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/p5-manager\nthis.dot song: https://soundcloud.com/kristianpedersen/this-dot-feat-daniel-shiffman\np5.js Sound Library: https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound\n\n\nSource Code for the all Video Lessons: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code\n\np5.js: https://p5js.org/\nProcessing: https://processing.org\n\nFor More Live Streams: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bxnFR6no70vlxxuxDEzflz\n\nFor More Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/72qD/"
