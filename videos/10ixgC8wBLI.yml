description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2017\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nThis presentation shows what we learned during a redesign of the video camera support in Nexia Home Intelligence. Nexia is a large-scale Ruby on Rails application with a customer base using tens of thousands of video cameras. Weâ€™ll walk through examples of key design decisions and show code samples to illustrate refactoring the video camera code towards ubiquitous language, a rich domain model, better performance and scalability, and cleaner module boundaries. Learn how applying Domain-Driven Design (DDD), pair-programming, and TDD enabled us to make significant improvements to the performance and maintainability of the Nexia codebase, while continuing to deliver new customer features."
