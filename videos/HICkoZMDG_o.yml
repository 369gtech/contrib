recordingDate: 1572352778
description: "After over a year of tempestuous development, a new build tool for Scala is approaching a stable release! Fury has aspirations to shake up the entire software development process for Scala, and this will be your opportunity to see for yourselves what a source-based future with Fury could look like.\n\nThis talk will be a livecoding tour of Fury. You will get to see what itâ€™s like to use Fury for everyday tasks like compiling and testing, as well as occasional tasks like resolving dependencies, and infrequent actions like bundling and publishing."
