description: "Most Elixir developers know about the Erlang SSH module but they may be unaware of just how flexible it is.\n\nFirst, Milad will talk about the SSH protocol. He will then explain in detail, the setting up of the SSH server/Client module and how to use custom SSH Key server and the SSH subsystem. Once this is done, he will then show us how to use this to build a communication protocol between two Erlang nodes using SSH.\n\nMore details on website: http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconfeu2018/milad-rastian"
