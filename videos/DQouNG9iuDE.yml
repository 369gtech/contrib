The open question is how it will do so.\n\n\nThe answer is data. Precision medicine is data-driven medicine. It uses data -- frequently genetic data -- to prevent, diagnose and treat disease at its root cause and in the context of an individual patient.\n\n\nThis talk covers the development of an algorithm for conducting precision medicine, and it casts the creation of this algorithm through the lens of a personal story: of discovering that my child was the first case of a new, ultra-rare genetic disorder. From this story, I will generalize to a process that scales precision medicine to all disease, or rather, to all patients. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/channel/JUMjvCF2ucj"
