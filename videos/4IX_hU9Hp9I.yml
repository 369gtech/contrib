description: "Filmed at http://js-kongress.de on November 28-29 in Munich\n\nDo you care about performance? Memory leaks, megamorphic cache misses, garbage collection jank, and deoptimizations can slow your app down. Chrome’s JavaScript engine, V8, ships with its own profiling tools that can identify such problems. We’ll dive deep into the inner workings of V8 to better understand what these terms mean – and how to avoid them. You’ll learn to identify and fix low-level JavaScript performance issues using several V8 developer tools."
