description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/fl1Ro\n\nIn this part of the code refactoring tutorial, I show you examples of how you can make your code more understandable using something called an Explaining Variable.\n\nWe also explore many short cuts people take when writing code that will cause many problems later. I want to get these basic rules out of the way so we can concentrate on refactoring to design patterns very soon in this tutorial series."
