description: "Speaker: Jan-Benedikt Jagusch\n\nTrack:PyData\nIn this talk you will learn how to visualize graph networks in Python, using `networkx`, `traitlets`, `ipywidgets` and `plotly`. The resulting plot will be fully interactive, which makes it easy to filter edges, find nodes by their name and update the graph's layout.\n\nRecorded at the PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2019 conference.\nhttps://pycon.de\n\nMore details at the conference page: https://de.pycon.org/program/HFKNUW\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pydataberlin\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/pyconde"
