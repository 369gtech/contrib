description: "Reactive Programming is hot, but what does it actually mean to develop a reactive application? In this talk we will run through a number of strategies and techniques to implement reactive programming concepts into new and existing applications. The goal of this talk is not to tell about how to implement reactive programming in Java applications, but to show how it can solve realistic problems, and improve your codebases.\n\n# Kristof Van Sever\nKristof has experience in Java development in a wide array of different roles. As a developer, teacher, and coach his main expertise lies in enterprise development. With his main focus and specialization on the Spring ecosystem, he's a strong advocate for clear, and concise software. He believes code should be as clear as a children's book, but powerful enough to run an entire industry."
