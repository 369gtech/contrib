description: "Slides: \nhttps://speakerdeck.com/mploed/ddd-strategic-design-with-spring-boot-examples\nSample code link\nhttps://github.com/mploed/ddd-strategic-design-spring-boot\nThis talk will focus on one of the most precious parts of Domain Driven Design, the concept of Strategic Design, as well as Bounded Context, the Context Map and the patterns that are being documented in the Context Map.\n\nAn explanation of these principles as well as practical usage scenarios such as migrating a monolithic landscape to microservices is planned for discussion. And, using a hands-on approach, we will demonstrate the concepts surrounding Strategic Design with an application landscape of various Spring Boot Applications."
