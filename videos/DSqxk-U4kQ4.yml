description: "Braintree is a payment gateway, so downtime directly costs both us and our merchants money. Therefore, high availability is extremely important at Braintree. This talk will cover how we do HA at Braintree on our (mostly Ruby) application.\n\nSpecific topics will include:\n\n    Working around planned downtime and deploys:\n    How we pause traffic without losing requests\n    How we fit our maintenance into these pauses\n    How we do rolling deploys and schema changes without downtime\n\n    Working around unplanned failures:\n    How we load balance across redundant servers and ISPs\n    How the app is structured to retry failed requests\n\nPaul Gross\nBraintree Payments\n@pgr0ss\n\n\nPaul Gross is a software developer working at Braintree Payments.
