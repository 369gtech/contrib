description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nStartup Containers in Lightning Speed with Lazy Image Distribution - Kohei Tokunaga, NTT \n\nPulling image is one of the time-consuming steps in the container startup process. The most critical factor is the current OCI Image Spec with which a container cannot be started until its all image layers are downloaded. However, most of the contents in image layers are not being used for real-world workloads.  In this talk, Kohei will show state-of-the-art alternative image formats which lead to faster container startup by allowing container runtimes to start a container without waiting for all its contents to be locally available. He will also introduce CNCF containerd's fast image distribution approach \"Remote Snapshotter\" which leverages these formats (https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/3731). Finally, he will share the status of his current work on the remote snapshotter implementation and how to take advantage of the new functionality.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZepQ"
