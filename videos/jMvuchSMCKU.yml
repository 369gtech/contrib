The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nSolving Multi-Cluster Network Connectivity With Submariner - Chris Kim, Rancher Labs & Miguel Angel Ajo, Red Hat  \n\nToday companies face the need to spread workloads across several clusters, leverage the capabilities of specific clouds, create more resilient services, or comply with GDPR by locating and securing specific data on specific geographic locations, but while that is possible today still communication between clusters is not solved in a transparent and secure way.    Currently the pods and services in two different kubernetes clusters are isolated from each other, network plugins in kubernetes don't have a common for way creating such connectivity. To connect two services in separate clusters the administrator needs to make the application endpoints public, some network plugins provide partial solutions to this problem and service meshes like Istio solve this and more at the cost of some level complexity and overhead.    https://submariner.io solves this problem connecting clusters at IP level  \n\nhttps://sched.co/UadI"
