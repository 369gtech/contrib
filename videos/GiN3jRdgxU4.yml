description: "https://www.facebook.com/tusharroy25\nhttps://github.com/mission-peace/interview/blob/master/src/com/interview/graph/FordFulkerson.java\nhttps://github.com/mission-peace/interview/blob/master/python/graph/fordfulkerson.py\n\nThe Ford–Fulkerson method or Ford–Fulkerson algorithm (FFA) is an algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network. It is called a \"method\" instead of an \"algorithm\" as the approach to finding augmenting paths in a residual graph is not fully specified[1] or it is specified in several implementations with different running times.[2] It was published in 1956 by L. R. Ford, Jr. and D. R. Fulkerson.[3] The name \"Ford–Fulkerson\" is often also used for the Edmonds–Karp algorithm, which is a specialization of Ford–Fulkerson.\n\nIn computer science, the Edmonds–Karp algorithm is an implementation of the Ford–Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network in O(V E2) time. The algorithm was first published by Yefim (Chaim) Dinic in 1970[1] and independently published by Jack Edmonds and Richard Karp in 1972.[2] Dinic's algorithm includes additional techniques that reduce the running time to O(V2E)."
