description: "José Valim - Elixir Creator: Keynote - announcing Broadway by José Valim\n\nAbstract\nBroadway is a new open source project by Plataformatec that aims to streamline data processing pipelines. It allows developers to consume data efficiently and concurrently from many systems, such as Amazon SQS, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub and others.\nIn this talk, we will discuss how the Broadway architecture connects multiple stages and producers, how it leverages GenStage to provide back-pressure, how we rely on OTP for fault-tolerance, and other features such as batching, rate-limiting, partitioning and more.\n\nThe speaker \nJosé Valim is the creator of the Elixir programming language and the Director of R&D at Plataformatec, a consultancy firm based in Brazil. He is author of Adopting Elixir and Programming Phoenix as well as an active member of the Open Source community.\nGithub: josevalim\nTwitter: @josevalim\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: www.elixirconf.eu\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/elixirconfeu\nMail: info at elixirconfeu"
