title: '[Uber Seattle] Michelangelo (MA) Learners and Transformers'

recordingDate: 1558721288
description: 'During this April 2019 meetup, Uber engineer Mingshi Wang discusses the architectures of Michelangelo (MA) learners and transformers. A Michelangelo (MA) Learner is a workflow authoring framework for Uber''s Michelangelo machine learning platform that allows Uber data scientists, researchers, and engineers to solve complex machine learning problems with customized workflows. An MA Learner provides Python SDK''s that make it easy to write MA models on Jupiter notebooks while hiding the underlying complexities of distributing the machine learning jobs to different computing environments. At Uber, machine learning models are represented by pipelines composed of MA transformers. The data preparation and training-- processes that involve one or more estimators-- produce a trained pipeline with MA transformers. The trained pipelines are persisted for subsequent usage by batch and online predictions.'
