This is a principle aiming to simplify maintenance and evolution of the codebase.\n\nThis Video covers Following Topics:\n1.Implement Classes,Getter,Setter,Object,Private fields,Nested classes.\n2.Use Auxilliary Constructor,Primary Constructor,Companion Object,Apply Method.\n3.Understand packages,Override Methods,Type Checking,Casting,Abstract Classes in Scala.\n\nRelated Blogs:\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/apache-spark-lighting-up-the-big-data-world/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=spark-oops\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/5-reasons-to-learn-apache-spark/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=spark-oops\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/spark-functional-features/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=spark-oops \nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/apache-spark-ecosystem/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=spark-oops\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/scala-repl/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=spark-oops\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning environment, accessible from any part of the world.\n\nThe topics related to ‘Traits and OOPS in Scala’ have been widely covered in our course ‘Apache Spark & Scala’.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
