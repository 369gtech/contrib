description: "Intel released a toolkit that allows developers to build applications that emulate human vision across multiple platforms. The OpenVINO toolkit is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and it extends workloads across Intel hardware (including accelerators) and maximizes performance. In this video, I'll explain how OpenVINO, or Open Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization, enables us to use convolutional neural networks for computer vision on the edge. This video was sponsored by Intel. Enjoy!\n\nCode for this video: \nhttps://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/documentation/code-samples\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
