description: "Our job is to solve problems. The complexity of the problems takes us on the verge of chaos. We have learned to embrace the constant flux of problems through methods such as lean, agile and design thinking. These methods create order and give us a sense of control but they keep us separated. In terms of collaboration, we have come a long way from the times of BDUF. But even with design systems and the emerging DesignOps movement improving the workflow efficiency, our domains are still exclusive. This talk proposes an interpretation of design as a universal problem-solving skill which works best through equality and inclusion. This talk is intended to inspire developers to become responsive towards collaborative problem-solving. I believe we are all designers and we become better at problem-solving together. By the end of this talk so will you.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
