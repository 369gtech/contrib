description: 'We''ll figure out how awesome is the web platform and how fast it''s evolving. Back in the days, we used flash to make powerful animations, then the platform evolved and we had the power on the hands to make animations using JS libraries to make it a bit easier. Now you can simply do it using this sweet dream called Web animations API, it''ll provide you a bunch of interfaces and power to create lovely animations in applications. Well try it and feel the sweet taste ;)'
