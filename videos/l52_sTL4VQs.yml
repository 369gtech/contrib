description: "OpenCensus is an emerging standard for tracing and metrics of cloud services. You can use it to gain observability into applications that span multiple clouds and technological stacks.\nIn this talk, we will use open source and vendor agnostic client libraries for OpenCensus and export telemetry to common distributed tracing systems such as Zipkin and others.\nAlong the way. we will discuss core concepts such as tags, metrics, exporters, zPages and trace context propagation.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
