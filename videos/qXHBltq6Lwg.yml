description: "JavaFX is included with JDK 1.7, supports CSS 3 skinning and data binding, and comes with a WYSIWYG editor: Scene Builder. In this session, an MVP architecture heavily influenced by convention over configuration, inversion of control (Scene Builder), CSS, and data binding is presented in a working code example. Integration with local storage via dependency injection, REST services, Java EE 6 integration, long polling, and legacy service integration are discussed as well.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAdam Bien\nConsultant and author Adam Bien is an Expert Group member for the Java EE 6 and 7, EJB 3.X, JAX-RS, and JPA 2.X JSRs.
