description: "According to Paul Chiusano, team lead at S&P Capital IQ, stream processing contain's problems that are crying out for simple and usable solutions. At the Northeast Scala Symposium, Paul delivers an advanced level talk on functional programming that addresses these issues. \n\nHe dives in, gives a series of examples, and demonstrates his attempt to create a library for declarative stream processing that is both powerful and understandable. Topics include parallelism, nondeterminism, and distributed programming.\n\nPaul notes that a far more detailed explanation of these concepts can be found in Chapter 15 of his book: Functional Programming in Scala (http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/)\n\n** Visit our site for more content on Scala, including the rest of the presentations from NE Scala 2013: http://marakana.com/s/tags/scala"
