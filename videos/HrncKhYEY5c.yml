description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #15\n23 July 2018\nSponsored and Hosted by Taboola\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nPython is amazing for expressing algorithms concisely and robustly for academic purposes. However, going to production means that an engineering team has to be able to own an application code base consisting of hundreds of algorithms, that is reliable, has high and controllable performance and is easy to extend and fix. This talk is about an approach to technology and culture that enables these goals while retaining Pythonâ€™s fundamental elegance.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
