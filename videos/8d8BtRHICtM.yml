description: "Presented at Android Builders Summit on February 14th in Redwood Shores, CA by Aleksandar (Sa≈°a) Gargenta from Marakana inc.\n\nFor the complete slides from this talk go to http://mrkn.co/munz7\n\n\"The most interesting part of Android stack are the Android System Services. The 60+ such services expose the low level functionality, such as Power Management, Wifi, Camera, Sensors, GPS, Display, Audio, Media, and so on, all the hardware all the way up to the application layer. While each one is different, the all have certain similarities, namely the way they rely on Binder (Android's IPC mechanism), use JNI to cross Java-C boundary, and use of shared libraries to abstract the Linux drivers. In this talk, we'll explore the common system services in Android and discuss their architecture. You will get to see the diagrams of the inner workings of some of the previously undocumented parts of the Android stack. By the end of the talk, you should have a better understanding of the underpinnings of the backbone of Android OS.\"\n\nhttps://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/android-builders-summit/gargentaa"
