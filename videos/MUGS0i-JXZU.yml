description: "Spring, the Kotlin and Functional Way\n\nModern Web\n\nIn this talk, I will live code a Spring application with functional configuration in Kotlin leveraging what we explored with the Spring Fu experimental project:\n\n- Designed to provide a idiomatic Kotlin developer experience\n- Functional configuration via Kotlin DSL instead of annotations\n- Minimal reflection usage, no classpath scanning, no annotation processing required\n- Explicit configuration: minimal core, no conventions, no classpath detection\n- Flexible programmatic configuration\n- Run as native image with instant startup via GraalVM support\n- Coroutines allow to leverage our Reactive support with imperative programming style\n- Reactive/Coroutines SQL\n- Spring packages filtering in order to have a minimal classpath and deploy just what you need\n- Single language fullstack support with frontend written in Kotlin\n- Self-sufficient opinionated documentation\n\nI will explain what we learned, and what's coming next in terms of new Spring Framework and Spring Boot features.\n\nSpeakers:\nSÃ©bastien Deleuze\nSpring Framework Committer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
