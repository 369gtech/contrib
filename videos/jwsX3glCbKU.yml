description: "Session from the 'Agile Riga Day 2012' conferenece.\r\n\r\nThe role of software analyst is full of misunderstandings. In cross-functional teams we focus on having a shared vision and shared architecture. We avoid specializations, we force every member of a team to act and pull required information from all available sources without additional chains in the communication.\r\n\r\nThe role of traditional software analyst does not fit nicely into Scrum either. They have been usually separated from teams and we cannot call them neither Scrum Masters nor Product Owners.\r\n\r\nHowever, software analysts play essential role in cross-functional teams. Our understanding of what they should do and the role they play in a team should be different. Analysts help us understand and we should focus on sharing this understanding inside the team.\r\n\r\nHere I will present the roots of misunderstandings and some practical tips how they can be avoided.\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.agilerigaday.lv/Sessions/anonymous-analyst"
