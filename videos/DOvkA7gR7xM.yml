description: "http://oreilly.com/go/fluent_comp_14\nThe O'Reilly Fluent Conference was first launched in 2012 as a new event for developers working with JavaScript, HTML5, and other web technologies. Now in its third year, Fluent covers the full scope of the Web Platform and its associated technologies, including WebGL, CSS3, mobile APIs, Node.js, AngularJS, ECMAScript 6, and more.\n\nThese technologies have become central to all kinds of development, not just building websites. If you're building web applications, designing for mobile devices, or working with the web's evolving infrastructure, you need to keep up with the proliferation of new technology that's driving the Web Platform."
