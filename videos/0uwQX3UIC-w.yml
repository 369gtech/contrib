description: "A normal Science teacher and his journey into Python and the impact it has had on his STEM teaching\n\nSpencer Organ\n\nSunday 16th, 12:30 (Room D)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nSix years ago I was happily teaching Science and a little bit of IT at school. I had done some basic programming a long time ago but this was mostly from magazines as a kid. Jump forward six years and I am now leading on Computer Science at Key Stage 3 and engaging learners in Chemistry and Physics with physical computing, digital making and programming.\n\nThis has been an exciting journey and has transformed the way I teach Science and developed the skills to teach Key Stage 3 Computer Science. At the heart of this has been Python and I would love to share that journey with you and how I brought Python into school in more than just Computer Science lessons.\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for new programmers.\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for teachers."
