description: "The front-end tools landscape is growing at an exponential pace. Every week there are new plugins, new coding methodologies, new native apps, new JavaScript utilities, new jQuery plugins, new build tools, Grunt plugins, JavaScript libraries and so on. Many help us to solve problems and be more productive.\n\nThis talk will give you a quick overview of the kinds of things that get released every week, showing the variety of what’s available. But we shouldn’t be discouraged or overwhelmed by the amount we need to keep up with.Louis  will cover some suggestions for dealing with the madness, and how developers today can benefit greatly from this influx of new stuff, even if they can’t keep up with it all.\n\nLouis Lazaris\nManaging Editor, SitePoint\nhttps://twitter.com/ImpressiveWebs\nhttps://github.com/impressivewebs\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
