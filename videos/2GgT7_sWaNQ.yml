language: English
recordingDate: 1567588599
description: "Byte-sized talks from CERN engineers\nBecause of the lack of support for modern agile interpreted languages, the software architects have moved the logic execution out of the database. Oracle Labs is building a polyglot engine with GraalVM, and integrates it to the Oracle and MySQL RDBMS. Currently in beta, this scales the database applications by avoiding the CPU context switches between the procedural code and the persistence layer. Short presentation and demo on the beta."
