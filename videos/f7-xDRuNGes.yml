title: 'Deep Learning for Product Title Summarization'
recordingDate: 1543956937
description: "Joan Xiao, Lead Machine Learning Scientist, Figure Eight\nPresented at MLconf 2018\nOnline marketplaces often have millions of products, and the product titles are typically intentionally made quite long for the purpose of being found by search engines. With voice shopping on the verge of taking off (voice shopping is estimated to hit $40+ billion across U.S. and U.K. by 2022), short versions (summaries) of product titles are desired to improve user experience with voice shopping. \n \nIn this talk, we’ll present two different approaches to solve this problem using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. We’ll give a historical overview of the technology advancement in these approaches, and compare the evaluation results on a real world dataset. \n\nSee Joan's presentation slides on our slideshare page here: https://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/deep-learning-for-product-title-summarization"
