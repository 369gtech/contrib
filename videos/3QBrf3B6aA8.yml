title: 'Batch Processing and Integration on Cloud Foundry'
recordingDate: 1366727466
description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012\nSpeaker: Josh Long\nSpring Integration is a lightweight integration framework from the makers of Spring. Integration of data and services between applications is not easy -- and often requires adaptation from one system to another. Spring Integration also promotes loosely coupled, event-driven applications. Spring Batch is a batch processing framework -- providing a simple, idiomatic way to crunch large amounts of data across in a sustainable way. Spring Batch even allows you to distribute processing across multiple machines in a cluster. Naturally, both of these frameworks play very nicely on top of Cloud Foundry, which lets you scale up and out as demand requires.\n\nIn this talk, Josh Long introduces how to use Spring Batch and Spring Integration on Cloud Foundry, the open source PaaS."
