description: "How can we be agile in a business-to-business world? How can customers procure software changes and additions before they know what they want? Is it possible to keep corporate legal and procurement teams happy while the development team embraces change?\nThis is a case study on how Sony Professional has worked with a major broadcaster in an agile way. The aim is to share the experience, the pitfalls and the lessons learnt.\n\nThe session is primarily aimed at software development managers or project managers, but anyone with interest or experience of running agile as a software supplier would find the session interesting."
