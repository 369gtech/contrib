title: '#DCBerlin18 209 Miu Room An SQLite Object Mapping Library DAY1'
recordingDate: 1534256339
description: "Magda Miu, Mobile Team Leader and Scrum Master\n\nROOM: AN SQLITE OBJECT MAPPING LIBRARY\nIntermediate / Android Architecture / Talk\n\nHandling an SQLite database in Android implies challenges like: a lot of boilerplate code, database operations on the main thread, queries checked at runtime and especially unmaintainable code. At Google I/O 2017, the Android team launched Room, an SQLite object mapper, that provides a set of components and features that will solve all these challenges and will help us, the developers, to have a better experience when using a database in our app. The presentation will include examples about how to use the main components from Room (@Entity, @Dao, @Database), how to handle the relations between the entities, how to use the (observable) queries and not run database operations on the main thread. Also we will discover more details about the migration support, compile time query verification and whatâ€™s happening behind the scenes."
