Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. Speaking from experience building MyGet.org: users are insane. If you are lucky, they use your service, but in reality, they probably abuse. Crazy usage patterns resulting in more requests than expected, request bursts when users come back to the office after the weekend, and more! These all pose a potential threat to the health of our web application and may impact other users or the service as a whole. Ideally, we can apply some filtering at the front door: limit the number of requests over a given timespan, limiting bandwidth, etc.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the simple yet complex realm of rate limiting. We’ll go over how to decide on which resources to limit, what the limits should be and where to enforce these limits — in our app, on the server, using a reverse proxy like Nginx or even an external service like CloudFlare or Azure API management. The takeaway? Know when and where to enforce rate limits so you can have both a happy application as well as happy customers."
