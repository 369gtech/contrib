description: "Speaker: Marion Schleifer, Junior Software Developer, Simplificator AG\n\nIt is no news that there are not enough women in programming. As a (female) career changer, I know how a lot of people (and especially women) think about programming. I am now a Ruby programmer and programming is completely different than i imagined it would be. And I love it! Therefore, I am putting a lot of my time and energy into educating women about programming. I want to talk about why we don't have enough women in programming, why we need more, and what we all can do to achieve that goal.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\n\nMarion is a career changer. She has a Bachelor in Translation, a Master in Economics and just finished a Master in Software Engineering. Changing careers to programming is the best decision she has made. Apart from her job as Junior Developer, she is spending her time encouraging women to program and as a member of the Hanami core team.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/8HYJ/"
