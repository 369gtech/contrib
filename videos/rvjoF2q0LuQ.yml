description: "Node.js (or I/O.js) as an evented I/O runtime is very popular and is used widely. But how do you integrate Node in enterprise architectures? There are mature monitoring processes for JVM runtime environments and a significant part of the business logic is implemented in Java libraries. In addition, JavaScript code execution in Node.js is only single threaded, is it worth at all?\n\nThe seamless integration and a (nearly complete) compatibility to Node.js applications in JVM environments promise Nodyn from RedHat, but it’s using alternative JavaScript engines from V8 like Nashorn and DynJS; additionally there’s Netty and Vert.x.\n\nThis approach deals with the ability to be able to execute JavaScript code not only non-blocking and asynchronously, but also in highly distributed environments using the Vert.x Eventbus. Additionally, there are other advantages of using a JVM-based scripting engine when developing for enterprise environments.\n\nCome and see my Beer-as-a-Service in action!"
