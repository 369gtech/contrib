description: "Business owners always dream about system that will let them change its behaviour without involving coders. This desire is event stronger in enterprises, when coders are usually in different company. We’ve seen many examples: BPMN, DSLs, Drools, and many in-house samples. Big vendors and open source projects promise miracles - and usually do not deliver - or at least not to expected extent...\n\nDuring more than 10 years in our industry I’ve seen and taken part in many such efforts. I’d like to share my experiences - what is (almost) doomed to be a failure, what can only depend on structure of organisation and when can we expect some modest success.\n\nI also believe that the project I’m working on - Nussknacker (check it out on github) can be a bit more successful. Join me to hear about our domain (real time stream processing in telco), technologies (Kafka, Flink, React and more) our vision and architecture."
