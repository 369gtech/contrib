description: "The concept of an MVP is so ubiquitous these days that most people and organisations can readily tell you that it stands for Minimum Viable Product. However, these same people will often then struggle to articulate what it really means. Is it simply the first release of a product or is it something more special?\n\nIn this talk I will discuss the common mistakes we all make when crafting an MVP and the hurdles that get in the way of us getting it right. I will share the simple things that we can all do to ensure that we aren’t just throwing around a buzzword and instead we’re creating value with our MVPs."
