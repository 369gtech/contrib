title: '#HITBLockdown002 VIRTUAL LAB: Qiling Framework: Build a Fuzzer Based on a 1day Bug - Lau Kai Jern'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597618047
description: "Qiling Framework (https://qiling.io) is a sandbox emulator framework with a rich set of Python API to enable highly customizable analysis tools built on top. Using emulator technology inside, our engine can run the executable binary in a cross-platform-architecture way, so we can analyze Windows PE files on Linux Arm64, IoT firmware based on Mips on MacOS, and so on.\n\n\n\nIn this lab, we will be walking through the installation Qiling Framework, fundamentals and how to use Qiling Framework. We will also discuss how to build fuzzers based on 1day bugs. Eventually, how we can dig deeper on both the fuzzer and the 1day bug and possible chances to locate an 0day.\nQiling CONTRIBUTORS\n\n\nBo Wen, SUN\n\n\nBo Wen SUN is the team members Dubhe CTF team.
