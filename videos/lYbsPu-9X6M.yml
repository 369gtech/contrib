description: "by Gautier de Montmollin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.125/ada_compression.webm\n\n\nWe will show a new Trained Compression generic plug-in, which can leverage prior information about the data to be transmitted for reducing further raw compressed streams. We will also present a pick-and-choose technique feature called \"Preselection\" for improving the Zip archiving process. The Zip-Ada library has met over the years the needs of several professional users who need the file archiving features, or the data compression features to reduce storage and shorten transmission times. We will show the evolution of this full-Ada portable library and the advantages of using it. \n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:00:00+01"
