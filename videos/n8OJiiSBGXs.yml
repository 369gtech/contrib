language: English
recordingDate: 1433232101
description: "The Internet of Things is rapidly growing, and since its early days, different  standard  protocols have emerged (OMA-DM, TR-069, MQTT, ...) or are emerging (CoAP or Lightweight M2M, for example). Understanding which protocol to use for which application can be intimidating, so this presentation gives an overview of these protocols to help you understand their goals and characteristics. It includes the status of the available Java open source implementations, with projects such as Paho, Californium, Leshan, Moquette, and Kura. It also demonstrate the usage of the different presented Java projects for the most-common uses cases (device management, sensor networks, and the like.).\n\n\nAuthors:\nBenjamin Cabé\nBenjamin Cabé is IoT evangelist at the Eclipse Foundation.
