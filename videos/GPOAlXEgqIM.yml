language: English
recordingDate: 1563562606
description: "Kurt Andersen, LinkedIn\n\nStudies in the fields of safety, incident response, and organizational performance have identified a common characteristic shared by the best performing groups. This characteristic is called \"collective mindfulness\" or \"mindful organizing\" and it is especially pertinent to decision making under stressful conditions.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn what collective mindfulness is, training exercises which promote the development of collective mindfulness in teams or wider organizations. Specific suggestions relevant to the SRE practice will be provided along with exercises drawn from parallel organizations. You'll be able to take these exercises back to your day job after the conference to help your team.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
