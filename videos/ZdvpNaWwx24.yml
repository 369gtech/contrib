description: "An alternative title for this talk, says Simeon Franklin, could have been \"What are descriptors and why do I care?\" Descriptors give us a powerful interface to write reusable code that can be shared between classes, the descriptor protocol underlies cool and well-loved features of Python such as the @property decorator, but not many people seem to write descriptors directory. Are they too verbose, too difficult, or just not useful?\n\nSimeon, Technical Instructor at Twitter, believes that descriptors are an underutilized feature. In this talk from SF Python, he helps us understand how they work, how to write your own, and when to use them.\n\nFollow along with Simeon's slides: http://simeonfranklin.com/talk/descriptors.html\n\nFree Python Developer Resources: http://crcl.to/m575q\nProfessional Python Training: http://crcl.to/p430h\n\nInformation on SF Python: http://www.meetup.com/sfpython/"
