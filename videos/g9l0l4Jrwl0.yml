description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nQuarkus is a new Java runtime, designed for productivity and efficiency. Instant reload, hotspot and native execution, vastly reduced start time and memory usage, and all that with a set of libraries you already know, such as Hibernate, RestEasy, Vert.x or MicroProfile.\n\nThis talk will give an overview of Quarkus and demo basic cloud use cases with MicroProfile and Kubernetes."
