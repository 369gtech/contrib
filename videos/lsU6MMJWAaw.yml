language: English
recordingDate: 1616503376
description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\nLiberating Structures are easy-to-learn microstructures that enhance collaboration and trust. You can think of them as 33 simple but very powerful exercises, formats or games. Each with its own purpose, but all aimed to help groups move forward effectively.\n\nIn this online workshop I will guide you through a designed sequence of Liberating Structures, you will experience and learn how these structures bring a special way of online collaboration and conversation. You'll also learn how to facilitate it. We will be using Zoom in this session with breakout rooms, and an online collaboration board (Miro). This is an interactive session, you learn the structures by practicing, so be prepared to ACTIVELY take part in conversations with your peers!"
