language: English
recordingDate: 1582018624
description: "I created TotalCarCheck.co.uk after my parents fell victim to a criminal selling them a stolen car. Using .Net technologies I built the business from zero to checking millions of vehicles every month in a few years. Here I hope to share all of the shortcuts, tips, mistakes and must-do's for any project looking to go from side-project to money making business. This includes technology (opinions), cost control measures, strategies and things to avoid.\nI intend the lightening talk to be fun but informative. The lessons learned can be used on a side project, or in your day to day roles where applicable.\nI have distilled the most important lessons I have learnt over 5 years to create a useful guide for anyone looking to make the next step.\nThis talk includes .Net specific guidance. It includes recommendations for software and packages that we have used at Total Car Check to help you get a head start when trying to solve the common problems all e-businesses face, for example SEO (Search engine optimisation), avoiding the ‘snake oil’ and getting results.\nThis is the talk I wish I had heard before I started on my journey to build Total Car Check and I hope it can help inspire and assist others to build successful businesses.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
