title: 'YOW! 2016 Laura Bell - Simplicity, Complexity and Security'
recordingDate: 1483400822
description: "We no longer live in a world where we build our applications from scratch. We build amazing creations using the blocks provided by libraries, frameworks and components. We trust widely and openly. We share and collaborate.\n\nWe design architectures that combine simple single purpose entities into massive complex coupled systems.\n\nThen we try to secure them. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nIn this talk we will explore how our approaches to development, architecture and trust change the security of our applications and environments. We will discuss the challenges of securing these systems and some of the practical steps we can take to bring simple security to complex systems.\n\nLaura Bell likes building secure things and going really really fast, preferably at the same time.\n\nA speaker at a range of events such as BlackHat USA, BlueHat Velocity and OSCON, on the subjects of privacy, covert communications, agile security, and security mindset, she is an author for Oâ€™Reilly (the people with the animal books) and trains people anywhere they stay still long enough.\n\nShe founded the most chaotic security company in New Zealand, SafeStack (http://safestack.io) and now tries to bring security to some of the fasted moving application development environments on Earth.\n\nYou can find her at home in Auckland, New Zealand with her husband and daughter.\n\nFor more on YOW!
