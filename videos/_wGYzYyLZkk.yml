description: "The photo-sharing website Flickr has a ten-year history of trying out new things. From its origin as a feature spun off of a massively-multiplayer game, through the dark days of neglect, to its current reincarnation, many different people have advanced new ideas via many different paths.\n\nWhich roads are the smoothest and which are full of potholes? Which lead to the most interesting discoveries and which to the staid and expected? Are new ideas the sole province of product teams, or should engineers and designers participate in the process?\n\nIn his talk, Eric explores a brief history of Flickrâ€™s long tenure on the Web, and provides a platform from which to examine these questions.\n\nEric Socolofsky\nFront End Engineer, Flickr\nhttps://twitter.com/ericsoco\nhttps://www.flickr.com/people/ericsoco/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
