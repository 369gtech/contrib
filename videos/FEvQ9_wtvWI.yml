title: '"Pictures Of You, Pictures Of Me, Crypto Steganography" by Sean Marcia'

recordingDate: 1633989838
description: "I was puzzled when a friend sent me a Buffy the Vampire Slayer picture out of the blue, but knowing my friend is an oddball, thought nothing of it. Days later, again without warning, a Babylon 5 picture arrived in my inbox! A few days after that a picture from Firefly. Then they started re-sending the same three pictures over and over again. A cryptic comment turned out to be a clue, that led me to understand that there was more to the pictures than met the eye. Join me to learn the history, applications, and math behind Crypto Steganography, and learn how unraveling the mystery of the three pictures culminated in the resolution of a 15 year rivalry, when the US Olympic Men’s Curling team won the gold in 2018.\n\nSean Marcia\n@seanmarcia\n\nSean Marcia, pronouns he, him, his, founded Ruby for Good in 2013 to fill the gap created by inaccessible and uneconomical technology solutions for nonprofits.
