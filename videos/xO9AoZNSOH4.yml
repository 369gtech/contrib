description: "Can concepts from abstract algebra be used in a programming context? Tom Switzer thinks so. He believes that many problems, though they might not seem so at first, are actually algebraic. \n\nFor his talk at the Northeast Scala Symposium, Switzer shows us why abstractions from algebra are important, and how we can model these in Scala to be of benefit in everyday programming.\n\nTom Switzer is a senior R&D engineer at Precog and is the co-author of a generic numeric programming library called Spire.\n\n** Visit our site for more content on Scala, including the rest of the presentations from NE Scala 2013: http://marakana.com/s/tags/scala"
