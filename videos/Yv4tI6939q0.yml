title: '"Keynote: Drop Your Tools â€“ Does Expertise have a Dark Side?" - Dr Sean Brady (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1578986875
description: "Dr Sean Brady\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/218/\n\nAll professionals possess some measure of expertise, and not only is this expertise useful, it is usually also necessary to do the job. In general, this expertise is viewed as a good thing.\r\n\r\nBut what if there is an issue with expertise? Is expertise always a good thing?\r\n\r\nThis presentation will discuss how expertise has limitations when it is applied outside its normal area of application, and how these limitations will typically not be evident to the individual applying the expertise. Further, even in situations where evidence suggests the application of the expertise is inappropriate, it is likely that an individual will continue to apply their expertise regardless of its inappropriateness.\r\n\r\nTo explore these issues the presentation will examine the behaviour of a group of firefighters fighting a wildfire in Mann Gulch in the US in 1949, it will look at psychological studies that examine the concept of Priming, and it will discuss how the game of baseball can assist in unravelling why expertise can sometimes let us down.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
