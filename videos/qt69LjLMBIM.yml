description: "In the Internet of Things world, using a distributed architecture as a smart grid to manage power line routing leverages security as the top priority. A secure and safe system for connected grid devices is a key enabler for successful deployment. This session describes how the smart grid topology can be secured at each level of the grid architecture and communication. It presents a secure smart grid proof of concept using Java SE Embedded with Java Card inside a secure element. Embedded secure elements provide a high level of security against physical and logical attacks and can execute Java cryptography and signatures. The session, jointly presented by Oracle and Gemalto, includes a real-time demo.\n\n\nAuthors:\n Frederic Vaute\nFrederic is a Master Principal Sales consultant in the Java Sales organisation at Oracle, based in Paris (France). Frederic has a special interest and focus on embedded distributed systems and related security architectures. Frederic has 25+ years of experience in the domain and is involved in technical discussion with strategic global customers.\nView more trainings by  Frederic Vaute at https://www.parleys.com/author/frederic-vaute-5\n\n Marc Muller\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by  Marc Muller at https://www.parleys.com/author/marc-muller-1\n\n Pierre Girard\nPierre is Security architecture team manager at gemalto\nView more trainings by  Pierre Girard at https://www.parleys.com/author/pierre-girard\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
