description: "Banking on DevOps\n\nJohn Rzeszotarski, Director of DevOps, KeyBank\nChris McFee, Architect, KeyBank\n\nWe started our DevOps journey in January of 2016. We had a Traditional Silo'd Operations organization and spent entirely too much time coordinating these teams. In fact, we were aligned to our Risk organization, not for enablement.\n\nOur team planned to accelerate the Online Banking and Treasury Portal implementations. The bottlenecks we focused on first was Infrastructure, Automated Testing, and the Release platform. The team started the migration from proprietary solutions to open source platforms on containers. Containers alone are great, but Enterprises need High Availability, Self-Healing, Auto Scaling and Deployments that does not affect users during a release. Our biggest struggles were educating while adhering to security and risk policies and communication with offshore automated testing. \n\nIn seven short months we adopted Kubernetes in the enterprise, migrated multiple application components to open source platforms, hardened solutions with log forwarding and configurations for rolling deployments, and built out all the environments from development, testing, staging, disaster recovery to production. Oh and we also automated everything with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery processes.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
