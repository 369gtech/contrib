Few IoT devices have embraced modern C++ as a viable language for implementations. MQTT is a reliable publish-subscriber based messaging protocol that can be found in diverse ecosystems such as servers, cell phones, and light bulbs. Unfortunately, existing open source libraries leave much to be desired and many are a rich source of bad practices when compared to modern techniques. This session will explore maqiatto, CiereLab’s open source MQTT client library written for embedded systems in modern C++ . There will be a brief demonstration of the library followed by digging into the design and implementation while providing the resource “cost” of various solutions. As we explore the C++14 code base to illustrate useful idioms and techniques for your own code we will answer the questions, what does is take to put modern C++ on a small OS-less device or a cell phone? Are there features to avoid? Join us and see how libraries can be elegantly designed and implemented for big or small targets alike.\n— \nMichael Caisse\nCiere, Inc.\nMichael Caisse has been crafting code in C++ for 25-years.
