title: 'Automating Flink Deployments to Kubernetes - Marc Rooding & Niels Dennissen'
recordingDate: 1562936367
description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nDeploying Flink jobs while maintaining state requires a number of CLI tasks that need to be performed. As error-prone as that is when done manually, in any serious software project you'll rely on a continuous integration pipeline to automate it. Summing up a bunch of commands in a CI script will get you going. However, add a Kubernetes environment with restricted access in the mix and you got yourself an operational hell. What you really want is a tested, maintainable and repeatable process on which you can rely. In this talk we'll discuss the major pain points we had to overcome when deploying jobs to Apache Flink in a Kubernetes cluster and how we solved this by creating an open-source deployment tool.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
