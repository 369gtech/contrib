description: "Which was first, agile organizations or Agile methodologies? Why do companies believe the best way to become more adaptive (i.e. agile) is to implement Agile methodologies? Did the companies, who are leading the pack in digital transformation focus on implementing Agile or on something else? Do companies know at all what Digital Transformation is about? \n\nI will share with you what I have learnt and collected both from my own transformation experience and from what my peers have shared with me. All my peers, who I interviewed are responsible for global / regional (agile/digital) transformation just like myself. I have collected misconceptions and mistakes about this topic and will help you to guide yourself and your organization to the direction where the leading companies are heading to. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nhttp://www.stretchcon.com/"
