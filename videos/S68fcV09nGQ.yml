language: English
recordingDate: 1517162405
description: "Firefox is in the process of shipping a new implementation of CSS styling written in Rust as part of Mozilla’s Servo project. Firefox has 20+ million lines of code and hundreds of millions of users, so this is no small undertaking! As a case study for integrating a large, multi-repo Rust project into a larger C++ project, this talk explains how we:\n\n- created bi-directional FFI boundaries that maximized each project’s strengths\n- addressed cross-language mismatches including threadsafety and ownership\n- integrated two fast-moving codebases while managing regressions\n\nWe’ll cover specific successes and failures that emerged over the course of the project, and discuss how Rust contributed to those outcomes.\n\nEVENT:\n\nRust Belt Rust\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJosh Matthews\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6SSTRr2mFU"
