title: 'Ellie Shin No Strings Attached at Mobile Era'
recordingDate: 1574413422
description: "Swift String is one of the most commonly used fundamental types in the Swift standard library, but it has pitfalls that are easily overlooked. At Uber, we work with multiple apps that are deployed in multiple markets and localized in over 50 languages, which rely heavily on correctness and safety of String. We’ve also built multiple code generators and other developer tools that involve a large amount of String processing, and thus String performance can have a huge impact. This talk will discuss various scenarios where we encountered pitfalls of Swift Strings, and the methods we used to resolve challenges from both the correctness and performance perspectives. It will also cover what you can do for your apps or tools to safeguard and optimize if you use Strings a lot.\n\nAbout the speaker\nEllie is a senior iOS Engineer at Uber on the mobile platform team. She has worked on building Uber’s rider app and tools including code generators. She cares deeply about optimizing iOS apps and frameworks at scale. She has previously worked at Spotify and Microsoft among other companies, primarily on iOS. She has given talks at UIKonf, NSSpain, and other conferences, on iOS app binary size optimization, efficient code generation, and Swift String performance.\n\nAbout Mobile Era\nMobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo. We're passionate about developing mobile apps and want to see a kick-ass event in Oslo for people like ourselves. The organizing committee consists of developers who are also active in organizing open events, conferences and meetups in the Oslo developer community.\n\nOur topics: iOS / Android, Mobile web / PWA, Cross-platform / JS-to-Native, IoT / Hardware, Mobile UX / Accessibility\n\nFollow us on:\n\nWebsite: mobileera.rocks\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mobileeraconf\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mobileeraconf/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mobileeraconf"
