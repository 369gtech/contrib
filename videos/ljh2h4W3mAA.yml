description: "Have you ever been approached by an online publisher to create content and dismissed the idea because you thought it’s unlikely to be worth your time? While you may have legitimate reasons for dismissing this kind of freelance offer, there are several reasons why you should consider it. As an Acquisitions Editor at a technology learning company, I have spent years crisscrossing the globe looking for the best, the brightest, and the up-and-coming Java experts to share their knowledge with the world. I have had thousands of conversations with some of the best minds in software development. In this talk, Arun and I will team up to take a critical look at the reasons you should give this subject some thoughts. We will answer the biggest question of all: What’s in it for me? We’ll do this from both the developer and the non-developer’s point of views. We’ll address time commitment, return on investment, and credentials. Our discussions will also examine the implications for the Java community you support. Our principal aim is to arm you with the most accurate information so next time someone approaches you with a similar offer, you’ll know which questions to ask.\n\nKoffi Alain Sessi is a strategic communicator and tech enthusiast with a passion for using branding and identity development to help tech experts further their personal reach. As Acquisitions Editor at Pluralsight, Koffi has helped tens of Java experts expand their brands and advance their careers through Pluralsight’s curated learning platform.
