title: 'Coding Tests:  Why You Don''t Need Them During Interviews'
recordingDate: 1543661697
description: 'Technical organizations have a rather interesting problem. Employees add values by the skills they are proficient with. It''s important since those skills need to fit with the technology the company has chosen, mesh well with the skills of coworkers, and are ever so important in delivering results so that profits can be made. Judging those technical skills in just a short amount of time provided by an interview can be difficult. Many have attempted to better judge a candidate''s technical skills lately with coding exercises during the hiring process. But, coding exercises can cause many very talented developers to fall through the cracks and good candidates can be lost. Why? Other professions don''t do this. A doctor interviewing for a job isn''t told to perform an appendectomy and send in the appendix as part of an interview. This session will: 1) Show the dangers of coding tests 2) Suggest alternatives for coding tests 3) Show how to minimize the dangers if you MUST use the coding test'
