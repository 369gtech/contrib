It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.\n\nWith React Native, you don't build a \"mobile web app\", an \"HTML5 app\", or a \"hybrid app\". You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React."
