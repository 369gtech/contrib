recordingDate: 1446775483
description: "Courtney Kissler, Vice President of E-Commerce and Store Technologies, Nordstrom\n\nJason Josephy, Development Manager, Nordstrom\n\nLast year, I shared our story about transforming to a culture of continuous improvement. Since then, we have made progress in some areas and have had setbacks in others. We’ve learned a lot and this year and we have made adjustments. I will give an update on our directive to reduce cycle time by 20%. In addition, Jason Josephy, a Group Manager from our eCommerce team, who recently moved to our non-tender Loyalty team, will share his perspective on his DevOps journey at Nordstrom.\n\nFinally, as with most enterprises, we have legacy applications, legacy technology, and legacy mindsets. In this talk, I will share how we are approaching this problem by investing in our people, setting targets, using metrics to make data-driven decisions and share an example of how we took one of our legacy mainframe applications and leveraged lean techniques to problem solve and conduct an experiment that significantly reduced cycle time, improved data accuracy and most importantly – improved our customer satisfaction and team morale."
