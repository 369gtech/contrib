description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\n\nFashion becomes interactive and technology has never before been as close to the skin – what kind of possibilities does this open up? Anouk Wipprecht is a FashionTech designer who works interdisciplinary in search for intelligent systems that interact with the body as the environment of the wearer. Wipprecht uses machine learning and biomimicry coupled to sensors and animatronics. Her designs move, breath, and react to the world around them. She is interested in new ways we can interface — and builds micro-controlled garments to provoke her generation.\n\nAnouk Wipprecht\nCurator, Designer, Engineer, anoukwipprecht.nl\nhttps://twitter.com/AnoukWipprecht\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSee Anouk at CAMP Festival 2018 - https://goo.gl/sjpf67"
