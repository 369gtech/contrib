description: "Michael Hrivnak, Red Hat, Inc.\n\nAbstract: \nMany applications consist of multiple services, such as a database, API service, and frontend. Provisioning them as a single application in Kubernetes can be a challenge, especially if one or more services runs outside your cluster.\n\nThe Service Catalog provides a new way to publish, provision, and manage applications on Kubernetes through the use of Service Brokers. The Automation Broker allows users to leverage Ansible Automation to define and orchestrate simple to complex multi-service deployments.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\nHow to provision a multi-service application on Kubernetes using the Automation Broker.\nHow to include external service provisioning in your applicationâ€™s deployment.\nHow to package Ansible Playbooks into a single meta-container for orchestrating the deployment of your application.\nHow to publish your own applications in the Kubernetes Service Catalog.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
