description: "by Eduard Tomàs\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.201/dotnet_console_app.webm\n\n\nCreating a .NET Core console app seems a very easy thing: your logic and a few calls to System.Console, isn't it? Well, in this talk I will try to explain why cross-platform console apps aren't easy as they seems. I'll talk about what console means on different operating systems, how they differ and how it can impact on your application. Will see why System.Console is incomplete, why is missing and take a glance to native APIs (Win32 Console API, curses/ncurses, termcap/terminfo) and how we can try to abstract their differences. \n\nFor the samples I'll use Tvision2, an open source (https://github.com/eiximenis/tvision2) library that I am developing to help building full-featured cross-platform console apps! \n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:30:00+01"
