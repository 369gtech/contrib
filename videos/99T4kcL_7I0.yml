title: 'Intro to Gestural Interfaces with the Microsoft Kinect'
recordingDate: 1335640981
description: "This webcast offers a beginners introduction to building your own applications with the Microsoft Kinect. It covers everything you need to know to understand how the Kinect works and how it enables new forms of interaction.\n\nIn this webcast, Greg Borenstein, author of Making Things See, will introduce you to:\n\n-The history of the Kinect and the principles behind how it works as a depth camera and how it can track users' skeletons\n-Survey the landscape of tools, drivers, and frameworks that are available for working with the Kinect and doing skeleton tracking based on its data\n-Understand the calibration process, how it works, and why and when it's necessary\n-Learn how to access user joint positions in 3D\n-Explore tools for using joint position and relative distance in user interfaces and creative tools\n-Discover the possibilities, limitations, and opportunities in this kind of interaction\n\n\nAbout Greg Borenstein:\n\nAfter a decade as a musician, web programmer, and startup founder, Greg Borenstein recently moved to New York to become an artist and teacher. His work explores the use of special effects as an artistic medium. He is fascinated by how special effects techniques cross the boundary between images and the physical objects that make them: miniatures, motion capture, 3D animation, animatronics, and digital fabrication. He is currently a grad student at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
