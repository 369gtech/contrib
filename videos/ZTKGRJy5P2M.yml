title: 'C# Advanced Async - Getting progress reports, cancelling tasks, and more'
language: English
recordingDate: 1517587240
description: "Now that we know how to do the basics in async, let's take it to the next level. In this video, we look at how to get status reports back from asynchronous tasks so we can display a progress bar and more to the screen while they are running. We also set up the ability to cancel a long-running or hung asynchronous task.\n\nWe will also explore the differences between adding tasks in a foreach loop vs Parallel.foreach and how we can even get the benefits of both methods at the same time.\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/ (your email will be kept safe and you will not be spammed).\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=AdvancedAsyncDemo\nIntro to Async / Await: https://youtu.be/2moh18sh5p4"
