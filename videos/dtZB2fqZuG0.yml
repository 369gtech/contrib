title: 'Observable Web Applications - Todd Gardner - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623753086
description: "Users don’t see your distributed services, cloud architecture, or instrumentation—they only see how the web app is working. Understanding their experience in the client-side is the first step towards understanding the rest of the system. \nWe’ll explore how to make your client-side applications more observable through error tracking, web performance, and usage analytics. With better understanding of real-user experience, you’ll better understand the real behavior of your systems."
