description: '010 Let''s create a simple functional component in React named ball and figure out how to make the ball rotate on the edge of a disc. We''ll make use of some CSS tricks so we don''t have to do any math or complex algorithm, let the browser do it for us. Don''t miss out how to render multiple tags in React without wrapping it in a root tag or without using React fragment. Again, you shouldn''t choose JavaScript over CSS or the other way around, as a web developer you should mix and match them to maximise the potential both technologies have to offer if you want to be in top 10% best web developers in the world.'
