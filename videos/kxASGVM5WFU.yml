description: "They say the only constant in the world is change. Google is no different, so we’re happy to announce that the Launchpad Online video series you’re familiar with is splitting into two! On the Google APIs side, we’re creating a new series called “The G Suite Dev Show” where we’ll continue to show you a variety of things you can do with the G Suite set of APIs & developer tools. On the Launchpad side, the updated Launchpad program is taking off to focus on helping your startup grow. This DevByte introduces you to both video series. Let us show you how Google developer tools and programs can help you become more successful!\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel for new episodes of the G Suite Dev Show: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
