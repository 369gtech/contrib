description: "C++ is marooned in the 1970s with its lack of standard support for graphical output to anything other than stdout. The history of programming is full of experts who learned their profession by writing simple games, puzzles and demos, all of which require graphical display.\n\nThe graphics API for Standard C++ has been under development for a while and is nearly ready for prime time use. A reference implementation is available. In this talk one of the co-authors will give an overview of all the features it offers and demonstrate some of the capabilities, as well as reveal some of the sample programs that have been written with it.\n\nAll code will be available from GitHub after the presentation. This talk is suitable for educators and those seeking to get a lead on the newest technology coming to C++. It should be accessible to most levels of expertise."
