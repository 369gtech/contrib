description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nSpring Framework 5.0’s major theme is Reactive Programming support, specifically, Reactive Streams. To fuel that revolution, the same OSS teams behind Spring and RxJava are working on an independent reactive engine: Project Reactor. In fact, it’s supporting a wide range of reactive new features from Spring MVC to Spring Data, Spring Cloud Streams, or even Kafka, Netty and Cloud Foundry orchestration (!).\nThis session introduces Reactor 3 with practical examples. It will show how to write and test reactive applications or APIs that are backpressure-ready and resilient by design, going from callback hell to reactive well."
