description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/2BXjLSo\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\nServerless technology is trending, but in-depth details are missing. How does it fit with non-serverless components? What are the practical use cases? Should you fight vendor lock-in? And what about limits and pitfalls with Azure? I will answer those questions, share a few tricks and short demo.\nI'll cover serverless usage scenarios with Azure, what problems can be solved, and what is a viable adoption strategy. Then I'm going to talk about technology shortcomings, when to omit it and how to rip all benefits. There are circumstances when a cloud-agnostic approach is beneficial, so I discuss serverless frameworks too and why vendor lock is not that bad. Finally, we'll look at a short demo that illustrates why you have to use specific serverless patterns."
