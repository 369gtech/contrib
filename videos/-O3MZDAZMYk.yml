description: "RejectJS 2013 - http://rejectjs.org - Berlin, September 12, 2013\nBitford: https://github.com/astro/bitford\n\n\nTalk description: \"With Chrome Packaged Apps and Mozilla Open Web Apps, desktop apps can now be written in HTML & JS. Apart from cosmetical distinction, these apps gain a number of privileges over conventional Web apps.\n\nThis talk focuses on the fileSystem and socket APIs for a polished attempt at bringing the Internet's best media distribution system back to the browser: Bitford, a BitTorrent client running as a Chrome Packaged App.\n\nCompared to other Chrome extensions, Bitford does not remote-control a native client behind the stages. It implements the standard BitTorrent wire protocol over TCP, storing data with the fileSystem API exposed by the browser, all in JavaScript.\n\nI will detail some practical techniques for processing binary data streams. Necessary information about BitTorrent will be provided. Then I am going to talk about ways to facilitate streaming to HTML5 media elements as soon as particular data is available and verified. That means: load a .torrent and start playback almost immediately!\"\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
