language: English
recordingDate: 1624957292
description: "During the last decades a growing trend has been to put more and more functionality into the client by using the latest and greatest JavaScript framework. But what if we could be using native code in the browser in order to run computations faster and potentially reuse code from the backend in the frontend.\n\nEnter Web Assembly. Web assembly is a new web standard which enables you to run native code as part of your current JavaScript framework. This talk will give you a thorough understanding of what web assembly is and how you can use it in your project.\n\nWe will cover a practical example writing our web assembly using Rust. We will go through everything from writing your web assembly code to publish it as a npm package and finally use it in an existing web application."
