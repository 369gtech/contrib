description: "Presented by Brian Johnson at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday April 24th 2014 - Universal Controller is a node.js based application intended to run on a device within a local network - preferably a dedicated server (such as a Raspberry Pi). It allows all web capable devices within that same network to issue commands to any other configured device. You may use your phone, tablet, desktop or laptop browser to interact with any controllable device - or issue simple GET commands programmatically.\n\n* twitter.com/imbrianj\n* github.com/imbrianj"
