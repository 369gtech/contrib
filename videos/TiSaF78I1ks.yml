description: "by Timo Savola\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2215/gate_portable_execution_state.webm\n\nThis presentation is an introduction of an open source project I have been working on for five years.\n\n\nBuilding on WebAssembly, Gate makes it possible to snapshot running programs and resume them in diverse environments: unlike with other snapshot-and-restore solutions, the snapshots are portable across CPU architectures and operating systems.  Part of the solution is appropriate resource abstraction.  The presentation includes a quick demonstration of migration of a program between x86-64 and ARM64 machines.\nA subproject of Gate is a specialized WebAssembly compiler implemented in Go.\n\n\nGate is at the stage where a proof-of-concept has been implemented; it works.  Its future would greatly benefit from wider community engagement, so I wish to present the project and its ideas to a technical user and developer audience.\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 16:20:00"
