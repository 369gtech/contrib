description: "Speaker : Valentin Deleplace\n\nI want to optimize the performance of my cloud components, to save money, but most importantly to improve responsiveness. Nobody enjoys slow software…\n\nMy key advice is to consider the whole picture, to measure, and to focus on the bottlenecks. I will tell the story of a cool app written in Go using App Engine and GKE, which has latency problems. Let’s explore how to diagnose it with the tooling: Benchmarks, Pprof, CPU Trace, Flame graphs, OpenTelemetry, and StackDriver’s waterfalls.\n\nOnce I am able to visualize the latencies, it becomes much easier to incrementally make my app faster!"
