description: 'So you’ve already containerized the shit out of your code, broken down monoliths, microserviced the hell out of your app and have run some awesome workloads in your local, dev and test environments. It’s all looking good, but now what? Running Docker commands is one thing, but maintaining containers in production is a whole other ballgame. So during this talk, I’ll show you the REAL wild world of Docker in production. With the added benefit of talking to and observing how over 900 of our customers have been using Docker in production.'
