title: 'Flink for Everyone: Self-Service Data Analytics with StreamPipes - Philipp Zehnder&Patrick Wiener'
recordingDate: 1571153988
description: "This talk presents StreamPipes (https://www.streampipes.org), an open source self-service data analytics solution leveraging existing big data technologies such as Apache Flink to provide non-technical users with an easy and intuitive way to connect, analyze and exploit a variety of different streaming data sources for their use.\n\nNewly arising IoT-driven use cases in domains such as manufacturing, smart city or autonomous driving often demand for continuous integration and processing of sensor data in order to derive time-sensitive actions. One example is the optimization of maintenance processes based on the current condition of machines (condition-based maintenance). While this is technically already well supported by the existing big data tool landscape, building such applications still require a crucial set of expertise ranging from general domain expertise, programming skills to deep knowledge on distributed and scalable systems. Such skills are usually not present in hardware-focused manufacturing companies.\n\nTo mitigate these shortcomings, StreamPipes allows non-technical users to leverage a graphical editor to model and deploy analytical tasks as pipelines in a drag and drop manner. Pipelines are built based on a toolbox of reusable data adapters, processors and sinks. Toolbox elements encapsulate dedicated algorithms (e.g., filter, aggregation, machine learning classifiers) implemented in big data processing engines such as Apache Flink communicating over an internal distributed messaging system (e.g. Apache Kafka).\n\nIn this talk, we present technologies and tools enabling flexible modeling of real-time processing pipelines by domain experts. We motivate our talk by showing real-world examples we gathered from a number of industry projects during the past years in Industrial IoT domains such as manufacturing and supply chain management. For instance, we show how StreamPipes eases the accessibility of big data tools for non-technical users based on examples such as supervising a fleet of autonomous electric delivery vehicles as well as data analytics in one of the largest test areas for autonomous driving in Germany."
