description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nFlyte: Cloud Native Machine Learning & Data Processing Platform - Ketan Umare & Haytham AbuelFutuh, Lyft \n\nFlyte is the backbone for large-scale Machine Learning and Data Processing (ETL) pipelines at Lyft. It is used across business critical applications ranging from ETA, Pricing, Mapping, Autonomous, etc. At its core is a Kubernetes native workflow engine that executes 10M+ containers per month as part of thousands of workflows. The talk will focus on,  - Architecture of Flyte and its specification language to orchestrate compute and manage data flow across disparate systems like Spark, Flink, Tensorflow, Hive, etc.  - Deploying highly scalable and fault tolerant Kubernetes Operators  - Learnings from operating Flyte across multiple Kubernetes clusters and using other CNCF technologies like gRPC, Envoy, FluentD, Kustomize and Prometheus.  - Use-cases where Flyte can be leveraged  The talk will conclude with a demo of a machine learning pipeline built using the open source version of Flyte. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaYY"
