description: "When you were just a developer, things seemed so simple. Sometimes it was a choice between using several libraries, or working out the right algorithm to solve a problem. Making decisions seemed really easy. When you are playing the Lead Developer role, decisions no longer seem black and white and you have several competing priorities.\n\nWe will explore the common paradoxes a Lead Developer experiences such as keeping technically relevant and developing better people skills, focusing on delivery software and supporting learning and encouraging improvements and maintaining consistency. Come away from this talk recognising the paradoxes other Lead Developers share with you and how to successfully solve them.\n\n\nAbout Patrick Kua\n\nPatrick is a Principal Technical Consultant at ThoughtWorks who is normally found leading development teams. He is a conference speaker and author of “The Retrospective Handbook” and “Talking with Tech Leads” and is passionate about bringing a balanced focus on people, organisation and technology."
