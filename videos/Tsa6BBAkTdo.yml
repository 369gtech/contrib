title: '2017 Cockpit: A Linux sysadmin session in your Browser'
recordingDate: 1508619759
description: "https://media.ccc.de/c/asg2017/ASG2017-99-cockpit_a_linux_sysadmin_session_in_your_browser\n\n\n\nCockpit is an open source project that has built the new system admin UI for Linux. It turns Linux server into something discoverable and usable. Its goal is to remove the steep learning curve for Linux deployments.\n\nCockpit lets you immediately dive into things like storage, network configuration, system log diagnosis, container troubleshooting and Kubernetes orchestration. All while being zero-footprint: It goes away when not in use. Cockpit interacts well with other management configuration tools, it reacts instantly to system changes made elsewhere.\n\nWe'll look at how Cockpit is an actual linux user session that you drive through your browser, running with user privileges, and accesses to the native system APIs and tools.\n\nYou'll be able to build new pieces of sysadmin UI as fast as you write a shell script. In fact we'll do it on stage in a few minutes.\n\n\n\n\nStef Walter"
