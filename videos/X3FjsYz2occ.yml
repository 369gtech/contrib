recordingDate: 1550095205
description: "Streaming Data with Kafka and Microservices\n\nWhen we think of modern data processing, we often think of batch-oriented ecosystems like Hadoop, including processing engines like Spark. However, the sooner we can extract useful information from our data, the better, which is driving an evolution towards stream processing or “fast data”. Many of the legacy tools, including Spark, provide various levels of support for stream processing, but deeper architectural changes are emerging.\n\nDean Wampler, Ph.D., is a member of the Office of the CTO and the Architect for Big Data Products and Services at Typesafe. He uses Scala and Functional Programming to build Big Data systems using Spark, Mesos, Hadoop, the Typesafe Reactive Platform, and other tools. Dean is the author or co-author of three O’Reilly books on Scala, Functional Programming, and Hive. He contributes to several open source projects (including Spark) and he co-organizes and speaks at many technology conferences and Chicago-based user groups.\n\nFor more on YOW!
