description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nBjorn Freeman-Benson - Software Psychologist. VP Engineering, New Relic\n\nABSTRACT\nIn four years, New Relic has grown from a dozen customers to over 25,000 customers, and from collecting hundreds of metrics a day to collecting billions a day. We've done this without a huge investment in hardware - which is very cool. This talk will cover some of the ways we built a system that has scaled so effectively. Sharding, of course, but sharding is not magic; caching, of course, but caching is not magic; hardware improvements, of course, but ... well, you get the idea. There is no one magic solution but a combination a number of strategic decisions. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
