title: 'JeremyBytes - Lambdas & LINQ in C# - Bonus: Deciphering the Join Method'
recordingDate: 1429927117
description: 'Previously, we looked at demystifying LINQ method syntax, including Where, OrderBy, and SingleOrDefault. The Join method looks a bit more complicated - 4 generic types and 5 parameters. But when we take a closer look, we see that we''ve already dealt with the pieces in similar methods. We''ll take a closer look to fully understand the syntax of the Join method.
