However, it poses some challenges: remote function management and the cognitive load of a complex system. We find existing tools insufficient and propose a novel approach using the Luna programming language, its visual-textual representation of programs and functional semantics. We leverage it to create a proof-of-concept framework for remote function management and execution, using AWS Lambda as a base platform.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/piotr-moczurad\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKERS\n\nPIOTR MOCZURAD\nMember of the Luna team, Haskell developer\nMore on Piotr: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/daniel-urban\n\nMIRON MARKOWSKI\nArtist wannabe\nMore on Miron: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/miron-markowski\n\nŁUKASZ NAWOJOWSKI\nRambler\nMore on Łukasz: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/lukasz-nawojowski\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
