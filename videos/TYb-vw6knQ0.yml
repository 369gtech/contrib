description: "AWS continues to expand .NET Core support, especially with the release of .NET Core 2.0 support for AWS Lambda.\nWith AWS Lambda you can build serverless applications responding to AWS events, like changes to your data in AWS, custom triggers using any of the AWS SDKs or HTTP events coming from the internet. \n\nServerless is not all you can do with .NET Core and AWS. The .NET Core platform is great for running containerized applications with Amazon Elastic Container Service. \n\nJoin this session to see how to use both serverless and container technology. We'll also explore when to use each technology."
