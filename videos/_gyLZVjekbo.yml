description: "Check out 3 quick lightning talks from Tamir Gefen, Meredith L. Patterson, and Santiago M. Mola. \n\nTamir Gefen presents a case study on moving to Git from IBM Rational ClearCase, including challenges; how to resolve them; some technical tips and lessons learned (including insights).\n\nMeredith L. Patterson discusses the use of Git as a blockchain-like primitive for the delivery of humanitarian aid in a stored-value network. She'll also talk about git as a primitive for delay-tolerant design, and what that implies for P2P technologies and the developing world.\n\nSantiago Mola discusses the development of go-git, a Git library written entirely in Go. He'll introduce the library and share some use cases.\n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels.
