description: 'In this talk, I will share my experiences from ''Groovyfying'' a new team from a well established company producing toys, that is established to handle tasks that typically calls for a more agile approach, and using a microservice architecture. What elements from the Groovy Ecosystem are low-hanging fruits to integrate amongst a team with JAVA competences, but little Groovy knowledge? What is the status after roughly one year? And how can you convince your own team to Groovy-up?'
