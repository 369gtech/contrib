description: "http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/33482\n\nHumans are constantly curious and learning should be about making new discoveries. With big data, we have the potential to take formal learning which is taught and combine it with informal learning which is experienced, to create personalized learning paths for every individual. Ramona's personal story set her on this path and she will share what it means for companies and people across the world."
