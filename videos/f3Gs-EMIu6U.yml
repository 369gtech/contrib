title: 'IoT at home - The solution to all your spare time problems - Karl-Henrik Nilsson'
recordingDate: 1470642298
description: 'IoT today is mostly about prebuilt appliances made for a specific purpose, with a neat API often via a cloud service not even allowing you to talk to the hardware directly, or allowing you to own your data. I will talk about some of the design implications that goes into designing and building your own IoT hardware that talk to the cloud, how we design items with a high WAF, and how we can make solutions that are somewhat less likely to fail miserably in a short amount of time.'
