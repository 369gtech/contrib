description: "Full title of the presentation: \"3 Martech Industry Trends: Ecosystems, Experts, and (Citizen) Engineers\"\n\nScott will share three of the overarching trends shaping the marketing industry:\n\nThe maturing of martech platform ecosystems, overcoming the tension between suite vs. best-of-breed and consolidation vs. diversification.\nThe blending of software and services — within both SaaS vendors and agencies/consultancies — overcoming the barriers of utilizing cutting-edge technology.\nThe blending of commercial martech software and custom development — including by citizen developers — overcoming the tension between build vs. buy.\nAll three of these trends are breaking free of classic Pareto trade-offs in the martech industry and enabling marketers to have \"the best of both worlds\" — standardization and specialization, cutting edge technology without the talent gap, and customized martech capabilities without reinventing the wheel.\n\nYou can harness these trends today. But they will also get you through the disruptive \"age of martech reckoning\" ahead as we transition from the first golden age of marketing software to the second golden age beyond.\n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on Marketing Stage during Infoshare 2019."
