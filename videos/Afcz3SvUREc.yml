title: 'Sumatra OpenJDK Project Update: Parallelize Yourself with the Stream API'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433253484
description: "The Sumatra Project aims to enable execution of a suitable portion of Java applications on GPUs. GPUs can offer huge performance gains for some workloads, but it used to require special setup for the application to execute on the GPU. The project is leveraging the parallel execution features in the Stream API to make the offload of Java methods to a GPU as simple and transparent as possible. This session presents an overview of the project, which intends to fully integrate GPU execution into the JDK; shows its current features; and shows how the OpenJDK Graal compiler is being used to produce the GPU code. It also demonstrates how to use lambdas and the Stream API that will enable application code to be transparently offloaded to the GPU.\n\n\nAuthor:\nEric Caspole\nEric is an engineer in the AMD Server Runtimes team working on the Sumatra project since 2012.
