description: "Google Tech Talks\nOctober, 26 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn this talk we will discuss the issues involved in building\nindustrial-strength performance tools. We first discuss the\nrequirements for such tools, and then the issues and tradeoffs\ninvolved in compiling the targets for the tools. We then discuss data\ncollection, and the strengths and weaknesses of the different\ntechnologies that can be used. We go on to discuss the issues involved\nin data presentation, and how to show data in the user's model of the\ncode, rather than in the implementation model in which the data is\ncollected. Finally, we discuss the issues involved in testing such\ntools.\n\nSpeaker: Marty Itzkowitz, Sun Microsystems\nMarty Itzkowitz is Architect and Project Lead of Performance Tools at\nSun Microsystems, where he is responsible for various tools including\nSun Studio Performance Analyzer. Previous to Sun, Marty was Technical\nLead for Performance and Parallelization Tools at SGI, where he lead\nthe development of SGI SpeedShop and SGI Developer Magic."
