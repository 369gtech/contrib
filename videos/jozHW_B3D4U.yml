description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nC++20 is set to add new facilities to make writing concurrent code easier. Some of them come from the previously published Concurrency TS, and others are new, but they all make our lives as developers easier. This talk will introduce the new features, and explain how and why we should use them.\n\nThe evolution of the C++ Concurrency support doesn't stop there though: the committee has a continuous stream of new proposals. This talk will also introduce some of the most important of these, including the new Executor model.\n— \nAnthony Williams\nJust Software Solutions Ltd\nAnthony Williams is the author of C++ Concurrency in Action.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
