description: "Matt and Emily start out this episode of the Boring Show by answering a handful of Flutter questions. They discuss e-commerce apps, applying padding and spacer for your app layout, when to use viewmodel, and more. Remember to ask your flutter questions in the comments or by using #BoringShow on Twitter! \n\nIn the remaining 40 minutes, Matt and Emily dive back into the Hacker News reader app (9:30). They work through incorporating web view into the app so that users can view web content from within the reader app - this eliminates the need to bounce back and forth between reader app and browser.\n\n(Also, stay tuned for the new Flutter YouTube channel coming soon!)\n\nFilip’s GitHub → https://bit.ly/2MqwDEW\nSource Code for Hacker News reader app → https://bit.ly/2FSKLFC\nFlutter Samples → https://bit.ly/2R8SeCq\nFilip’s State Experiments → https://bit.ly/2ATIlDh\n\n\nLink to previous episode → https://bit.ly/2HsfJqN\n\nWatch more episodes of the boring show here → https://bit.ly/BoringShow\n\nGet started with Flutter → https://flutter.io\nTry a Flutter codelab → https://goo.gl/d3fHPo\nJoin the conversation → https://goo.gl/68oUnb\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel → https://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
