title: 'Codemotion Deep Learning Conference 2020: The role of AI in the transformation of the banking sector'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592418961
description: "In the past ten years, we have witnessed the evolution of the concept of artificial intelligence towards a concept that has captured the collective imagination with its promises of transformation. Machine learning and its flagship applications: Alpha Go, the autonomous car, image recognition, machine translation, etc., have created expectations in terms of the transformative potential of certain sectors of economic activity. Historically, the banking sector has been a kind of ocean liner that has struggled to change direction. In terms of technological innovation, banks have been overtaken by the fintech ecosystem in terms of agility. As banks try to catch up, it's important to take a hard look at the promise of artificial intelligence and what it means for the banking industry. In this presentation, we will discuss the transformation potential that artificial intelligence brings to the sector, but also the challenges that this transformation represents. We will discuss these questions around some examples of the application of machine learning in banking and capital markets.\n\nSpeaker: Manuel Morales, General Director, FinML Network"
