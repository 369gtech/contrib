description: "While we go with microservices we bring one of the consequence which is using multiple datastores. With single data source, itâ€™s way much easier to guaranty that given entity such as customer, order or payment will have the same state across the system. The challenges arise when the related data is spread across multiple microservices. This talk represents my architecture experience gathered in three organizations from different industries on making data consistent across multiple microservices. The solutions are based and inspired on the known facts about distributed systems such as CAP theorem or FLP impossibility, protocols such as 2PC or Raft, patterns such as Sagas or Event Sourcing.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
