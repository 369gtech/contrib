description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nCNCF Project Paperwork Working Session - Josh Berkus, Red Hat, Carolyn Van Slyck, Microsoft & Dawn Foster, VMware \n\nAt each stage from Sandbox to Graduated, you’ll need to add community and process documentation – and there’s even more that’s good to have even if it’s not required. Let us help you create this “project paperwork” now instead of waiting for a deadline. With just a little planning, it doesn’t need to overwhelm you. SIG Contributor Strategy will walk you through required and desired community docs, how to use the new template repo, and which docs you need at which level. We’ll also be on hand to answer your questions and provide 1-on-1 help and editorial support. You can get your project ready, and we’ll show you how. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekG0"
