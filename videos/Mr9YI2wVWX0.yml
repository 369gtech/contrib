title: 'Resilient and Adaptable Systems with Cloud Native APIs'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327470
description: "You may have heard about cloud native applications and the patterns and infrastructure required to run them, but what about your APIs? What is a cloud native API? \n \n As we move to cloud native systems, the APIs are the glue that binds them together. API clients can be very diverse, from the desktop to mobile to IoT. \n \n In this talk, we describe what a cloud native API is and discuss some patterns and protocols that help connect clients and APIs. Some of the patterns we discuss include API gateways, API discoverability, distributed APIs, and adaptability. We demo some tools, protocols, and projects that you can use to implement Cloud Native APIs, such as RSocket and GraphQL.\n\n Olga Maciaszek-Sharma, Senior Member of Technical Staff at VMware\n Spencer Gibb, Spring Cloud Core Lead at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/resilient-and-adaptable-systems-with-cloud-native-apis"
