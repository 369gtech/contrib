description: "How can we develop websites where the different parts of the pages are developed by different teams? If you work in a large enough organization which has its content and services on the web, this is probably a question you have asked yourself several times.\n\nWith this talk I want to show that server-side rendered websites integrated on content (using transclusion) allow for high long-term evolvability compared to client-side rendering integrated with shared code. In other words, if you want a system with high long-term evolvability, you should not develop websites using only client-side JavaScript and integrate them using a shared components approach.\n\nI will also show that Client Side Includes is a good first choice for transclusion technology, since they are lightweight and allow for a faster initial release than Edge Side Includes."
