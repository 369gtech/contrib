description: "Why is it that when a security person says ‘we should validate our inputs’, developers usually run away screaming about the unreasonably huge amount of work that requires? Why is it that when a developer says they ‘just made a quick hack to get things working’, security people start getting a panicked look in their eyes? What is it about Security and Development that the fields are so closely linked, yet nobody seems to understand each other clearly? Security and developers actually want the same thing, but due to a difference in terms and ways of seeing the world, good solutions are often missed.\n\nWelcome to this talk, featuring a developer and a security pony trying to bridge the gap, and find a better way forward together."
