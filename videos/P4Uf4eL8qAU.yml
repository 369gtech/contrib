recordingDate: 1579213119
description: "Nicola Nye\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/26/\n\nWhen will your personal data be hacked, leaked or compromised? If you think it already hasn't happened to you, think again. What about your parent's data? Your children's data?\r\n\r\nWe are increasingly inhabiting a digital world, scattering electronic footprints in databases near and far. We, as technologists, have a responsibility to ensure that our products are using that data for good. Treating the humans and communities we serve with respect. Behaving ethically both individually and collectively in the companies and teams we work in. There are those who would have you believe that ethics and capitalism cannot coexist, that businesses are only rewarded if they put profit first and customers last. I refuse to accept this is true.\r\n\r\nThis talk provides an introduction to what it even means to even 'be ethical', how doing so can benefit your bottom line, and explore some practical tips to build your ethical muscles so we can build the kind of future we want to have, that our children deserve to have.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
