description: "New requirements for robotics applications, such as flexibility, integration with other systems (Industry 4.0), and multikinematics, are difficult to satisfy with the prevalent proprietary solutions of robot manufacturers. These challenges push robotics closer to the world of IT, which already has answered many of them. KUKA Laboratories has therefore chosen Java SE as its new programming language for robotics applications. In this session, it presents the open and modular platform Sunrise.OS, which bridges the gap between IT and robotics. Its integral Java API enables the Java community to develop robotics applications and system extensions.\n\n\nAuthors:\n Christian Tarragona\nChristian Tarragona is Director R&D Software and Control of KUKA Laboratories. He joined KUKA in 1997 as Software Developer at R&D of KUKA Roboter. Later on he took over the department for application, sensor technology and user interface. \n\nSince 2011 he is the director of software and control at KUKA Laboratories. Following a strategic realignment, KUKA Laboratories was founded in 2011 with the aim to develop new products for the future markets of medical and service robotics. Furthermore, KUKA Laboratories is the technology hub of the KUKA group and responsible for new platform technologies. There Christian Tarragona is notably responsible for  Sunrise  – the new controller software for KUKAs next gen robots like the LBR iiwa. \n\nHe studied physics at the University of Karlsruhe and received the Diplom Physiker degree in 1996. He is married, has two children, owns a private pilot license for airplanes and loves to develop physics engines in his spare time.\nView more trainings by  Christian Tarragona at https://www.parleys.com/author/christian-tarragona-1\n\n Günther Dörner\nGuenther Doerner is a Senior Product Owner for the new controler software Sunrise at KUKA Laboratories.
