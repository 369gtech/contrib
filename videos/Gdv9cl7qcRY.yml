title: 'YOW! CTO Summit 2016 Scott Shaw - Confessions of an Enterprise Architect'
recordingDate: 1489324352
description: "Having worked in and around the software development business for many years, gaining a certain amount of grey hair and experience along the way, I’m often asked to help out teams struggling under the sometimes onerous and dogmatic restrictions of corporate IT. Years of these engagements led to a sort of messianic complex; Me–righteous defender of software craft– locked in epic struggle with evil strictures of enterprise architecture. But lately the tables have turned. Faced with challenges of business reality, regulatory compliance, and organisational complexity, I found myself committing some of the same acts I might have once condemned. This talk gives me an opportunity to confess some of those behaviours, explain why they’re sometimes necessary in a large and complex corporate environment and offer some ways they might be done differently.\n\nAs the Head of Technology for ThoughtWorks in Australia, Scott divides his time between professional services leadership and consulting. As a consultant, he helps enterprise customers to shape their technology to align with 21st century practices like cloud, continuous delivery, microservices and lean governance. As a lifelong programmer and technology professional, Scott has designed and worked on distributed systems of every imaginable size and shape. When he’s not in meetings, Scott enjoys writing Clojure code.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
