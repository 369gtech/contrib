description: "This was our first session of the Google+ Platform Office Hours On Air.\r\n\r\nJenny Murphy and Jonathan Beri represented Google and Martin Matysiak, Gerwin Sturm, Fraser Cain, Abraham Williams and Allen Firstenberg joined from across the globe.\r\n\r\nDuring the office hours this week we live coded. We used the JavaScript client library and the Google+ REST API pulls the comments API every few seconds. This is useful if you're monitoring an activity on Google+ in real time, as is the case when we use comments to field questions during our hangouts on air. You can see the code on the google-plus-office-hours project found at code.google.com/p/google-plus-office-hours/.\r\n\r\nPlease join the discussion in our support forum: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-plus-developers/896fyKsIIUM\r\n\r\nLearn more about our office hours on Google Developers: https://developers.google.com/+/office-hours"
