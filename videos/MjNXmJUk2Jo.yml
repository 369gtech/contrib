language: English
recordingDate: 1576714035
description: 'Monero has a biannual major release schedule, but it has been hit with setback after setback despite the best efforts of the community. Justin will discuss how borrowing small changes from other projects to work smarter, not harder, will improve Monero’s release schedule without compromising on centralization. Creating clear policies, procedures, and timelines, even if they are flexible, will improve Monero’s release process and encourage outside development efforts and allow important stakeholder feedback.'
