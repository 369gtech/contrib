description: "Precise Alerting with Bosun\n\nKyle Brandt, Stack Overflow\n\nIn order to reduce alert desensitization, we must be alert developers and designers. Bosun is a monitoring system that was built to enable operators to do this. It includes an expression language, a templating language, forecasting, anomaly detection, and historical testing to enable one to create very refined alerts. I'll present my philosophy on what makes good alerts, and then demonstrate developing them and testing them in Bosun - as well as the alert handling workflow.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
