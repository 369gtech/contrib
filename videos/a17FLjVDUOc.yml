description: "State of Kubernetes Contributor Community - Paris Pittman, Google \n\nThe Kubernetes contributor community spans the globe reaching over 26,000 people since the start of the project. If we grow on the same trajectory as years past, expect to cross 30,000 by Barcelona. (eek - a prediction!)    What does the contributor landscape look like after 5 years in the land of open source? In this talk, I'll highlight:  -who are our contributors now?,  -new programs that have been created to help scale the community,  -stories as told through data on our communication platforms,   -and give recognition throughout \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZb"
