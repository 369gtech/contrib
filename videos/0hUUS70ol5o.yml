Research has shown that slow sites and apps lose customer engagement. Despite this, most mobile sites and apps have performance issues that can be easily resolved once diagnosed. In this talk, we will walk through steps to diagnose network performance bottlenecks in mobile services. We'll discuss real world examples and how they were resolved. Attendees will leave this talk armed with the tools to test, diagnose and resolve the top network performance issues that affect mobile today."
