description: "We are witnessing an explosion in the sheer mass and velocity of data. More systems, machines, and software are emitting data constantly, every second of every day. But this data is most useful if the actual builders and operators—the people with all the context—can understand it and react to it quickly. Ozan Turgut discusses how to use visualization and analytics to turn data into leverage for decision making.\n\nSponsored by SignalFx.\n\nWatch all Velocity keynotes here: http://oreil.ly/2cKCaW8\n\nFollow @velocityconf on Twitter for news about web performance, DevOps, and continuous delivery."
