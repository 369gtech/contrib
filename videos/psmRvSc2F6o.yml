description: "A Rose by Any Other Name Would Run Just as Long Understanding Computational and Hardware Complexity in Software Defined Radio Framework\nby John Brunhaver\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.120/a_rose_by_any_other_name.webm\n\nAbstract: Radio based communication systems and imagers operate under real-time constraints. Off-loading computes to an FPGA seems like a solution to speeding-up your application but comes with many pitfalls.  Specifically, software-oriented implementations fail to achieve the required interface bandwidths or computational throughput required to see a speed-up.  In this talk, we will discuss the organization of common compute motif's in software-defined-radio and their complexity in time and resources for FPGAs.\nRough goals of talk:\n1) Communicate why FPGA acceleration would be attractive\n2) Discuss common pitfalls\n2a) A behaviorally oriented accelerator\n2b) Starving the beast, failing to provide the required data bandwidths\n2c) Processor oriented runtime, creates execution overheads\n3) Thinking about accelerators, what do they look like\n3a) FFT\n3b) Correlators\n3c) Matrix-Vector Multiply\n4) Building an off-load model\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 10:00:00"
