title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Ain’t No Body: Not Your Mama’s Headless Drupal'
recordingDate: 1493229763
description: "You’ve heard all the buzz about headless\_Drupal and seen the cute headless horseman icons, but have you built a disembodied\_Drupal-powered application?\n\nJoin us for a session exploring disembodied Drupal, also known as bodiless Drupal- an application that uses Drupal’s powerful framework to do things it does well while storing the actual domain data in a remote repository.\n\nWe will also explore applications that are both disembodied and headless - in which Drupal is the framework used to maintain data stored in a remote repository; and kiosk applications and other non-Drupal front ends leverage the stored data, whether via Drupal paths or otherwise.\n\nWe will share our experience- the what, why and how; discuss pain points and pitfalls, and hopefully entertain as well as enlighten you on our journey to leverage Drupal in this manner.\n\nYou will walk away with a new buzzword, a few new laugh lines, and some headless and disembodied Drupal tricks that you can leverage in your work.\n\nThis presentation will be more relevant\_for back-end developers of any skill level as well as project managers and business people. Disembodied Drupal is\_the introductory session for our pièce de résistance, “completely soul-less Drupal”, presentation details TBD."
