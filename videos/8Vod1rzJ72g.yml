title: 'Louis Lazaris — DOM Features You Didn’t Know Existed'
language: English
recordingDate: 1463511202
description: "We get excited over new HTML5 APIs and new CSS features, but many developers aren’t aware of the diverse array of native DOM features that are available — many of them supported as far back as IE6. In this talk, Louis will discuss and show examples demonstrating practical use cases for features like insertAdjacentHTML(), getBoundingClientRect(), scrollIntoView(), contains(), normalize(), and lots more.\n\nHe’ll also point out how developers can research different DOM features along with their browser support, which often is not available on commonly known references like http://caniuse.com\n\nLouis Lazaris\nManaging Editor, SitePoint\nhttps://twitter.com/ImpressiveWebs\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
