description: "Collin and the Slingbot\n\nJoe Ruscio, Librato\n\nIn this talk we describe our internal feature-flagging system, which combines Rollout, ZooKeeper, and our in-house campfire chatbot (twke), to transparently enable features for targeted production end-users without disrupting other customers.\n\nOur talk follows the escapades of our intrepid engineer Collin as he cleverly employs feature flagging to manage production traffic flow in order to re-engineer and replace a core component of our production SaaS infrastructure. Like the engineering acrobatics involved in reworking a bridge that must continue to bear traffic, Collin's story is a prolonged, high-stakes, surgical endeavor with a lot of moving parts. It is also a textbook illustration of the multi-disciplinary balance between architecture, programming, and operational ingenuity that exemplifies site reliability engineering in the wild.\n\nView the full SREcon15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon15/program"
