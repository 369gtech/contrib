description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nEnhancing the Kubernetes Scheduler for Diverse Workloads in Large Clusters - Yuan Chen & Yan Xu, Apple \n\nAs a wide diversity of workloads are being deployed in Kubernetes, the default scheduler has become insufficient in the light of scheduling performance and functionality. In this talk, Yuan Chen and Yan Xu will present their experience and results of leveraging the Kubernetes scheduling framework and developing new plugins to create a custom scheduler. The scheduler can meet different scheduling needs of diverse workloads in large scale clusters, from stateless to stateful services, big data jobs and machine learning applications. They will deep dive into (1) the design and implementation of the scheduling plugins for performance optimization, custom pod placement and group scheduling, and (2) the use of plugins and scheduling profiles to achieve a better balance between scheduling performance and quality. New features and enhancements of the scheduling framework will also be discussed. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekBk"
