description: "MobileOptimized 2018, Minsk\niOS Track\n\nThe future is here: ARKit 2.0 – Bruno Muniz @Supercharge.io\nOn the latest WWDC we’ve all seen some of the amazing things ARKit framework can do and the possibilities are infinite. Most of the things that we see on our social media feed are completely feasible and actually easy to do within a couple of minutes, and this presentation was prepared to continue with the introduction Bruno has already started on previous conferences. Obviously, some introduction won’t hurt, but the focus here will be to reproduce and understand how these amazing things we see people demo-ing works.\n\nGeneral Partner – Verv (https://verv.com/) \nVideo Partner – Instabug (https://instabug.com/)"
