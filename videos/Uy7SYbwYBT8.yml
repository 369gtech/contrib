title: 'Lightning Talks: Secure Communication between Extensions and Applications - Pavel Studen√Ω'
recordingDate: 1533652149
description: 'The main focus of the talk is on securing HTTP communication, that a browser extension uses to send commands to a locally installed application or to display data from the application. The largest threat in this area comes from malicious pages a user visits either randomly or as a result of a phishing or a scam attack. Luckily, the HTTP protocol and related security standards provide enough options to defend against such attacks and you will learn how to use them.'
