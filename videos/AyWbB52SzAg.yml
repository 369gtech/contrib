title: 'Clojure vs Sepsis: path to real time enterprise data science - Igor Ges + Gerardo Castro'
language: English
recordingDate: 1543602021
description: 'After being tasked with bringing data science to HCA, the largest hospital chain in the United States, we recognized the need for a large scale, life-saving project to demonstrate value and pave the way for getting the infrastructure and support that a meaningful data science operation would require. This is the story of how we used Clojure and Datomic to successfully deploy SPOT (Sepsis Prevention and Optimization of Therapy) in 165 hospitals all across the US. In this talk we will discuss the design of a real-time streaming clinical system, our experience using Datomic for a medical data science application, as well as challenges that we had to overcome (both technical and organizational) to deploy and operate SPOT at this scale.'
