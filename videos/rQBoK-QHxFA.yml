description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nEmitting, Consuming, and Presenting: The Event Lifecycle - Jesse Dearing, VMware \n\nYou’re building a suite of operators and processes that will run in your cluster to make your job easier. You’ve written CRDs to manage cluster and out of cluster resources, you’ve set up your monitoring with Prometheus, and set up horizontal pod autoscaling. How do you know what’s happening in your cluster? In this talk we’ll cover different ways to emit events related to cluster objects using Kubernetes events, using metrics to drive events, different techniques for consuming events, and ways for folks to create events without touching a command line. After attending this talk, you should be able to take advantage of events and metrics occurring inside the cluster and be able to produce your own events relevant to your cluster. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaY1"
