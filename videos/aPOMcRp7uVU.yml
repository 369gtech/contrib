description: "User is working with your application, suddenly, UI freezes and probably, one of the CPU cores is burning! They cannot do anything. The only perception you can feel is as hot as a hell metal case of the laptop. Although this sounds like a horror movie, this is your application that cannot leverage modern APIs to lift heavy computation to a different thread where consequently user suffers the pain.\n\nModern features like Web Workers, WebAssembly, Worklets, and Service Worker allow us to leverage multithreading computing to run tasks parallely which at the end, makes the user feel like in a rainbow paradise instead of a nightmare, even though JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language!\n\n\nIn this session, I am going to show my experience running jobs in parallel on a React.Js application that will provide a pleasant user experience and exciting development.\n\n\nEVENT:\nTalk recording from React Day Berlin Conference 2019 https://reactday.berlin\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nMajid Hajian\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nGitNation Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish GitNation Conference talks."
