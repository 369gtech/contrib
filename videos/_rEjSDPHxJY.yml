description: "In the cyber security world, analysis of command line logs is important for breach detection, but it is one of the most challenging problems. To simplify this process, we propose a framework called CMDLang – command line language, which has features of natural language. I will present results of successful POS and NER training using popular NLP algorithms and demonstrate a real use case of CMDLang\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations.
