title: 'SREcon20 Americas - "Disorganizing" Your SRE Organization'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608746569
description: "\"\"Disorganizing\"\" Your SRE Organization\n\nLeonid Belkind, StackPulse\n\nThe COVID-driven new WFH/all-remote model has amplified traditional challenges remote teams can face with incident response and reliability. Silos and reduced information exchange, challenges onboarding or cross training engineers, increased noise and toil – just to name a few. All of these make it harder for teams to continue to deliver reliable services, at a time when reliable software is what's keeping the world connected.\n\nInstead of trying to translate existing roles and responsibilities, processes, and methods to the new normal – we'll share how to improve reliability by 'dis-organizing' and democratizing the SRE function – empowering the entire engineering team to own reliability and adopt SRE mindset. We'll cover goals for SREs/SWEs, training for SWEs, automating knowledge management/sharing, getting started with code-based incident response playbooks – and the role of the SRE in orchestrating it all.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
