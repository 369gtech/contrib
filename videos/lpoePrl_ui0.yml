description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nIs it challenging to mention IT and agriculture in same sentence? Can we add cloud, drones, software development, robotics? Can we even say startup? Ok, now do you believe me, if it I said in Serbia?\nAs you all know, IT has fast grown in our region, many of them software-export oriented, developing for big corporations. We tried to be more local and practical, but financial viable. As we are focused more, what we like to do, we like quality food, so we decided to do something, as a startup for agriculture. We thought maybe we can help to provide some solutions for them. As we learned on the way, we cannot do it alone. We need your help.\nI will try to tease you, and point a direction, in return I expect though questions and knowledgeable debate."
