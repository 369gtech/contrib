description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2017\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nAfter all those years, a bottle neck in software development is still the lack of long-term understanding between developers and domain experts. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) certainly addresses that and at the core of DDD is the focus on reaching deep and shared understanding to together coming up with a better solution than ever before.\n\nThat can be taken to a new level with using business centric languages for describing the solution domain. The benefits are huge! One way of describing this is: some requirement descriptions = the code that executes = the documentation\n\nThe description of the solution domain is then executed by an engine which is created and maintained by the core developers. Most architecture opinions and decisions are taken care of at the engine level. The end result is a very small amount of code, both the engine code and the description of the solution domain.\n\nIn this presentation we will describe the key parts of this concept. You will be able to try it out in your own projects afterwards!"
