description: "Natural Language Processing is a field of Artificial Intelligence dedicated to enabling computers to understand and communicate in human language. NLP is only a few decades old, but we've made significant progress in that time. I'll cover how its changed over the years, then show you how you can easily build an NLP app that can either classify or summarize text. This is incredibly powerful technology that anyone can freely use, I'll show you how to do it. Enjoy! \n\nCode for this video: \nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/bert-as-service\n\nPlease Subscribe!
