description: "Not Your Father’s Complexity: Estimating Program Performance in a New Machine Age\n\nIt’s no simple matter to explain the performance of even a simple Java program, when instruction execution time is often overshadowed by other costs. Even when network and IO have been taken into account, two programs with similar computational complexity—their big-O characteristics—can differ in cache usage, with big resulting differences in performance. For the Java programmer, this means that big-O analysis no longer gives enough guidance in choosing a collection implementation for performance-critical code. In this tutorial we’ll explore optimization of the memory layout and performance of some simple programs via alternative collection implementations and frameworks, and object layout libraries."
