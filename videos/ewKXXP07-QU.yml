CloudFormation allows application stacks to be provisioned from JSON or YAML formatted templates. Unfortunately, due to their size and complexity, CloudFormation templates have earned a reputation as being unwieldy to work with.\nThe AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) mitigates some of the complexity associated with CloudFormation by allowing developers to programmatically define their cloud architecture using familiar high-level languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript. CDK projects can then be deployed via CloudFormation, while retaining all of the benefits of CloudFormation, such as repeatable deployments and drift detection. This talk will introduce the CDK in the context of Node.js and demonstrate how it can be leveraged to provision cloud native architectures.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nAWS Amplify → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nRetool → https://retool.com/\nEpsagon → https://epsagon.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nG2i → https://www.g2i.co/ \n\nSilver Sponsors\nAppSignal → https://appsignal.com/\nSailscasts → https://sailscasts.com/\n\nDiversity Sponsor\nPrisma → https://www.prisma.io/"
