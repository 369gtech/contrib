description: "Dawn Parzych, Catchpoint\n\nSite Reliability Engineering is a relatively new discipline when it comes to careers, having only been in existence for about 15 years. While 15 years may seem like an eternity, the SRE role can be considered to be in its infancy. This leads to challenges defining the role and understanding exactly what it is. Browsing through job descriptions or speaking with other SREs you will see many different job descriptions and responsibilities.\n\nEarlier this year Catchpoint conducted a survey of 416 professionals with the title or responsibility of an SRE in an attempt to create a real-world profile of the SRE and the organizations where they work. This session will review the findings of the survey. Learn what the top technical and non-technical skills are, and whether they vary by industry or size of the company. What surprised us with the findings? What additional questions arose analyzing the results? And how can the survey results be used to help organizations building out an SRE team.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
