description: "Keynote presented by Andrew Crump, CTO, CloudCredo.\n\nCloud Foundry dramatically simplifies the work necessary to build deployment pipelines for continuous delivery. In this talk we'll look at the benefits of building deployment pipelines with Cloud Foundry, some anti-patterns to watch out for, and how you can practice continuous delivery when making changes to the infrastructure code of Cloud Foundry itself. In this session we will describe how we used Cloud Foundry to serve hundreds of transactions a seconds in prime time TV while continuously delivering improvements to the application and infrastructure code."
