description: "The full title of the presentation is \"How to scale up a team and keep #GettingThingsDone? Fast growth is not an excuse to stop delivering\"\n\nWhen working in groups below 30 members, there's little need for structure and hierarchy (business people call these groups \"startups\"). The lack of formal processes enable these groups to get things done quickly and form close relationships with one another.\nThen there are the larger groups, which have over 150 members working together towards a common goal (business people would call these groups “corporations”). In such groups, formal regulations play a vital role due to insufficient communication and trust between its members.\nThen, there are also teams that fall somewhere in the middle — teams that have between 30 to 150 members. In these groups, human relationships still play an important role, yet little by little, a hierarchy emerges (these are the so-called \"scale ups\").\nOver its 6 years of existence, AirHelp has grown at a rapid pace —  the business doubles every year.  A company that managed to scale its Engineering and Product departments to employ over 150 people is not a typical startup anymore.\nIn this presentation, Jakub will explain how technical processes at AirHelp evolved to enable the company to grow so rapidly, while still maintaining the \"common sense\" approach that allows AirHelp to successfully help air passengers and build a great work environment.\n\nThe speech took place on 9th May 2019 on DevTrends Stage during Infoshare 2019."
