title: 'Gov 2.0 Online Conf: Santa Cruz Budget Crisis - A Blueprint Using Social Media'
recordingDate: 1262651912
description: 'The City of Santa Cruz, CA, has quickly become known for its interactive social media strategy for engaging residents in resolving the City''s recent budget crisis.  Santa Cruz officials realized that it couldn''t wait 12 or 24 months for community forums and elections; decisions needed to be made immediately with the help of its residents.  As a result, the City launched a special community feedback portal which gave residents an opportunity to offer City leadership constructive suggestions to the City''s fiscal problems.  In this session, Peter Koht, economic development coordinator, will discuss at length the City''s social media strategy and best practices for other cities looking to use the technology.'
