title: 'Introducing Spring Framework 5.3'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027431
description: "After several years of Spring Framework 5.x feature releases, it’s time to wrap up the major themes in 5.3 (e.g., revisiting web data binding and data class support, fine-tuning the reactive programming facilities, and completing Spring’s Kotlin coroutines support). Most importantly, we’re preparing the core framework for the next OpenJDK Long-Term Support release, namely JDK 17 LTS, and for deploying certain kinds of Spring applications as GraalVM-native images. This talk covers the key topics and the support roadmap for this final feature release in the 5.x line.\n\nJuergen Hoeller: Senior Staff Engineer, VMware\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/introducing-spring-framework-53"
