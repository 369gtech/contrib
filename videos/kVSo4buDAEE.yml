description: "The DevTools have evolved over the past year to offer a number of features that can enrich your development workflow, helping you achieve more common tasks without the need to leave your browser. \n\nThis session introduces you to some of these features, including Workspaces - a convenient way to create and edit new applications. \n\nWe will also look at a better Sass editing workflow, where changes can be made directly to your source files without flipping back and forth with a compiler to generate your CSS."
