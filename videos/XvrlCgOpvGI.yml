Eclipse MicroProfile JWT (https://microprofile.io/) is the answer. MicroProfile JWT designed a mechanism to propagate the security state from clients to services or event services to services by using security tokens. This session will give you a quick overview on the MicroProfile JWT design, followed by a live demo of microservices communication by passing on the JSON web token, running on Open Liberty (https://openliberty.io/). Come to this session to understand the technology and learn how to use it.\n\nEmily Jiang \nFrom IBM\nEmily Jiang is Liberty Architect for MicroProfile and CDI in IBM.
