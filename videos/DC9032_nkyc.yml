title: 'Designing APIs: Less Data is More'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636003071
description: "Often developers design APIs that expose more than is needed - unnecessary fields, redundant relationships, and endpoints that no one asked for.\n\nThese kinds of practices later on introduce communication overhead, extra maintenance costs, negative performance impacts, and waste time that could have been spent better otherwise.\n\nWe'll walk through how to design minimal APIs that are straight forward to use, and that are exactly what our consumers need!\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
