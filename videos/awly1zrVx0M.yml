description: "JSLA Thursday July 26, 2012 - Aaron Martin @citygridmedia\nJQuery, Dojo, Mootools, Ext, Prototype, Script.aculo.us, Backbone, Modernizer….[sigh]…it’s hard to keep up. Remember when there was just something called JavaScript? I do. Don’t get me wrong I love all the aforementioned libraries like a father loves his children, but when it is time to get practical and create performance solutions those babies got to go. I’m going to introduce you to an old friend of mine, the JavaScript native image object. This ol’boy is perhaps one of the most powerful objects in JavaScript and he’s uber simple to get to know. I’m going to show you some of his tricks and try to convince you that he belongs in your JavaScript solutions tool belt!"
