description: "For Spring developers, building containers is a common obstacle on the road to Kubernetes adoption. Traditionally, Dockerfiles define container builds imperatively, but can also be cumbersome, error-prone, and slow.\n\nThe development cycle can be slow. IDE support is generally poor. Most likely, your Java application will crash with an OOMKill message. In this talk, we'll introduce tools and best practices to help you adopt Kubernetes faster and easier.\n\nThis includes tools such as Jib and Skaffold for fast image build and development cycle turnaround time, and Kustomize for mult-environment configurations.\n\nWe'll also discuss best practices for configuring your Java applications to run inside of Kubernetes, such as health checks, zero downtime deployment, externalizing configurations, logging, and understanding memory usage to avoid OOMKilled situations.\n\nRay is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform and a Java Champion. Ray has extensive hands on cross-industry enterprise systems integration delivery and management experiences during his time at Accenture, managed full stack application development, DevOps. Ray specialized in middleware, big data, and PaaS products during his time at Red Hat while contributing to open source projects, such as Infinispan. Aside from technology, Ray enjoys traveling and adventures."
