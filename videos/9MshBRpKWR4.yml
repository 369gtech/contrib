title: 'Webinar: Backup and Mobility for Kubernetes Applications'
language: English
recordingDate: 1571856989
description: "As teams start to onboard mission-critical applications, including relational and NoSQL databases into production, there’s a need to address critical Day 2 operational concerns such as backup and mobility. Dealing with regulatory requirements, user error, ransomware, and cluster upgrades requires safeguarding of both data and state through backup and disaster recovery. Additionally, Kubernetes and containers have enabled applications that are portable across clusters in any environment – developer machines, on-premises and cloud provider environments. In spite of this, applications are often constrained to a single environment due to their reliance on data, be it the use of a specific storage provider or a managed data service.\n\nIn this session, we will discuss key considerations when addressing such Day 2 concerns. We will demonstrate not just how to easily implement backup and disaster recovery for Kubernetes but also how to enable hybrid and multi-cloud application mobility."
