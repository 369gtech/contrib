description: "Panel Discussion: Avoiding the Weeds in the Cloud Native Landscape – Moderated by Priyanka Sharma, GitLab \n\nThe CNCF is one of the seminal technology organizations of our time and has come to house a plethora of projects and technologies that are relevant to the ecosystem it has created. In this heyday of technical innovation, it can be hard for organizations to decide what tooling and workflows to use as they move to cloud native. There is the tension between best of breed point solutions and what you need across the organization. This panel brings together practitioners who have made infrastructure and tooling decisions for large-scale companies and businesses and offers their perspective. The questions we will cover are: * What are the main categories of tooling when someone moves cloud native? * How do you choose tools - best of breed or integrated solutions? * Share a horror story about a tool/solution your company chose. * Share a success story about a tool/solution your company chose. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrSS"
