title: 'SPONSORED Session: From concept to production; the fastest way to develop & deploy Apache Flink jobs'
recordingDate: 1635844968
description: 'At the end of this session you will be ready to accelerate your streaming data analytics development lifecycle. We will explore how the notebook development environment of Apache Zeppelin integrates with Apache Flink, enables us to quickly develop and build jobs and deploy them to a production Flink cluster. A set of examples covering common data analytics scenarios will be presented, with key integrations including Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Apache Kafka, and Amazon S3. We will deep dive into the underlying architecture to examine how AWS leverages Kubernetes and other AWS services to provide a highly available, secure, notebook development environment for Flink applications.'
