title: 'The delightful user experience of security'

description: "Casey Schaufler\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/245/\n\nThe delightful user experience of security – We all know that computer security is obtrusive, annoying and expensive. At every layer of software from wifi modem micro-code to web backgammon there are passwords, updates and restrictions that get in the way of doing the simple things we set out to accomplish. If you’re a developer, it’s even worse with CVE tracking, code scanners and named exploits sucking away precious schedule time. But what if it wasn’t that way? What would software be like if someone developed computer security with the explicit goal of creating something people will like? Casey Schaufler knows how dreadful the experience of security can be, having implemented everything from access control lists and release process to the ugliest login screen ever produced. In this talk he steps back from the traditional approach to computer security and investigates it from the viewpoint of providing a delightful user experience. The talk starts off with the basic premises of security and why they ought to make systems more usable, not less. It continues with the importance of creating security models that reflect what people want the software to do, and how to go about doing so. The process of building software to enforce those models and the mechanism for ensuring that both security and user experience are maintained throughout are described. Finally, the problem of keeping the user experience from deteriorating when faced with new and unexpected security challenges is addressed.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
