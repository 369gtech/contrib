title: '[LIGHTNING TALK] Yoel Gluschnaider - How Skyscanner Tests RN Bridges on iOS'
recordingDate: 1536920852
description: "If your app is a hybrid of native and RN, you will probably rely on a lot on bridges to expose native behaviour to your JavaScript. Like any production code and especially for infrastructure code we want to test the bridges. In this talk we will show how we covered our bridges with automated tests.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
