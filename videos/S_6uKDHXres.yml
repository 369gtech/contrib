description: "Michael Meeks\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/70/\n\nCome hear how how Collabora Online has brought LibreOffice\r\ntechnology to mobile devices and to your web-browser. Hear about:\r\n* adding collaborative editing to a legacy-rich code-base\r\n* Linux security / isolation pieces we use to make that sensible\r\n* how we make that scalable & performant\r\n* the exiting drop-offs of the Web APIs we have to use\r\n* the joys of native JS mapping of UX\r\n* business constraints on engineering: the use of map widgets, for document rendering: you are here → ←, and/or why we’re now Collabora Online.\r\nAnd of course, get some updates on new user-experience changes, what’s coming next, and how to contribute to our mission of making Open Source rock!\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSun Jan 24 14:25:00 2021 at Rusty R. Hall"
