description: "Common web frameworks make the assumption you are going to build against a Restful API, but what if your use case doesnâ€™t fit with the Restful principles. How might you go about systematically designing a protocol between client and server? In this talk we are going to discuss how you can design and build an RPC style protocol and service layer that is flexible and extenisble enough to serve multiple cross platform clients and servers, growing with application needs whilst letting developers focus on building features instead of maintaining API boilerplate.\n\nTranscript and slides: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/william-lewis-pavel-dovbush-building-a-maintainable-bi-directional-cross-platform-protocol.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
