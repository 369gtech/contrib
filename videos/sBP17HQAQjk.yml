description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nAmid an avalanche of packaging solutions, who's side should you take? Trick question; you can support all of them! Discover the fundamental principles that make your library easy for _others_ to package so you don't have to! As a bonus, your builds will be faster, simpler, and more maintainable. \n\nThis talk covers the lessons learned from packaging over 700 libraries in vcpkg, from the simplest single-header to the massive framework of Qt. We'll dissect the open source package maintainer's perspective and walk through the top library mistakes, supported by real-world examples from the vcpkg catalog.\n— \nRobert Schumacher\nDeveloper, Microsoft\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
