description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBuilding a Multi Cluster/Env Service Mesh at Airbnb - Weibo He & Stephen Chan, Airbnb\n\nTutorials and demos are great, but how do real organizations implement service meshes at scale? In this talk, we will discuss some of the problems Airbnb is solving with their service mesh based on Istio. Make sure you attend if you’re interested in building out a service mesh at your own company and interested in ways to adapt to your own requirements. We will walk through: - Partitioning workloads across multiple clusters and how to manage the mesh. - Testing mesh upgrades reliably with multiple environments. - Expanding the mesh to legacy, non-container workloads. - Routing traffic between regions, not just clusters, securely."
