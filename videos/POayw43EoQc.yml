description: "Docker and Cloud Foundry: The 3 Use Cases - Alexandre Vasseur, Pivotal\n\nWith Diego, Cloud Foundry is capable of deploying and running apps as Docker images. That is now easy to orchestrate, scale and manage in production those Docker containers up to the point that what you care is not Docker but the app itself. But there is more you can do to and explore combining Cloud Foundry with Docker! \n\n- leveraging Docker service broker, possibly using Docker Swarm managed by BOSH to provide containers as a service with all the BOSH and service broker great capabilities \n- leveraging Concourse and Docker based pipeline to ensure your run pipeline in isolation, using Concourse as BOSH release with garden-runC.\n\nThose 3 uses cases are fully independent yet all use Cloud Foundry, BOSH and Docker to align to specific requirements. Come learn about those combined architectures, seem them in action thru live demos, and expand the possibilities with Cloud Foundry.\n\nAbout Alexandre Vasseur\nAlexandre Vasseur is in charge of Pivotal â€˜ technical field engagements in France and South of Europe. He and his team are in charge of technical awareness and solution architecture for customers, prospects and partners in that region around Cloud Foundry and Pivotal solutions. Alexandre joined Pivotal at its creation from his past tenure at VMware in the early Cloud Foundry days and spent around 15 years on applications and middleware. He also leads the Cloud Foundry Paris meetup."
