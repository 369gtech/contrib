description: 'The Google Games Chat (official motto: "Still not cancelled") is back for yet another rousing debate about industry trends, the state of gaming in general, and, frankly, any other random thoughts that happen to cross our minds. We don''t really filter what we say very much. Ask us questions in the moderator link! We might even get around to answering them!'
