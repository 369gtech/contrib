language: English
recordingDate: 1468312048
description: 'The goal of HTTP/2 is to increase the perceived performance of the web browsing experience. This is achieved by multiplexing over TCP and Server Push among other techniques. What implications does this have for developers? How does Servlet 4.0 embrace HTTP/2 and what support is there in JDK 9? We will see, with code examples, what the future of developing with HTTP/2 might look like.'
