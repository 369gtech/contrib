title: 'Cardboard boss - Elise Garborg Undheim - NDC Oslo 2020'
recordingDate: 1598275434
description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\n\nWe made a huge 2.5 meter tall cardboard cut out of our boss. Using a cheap microcontroller with WiFi and some engines with wheels from a broken robot vacuum cleaner, we built a robot to drive him around that could be remotely controlled from our phones. Then we took him on the underground and drove him around at our company Christmas party."
