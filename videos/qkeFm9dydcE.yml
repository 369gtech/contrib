description: "Designing for Operations\nPresented by Craig McLuckie\n\nKubernetes and Linux application containers are making it easier than ever to build and deploy distributed systems software. They also provide a gateway to more intrinsically sustainable operations. During this session we will explore how to think about building more intrinsically operable systems with Kubernetes that are not only easy to live with, but how they are changing the game for operations teams that are responsible for the care and feeding of production systems."
