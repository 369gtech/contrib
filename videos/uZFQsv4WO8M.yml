description: "\"Through this tutorial, you’ll get an introductory overview of how to make sense of a large corpus of textual data through SA. You will take advantage of open-source Python libraries (notably the Natural Language Toolkit and spaCy) to conceptualize, to design, and to implement distinct components of an SA model and workflow. After building an SA model from scratch, you’ll apply it to extract sentiments from customer review data. You’ll also get a chance to work with a pre-trained model on a corpus more representative of actual customer reviews (because they constitute an invaluable resource allowing organizations to understand quantitatively and to improve services, products, customer experiences, workforce analytics, social media monitoring processes, and, ultimately, business performance).\n\nApproximate outline: (10 min) Setup: We’ll ensure participants have working environments and data on their machines. (20 min) Introduction to Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (15 min) Importing and preprocessing the textual data (15 min) Exercise 1: Toy example to demonstrate how sentiment analysis works (30 min) Exercise 2: Implementing a sentiment analysis model using real data\"\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll be introduced to Sentiment Analysis (SA), the extraction of subjective, affective information from text through Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable data-driven decisions. Participants will work through a step-by-step application of SA to build a sound knowledge of its different components and an understanding of this powerful technique in various business settings\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
