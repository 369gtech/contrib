title: 'YOW! Connected 2016 Christopher Biggs - IoT for Slackers - Build Connected Devices with NodeMCU'
recordingDate: 1486942012
description: "Learn how to integrate connected devices into your business systems. Slack is a messaging platform with a robust add-on ecosystem, and supports both channel-based communications and direct messaging. NodeMCU is a Lua-based reactive programming environment (inspired by NodeJS) for the popular Espressif ESP8266 WiFi-enabled micro controller. This presentation will introduce each of the tools and then present several examples of using the NodeMCU IoT platform and Slackâ€™s third party hooks to have physical computing devices communicate with humans via your Slack chat channels. The examples are contrived for simplicity, but have been developed in response to needs of an actual office environment.\n\nYou will learn what is possible with incredibly inexpensive IoT devices, what hardware you will need to get started, and how to configure Slack to permit interoperation with your device(s).\n\nChristopher Biggs has been into Open Systems since the early 90s and was there at the birth of Linux and 386BSD. His interest in electronics and connected devices goes back even further.\n\nHe was founding vice president of HUMBUG, the Brisbane open systems user group, and managed a team of over 60 developers at a leading Brisbane IT company.\n\nIn his spare time he builds and blogs robots, and contributes to the growing Internet of Things in both the home and workplace.\n\nFor more on YOW!
