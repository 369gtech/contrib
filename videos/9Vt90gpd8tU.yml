title: 'Marcus Hammarberg, Consultant/Agile Coach â€“ 20 Quick Ideas on How to Improve Your Kanban Board'
recordingDate: 1496650002
description: 'I''ve been working in front of kanban boards for about 12 years. I''ve created and seen many of these boards not being used and fall into oblivion. And I''ve seen others that have thrived and helped the teams in flowing work faster. A good visualised process is the starting point for any process improvement - don''t waste your board. In this talk I have created a hit list of the top 20 ways I''ve used to improve our kanban board. Sadly there''s no way that I will get through all of these ideas within the timeframe and understandable English. So we''ll select a few of these together during the talk. Join me for a fun, interactive session - leave me with your head filled with ideas on how to improve your kanban board right away.'
