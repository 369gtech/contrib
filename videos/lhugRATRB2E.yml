description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Join Scott Hanselman as he talks about the history and future of .NET. How did it start, what were the goals, but most importantly, where is it going? What does the future hold for .NET 5? What does it mean to be able to run .NET on Windows and Linux and in containers or even on a Raspberry Pi? We will have tons of demos and not a lot of slides in this fun interactive session."
