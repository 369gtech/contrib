description: "Deep Dive: Brigade - Radu Matei, Microsoft \n\nIn this session, we will explore the Brigade architecture, and how it is built to chain together containers and share data between them. We will deep dive on how external events are routed and transformed into jobs, and how Brigade uses JavaScript for more complex scripting and error handling, and differentiate itself to enable scenarios that are extremely difficult to achieve in a purely declarative framework. In the end, we will take a look at how to build custom event gateways, and have a look at the future roadmap. \n\nhttps://sched.co/N7N9"
