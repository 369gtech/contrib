description: "These days fast code needs to operate in harmony with its environment. At the deepest level, this means working well with hardware: RAM, disks, and SSDs. A unifying theme is treating memory access patterns in a uniform and predictable way that is sympathetic to the underlying hardware. For example, writing to and reading from RAM and hard disks can be significantly sped up by operating sequentially on the device rather than randomly accessing the data. This session covers why access patterns are important, what kinds of speed gains you can get, and how you can write simple high-level code that works well with these kinds of patterns.\n\n\nAuthor:\nRichard Warburton\nRichard Warburton is a software developer who loves solving complex problems, but actively challenges how much of software development is dealing with day-to-day trivialities. Having obtained a PhD in the area of compiler optimizations and static analysis, he has been applying his abilities in industry. Initially on bytecode analysis software, and more recently on Java performance tuning tools. He actively involves himself in the London Java Community, and its Java Community Process Committee. He has been helping with the push to improve and complete the JSR 310 API and the expand community engagement with JSR 335.\nView more trainings by Richard Warburton at https://www.parleys.com/author/richard-warburton\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
