title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: Open Transportation Data in One Hour'
recordingDate: 1258052132
description: "Please note: The audio was recorded over the telephone and is not HD quality.  \r\nFor many years, transportation agencies and authorities have given out thousands of free copies of paper maps and schedules. However, transportation agencies often resist sharing the data behind those maps and schedules. In July 2009, The Massachusetts Executive Office of Transportation and its agencies began opening data to application developers. This data has been used by smart, innovative software developers to build applications that benefit transportation users, travelers, and riders. This effort provides a window into the possibilities created by open data. This webcast discusses why EOT decided to open its data, progress so far, and what possibilities exist as more information, including real-time data, is opened and shared."
