description: "In the LFE talk given at Erlang Factory San Francisco 2014, we got up and running with LFE: everything from the basics through use in cloud apps and building RESTful services. We even explored the fringe with GP and HTNs. This talk will provide a brief overview of these but then continue with the latest exciting developments in the language and the community.\n\nTalk objectives:\n - Provide a brief overview of what a Lisp in the 21st century provides.\n - Review several of the more useful/prevalent Lisp forms in LFE.\n - Provide an update on the latest features in LFE and look at the LFE roadmap.\n - Highlight LFE tooling and select projects from the community.\n - Take a tour of the latest BEAM and JVM language interop with LFE.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nIntermediate Erlangers or beginning Erlangers with Lisp/Scheme experience."
