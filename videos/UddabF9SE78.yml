description: "Deep Dive: Scalability SIG - Shyam Jeedigunta, Amazon Web Services & Wojciech Tyczynski, Google \n\nThis session will focus on the vision and strategy for the scalability effort. We will touch upon work the Scalability Special Interest Group has been doing over the past year. This involves work done along various fronts like improvements to scale-testing tooling, introduction of newer and more user-focused SLOs and performance/scalability improvements to Kubernetes. Following that, we will discuss whatâ€™s next in our roadmap. We will leave time for Q&A and receive input from the audience that can help guide our priorities. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPkd"
