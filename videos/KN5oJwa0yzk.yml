description: 'Most people in the world don’t speak English, and are more comfortable using software in their native language. Yet around the world software is usually produced with English text by default. This weird situation might seem normal if you think of Software Localization in terms of string freezes, content handoffs and the emailing of spreadsheets with content strings. Can it be different? Can translation work follow the pace of today’s software delivery pipelines, and join in on the continuous delivery party? In this talk, we will discuss software localization and some ways that teams can improve their localization processes, from the personal perspective of a Python dev team based in Greece. What challenges did we face and what did we learn while building our own web-based localization automation platform using Django and Python?'
