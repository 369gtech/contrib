description: "When IT operators and developers think containers, naturally, the first thought is Kubernetes. The use of Kubernetes managed services has provided teams the ability to bootstrap environments at unprecedented velocity. Removing the necessity to manage cluster components shifts the focus on development initiatives, enablement, CI / CD workflows, and tasks that create business value.\n\nIf Kubernetes is the path forward for your organization, how do you adopt the optimal model for provisioning, managing and deploying container based applications in the cloud?\n\nPresenter:\n\nAnthony Ramirez, Director of Consulting @Nebulaworks"
