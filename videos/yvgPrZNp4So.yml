description: "Project Tango unleashes a new way for you to explore the world. With a few sensors and some computer vision software, your phone gets even smarter, and can start to see the world the way you do. Follow guided arrows to know which exit to take when you get off the subway, see how a sofa looks in your living room before you buy it, or watch zombies battle on your dining table. In this session, we explore the vision of Project Tango and how it will come to life with the launch of our first consumer phone, announced earlier this year. \n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
