title: 'Defence in depth by Martin Altenstedt and Tobias Ahnoff'
recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "The development of REST APIs and applications that expose sensitive data over the internet is difficult for us developers. The classical model with perimeter protection is not a good fit for modern architecture. As a result, our role as developers changes, and we need to take more considerable responsibility for the security of the APIs that we build.\n\nThis presentation aims to help you make sure to get this right from the start.\n\nWe will describe what you need to create conditions for strong authorization. We will also show how to deal with an API request and what protection layers are necessary for secure implementation. Finally, we will establish a few essential principles that provide guidelines for building a defence in depth.\n\nMartin Altenstedt, Omegapoint\nTobias Ahnoff, Omegapoint\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
