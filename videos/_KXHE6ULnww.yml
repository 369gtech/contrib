description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nTHE BEAM PROGRAMMING PARADIGM\nby Kenji Rikitake\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nAccuracy \nTranscends \nSpeed\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nBEAM language systems have a different set of paradigms from other programming language systems, emphasizing on the immutability of the language elements and the robust protection against the possible malfunction. We demonstrate what kind of principles the BEAM language systems focus on by comparing with the examples of other language systems and the applications including C++ and C#.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/kenji-rikitake/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - KENJI RIKITAKE\nErlang/OTP Rand Module Co-Creator, Amateur Radio Enthusiast\n\nKenji Rikitake started programming at age 8 (45 years ago).  He began his professional career as a programmer and operating system tools designer at Digital Equipment Corporation Japan R&D Center. He is a user of Erlang/OTP since 2008.\n\nKenji has a Ph.D. of Information Science from Osaka University and is a government-registered Professional Engineer of Information Engineering in Japan. His research interests include DNS, remote working, network security, operating systems, and software-defined radio engineering.\n\nKenji has been an independent software engineer since 2014, after working for various institutions including KDDI R&D Labs, NICT of Japan's Telecom Ministry, and Kyoto University. His contribution to the BEAM communities includes Erlang/OTP rand module, ACM SIGPLAN Erlang Workshop 2011 Workshop Chair and the 2019 Workshop Program Committee Member, and ten talks on Erlang Factory and Code BEAM events since 2010. \n\nKenji is also a seasoned amateur radio operator since 1976 with the primary callsign JJ1BDX.\n\nMore on Kenji Rikitake: https://codesync.global/speaker/kenji-rikitake/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
