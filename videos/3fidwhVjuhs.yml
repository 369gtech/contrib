description: "RubyConf 2018 - The secret power of Ruby 2.6: JIT by Takashi Kokubun\n\nHave you tried the JIT compiler included in Ruby 2.6 preview releases? It's easy, just include \"--jit\" option to a ruby command or set RUBYOPT=\"--jit\" environment variable. You've just learned how to enable it.\n\nBut wait, are you sure you can use it? What the hell is going on behind it, why is there a GCC process under your Ruby process, and why can JIT even make your Ruby program even slower? In this talk, you'll be prepared to try the brand-new Ruby's secret power on production from the next Christmas."
