description: "Tutorial: A Day in the Life of a Cloud Native Developer - Randy Abernethy, RX-M, LLC \n\nIn this 90 minute, hands on tutorial, attendees will get a chance to work with a comprehensive set of modern cloud native tools from the CNCF software stack. The tutorial will take users on an end to end journey through some of the most important tools and processes involved in constructing, packaging, deploying and managing a working microservices application. Each lab step will introduce a new CNCF project and demonstrate how that project adds value in a cloud native tool chain. Participants will leave with an overarching understanding of the benefits associated with a fully cloud native developer experience. Projects used in this practical field trip include: Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, Fluentd, gRPC, Containerd, Helm, Harbor and Telepresence. Attendees will need a laptop and an ssh client to complete the hands on labs. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPh0"
