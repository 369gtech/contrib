Because of this, there is an abundance of development tools and resources, and, more importantly, experts. HTML 5 is all about multimedia presentation. It's designed to allow any look and feel with ease. Modern browsers are among the most sophisticated pieces of software ever produced. It's hard to compete with what they achieve in terms of performance, security and stability.\n\nHTML 5 is for web pages...\n\n... or is it?\n\nThis talk introduces using HTML 5 as a graphical user interface framework for C++ native applications. In it we will explore several approaches and discuss their pros and cons. We will present several examples and demos which can help you start working on your own HTML 5 GUI right away.\n— \nBorislav Stanimirov\nViewRay\nSoftware Engineer\nBulgaria\n\nBorislav has been a C++ programmer for 15 years.
