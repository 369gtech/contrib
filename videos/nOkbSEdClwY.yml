description: "Typically, professional solutions focus on performance, safety and security; and are often packed with features requiring training to become proficient. On the other hand, consumer products aim to deliver desirable user experiences and value out of the box, often with a strong brand and identity.\nThe recent years the lines between the two have been blurring, giving rise to a new breed of professional solutions; albeit not without pitfalls. Through insights and concrete examples, Espen will show how to apply some consumer sexiness to improve and succeed with new professional solutions.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
