description: "Bay Area Vision Meeting (more info below)\r\nLearning Representations for Real-world Recognition\r\nTrevor Darrell\r\nMarch 7, 2011\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nMethods for visual recognition had made dramatic strides in recent\r\nyears on various online benchmarks, but performance in the real world\r\nstill often falters. Classic bag-of-local-feature models make overly\r\nsimplistic assumptions regarding image appearance statistics, both\r\nlocally and globally. Recent progress suggests that new\r\nlearning-based representations can improve recognition by devices that\r\nare embedded in a physical world. I'll review new methods for domain\r\nadaptation which capture the visual domain shift between environments,\r\nand improve recognition of objects in specific places when trained\r\nfrom generic online sources. I'll also present recent results\r\nlearning hierarchical local image representations based on recursive\r\nprobabilistic topic models, and on learning strong object color models\r\nfrom sets of uncalibrated views, using a new multi-view color\r\nconstancy paradigm. Finally, I'll mention other efforts in my lab,\r\nincluding efforts to exploit Primesense/KINECT sensors for indoor\r\nobject category recognition.\r\n\r\nProf. Trevor Darrell is on the faculty of the UC Berkeley EECS\r\ndepartment, and leads the computer vision group at the International\r\nComputer Science Institute in Berkeley, CA. He obtained the PhD from\r\nMIT in 1996, and worked at Interval Research in Palo Alto from 1996 to\r\n1999. From 1999 to 2008 he served on the faculty of the MIT EECS\r\ndepartment, where he led the CSAIL Vision Interfaces group. In 2008 he\r\nreturned to the west coast, and since then has been pursuing his\r\ninterests in visual perception, machine learning, multimodal\r\ninterfaces, and entrepreneurial activity in Berkeley. Prof. Darrell\r\nhas authored over 100 journal and conference papers, has served on the\r\neditorial boards of PAMI and the Artificial Intelligence Journal, and\r\nserved as Program Chair for CVPR 2010. He also serves on the advisory\r\nboards of local start-ups IQ Engines and BotSquare."
