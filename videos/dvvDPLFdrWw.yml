description: "Users are being exploited. Developers are writing insecure code. The administrators don't want to update their systems. And nobody is listening to the security staff until it's way too late.\n\nSecurity is becoming a more important task for all companies. Dealing with breaches, preventing information disclosure that could help your competitors, all of this is slowly taking up more and more time for industry professionals.\n\nWould you like to learn more about how you can help your company (and yourself) to navigate this landscape. \n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
