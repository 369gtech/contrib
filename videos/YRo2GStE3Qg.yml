See http://fitc.ca for details.\n\nOverview\nThe web was originally imagined to be a simple distributed document retrieval system. It is now being used for applications that go far beyond the systemâ€™s original capabilities and intentions. We have found ways to make it work, but they are difficult and far too fragile. Many times companies have offered to replace the web with superior proprietary systems, but we rejected them. We have been adding features to the web, but this does little to correct the deep underlying deficiencies, increasing instead of reducing its complexity.\n\nThis talk suggests a way forward, taking inspiration from our successful transition from NTSC to HDTV. There is a way forward to a web that is safer, easier, and as good as we desire.\n\nDouglas Crockford\nSenior JavaScript Architect, PayPal\nhttps://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
