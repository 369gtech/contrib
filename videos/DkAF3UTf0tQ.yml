title: '[Online Meetup] Type Touching: Types at your fingertips in IntelliJ Scala - Justin Kaeser'
recordingDate: 1600250071
description: "Scala's powerful type system helps you develop complex programs with less runtime errors. But sometimes understanding the types while programming becomes a challenge onto itself.\n\nJustin shows us how the Scala plugin for IntelliJ IDEA helps you get a grip on your types so that they can support your development flow instead of complicating it.\n\nJustin gives a live programming tour of features supporting interaction\nwith Scala's type system, including:\n\n* Type hints in parameters and return types\n* Implicit conversions\n* Type of selection\n* Smart completion (types holes)\n* Type mismatch diffs\n* Type hierarchy"
