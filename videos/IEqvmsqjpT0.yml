description: "Code Here: http://goo.gl/v0M6t\n\nBest Java Book : http://goo.gl/FtKp0m\n\nIn this part of my Java Video Tutorial I introduce Java collection classes. Specifically I cover how to use Java ArrayLists.\n\nJava ArrayLists make it easy to keep track of groups of objects. A Java ArrayList differs from a java array in that it automatically resizes itself when you add or remove values.\n\nI'll go over nearly every Java ArrayList method in this video."
