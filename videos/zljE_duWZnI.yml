description: "Developers love to complain about their legacy systems, but if you have a legacy system, it means you have a working, successful system which deliver real value to business, and this is definitely a good thing. Even more, legacy system is a system so successful that it makes very hard to dispose of it, even when it is obsolete in some (or all) respects. The problem is how to keep it nimble and easy to maintain and expand. It could be not easy, but if you try a rewrite you are taking a much bigger risk. You may have to add new feature to an old legacy application or make it scale with different architecture. To do this you need to be able to split monolithic applications in smaller modules and then refactor them, but without blocking development. I'll present my experience in rejuvenating system for finance industry with some refactoring techniques I developed.\n\nUberto is an expert on designing and building software products, currently working with finance institutions in London. He has more than two decades experience, in many industries in building great sw products. He is practicing TDD and Agile since 2001. He writes technical articles, regularly speaks at conference around Europe and organises courses. Last but not least he is a passionate polyglot programmer, he started as a kid with a ZxSpectrum he hopes to continue for many years to come."
