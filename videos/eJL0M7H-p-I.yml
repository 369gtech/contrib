description: "Algorithms: CLRS in Ruby\r by Brad Grzesiak\n\nOne of the most celebrated books in Computer Science academia is \"Introduction to Algorithms,\" also known as \"CLRS\" after its 4 authors. It's the go-to (pun!) textbook for many intermediate college courses, and this talk will introduce some of its many wonderful algorithms in Ruby form, including: various sorting techniques, dynamic programming, and some fun graph techniques. If you want a theory-heavy lecture, this talk is NOT for you!\n\n\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
