description: "DevOps.js Conference 2021 #DevOpsJS\nWebsite – https://www.devopsjsconf.com/\n\nWatch the full version of all the conference talks including QnA sessions on GitNation Video platform, follow the link →  http://bit.ly/devops-yt-talks-qna\n\nTalk: Automate React Site Deployments from GitHub to S3 & CloudFront\n\nIn this talk, I will demonstrate how to create a CI/CD pipeline for a React application in AWS. We'll pull the source code from GitHub and run tests against the application before deploying it to an S3 bucket for static site hosting. The site will then be distributed using CloudFront which will point to the S3 bucket. All of the infrastructure will be built using Terraform. In addition, I'll make use of Terragrunt to show how to create this setup for multiple environments.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 🏆 🏆  Platinum Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\n🏆 🏆  Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nHarness → https://harness.io/\nBuddy → https://buddy.works/\nSonarSource → https://www.sonarsource.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nSentry → https://sentry.io\n\n🏆  Silver Sponsors\nMoogsoft → https://www.moogsoft.com/"
