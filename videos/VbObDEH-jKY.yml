title: 'Andrew Grangaard - "Adventures in Failure: Error handling culture across languages"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498109575
description: "Modern programming languages have a wide spectrum of error handling methods and related cultural expectations.\n\nI'll lead you on a brief tour of various error handling patterns and paradigms and their strengths and failings. As a polyglot dabbler, I've done just enough with each of these languages to have formed cranky opinions.\n\nBy the end, we'll have new patterns to apply to our perl code (be in perl5 or perl6).\n\nCompare and contrast:\n\nC inspired return values in C, perl5 and go\nJava vs Python exceptions\nErlang: \"let it crash\" approach,\nRust: Failure vs Panic\nmonadic: Rust Option and Haskell Maybe.\npattern matching\nwhatever it is that perl6 does ;)\n\nPerl-loving polyglot Engineer. I fix things. Former Electrical Engineer, now I write software. la.pm.org nerd-herder for a decade. I've used perl for forever (I remember grumpily updating perl4 code for perl5 semantics). After a 6 year python diversion I'm back writing perl at ZipRecruiter."
