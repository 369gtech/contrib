description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nIntersection of artificial intelligence and art world is an intriguing concept. I will show several examples of this intersection, with the focus on the AI based \"Museum Treasures\" game, a winning solution from the HackArt: a hackathon organised by the National Museum in Warsaw. I will also touch on the topic of analogies between creative processes and machine learning processes.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
