title: 'Fireside Chat #4: Culture of learning'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624466552
description: "In the fourth Fireside Chat, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso and Mashooq Badar and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta talked about the culture of learning and how they perceive it and see it in the everyday of different organisations. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
