description: "There have been many great improvements to the web in the post-plugin era of the Internet, however, streaming video has had a challenge to keep up. For the past several years, the primary means to stream video consistently across browsers has been through the use of a Flash or Silverlight plugin.\n\nThankfully the W3C has come up with a solution to stream video to HTML without plugins, “MediaSource Extensions.” In this session Jeff Tapper explores what MediaSource Extensions are, their state in browsers today, and how we can use them to stream video without plugins.\n\nJeff Tapper\nFounding Partner, Digital Primates\nhttps://twitter.com/jefftapper\nhttp://www.digitalprimates.net\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
