description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nJuly 12, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Misko Hevery.\r\n\r\nIf you are new to JavaScript and would like to understand how JavaScript works behind the scenes, than this talk is for you. We will look at the core philosophy behind JavaScript objects and how the primitives can be used to build up basic OO concepts such as Classes and what it means to instantiate an object. How functions are executed and the rules behind the \"this\" keyword and what it means to bind functions. How to think about the Asynchronous nature of non-blocking API and what it means for performance and testing."
