description: "Teachers know their students: what motivates them, what they struggle with, what it looks like when something clicks and a new subject opens wide before them. Teachers also know that a new learning technology isn't very useful if it takes away time that could be spent working directly with students to identify and work on their learning challenges. Applied Minds CEO, Danny Hillis will offer an introduction to The Learning Map, a Shared Learning Collaborative initiative organizing online learning material to get the right content to the right student at the right time.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Shared Learning Collaborative\n\nDanny Hillis\n\nApplied Minds, LLC\n\nDanny Hillis is Co-Chairman and Chief Technology Officer of Applied Minds, LLC, a research and development company that invents, designs, creates and prototypes high technology products and services for a broad range of applications including transportation, education, architecture, distance collaboration, advanced visualization, electronics and software.\n\nPreviously, Danny was Vice President, Research and Development at Walt Disney Imagineering, and a Disney Fellow. Before that, he co-founded Thinking Machines Corp., which was the leading innovator in massive parallel supercomputers and RAID disk arrays. In addition to conceiving and designing the company's major products, Danny worked closely with his customers in applying parallel computers to problems in astrophysics, aircraft design, financial analysis, genetics, computer graphics, medical imaging, image understanding, neurobiology, materials science, cryptography and subatomic physics. At Thinking Machines, he built a technical team comprised of scientists and engineers that were widely acknowledged to have been among the best in the industry.\n\nDanny is an inventor, scientist, author and engineer.
