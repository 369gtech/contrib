description: "Most complex distributed systems happen by accident, as an evolution of a design initially thought simple. Not everyone wants to be involved in getting the semantics of a distributed system right. In this talk, we'll explore how Apache Mesos can help simplify and decouple the inner workings of distributed systems.\nThis talk will give a short introduction to distributed systems and examples of infrastructure components which rapidly grow into behemoths. A mesos overview will be given, as well as an overview of frameworks which work on top of mesos. To finish, an example framework will be explored to highlight how complex systems can be built."
