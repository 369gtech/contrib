description: "Moving People and Products with Machine Learning on Kubeflow - Jeremy Lewi, Google & Willem Pienaar, GO-JEK \n\nGOJEK, the Southeast Asian super app, has experienced a massive increase in customer growth by leveraging machine learning throughout its products. However, building production grade machine learning systems is still fraught with challenges and delays. In order to address these challenges GOJEK has adopted Kubeflow, a fully open source cloud native platform for machine learning.    In this talk you will learn how Kubeflow empowers teams at GOJEK by increasing the speed at which they turn ideas into products. One of these products, the GOJEK driver (blog post: http://bit.ly/2MhujA1) allocation system, has been built from the ground up on Kubeflow, and fully utilizes cloud native tooling. We will show how Kubeflow, which leverages Kubernetes and Istio, simplifies the process of rapidly training, deploying, and evaluating models on this multi-objective ML system. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPac"
