description: "Andrzej Grzesik\nGreat Archwizard\n\nYou might have heard about Blockchain… As engineers, we prefer to talk facts, so I will start with the foundations, explaining the term and concepts. Then we will build a 'smart contract' application, in Java, using open source. Then consider the implications of the contract being put out \"there\", and what is \"there\". You will walk out understanding what a 'distributed ledger' is, maybe an idea of an application, who knows?"
