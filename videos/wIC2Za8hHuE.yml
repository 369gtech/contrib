description: "AI has a sizeable carbon footprint, both during training and deployment phases. How do we build AI systems that are greener? The first thing we need to understand is how to account and calculate the carbon impact of all the resources that go into the AI lifecycle. So what is the current state of carbon accounting in AI? How effective has it been? And can we do better? This conversation will answer these questions and dive into what the future of carbon accounting in AI looks like and what role standards can play in this, especially if we want to utilize actionable insights to trigger meaningful behavior change.\n\n\n\nSpeaker:\n\nAbhishek Gupta is a Software Engineer with the Commercial Software Engineering group at Microsoft where he works to solve the toughest technical challenges for Microsoft customers, usually on projects involving machine learning.\n\nHe is also the Founder and Principal Researcher at the Montreal AI Ethics Institute (https://montrealethics.ai ), an international non-profit research institution with the mission to democratize AI ethics literacy.\n\nHe serves as the Chair of the Standards Working Group at the Green Software Foundation (https://greensoftware.foundation ) where he is working on creating industry-wide consensus on methodology and tooling to assess the environmental impacts of software systems.\n\nYou can learn more about his work at https://atg-abhishek.github.io\n\nFeel free to connect with him on LinkedIn (https://linkedin.com/in/abhishekguptamcgill )"
