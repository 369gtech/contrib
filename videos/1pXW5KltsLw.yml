description: "Today’s world of Equifax breaches is the same old data security problem. In the past you’d need a solid SQL injection to pull all the records of a database. Now days, you need an RCE on the application server. The root problem has not changed. The app server has keys to database, decryption, and a public presence. How do you protect data in this architecture. A solution is crypto anchoring paired with effective monitoring.\n\n\nSpeakers\n\nJon Debonis\nHead of Security / CSO, Blend\nHi. I'm Jon. I study companies who've kept huge amounts of data secure, and try to replicate their success.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
