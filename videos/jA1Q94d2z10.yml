description: "Video sponsor: United States Digital Service (https://usds.gov)\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in people management is ensuring that your engineers are growing in their career. We expect larger companies to have an established career ladder, but it often gets sacrificed at many companies in the name of remaining “flatter” and “more agile”. As the demand for talent gets more competitive, painting a clear growth path for engineers becomes an asset in any serious engineering organization.\n\nMarco Rogers will give a concrete idea of what a career guide looks like for engineers based on his experience as an engineering leader at multiple companies. There are the big things like creating levels that engineers progress through, and addressing what “Senior” means. He will also touch on the less obvious aspects, such as providing guidance on how to get promoted, and maintaining consistency between internal hiring and external recruiting.\n\nAbout Marco Rogers\nMarco is an experienced engineering leader, having built software and teams at notable companies like Lever, Clover Health, and Yammer. He is dedicated to building healthy and diverse engineering organizations, and is often found sharing some his experience about Diversity & Inclusion topics on Twitter."
