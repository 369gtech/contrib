CI for Android development is a problem that has been solved before, but it gets a lot more interesting to keep the same quality and speed with hundreds of changes a day and hundreds of developers working on the same project. In this talk, Gautam will walk through the history of Android CI at Uber, the UX improvements for developers interacting with it and how it evolved into delivering release builds on every change. You will also learn how to incorporate such processes into your CI and CD workflows.\n\nGautam Korlam \nFrom Uber\nI lead the Android and Java Developer Experience Team at Uber. I am very passionate about tooling, infrastructure and build systems for building apps at scale."
