title: 'Building Faster, More Resilient Apps with Service Worker'
language: English
recordingDate: 1544478057
description: "Because most users access the Web on the go, it's critical that we deliver experiences that load quickly and run smoothly, regardless of network conditions. And with service worker now supported in all modern browsers, we can leverage it as a core part of our application architecture and performance strategy. But not all service worker implementations are created equal, and they can offer vastly different performance benefits. Every prefetch and cache decision comes with speed vs. freshness and bandwidth vs. storage trade offs. Join us to discover how to evaluate and build different service worker flows for your app, giving the best experience for your users.\n\nEVENT:\n\nChrome Dev Summit 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPhil Walton\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25aCD5XL1Jk"
