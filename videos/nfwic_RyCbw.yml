description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nCrashing BEAM applications\nby \nGuilherme de Maio\n\nABSTRACT\nWe often talk about embracing failures and making resilient applications, and how BEAM helps us do that. Nonetheless, there are several ways you can write code that will crash your application, and sometimes the whole VM! This talk is about those things, showing several ways, Guilherme may or may not have managed to crash the BEAM in the past, some obvious, and some not that obvious ;)\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Guilherme de Maio\n\nGuilherme is a software engineer with 10 years’ worth of experience, focused on web applications, from ops to backend. He is currently working at Telnyx, a CPaSS company aiming at democratizing universal communications.
