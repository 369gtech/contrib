description: "Applications may face the dreaded unplanned increase of requests. Even knowing when such an event might occur, it is very difficult to estimate how far to scale without under- or over-committing resources. The auto-scaling service adjusts the number of application instances based on need. Come learn about what the auto-scaling service can do for you. Lets discuss what additional capabilities (application metrics, time-based, external events, etc) you need to scale up or down your application properly.\n\nMichael Fraenkel\nIBM\nMichael Fraenkel is a Distinguished Engineer at IBM. He is the Product Manager for the Runtime OG team responsible for the DEA and HM9000.\n\nBo Yang\nIBM\nBo Yang is a Senior Technical Staff Member at IBM."
