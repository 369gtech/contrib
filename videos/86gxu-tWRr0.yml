title: 'Microsoft Tech Days: DevOps 101 for Developers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623841839
description: "You’re probably already using DevOps processes even if you don’t realise it. DevOps is where development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams collaborate to increase the speed and reliability of software delivery. Often referred to as a culture, DevOps connects people, processes and technology to deliver continuous value – which means you can spend more time creating great code. \n\nIf you’re a professional developer interested in the ‘dev’ element of DevOps but don’t know how to get started, this session is for you. Samuel Rowe, Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect and Peter Murray, Field Solutions Engineer at GitHub join forces to take you through a series of demos showing you everything from getting started through to managing the flow of work, security and quality and deploying and publishing code in the cloud. You’ll get the chance to ask questions of the speakers in live Q&A sessions and find out the best next steps to adopt DevOps practices in your organisation."
