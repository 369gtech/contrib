How does DNS work? What is DNSSEC? And what exactly is it that she is the keyholder for? \n\nPart 2 will dive into the the Internet of Things. With IoT we are facing new and different security risks in the developed digital world. Suddenly human lives are at stake in a way they haven't been previously. How can we prevent the Internet of Things from becoming the Internet of Shit? \n\nAnne-Marie Eklund Löwinder is the security chief at IIS. She is one of Sweden's foremost IT-security experts.
