description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotgo.eu on November 6th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nLiz explains how a debugger works by building one in a few lines of Go. This includes mapping between Go source code and the machine code instructions it compiles to, and using the ptrace system call to set break points and examine and modify the running process."
