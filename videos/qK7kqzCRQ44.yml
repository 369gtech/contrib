title: 'Complexity Sucks! - Aslam Khan'

description: "OUR APOLOGIES: AFTER TEN MINUTES THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE SOUND TRACK. IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO LISTEN THOUGH.\n\nBuilding software is mostly about trying to wrap our heads around the complexity of a domain.  If we understand the domain, we have a better chance of producing a simpler design.  The harsh reality is that there is a pretty good chance of deforming that simple design over months and years.  The challenge we face is dealing with inherent complexity up front and accidental complexity that sneaks in later.  In this talk I will share some techniques that I found useful in tackling with domain and code complexity.\n\nAslam Khan is an African technologist and strategist.  He consults to large enterprises looking to shift gears, and to startups that are off the runway trying the same.  He spends his time with his friends at Samushonga, Khan and Baker where they sharpen enterprise strategy and execute on its implementation; focusing on people to lines of code and the weird stuff in between.  After all, what is the value of a strategy that can’t be delivered?   He tweets in bursts at @aslamkhn.\n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
