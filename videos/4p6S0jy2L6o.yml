Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Keynote: Aggregating, Alerting and Graphing on Millions of Prometheus Timeseries - Rob Skillington, CTO & Co-founder, Chronosphere\n\nThe key to quickly resolving problems is knowing about them as soon as possible. To accomplish this, you need fast and reliable alerting. However, many companies find that as their environments grow, and their alerts and queries become increasingly more expensive, it can become challenging to maintain the speed of real-time queries alerts as the metrics become higher in cardinality. This is where aggregation can help!\n\nIn this keynote, Rob will discuss how M3 aggregation can be used to create derived metrics, similar to Prometheus recording rules, with any Prometheus remote storage that supports Prometheus Remote Write. This can help relieve the pressure on Prometheus or remote storage when querying and alerting on metrics at large scale."
