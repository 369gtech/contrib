language: English
recordingDate: 1540334148
description: "Werner Dietl, Assistant Professor, University of Waterloo\nMichael Ernst, Professor, UW\n\nAre you tired of null pointer exceptions, unintended side effects, SQL injections, concurrency errors, mistaken equality tests, and other runtime errors? Are your users tired of them in your code? In this tutorial, you will learn how to guarantee, at compile time, that these runtime exceptions cannot occur; you will learn the concepts of (pluggable) type checking; you will use existing type systems; you will learn to write your own type system that checks consistent use of encryption; and you will see a presentation on the design and usage of more-advanced checkers. The tool is in use at companies such as Amazon, Google, and Uber and is freely available at http://checkerframework.org/. You have nothing to lose but your bugs!"
