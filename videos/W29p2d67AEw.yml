description: "Would you put a chip in your body if it meant a longer and healthier life? Would you put a chip in your body in order to open doors, withdraw money from an ATM, and to safely store sensitive data?\n\nThis session will introduce you to connected bodies, look at the possibilities available today and end by discussing a few important things we can expect in the future:\n\nMedical reasons - what if we could implant thousands of chips and let them monitor vital parts of the body?\n\nIdentification - what if we could use chip implants as identification. No more pin codes , no more cards, no more finger prints, all that's needed is a connected body.\n\nTracking - what if we could publish our \"body status\" and whereabouts as a service? Insurance companies can base the cost on how inclined we are to take risks. Store owners can target ads to fit your \"body status\".\n\nThe speaker has been wearing a chip implant for a year and the audience will get the possibility to test the chip with there mobile phones.\n\nPär Sikö is a java developer, working primarily with Android but with a long and happy history that includes J2ME, Swing and JavaFX.\n\nHe’s been working with Java since it’s inception and tried everything from architecture and large enterprise systems to mobile devices.\n\nAs a developer Pär is curious and thorough and knows the importance of pixels and colors. Curious to learn new things, growing as a human being in the process, and happy to teach and inspire others about it. Thorough to ensure that the quality is on par with expectations and, perhaps most importantly, to really understand something makes it so much easier and fun to work with.\n\n[UYS-1254]"
