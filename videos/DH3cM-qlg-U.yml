title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Dries Q&A'
recordingDate: 1523586881
description: "Some feedback we have heard from previous DrupalCons has been that the Dries Q&A, traditionally done as part of the “Driesnote” on a Tuesday morning, was far too short and not enough questions could be asked.\n\nSo, we intend to change this. Moving to a whole new session time of its own; the new Dries Q&A will allow time for more questions and for them to be more in-depth. Dries will also have more time to explain his answers!\n\nIf you wish to submit questions to the Dries Q&A, you will be able to do this using the Twitter hashtag #askDries\_any time after the start of the Driesnote."
