description: "The Australian Taxation Office is gradually replacing systems that businesses, their accountants and taxation practitioners have been using for years to lodge obligations and reports. This is a slow-motion train wreck for both the lodging parties and their software providers.\n\nThe ATO's \"reporting taxonomy\" currently supports 63 forms, each with one or more variations (tax returns for instance get a different variation every year). Together they make up 40MB of schemata in 1,469 files. The \"definitions taxonomy\" on which these forms are based comprises 174MB in 6,095 files.\n\nThis talk describes how MYOB addressed the problem of testing this mess. In it, we will try to answer the following questions:\n\nHow do you grapple with such a complex and constantly shifting problem domain without going completely insane?\n\nHow do you create a testing regime that can be maintained and extended by non-technical domain practitioners but which can also be integrated with a build pipeline?\n\nWhat have we learned from this approach? What is going right? What is going wrong? What about the alternatives?\n\nFinally, how would you go about applying this approach to other problem domains?"
