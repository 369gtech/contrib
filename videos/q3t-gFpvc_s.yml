description: "To RPC or not to RPC: Choosing the right communication strategies in a micro service architecture\n\nThomas Bøgh Fangel\n\nLunar Way is what we define as a ‘money app’. We are not a bank - we are helping people making their money matter.\n\nBack in 2016 we started the journey of breaking up the existing monolithic backend into a micro service architecture. A major challenge throughout this - still ongoing - process has been choosing the right communication strategies between services. This entailed finding the balance between traditional directed RPC based communication and event based async pub/sub communication. \n\nIn this talk I will present Lunar Way’s journey of breaking up our Rails monolith into a scalable micro service based architecture with a special focus on the benefits we have gained from letting go of the secureness of synchronous RPC and instead use asynchronous event based messaging. I will present both what went well, but equally important, where we did not get it right in the first iteration."
