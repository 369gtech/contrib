description: "The Evolution of the AppDirect Kubernetes Network Infrastructure - Pierre Lacerte, & Alex Gervais, AppDirect \n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss the joys and pain the drove the evolution of the AppDirect ingress architecture, from NodePorts, to HAProxy/Consul, and ultimately to the open source Ambassador API Gateway. At AppDirect, we run 12 Kubernetes clusters, handling thousands of requests/minute, and we rely on our gateway to provide key cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting and observability. Join us to learn about how both development and ops teams use Ambassador, and how this acts as a control plane to the underlying Envoy data plane, which, for example, allows us to specify routing and rate limiting via Kubernetes annotations. We’ll also talk about our ingress roadmap and the planned future for the API Gateway as AppDirect scales. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrRm"
