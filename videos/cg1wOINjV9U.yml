description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nMost people think metaprogramming is hard. It isn't; we just didn't have the right tools for it. This talk will present a new way of metaprogramming using the same syntax as that of normal C++. It will show how the runtime and the compile-time boundaries can be crossed almost seamlessly. It will show how compilation times can be reduced without sacrificing expressiveness. It will introduce Hana [1], a newly accepted Boost library using cutting edge features of the language in a creative way to solve the problem of metaprogramming for good.\n— \nLouis is a computer programming enthusiast and math student with interest in C++ (meta)programming, functional programming, category theory and related subjects. In the past years, he's been working on various ways to solve the problem of metaprogramming in C++, and he thinks he has finally found a satisfactory solution.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
