But once the initial setup is done, it needs to be complemented with an ecosystem that can cope with the extra operational complexity and quality concerns. While running Spring Cloud in production for over a year, Pivotal has integrated some interesting tools for documentation, operations and testing. During this talk you will see a demo of an integrated platform based on Spring Cloud, including tools like Spring Cloud Contract, wiremock, saboteur, ELK, Spinnaker, Spring Boot Admin and more. One of these tools is a dashboard for visualising Pivotal’s Spring Cloud microservice architecture, which has recently been open sourced. Documenting, testing, troubleshooting, and monitoring highly distributed systems in microservice architectures are hard. Finding quality, complementary tools in the wilds of open source can be even harder. Join this webinar for a pragmatic look at taming some of the challenges of running microservices in production."
