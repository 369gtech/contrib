recordingDate: 1439712345
description: "Hi all. In this JavaScript tutorial for beginners, we're going to take our first look at control flow - if statements. If statements are alive everywhere you look in the world. If you perform an action, there will be a corresponding reaction or result. This concept is used in programming too.\n\nIf statements can be used to check a variety of things in JavaScript, such as whether a certain element has a particular class associated with it, or to check if an element is showing on a web page. They're an extremely important aspect of JS, and will be VERY helpful in your future coding!\n\nAs usual, any questions just ask away :).\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== JavaScript for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i9Ae2D9Ee1RvylH38dKuET\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n\n========== HTML for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
