description: "In this talk, reverse engineer and security expert John Dunlap will present security hazards concerning the ever expanding use of Field Programmable Gate Array systems. FPGAâ€™s are reconfigurable computers that allow programmers to redesign a CPU as if it were hardware. With this amazing capability comes significant security risks. \nJohn Dunlap will present a threat model for FPGA systems, including methods of both hardware and software attack for the purposes of exploitation and reverse engineering."
