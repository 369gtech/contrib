language: English
recordingDate: 1433505055
description: "Elevate your tuning efforts by using Oracle Performance Analyzer, which is used extensively within Oracle to gain insight into application behavior at the user, JVM, and machine level. Understand how to profile multiple processes and highly multithreaded applications with fairly low overhead. This presentation walks through analysis of  SPECjEnterprise and Oracle Fusion Middleware profiling to show how large, long-running enterprise applications can be profiled and optimized.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBikramdeep Singh Shahi\nundefined\nView more trainings by Bikramdeep Singh Shahi at https://www.parleys.com/author/bikramdeep-singh-shahi\n\nMartin Itzkowitz\nMarty Itzkowitz received an A.B. degree from Columbia College and a Ph.D. in Chemistry and Physics from CalTech.
