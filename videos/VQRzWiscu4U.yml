description: "Filmed at http://js-kongress.de on November 28-29 in Munich\n\nInterested in Machine Learning and its latest hype Deep Neural Networks? Maybe you have been fascinated by the spectacular win of AlphaGo?  Unfortunately, most libraries in that area have a Python interface that might be a tad hard to install or are not very accessible to a JavaScript developer. Additionally, you might be afraid of the math involved.\n\nIn this talk I will show you how Deep Neural Networks work â€“ leaving out most of the math. I will also introduce a JavaScript framework that easily lets you experiment with Machine Learning.\n\nSlides: http://djcordhose.github.io/machine-learning-in-the-browser/2016_js_kongress.html#/"
