recordingDate: 1314203583
description: "Robert Hodgin has been captivated by invisible forces since he first programmed a magnetic repulsion effect six years ago. Since then, Robert has explored the phenomenon of electrostatic fields and gravitational forces, using these invisible forces to create audio visualizations, natural simulations, and artistic interpretations.\r\nIn this recorded presentation from FITC Toronto 2011, Robert discusses these invisible forces at greater length and demonstrates a few implementations and unexpected uses.\r\n\r\nThanks to our video sponsor Vitamin T for making this possible.
