recordingDate: 1522514205
description: "Serverless computing is sweeping the cloud industry and transforming how we're building applications on the cloud. Node.js has been the first language each of the major serverless providers has supported from day 1. Node.js applications written for serverless are changing from their \"\"server\"\"ed past. We'll discuss why serverless went Node.js first, what impact this will have on Node.js developers, and finally, what consequences this might have on Node.js's ecosystem.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nChris Anderson\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNode Summit 2018 registration: http://www.nodesummit.com/registration/"
