description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nAdrian Cockcroft - Director of Architecture for the Cloud Systems Team at Netflix\n\nABSTRACT\nNetflix used to be a traditional Datacenter based architecture using a few large Oracle database backends. Now it is one of the largest cloud based architectures, with master copies of all data living in Cassandra. This talk will discuss how we made the transition, how we automated and open sourced Cassandra management for tens of clusters and hundreds of nodes using Priam and Astyanax, backups, archiving and performance and scalability benchmarks.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
