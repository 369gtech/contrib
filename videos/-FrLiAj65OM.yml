title: 'Building Mobile Physics Games with GWT and Box2D'
recordingDate: 1331530952
description: "Working on the next Angry Birds? Then step right up to GWT and Box2D. This powerful pair of technologies can build games with realistic physics and effects entirely in Java, even for non-Java platforms. The session will briefly cover GWT on mobile, then dive into the Box2D library and how to build casual games with it.\n\nAbout Joshua Marinacci:\n\nJoshua Marinacci first tried Java in 1995 at the request of his favorite TA and never looked back. He has spent the last ten years writing Java user interfaces for wireless, web, and desktop platforms. After tiring of web programming with several large companies in the Atlanta area he joined Sun to work on Java user interfaces full-time, first on the Swing team, then NetBeans, and now on the JavaFX tools team. Joshua recently co-authored O'Reilly's Swing Hacks with Chris Adamson. He also contributes to SwingLabs and writes regularly for Java.net. Joshua holds a BS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech and recently moved to Eugene, Oregon to be with his new wife.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
