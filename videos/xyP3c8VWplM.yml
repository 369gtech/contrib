recordingDate: 1581278404
description: "In my previous books, I’ve focused on principles and practices (e.g., Three Ways, Four Types of Work). However, I’ve always wanted to describe the spectrum of cultural, experiential and value decisions we make that either enable greatness or create chronic suffering and underperformance. They are currently as follows:\n\n• The First Ideal — Locality and Simplicity\n• The Second Ideal — Focus, Flow and Joy\n• The Third Ideal — Improvement of Daily Work\n• The Fourth Ideal — Psychological Safety\n• The Fifth Ideal — Customer Focus\n\nGene Kim is a multiple award winning CTO, and DevOps researcher and author.  He has been researching high-performing technology organizations since 1999. He was founder and CTO of Tripwire, which commercialized the open source software he wrote in 1992 with Dr. Gene Spafford at Purdue University. He is the co-author of The DevOps Handbook, The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win, as well as The Visible Ops Handbook and The Security Visible Ops Handbook.  \n\nGene’s area of passion is helping companies build super-tribes where Development, IT Operations, Product and Project Management, and Information Security simultaneously maximize throughput of features from “code complete” to “in production,” without causing chaos and disruption to the IT environment. He’s helped some of the largest Internet properties, such as Microsoft, Yahoo!, and AOL. He loves finding and fixing bottlenecks which impede and frustrate the entire organization, enabling management from each tribe to achieve the greater organizational goals.\n\nFor more on YOW!
