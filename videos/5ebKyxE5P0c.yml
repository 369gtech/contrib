description: "In this episode, @lmoroney meets with James McLurkin to talk about AIY -- Artificial Intelligence-it Yourself, a project from Google that is designed to 'build engineers', by giving you hands-on skills in building a device that uses Google's Artificial Intelligence technologies. We talk about a group of high school kids that were given these kits and a few days to see what they would come up with, and were blown away by the results! The goal is to put AI into the maker toolkit, to help you solve real problems that matter to you and your communities. These kits will get you started by adding natural human interaction to your maker projects.
