description: "It's the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine): Engineering for Crisis Response at Scale\n\nMatthew Simons, Workiva\n\nIt's 4 AM and your phone is ringing. The system is in full meltdown and the company is losing money. Start the caffeine drip and get ready for a rough day. \n\nWe've all been there. When the world is on fire, Reliability Engineers are almost always on the front lines, extinguishers in hand. For the sake of our own sanity, what can we do to minimize the frequency and impact of production crises? How can we engineer the system to be more resilient, and what best practices can we employ to that end? \n\nThese are the questions we've been asking at Workiva as we've grown and scaled our operations from a small startup to a publicly-traded company in only a few years. We're still sane (mostly), so we'd like to share what's worked for us. Hopefully it will help you too.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
