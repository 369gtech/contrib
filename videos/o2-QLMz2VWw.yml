description: "\"Our goal as software engineers is to deliver good quality software that is reliable is flexible, and -- above all -- solves customer problems. We want to be able to go from an idea to customer value rapidly, repeatably, and sustainably. \n\nIn this session, we will use the Five Ideals from The Unicorn Project to help us improve our ability to build and deliver software:\n* Locality and Simplicity\n* Focus, Flow, and Joy\n* Improvement of Daily Work\n* Psychological Safety\n* Customer Focus\n\nFor each Ideal, we will look at both what we can do as engineering leaders and what we can do as engineers. You will leave with actionable suggestions you can apply in your own organization.\""
