description: ".NET Summit 2019, Minsk\nFreaky .NET Track\nGeneral Partner - ArasCorp Development Center (https://companies.dev.by/arascorp-development-center) \n\n.NET 5.0: CoreCLR, CoreRT and Mono, Egor Bogatov\nWhile .NET 5.0 is basically the .NET Core vNext it will also offer a lot of new awesome features. One of them is \"switchable runtimes\" so you will be able to easily switch to Mono-as-a-VM without any code modifications for AOT, LLVM, WebAssembly targets and more. \nEgor is currently working on .NET 5 at Microsoft so he is going to share his experience and tell about challenges he faced."
