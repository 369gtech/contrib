description: "Google Tech Talk\nMarch 12, 2013\nNASA: The Exploration Ground Data System (xGDS). Reusable Software Tools for Human and Robotic Missions \n\nPresented by Matt Deans, Intelligent Robotics Group at NASA Ames\n\nABSTRACT\n\nDid you know that NASA uses Google Earth for mission planning and real-time mission operations? Are you curious about the software NASA is developing to carry out future human and robot missions? Would you like to know how modern Web frameworks can be used for data-driven field science?\n\nThe Exploration Ground Data System (xGDS) is a suite of reusable software tools for human and robotic missions. xGDS supports mission planning, ingesting and managing geo-referenced and time-series data, and visualization/analysis. xGDS is highly modular, Web-based and makes extensive use of Apache, Django, the Google Earth plug-in, JQuery, and\nMySQL.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the use cases that xGDS was designed to support and describe how it is implemented. I will show how the Intelligent Robotics Group has used xGDS for exploration missions involving astronauts (Arizona), planetary rovers (Canada and Hawaii), and personal submarines (British Columbia and Florida). And, I'll briefly talk about how xGDS can be used for other applications, such as crisis and disaster response."
