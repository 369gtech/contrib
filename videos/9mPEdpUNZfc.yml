title: 'Dependency Management in C++ - Patricia Aas - NDC TechTown 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635781674
description: 'C++ has been slow to settle on standardized tools for building and dependency management. In recent years CMake has emerged as the de facto standard for builds, but dependency management still has no clear winner. In this talk I will look into what dependency management might look like in modern C++ projects and how that relates to security.'
