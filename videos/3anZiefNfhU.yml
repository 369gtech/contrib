title: 'Bringing a Jewel as a starter from the Python world to the JVM with Apache Spark, Arrow, and Spacy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1523550639
description: "With the new Apache Arrow integration in PySpark 2.3, it is now starting become reasonable to look to the Python world and ask “what else do we want to steal besides tensorflow”, or as a Python developer look and say “how can I get my code into production without it being rewritten into a mess of Java?”\n\nRegardless of your specific side(s) in the JVM/Python divide, collaboration is getting a lot faster, so let's learn how to share! In this brief talk, we will examine sharing some of the wonders of Spacy with the Java world, which still has a somewhat lackluster set of options for NLP."
