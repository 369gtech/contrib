title: 'Python, Asynchronous Programming'
recordingDate: 1531960690
description: "We'll review the current state of asynchronous programming in Python, including real world use-cases in the web, IoT and robotics space. We'll talk about the standard library's asyncio package as well as the older Twisted framework. We'll also explore async use-cases in general: when does the complexity of this form of programming make sense and what problems does it solve?\n\nPresented by Jesse Legg at Code & Supply"
