recordingDate: 1384458157
description: "http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/28783\n\nThis talk looks at how Facebook has redesigned its configuration management system to handle a massive, dynamic, heterogeneous environment with a tiny team and open source software. We will look at the philosophy we use to manage our systems, the implementation of that philosophy, and how you can apply these ideas to any size server footprint, from a handful of servers to a global environment."
