description: "How should we think about harassment, bullying, bots, and misinformation on the Web? Have we failed as an industry to protect users, and do we need to aggressively police our spaces? If so, how do we respond to concerns about censorship by big business?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll propose a formal framework for user rights on the Web. I’ll explore the idea that the rights of users on the Web are not all legal, instead most are founded in the architecture of the Web itself, and by modifying the Web’s architecture, we can build the political foundation for democratic representation, community moderation, and social responsibility in an online society.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
