title: 'Kafka as a Platform: the Ecosystem from the Ground Up - Robin Moffatt - NDC Oslo 2020'
recordingDate: 1599750610
description: "Kafka has become a key data infrastructure technology, and we all have at least a vague sense that it is a messaging system, but what else is it? How can an overgrown message bus be getting this much buzz? Well, because Kafka is merely the center of a rich streaming data platform that invites detailed exploration.\n\nIn this talk, we‚Äôll look at the entire streaming platform provided by Apache Kafka and the Confluent community components. Starting with a lonely key-value pair, we‚Äôll build up topics, partitioning, replication, and low-level Producer and Consumer APIs. We‚Äôll group consumers into elastically scalable, fault-tolerant application clusters, then layer on more sophisticated stream processing APIs like Kafka Streams and ksqlDB. We‚Äôll help teams collaborate around data formats with schema management. We‚Äôll integrate with legacy systems without writing custom code. By the time we‚Äôre done, the open-source project we thought was Big Data‚Äôs answer to message queues will have become an enterprise-grade streaming platform, all in 60 minutes.\n\nTimecodes\n\n0:00 Intro\n01:24 What are Events?\n04:33 A platform for events\n05:11 The Log\n06:54 Topics\n08:53 Partitions\n09:37 Publisher API\n10:45 Message keys\n14:10 Consumer API\n19:20 Consumer Groups\n22:30 Brokers\n24:39 Demo 01 - Kafka producer/consumer\n30:30 Kafka use cases\n32:43 Kafka Connect\n36:40 Schemas & Serialisation Formats\n44:40 Stream processing introduction\n46:50 Kafka Streams\n48:03 ksqlDB\n50:16 Demo 02\n57:05 Recap & Resources\n\nüìö Free eBooks: http://rmoff.dev/ndcoslo2020\n\n‚úçÔ∏è Slides: https://rmoff.dev/kafka101\n\nüé• More Apache Kafka videos: https://www.youtube.com/rmoff"
