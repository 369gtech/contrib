title: 'Transformers from the Ground Up - Sebastian Raschka | PyData Jeddah'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628277832
description: "In recent years, deep learning-based transformer models have revolutionized natural language processing. First of all, this talk will explain how transformers work. Then, we will examine some popular transformers like GPT and BERT and understand how they differ. Equipped with this understanding, we will then take a look at how we can fine-tune a BERT model for sentiment classification in Python.\n\nNote: timestamps will be added soon.\n\nSpeaker: \nDr. Sebastian Raschka\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/rasbt\n\nPyData Jeddah\nWebsite: https://pydatajeddah.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyDataJeddah\n\nPyData\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.
