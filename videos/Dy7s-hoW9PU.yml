description: "In this talk we will be looking on how to model a domain into your application by using F# power-full type system. This approach will help you limit the amount of illegal states that can be represented and hereby ensuring a more correct application. \n\nIf we combine the above approach with idiomatic data structures in F#, we can argue that we have and even more sound application which would need fewer test cases to ensure correctness. \n\nRamón Soto Mathiesen is a passionate computer scientist, with flair for business, that advocates for correctness, code-quality and high-standards but always with the customer in focus. \n\nHe has more than +15 years of experience working with Microsoft technologies.
