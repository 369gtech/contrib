description: "by Jos Poortvliet\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.120/dozen_more_things_nextcloud.webm\n\nWith Nextcloud you can sync, share and collaborate on data, but you don't need to put your photos, calendars or chat logs on an American server. Nope, Nextcloud is self-hosted and 100% open source! Thanks to hundreds of apps, Nextcloud can do a lot and in this talk, I will highlight some cool things. Consider this a follow-up from my talk about 200 things Nextcloud can do last year! An update on what's new and some cool new stuff. What, what is ❮code❯Nextcloud❮/code❯? Let's see. A private cloud is one way to put it, though that's a contradiction of course. It is a way to share your data, sync your files, communicate and collaborate with others - without giving your data to GAFAM! Keep it on your own server, or something close (like a local hosting provider or data center). Nextcloud is a PHP app that does all that, and more! Easy to use, secure (really) and fully open source of course.\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 11:00:00"
