description: "RubyConf 2019 - How to write pleasant code by Roman Kofman\n\nAs we grow from beginner to intermediate developers, we tend to learn tools and Best Practices for writing good code. But. The more we learn, the more contradictions show up -- and the murkier it gets to find the right answers. Senior developers sometimes chime in with \"it depends!\". Which -- while being technically accurate, is also completely unhelpful. What does it depend on? How do we reconcile Best Practices when they conflict with each other? Who is \"good\" code actually good for? Is perfectly clean code even possible?\n\r\n\nWe'll learn to find the answers to all of these questions by exploring the discipline of Design (think fancy chairs in museum); and stealing from it shamelessly.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
