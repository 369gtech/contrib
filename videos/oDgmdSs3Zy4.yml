description: 'This talk will discuss techniques and tools which are useful when authoring tests higher up the test pyramid. Examples, often including code, of test fixtures from both OSS and speaker''s work which enable writing tests in which the system under test communicates with external services will be given. All this will be presented with using Groovy in mind and include discussion of certain features of the language that make it a perfect fit for writing test oriented DSLs. You should attend this session if you would like to learn how to write reliable and flexible integration and end to end tests in an easier way.'
