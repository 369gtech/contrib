description: "🙂 Csaba Sipőcz\n💼 Head of Operations @ IBM Budapest Lab\n🎙️ Getting Unsmart About Leadership\n\nJust like with any other skills, we read books, articles, do trainings and courses to develop our leadership skills. Yet, leadership is based on a set of different skills deeply wired into our genes. What if got less smart about it and relied on these skills more? It is easier than we'd think.\n\nStarted as an early member of Ustream in 2008, Csaba is now the operative leader of IBM Budapest Lab, and oversees their continued success within IBM.\n\nThis talk is from the 3rd Leadership Meetup Budapest Event that took place at Stretch Conference.\nStretch is a non-profit leadership and management conference that brings 500 attendees and 16 speakers from all around the world who want to build effective organizations since 2013. An international platform and community for leaders and managers to share stories, hands-on solutions and explore new trends and ideas to lead, fail, learn and stretch.
