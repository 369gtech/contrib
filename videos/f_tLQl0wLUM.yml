description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nThere are a lot of rules to remember for writing good C++. Which features to use? Which to avoid? The C++ Core Guidelines would be over 500 pages long if you were to try to print it! What happens if we swap this around and instead of Best Practices look at Code Smells. Coding decisions that should make you think twice and reconsider what you are doing.\n\nWe will ask:\n\n* What are the most important code smells?\n* Does it simplify the way we write code?\n— \nJason Turner\nDeveloper, Trainer, Speaker\nGreater Denver Area\n\nHost of C++Weekly https://www.youtube.com/c/JasonTurner-lefticus, Co-host of CppCast http://cppcast.com, Co-creator and maintainer of the embedded scripting language for C++, ChaiScript http://chaiscript.com, and author and curator of the forkable coding standards document http://cppbestpractices.com.\n\nI'm available for contracting and onsite training.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
