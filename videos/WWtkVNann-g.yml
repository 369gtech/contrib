description: "Speaker: \r\nDavid NÃ©grier (@david_negrier)\r\nCTO & Co-Founder, TheCodingMachine (https://www.thecodingmachine.com)\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will have a look at the GraphQL ecosystem from the standpoint of a PHP developer. We will review the options available to PHP developers and the different strategies used by PHP libraries to implement the GraphQL protocol. Finally, we will dive into [GraphQLite](https://graphqlite.thecodingmachine.io). This framework-agnostic library lets you build a schema simply by annotating your PHP code.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/GraphQLHongKong/events/270079237/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/C1EN0/"
