description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nIs there a way to automatically say how warped a pool table is, just by looking at a video of people playing? In this talk I will explain how I did that using OpenCV for pool balls tracking, and how more heuristic approaches may improve this model’s performance. I will also present a simple analysis of the effect of different levels of warp on players’ scores.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
