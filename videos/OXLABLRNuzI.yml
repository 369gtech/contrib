description: "This session introduces Apache Kafka, an event-driven open source streaming platform. Apache Kafka goes far beyond scalable, high volume messaging. In addition, you can leverage Kafka Connect for integration and the Kafka Streams API for building lightweight stream processing microservices in autonomous teams. The open source Confluent Platform adds further components such as a KSQL, Schema Registry, REST Proxy, Clients for different programming languages and Connectors for different technologies and databases. Live Demos included.\n\nKai Waehner works as Technology Evangelist at Confluent. Kai’s main area of expertise lies within the fields of Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning / Deep Learning, Messaging, Integration, Microservices, Stream Processing, Internet of Things and Blockchain. He is regular speaker at international conferences such as JavaOne, O’Reilly Software Architecture or ApacheCon, writes articles for professional journals, and shares his experiences with new technologies on his blog (www.kai-waehner.de/blog).
