description: "In this lecture Sagy Rozman - Team leader & Server guild master @ Wix -  will go over some advanced TDD essentials explaining how to evolve a maintainable design when doing TDD. \n\nWe will learn how to refactor code into 4 types of object categories and when should we use each category. \n\nWe will also discuss OO design styles like \"Tell Don't Ask\", and \"OO on the outside - functional on the inside\" and their implications on the types of tests we write. \n\nFinally we'll cover the Large and Small TDD cycles and how to apply the Inverted Ice-cream Cone principle to our tests. \n\nYou can continue to view - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sWXSvooQSg - for a bit of 'Hands on' insight."
