description: "Interested in learning about optimizing your Hadoop-based cluster? Ever wanted to know how to minimize and get the most out of your cluster? Or do you maybe just want to get started with Hadoop and find out what solution fits your needs? If so, don’t miss this session. The speakers—with their collective expertise in systems, networking, and Java performance—will help you understand Hadoop and walk you through their own study of Hadoop and optimizations to (hopefully) not only make your Hadoop-based cluster faster but also to show the design of a power-efficient minimal cluster.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMonica Beckwith\nMonica Beckwith is the Performance Architect at a cool startup called Servergy.
