description: "Talk #2: Open Source: What, Why and How\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nOpen-source software is everywhere around us; from Linux to Mozilla Firefox and 7-Zip, in many cases, the preferred application for a task is open-source, and much of the Internet today runs on open-source software. We discuss briefly what exactly open-source means, why it is important for the field of computing as a whole and its close ties to hacker culture, and how you can get started both in contributing to open-source and also open-sourcing your own software. In theprocess, we will cover the differences between the major categories of open-source software licenses, as well as some of the philosophy behind open-source software and also free software.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Profile\r\nHao Wei is a computer science undergraduate, and an NUS Hackers coreteam member.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/wpnb/"
