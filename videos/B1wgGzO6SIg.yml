description: "Join us for our next conference: https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\n\nTo build great teams you need to understand people. One of your core skills as a leader should be the ability to have effective conversations with your team, the rest of your organisation, and your customers.\n\nUnfortunately the ability to have an effective conversation is often seen as an innate skill that cannot be improved — and I see people making the same easily fixed mistakes again and again.\n\nThis session will help you get the most from your conversations. We’ll demonstrate common mistakes, and introduce you to simple proven techniques used by user researchers, therapists, salespeople, and others.\n\nYou’ll come away with a new way to look at conversations, along with practices you can use everywhere from retrospectives to interviewing job candidates.\n\nAbout Adrian Howard\n\nAdrian is passionate about building effective teams and great products.You'll find him working with companies of all sizes — combining team coaching & teaching with hands on UX & development work.\n\nYou'll often find him ranting in a corner of the bar about how agile, business and UX folk need to play nice together. Be kind and buy him whisky.\n\nAdrian is an active member of the Agile, Balanced Team & Lean UX communities, with more than 25 years experience working as a developer, UX practitioner, team lead & coach. He regularly teaches and speaks on integrating Lean, UX and Agile methods."
