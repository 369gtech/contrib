description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Paulina Sadowska, Allegro.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=176470\n\nUsing LeakCanary but still seeing a lot of OutOfMemoryError crash reports on Firebase? \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll show examples of non-trivial cases that I found in commercial projects with solutions that might help reduce memory consumption in your app (by almost a half!).\r\n\r\nI’ll explain why Glide is not always able to free all unused bitmaps and what problems you might encounter while using RecyclerView and ViewPager."
