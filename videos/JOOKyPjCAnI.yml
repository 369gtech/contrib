title: 'Achieving True Reliability & Disaster Recovery for Mission Critical Apps'

description: "Mission-critical applications of large enterprises don’t run in one datacenter, region, or cloud. They are distributed across different sites to ensure reliability and disaster recovery. Whether that is in multiple regions of a single cloud, across multiple clouds, different data centers, or all of the above depends on enterprise requirements and, in some cases, government regulations.\n\nAnd then there is self-healing with its multiple layers. Kubernetes itself ensures self-healing pods. But how do you ensure your applications, whose reliability depends on a self-healing infrastructure, cluster, pods, and Kubernetes itself, are truly reliable?\n\nDuring this webinar, Oleg will discuss requirements for a true multi-site implementation, the different self-healing layers, what Kubernetes does and doesn’t do (at least not by default), and what you should look out for to ensure true reliable applications."
