title: 'Tech Mesh 2012 - Developing and Integrating WebSharper Applications with Facebook - Adam Granicz'
language: English
recordingDate: 1375346835
description: "In this talk, I will present some of the work we are doing at IntelliFactory to enable creating mobile and web applications with F# that can interface with social networks such as Facebook. I will demonstrate how using various functional programming techniques one can develop a simple web application in F# that can be run in the browser, in a mobile app and as part of a Facebook page - all from the same code base. This work leverages our open source WebSharper framework, the main web and mobile development framework for F#. WebSharper provides powerful functional programming abstractions that enable modeling first-class, type-safe, composable web applications and user interfaces. It automates the translation of client-side F# code to JavaScript.\n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
