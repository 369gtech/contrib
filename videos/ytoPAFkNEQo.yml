description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 19 - http://bit.ly/37xc3Nr\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nCAPABILITY DRIVEN REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING\nby Natalia Chechina\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nEnhancing \nComplex \nSystems\n\nTALK LEVEL: Advanced\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this talk I would like to share findings and application of capability driven approach designed to enable informative system transformations.\n\nWhen planning for changes and improvements â€“ and scale in particular -- we need to consider not only code to be updated but the whole ecosystem: people, code, resources. The capability-driven approach is a systematic, analytical, and traceable approach to requirements engineering. The approach was validated in a number of industrial-size application, and is not limited to a particular area.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/natalia-chechina/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - NATALIA CHECHINA\nOne of the Core Authors of SD Erlang, Lecturer in Computing (Bournemouth University)\n\nNatalia Chechina is passionate about distributed systems, cooperative robotics, scalability, fault tolerance, and as a result is in love with Erlang. Her research investigates approaches and techniques to enable scaling and efficient performance on commodity hardware where components are loosely coupled, communication is significant, and any of the components may fail or disconnect at any time.\n\nMore on Natalia Chechina: https://codesync.global/speaker/natalia-chechina/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync. Code Mesh LDN 19 was sponsored by WhatsApp, Microsoft, Erlang Solutions, Juxt, aeternity, Duffel, and IOHK. \n\nCODE SYNC \nWebsite: www.codesync.global\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeMeshIO\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\nMail: info at codesync.global\n\n#CapabilityDriven #ComputerScience #Natalia Chechina"
