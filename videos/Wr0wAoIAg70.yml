description: 'The Java platform experiences an outburst of cool new features â€“ recently, local variable type inference, switch enhancements and multi-line string literals have been added to the Java language. Many other features are being in the pipeline and are actively worked on, like simple data carriers and pattern matching for the Java language, or value types for the Java virtual machine. These features are delivered quickly, thanks to the recently adopted, predictable, six-months schedule of major Java SE releases. This new release cadence means new Java platform features are delivered twice every year! In this talk, we will show a live demo of many of the recently added and newly developed features and improvements for the Java platform, including those mentioned above.'
