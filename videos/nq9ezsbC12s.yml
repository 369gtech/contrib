Learning and teaching programming\nby Francesco Cesarini & Simon Thompson\n\nABSTRACT\nIn our talk we’ll explore this hypothesis: in industry, you are learning a technology you will use to develop software, whereas in an academic setting, you are there to learn how to learn. Based on our experience of travelling in opposite directions: Francesco from industry to academia, and Simon from a theoretical to a more pragmatic approach, we’ll test the hypothesis, and, through evidence and anecdotes, show that in fact it is more complicated and diverse than we had first imagined.\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Francesco Cesarini\nCo-author of Designing for scalability with Erlang/OTP  \nFounder of Erlang Solutions Ltd. Francesco has used Erlang on a daily basis since 1995, starting as an intern at Ericsson’s computer science laboratory, the birthplace of Erlang. He moved on to Ericsson’s Erlang training and consulting arm working on the first release of OTP, applying it to turnkey solutions and flagship telecom applications. In 1999, soon after Erlang was released as open source, he founded Erlang Solutions, who have become the world leaders in Erlang based consulting, contracting, training and systems development. Francesco has worked in major Erlang based projects both within and outside Ericsson, and as Technical Director, has led the development and consulting teams at Erlang Solutions. He is the co-author of 'Erlang Programming' and 'Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP' both published by O'Reilly. Francesco is also a lecturer at the University of Oxford, and has participated in the Future Learn Erlang MOOC, O'Reilly and University of Kent online Master Classes and is a regular conference speaker and tutor.\n\nSimon Thompson\nResearcher, author and teacher \nSenior researcher for IOHK and professor at the University of Kent and ELTE, Budapest. His research has covered many aspects of functional programming, including verification, tool building and testing for Erlang, Haskell and OCaml. He is an author of books on type theory, Haskell and Erlang, and runs a MOOC on Erlang for FutureLearn. He is currently a senior research lead at IOHK, developing a DSL for financial contracts on blockchain.\n---\n\nLambda Days\nWebsite: https://www.lambdadays.org​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LambdaDays​"
