description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nAt the Urban Institute, our Data Science team works with social scientists every day to elevate the debate around social and economic policy. Webscraping in Python is one way we help provide evidence and support research. In this talk, I’ll walk through the projects we work on, the tools we’ve built, and the organizational policy we developed to support responsibly collected web data for research.\n\nSlides: https://t.co/MM2x14dJt7 \n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
