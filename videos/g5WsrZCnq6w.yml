description: "by Olivier CrÃªte\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/media_gstreamer_embedded.webm\n\n\nGStreamer is the de-facto multimedia framework used for embedded Linux systems. I will focus on recent improvements relevant to the embedded community. I'll explain our progress in the Video4Linux support, in particular support for encoders. I'll talk about various optimizations thas have been happening and how they can help embedded developer deliver better devices. Finally, I'll will look forward at the next releases. I'll also discuss the on-going effort to add embedded systems into GStreamer's Continuous Integration &amp; Automated Testing system. \n\nGStreamer is a highly versatile plugin-based multimedia framework that caters to a whole range of multimedia needs, whether desktop applications, streaming servers or multimedia middleware; embedded systems, desktops, or server farms. It is also cross-platform and works on Linux, *BSD, Solaris, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android. \n\nThis talks targets everyone who cares about Free and Open Source multimedia on embedded systems. GStreamer is the standard multimedia framework, not only on the Linux desktop, but most importantly, in embedded Linux products. \n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:30:00+01"
