description: "Markus Holtermann \n\n\n\nWe build services, potentially used by millions of people. And despite all the testing we do, some interactions with these services will not work out the way we hope. Wouldn’t it be great to reconstruct what let to a problem and analyze if the problem occurred at other times?\n\nIn this talk I want to look at structured logging. What are the benefits of it over plain text logging. How can it be used effectively?\n\nLogging, by itself, can help to trace bugs. Structured logging adds additional, post-logging capabilities when used correctly. Because log events are structured data, they can be analyzed much more efficiently and effectively than plain text log messages. Furthermore, one can even build graphs and diagrams to nicely visualize what’s happening in a service."
