Their free web site features a daily feed of quality news and opinions from mainstream and independent sources, based on ratings from their reviewers -- who rate the news based on quality, not just popularity. Their web review tools enable our members to evaluate fairness, evidence, sourcing and other core journalistic principles. NewsTrust rankings are based on a combination of professional and amateur evaluations, as well as computer algorithms. This presentation will include a discussion of best practices for helping people develop their news literacy skills, and becoming more discriminating news consumers.

April 30 - 3pm-4pm, Benghazi\n\nThis stimulating group discussion will explore best practices for helping people find good journalism online. As a group, we will start by evaluating a news article for fairness, sourcing, context and other core principles of journalism - using the NewsTrust review tools. We will then brainstorm ways we can encourage this type of critical thinking by using online news services such as Google News and NewsTrust.net.\n\nSome of the questions we'll discuss in this session include: \n\nwhat is good journalism? how can you tell it apart from misinformation?\nhow can we join forces online to share quality news with each other?\nhow can we encourage more citizens to grow their news literacy skills?\nhow can we improve NewsTrust.net to serve these goals?\nhow could we mash-up Google News and NewsTrust to bring this service to a broader audience?\n\nDuring the meeting, we will briefly introduce what we're doing at NewsTrust to address these questions-- and ask your thoughts on how to best expand this public service in combination with other popular news sites -- to help more citizens make informed decisions about their lives and governments.\n\nSession leaders: Fabrice Florin and Kaizar Campwala, NewsTrust.net\n\n*Maximum 30 participants.
