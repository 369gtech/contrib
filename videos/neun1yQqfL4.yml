title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2014 - Reactive Design & Language Paradigms - Dean Wampler'
language: English
recordingDate: 1421915866
description: "Can reactive designs be implemented in any programming language? Or, are some languages and programming paradigms better for building reactive systems? How do traditional design approaches, like Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and Domain-Driven Design (DDD), apply to reactive applications. The Reactive Manifesto strikes a balance between specifying the essential features for reactive systems and allowing implementation variations appropriate for each language and execution environment. We'll compare and contrast different techniques, like Reactive Streams, callbacks, Actors, Futures, and Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), and we'll see examples of how they are realized in various languages and toolkits. We'll understand their relative strengths and weaknesses, their similarities and differences, from which we'll draw lessons for building reactive applications more effectively.\n\nFor more on YOW!
