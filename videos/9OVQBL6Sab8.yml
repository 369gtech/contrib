language: English
recordingDate: 1598238077
description: "Cybersecurity vulnerabilities are ever present in IT and OT systems and the aerospace sector is not exempt from these findings. What should a researcher or vendor do when they find a vulnerability? This is a common question but can have many and variety complex answers. Showing how a few simple steps by each participant in the process of coordinated disclosure can decrease the stress of the efforts and result in trust among researchers and a more resilient aviation sector.\n\nMajor points will focus on:\n- What researchers should be doing in preparation of disclosure.\n- When a researcher should be looking for help with coordination.\n- Questions vendor should be asking in preparation of a public disclosure.\n- Each disclosure is a unique event and should be leveraged to build upon."
