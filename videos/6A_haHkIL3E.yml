title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Enforcing Your Code Of Conduct'
recordingDate: 1523509416
description: "Karl Popper\_way back\_in 1945\_coined the\_paradox of tolerance\_\"...\_tolerance\_requires us to tolerate even\_intolerance. Thus, if somebody is preaching or practising\_intolerance, the\_tolerant\_person cannot, in principle, speak out against what the\_intolerant\_person is doing, since speaking out against\_intolerance\_would itself be an act of\_intolerance... Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.\n\nOver the years of building the Drupal4Gov community I've seen the DrupalDrama and invariably, it has come from tolerance of the intolerable and our inability to communicate what does seem paradoxical.\n\nIt is with Popper in mind that Drupal4Gov writes, re-writes, communicates and enforces a Code of Conduct for all of our events. There have been a few violations and in this session, I will discuss how we communicate and enforce our Code of Conduct at all our events.\n\nThis session will provide lessons we have learned about\n\nReporting\nCommunicating\_\nTaking Action\nCommunicating again\nWe are a community, and we are stronger together, even when we have to address issues that make us all uncomfortable or worse."
