description: "Your application is living now in a container, yet is its private life a happy one?\n\nFind out that before your users do! If your application is not feeling so well, perhaps dealing with issues should be an inner container/Kubernetes affair while trying not to affect the availability of your software piece.\n\nIn this session will detail some implementation techniques for troubleshooting and debugging containerized applications in order to address some common problems like: permission issues, invalid parameters, volume mount errors, obsolete images, accessing running containers inside pods etc.\n\nAna-Maria Mihalceanu is a custom application development enthusiast, co-founder of Bucharest Software Craftsmanship Community and a constant adopter of challenging technical scenarios. Some of her older experiments are available on Dzone. In 2016, as tech passionate of cloud application development she achieved IBM Certified Application Developer - Cloud Platform v1. Since then, she has enriched her cloud expertise by learning and certifying as a Salesforce Developer and attained a better understanding on how to integrate different types of cloud offerings. Other passions? The knowledge hunt through reading and growing fashion skills through shopping."
