title: 'How to write Terraform code which will not scare you in half-year? (Anton Babenko, Norway) [RU]'
recordingDate: 1545239047
description: "Many of us know and use Terraform already but there are no best practices, and each team has to invent their solutions.\n\nAn infrastructure almost always starts with few resources and few developers. As time goes, it grows in all possible directions. You found your ways around grouping resources into Terraform modules, so what can go wrong? (famous last words)\n\nAfter three years of maintaining an open-source collection of Terraform AWS modules and long-term usage of Terraform in production, I want to share my experience and explain how to write Terraform code which will not scare you in half-yearâ€¦ (or when Terraform 1.0 is out)\n\nThis talk is best for people who have already read official documentation, use Terraform and have practical questions."
