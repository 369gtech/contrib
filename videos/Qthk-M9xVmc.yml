description: "IoT device manufacturers have no idea what's running on their devices -- they really don't.\nIn 2002 then-US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfield, brought public attention to a notion that information can be divided into three categories: known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns. As hackers, how can we apply this formulation to IoT vulnerabilities?\nThe known knowns: Vulnerabilities that have been explicitly discovered through scanning and testing. The known unknowns: Newly created software that has yet to undergo any application security testing. The unknown unknowns: Systems that the defender does not know about.\nThere is, in fact, a fourth dimension: unknown knowns, which comprise “that which we intentionally refuse to acknowledge that we know” or “do not like to know.”\nThe unknown knowns: Vulnerabilities that are known to exist, but that have not been associated with all the systems they actually affect.\nIn this talk, we report on IoT device vulnerability findings at massive scale, as a result of our firmware collection and analysis. For this research we have selected approximately 50k firmware images, representing over 7M files, 10k products, and 150 vendors, spanning many different architectures and operating systems. We will highlight some of the trends we've uncovered in supply chain vulnerabilities, and reveal specific examples of device backdoors, botnets, and vulnerabilities discovered in medical, home, and commercial device firmware."
