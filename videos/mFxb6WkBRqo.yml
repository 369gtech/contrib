description: "Stewart Bryson, Owner and Co-founder, Red Pill Analytics\n\nBjoern Rost, Principal Consultant, The Pythian Group Inc.\n\nApache Kafka is a massively scalable message queue that is being used at more and more places to connect more and more data sources. This presentation introduces Kafka from the perspective of a mere mortal DBA and shares the experience of (and challenges with) getting events from the database to Kafka and back, using various solutions and connectors. Demos show how to get started with Kafka, set up the kafka-connect-jdbc producer, poor manâ€™s change data capture with flashback query, and replication technologies to turn database logs into Kafka events."
