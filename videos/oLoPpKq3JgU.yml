recordingDate: 1403041134
description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeaker: Damien Dallimore\nHow much visibility do you really have into your Spring applications? How effectively are you capturing,harnessing and correlating the logs, metrics, & messages from your Spring applications that can be used to deliver this visibility ? What tools and techniques are you providing your Spring developers with to better create and utilize this mass of machine data ? In this session I'll answer these questions and show how Splunk can be used to not only provide historical and realtime visibility into your Spring applications , but also as a platform that developers can use to become more \"devops effective\" & easily create custom big data integrations and standalone solutions.I'll discuss and demonstrate many of Splunk's Java apps,frameworks and SDK and also cover the Spring Integration Adaptors for Splunk.\nLearn more about Spring Integration at http://www.spring.io/spring-integration"
