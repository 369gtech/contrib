description: 'Quantum computers are considered to be the holy grail of computer science. Many well-known IT giants including IBM, Google and Microsoft are competing for the release of the first commercially viable quantum computer. But even if quantum computers are here one day: What are we going to do with it? Can we finally solve NP-complete problems efficiently? Will Quantum Neural Networks help us to further optimize our machine learning models? Following quantum mechanics, this presentation will be both revealing and confusing at the same time. In addition to the question which challenges companies will be able to solve (and not solve) using quantum computers in the future, we will also discuss the practical solutions that Microsoft is currently working on, including the freely available Quantum Development Toolkit and the new language Q#.'
