language: English
recordingDate: 1576211892
description: "Network Behavior Anomaly Detection (NBAD) and User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) are heralded as machine learning fueled messiahs for finding advanced attacks. The data collection and processing methodologies of these approaches create a series of new exploitable vectors that can allow attackers to navigate network and systems undetected. In this session, methods for poisoning data, transforming calculations and preventing alerts will be examined. Proof of concept Python code will be demonstrated and made available. Approaches to harden against these attacks will also be discussed as well as outlining needed changes in detection standards.\n\nAbout Charles: WitFoo Chief Technology Officer - Charlesâ€™ dedication to maturing the craft of InfoSec is built on a diverse career path across the industry.
