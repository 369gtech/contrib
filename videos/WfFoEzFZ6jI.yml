description: "Treasure Hunts, Indoor Navigation and the Physical Web: Adventures in JavaScript and Bluetooth Beacons\n\nSpeaker: Shwetank Dixit (Opera)\n\nTalk of 20 minutes\n\nThe number of electronic devices we have around us is gigantic. We need a new interaction model to deal with all these devices, and having a separate native app for each device is impractical. The concept of the ‘Physical Web’ attempts to assign devices with their very own URL, which can be accessed by everyone using their web browser. This opens up a lot of possibilities for developers to create new and amazing applications, taking the user’s immediate physical presence into play. We’ll take a look at some use cases, including, but not limited to treasure hunts, contact sharing and indoor navigation. We’ll dive deep into how JavaScript can be used along with Bluetooth-LE and the Eddystone protocol to create great web apps, and understand the concepts at hand.\n\nAbout Shwetank Dixit:\n\nShwetank is PM of the Extensions platform in Opera as well as part of Opera's Developer Relations team. Over the years, he was worked to evangelize open web standards and cutting edge web technologies. He has written technical articles for a variety of publications and regularly talks at various developer conferences around the world.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.fossasia.org/schedule/#HW-06\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCcJ/"
