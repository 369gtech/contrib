description: "Keynote talk from Erlang User Conference 2016 http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/\nSlides here: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/fred-hebert\n\nIn this presentation, we take a look at a quick history of Erlang tooling and user experience for newcomers, and try to find reasons for why we are able to have so many fantastic tools but make it so hard to use them properly in a project, and attempt to propose solutions so the community can catch up with the rest of programming languages and provide a better experience for everyone."
