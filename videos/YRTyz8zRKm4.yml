description: "Bohatei: Flexible and Elastic DDoS Defense\n\nSeyed K. Fayaz, Yoshiaki Tobioka, and Vyas Sekar, Carnegie Mellon University; Michael Bailey, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nDDoS defense today relies on expensive and proprietary hardware appliances deployed at fixed locations. This introduces key limitations with respect to flexibility (e.g., complex routing to get traffic to these “chokepoints”) and elasticity in handling changing attack patterns. We observe an opportunity to address these limitations using new networking paradigms such as softwaredefined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV). Based on this observation, we design and implement Bohatei, a flexible and elastic DDoS defense system. In designing Bohatei, we address key challenges with respect to scalability, responsiveness, and adversary-resilience. We have implemented defenses for several DDoS attacks using Bohatei. Our evaluations show that Bohatei is scalable (handling 500 Gbps attacks), responsive (mitigating attacks within one minute), and resilient to dynamic adversaries.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/technical-sessions"
