Luckily for us, there are many options for leveraging the abstractions Kubernetes provides to create a better developer experience. Drawing on real-life experience with Kubernetes at three large corporations, we will work through practical examples of using Helm, Draft, custom controllers, and other Kubernetes tools to build example platforms for empowering developers. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrRa"
