title: 'Build Scalable APIs Using GraphQL and Serverless'
language: English
recordingDate: 1576015327
description: "Current trends in software and backend architecture have been evolving towards a more loosely coupled, more granular design. Most of you have heard of micro-service based architectures; the latest development in the past couple of years has been the advent of Serverless which allows you to run applications in very cost effective ephemeral services.\n\nThis is why it is important to have a proper gateway for your API that is able to route all your requests to the designated endpoint. GraphQL stands out in that respect as being a mature open sourced standard started at Facebook. Simona will demonstrate how to set up a GraphQL server locally, then explore the Query language and schema definitions it provides which allows you essentially query your mesh of services from a single point of entry.\n\n\nThe beauty is that it will notify you early if any of your endpoints is misbehaving or the schemas are out of date by erring out. Another advantage is that it allows for your API documentation to be a real time process and it will give you what one may call an API playground where you can query and explore your API. After exploring Serverless API, Simona will have a look at the more advanced features and standards around mutators and resolvers and then she will close by going all in, full Serverless and deploy a GraphQL server to a function in the cloud.\n\n\nEVENT:\n\n\nWeb Unleashed 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\n\n\nSimona Cotin\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish  fitcevents videos.\n\n\nCREDITS:\n\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
