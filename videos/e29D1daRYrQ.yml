description: 'We''ve see the future, and it''s looking modular. Corporations with large numbers of sites increasingly build complex reusable components, and we''ve seen frameworks emerge to organise these components on a page (e.g. Facebook''s React or FT''s Fruit Machine). At the same time, web standards are evolving to give us a native solution in the form of web components. How do we get there from here? And for smaller organisations and single developers, will there be a market in components? What standard will drive that?'
