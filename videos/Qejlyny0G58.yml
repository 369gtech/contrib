description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nKubeVirt Deep Dive: Virtualized GPU Workloads on KubeVirt - David Vossel, Red Hat & Vishesh Tanksale, NVIDIA \n\nKubeVirt is a Kubernetes extension that supports running traditional Virtual Machine workloads side by side with containers.  In this session we will explore the architecture behind KubeVirt and how NVIDIA is leveraging that architecture to power GPU workloads on Kubernetes. Using NVIDIA’s GPU workloads as a case study, we’ll provide a focused view on how host device passthrough is accomplished with KubeVirt as well as providing some performance metrics comparing KubeVirt to standalone KVM. You’ll come away with a high level understanding of what KubeVirt is capable of and the general design principles that drive the project. \n\nhttps://sched.co/VnjX"
