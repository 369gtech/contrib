description: "https://media.ccc.de/c/asg2017/ASG2017-103-getting_started_with_habitat\n\n\n\nHabitat is the best way for software developers to build, deploy, and manage modern applications - regardless of their expertise. Habitat provides a self-healing, self-configuring, stack-agnostic, frictionless abstraction for running applicationsâ€”regardless of their complexity on whatever infrastructure you prefer, from physical hardware and virtual machines to containers and everything in between. This session will show you how to build and run your own application. You will learn how scaffolding helps you quickly and easily package your application. Explore the build system used for generating Habitat artifacts. Run an application using the Habitat supervisor. This is the talk for anyone who's just learning about Habitat or those that are interested in seeing some of the newer features of the framework.\n\n\n\nJamie Winsor"
