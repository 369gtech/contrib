description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n\nServerless Data Streaming on AWS | Anahit Pogosova\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this talk, I will be using a real-life example of Finland’s national public broadcasting company, Yle, to talk about AWS Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Analytics and how they integrate with AWS Lambda. I will be talking about some of the “gotchas” that came along the way and lessons we learned while implementing a fully managed serverless architecture streaming over 0.5 TB of user interaction data per day and enabling diverse, near real-time content personalization.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshIO\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
