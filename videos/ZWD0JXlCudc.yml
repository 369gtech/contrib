recordingDate: 1557356927
description: "Feeling the pressure to keep up with customers and competitive demand in the market? Or the squeeze to deliver more business value at an increasingly fast pace?\r\n\r\nWhile the cloud, containerization, and microservices offer efficiency and scaling, many organizations arenâ€™t quite prepared for that additional complexity of cloud native technologies and demands.\r\n\r\nAI, automation and monitoring facilitate the management of complex modern delivery platforms and help build resiliency into your deployment to enable better performance. In the context of software delivery pipelines.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will review how AI, automation and monitoring can facilitate the management of complex modern delivery platforms and help build resiliency into your deployment to enable better performance while increasing feature velocity.  We will also review key performance indicators for gauging your agile practices and automation, key capabilities to strive to, and an implementation road map to get there."
