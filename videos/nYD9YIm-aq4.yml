description: "What's up everyone, this is Dariusz Kalbarczyk co-founder of NG Poland, JS Poland, AngularMaster.dev & WorkshopFest.dev.  Welcome back to the Angular Master Podcast.\n\nToday we've got a special guest from Warsaw Poland, Senior Frontend Developer @ BigPicture. Ladies and gentlemen... Kamil Gałek\n\nTechnical part:\nCan you tell us a few words about yourself, what do you do on a daily basis? Tell me more about BigPicture, what is it? Can you describe what is the biggest problem with huge apps? What is an incremental change approach? Are there any tools that can help with it? Are there any other challenges during work with that big app? Do you use the monorepo pattern?  If you do, why? Why not micro frontends? What kind of performance issues do you have to solve in BigPicture? How often do you have to work with performance? Is it possible to do some kind of automatic process that helps you with incremental changes on performance issues?\n\nNon-technical part:\nWhat kind of person is Kamil? How do you see yourself? Do you have some hints for us regarding self-organization? Do you have any favorite hobbies? What’s about your work/live balance? Do you have some hints for us? You will be a speaker at NG Poland 2021, what are you preparing for this year's edition?\n\n\nhttps://ng-poland.pl\n\nhttps://js-poland.pl\n\nhttps://angularmaster.dev\n\nhttps://workshopfest.dev"
