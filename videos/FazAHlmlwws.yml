description: "MobileOptimized 2019\nAndroid track\n\nRx in Multiplatformland - Sergey Ryabov\nReactive programming has firmly become one of the modern Android developer's tools. More and more teams apply fully reactive architectures for their apps utilizing MVI approach. This plays well for separating our OS-independent business logic from presentation layer. And while it can be implemented really nice using Kotlin, what if we want to expand this solid base further and don't repeat ourselves on every platform? What if we want to enter Multiplatformland?\nObviously, our best friend, RxJava, is not ready for that journey. But do we really have no alternatives? In this talk, we'll discuss how we can adapt Unidirectional Data Flow for a Kotlin multiplatform project and mutliplatform alternatives to RxJava, such as Flow from Kotlin team and Reaktive from Badoo, and speak about refactoring a MVI project to untie it from JVM and make it reusable on different platforms.\n\nGeneral Partner –Apalon (https://www.apalon.com/)\nVideo Partner – Flo (https://flo.health/)"
