description: "SQL is a powerful language. But there are still some queries it struggles with!\n\nIn this session we investigate some thorny problems:\n\n* Find all the fully connected subgraphs in a graph\n* Find the average (mean) of a node's children in a tree\n\nKey highlights include:\n\n01:15 - Finding all the fully connected subgraphs in a graph; introduce the problem\n07:00 - Walk through Live SQL solutions to this problem\n20:30 - Performance considerations for this: are graph technologies better suited?\n22:20 - Introduction to Oracle Spatial & Graph\n25:10 - Spatial & Graph architecture\n30:20 - Solutions could be slow; reframe the problem - perhaps looking for strongly connected components instead?\n41:30 - Find the hierarchical mean; introduce the problem\n45:30 - Walk through Live SQL solutions to this problem\n50:35 - Introduce PGQL (property graph query language) & sketch solutions with this\n55:10 - Further graph resources\n\nLive SQL scripts with setup & solutions:\n\nFully Connected \nSubgraphshttps://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/content_IOHVI2K4AYK6GOMOAVG93YBF6.html\n\nHierarchical Mean \n\nhttps://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/content_IOHVI2K5THQ213SZ6XOZPB402.html\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
