description: "App-AutoScaler: A Production Ready Cloud Foundry Service to Autoscale Your Cloud Native Applications - Ying Liu, IBM & Rohit Sharma, SAP\n\nDo you want to keep your application healthy no matter how the load changes? Do you want to just pay for the instances that you need? If you do, then App-Autoscaler will be your right choice.\n\nThe app Auto-Scaler is a Cloud Foundry extension (part of the Extensions PMC) project that automatically scales Cloud Foundry applications based on load. After two years of incubation, it has achieved a major milestone that we think it is ready for production.\n\nIn this talk, the project leads will introduce the key features that the service supports, and demonstrate how to use the command line tool to manage the scaling policies, monitoring the app performance, and query the scaling history. The second part of the talk will address the deployment aspect of the service, including BOSH release, pipeline automation using Concourse CI, and the efforts to containerize the service components so that it can be easily deployed on Kubernetes. The last part will share the current two production deployments in SAP cloud and IBM Cloud Enterprise Environment, as well as the feedback team gets and new features that is coming in the near future.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRym/app-autoscaler-a-production-ready-cloud-foundry-service-to-autoscale-your-cloud-native-applications-ying-liu-ibm-rohit-sharma-sap"
