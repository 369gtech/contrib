In 1999 he added support for CVS anonymous read-only repository access, inaugurating a new standard for access to development sources in open source projects. That same year, he wrote Open Source Development with CVS (published by Coriolis), now in its third edition via Paraglyph Press. He has also written Producing Open Source Software, from O'Reilly Media.\n\nFrom 2000-2006, he worked for CollabNet, Inc., managing the creation and development of Subversion, a open source version control system meant to replace CVS as the de facto standard among open source projects. After a brief stint at Google in 2006 as an Open Source Program Specialist, he left to become editor of QuestionCopyright.org. He also participates in various open source projects as a module maintainer, patch contributor, and documentation writer.\n\nThe O'Reilly author and Executive Director of copyright activist non-profit Question Copyright sits down for an interview at the 2014 O'Reilly Open Source Convention (OSCON).\n\nFind out more about OSCON: http://oscon.com\n\nDon't miss an upload!
