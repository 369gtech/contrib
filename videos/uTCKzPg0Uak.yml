title: 'When, Why, and How to CQRS'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502110706
description: "Most of today's enterprise applications are based on a create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data model that is simple and straightforward to implement. Another way to model applications is the command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) model that enables interesting solutions and use cases, especially with rising demands of scalability. In this session, learn the concept and benefits of CQRS; how it enables eventual consistency, domain-driven design, and event sourcing; and how to create a CQRS application. Discover whether CQRS can be used with Java EE technology, where the framework already offers solutions, and where it has to be extended. Much of this session focuses on live-coding and examining the details of both approaches.\n\nSpeaker: Sebastian Daschner"
