description: 'Clojure-Android initiative is a group of tools and people that aim to make Clojure a first-class language for Android development. It is almost four years old now, and during these years it evolved from being a small hobby project into an ecosystem that some companies use professionally. This talk will present the current state of Clojure-Android, explain why and in what areas Clojure is better than Java for Android development and give a brief overview of Clojure-Android tools and libraries. It will also feature Project Skummet, an optimizing Clojure compiler for both JVM and Android, that can make an application load 3-4 times faster. The talk will conclude with a short demo where a very simple Clojure-Android app is created step by step.'
