description: "Now and then, the standard JavaFX API controls are not enough and you need to create a customized control for a project. Luckily for you, JavaFX gives you multiple ways to create custom controls. This session shows you these various ways. It discusses how to create your own control by simply extending a existing control, extending a region, or creating a more library-style control with custom control, skin, behavior, and CSS file. It also shows how to avoid common pitfalls that can lead to performance problems and how to use the different techniques (such as CSS or pure code) to visualize a control.\n\n\nAuthor:\nGerrit Grunwald\nGerrit Grunwald is working as a software engineer at Canoo Engineering AG (Basel, Switzerland).
