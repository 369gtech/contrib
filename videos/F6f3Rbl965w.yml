description: "Loiane Groner\nBusiness Analyst / Developer\nCitibank\n\nWith RxJS and NgRx, Angular allows developers to fully use the power of reactivity in the front-end. But our back-end is still processing the good and old HTTP ajax request. The newest version of Spring also introduced the reactive architecture, and together with Angular, we can leverage reactive architectures in the front-end and now also on the back-end. In this session we will dive into the code of real-world examples, using the most modern technologies we have available in the industry for enterprise applications."
