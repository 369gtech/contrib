description: "Talk \nThis talk focuses on sampling from (truncated) high-dimensional log-concave densities. We present the most recent contributions to VolEsti which include algorithms for log-concave sampling via efficiently solving ODEs, in the R language.\n\nSpeaker \nMarios is a first-year Ph.D. student at the Computer and Information Science Department at Cornell University. He has received his undergraduate degree from the Electrical and Computer Engineering School at the National Technical University of Athens.\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
