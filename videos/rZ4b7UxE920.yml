description: "Don't you love making your app robust against network failures? Now imagine your app talking to a Wi-Fi connected product... Locally when your home or via a server when you’re not. You'll certainly love handling those network switches!... And what if your app doesn't just control one product, but multiple ones? Some locally, some remotely connected?... Or how about having multiple users controlling the same product at the same time?... It goes without question that building apps for connected products is incredibly challenging.\n\nFrom device discovery, over minimizing network requests to out of the box setup, this talk will cover it all. Packed with code examples, architecture suggestions and tons of best practices, you'll learn five years’ worth of hard earned experience. This won't just kick start your IoT app development skills, but it'll also teach you how to keep your app scalable and maintainable towards the future.\n\nStarting as early as 2011, Jeroen has built an impressive range of connected products: BT LE coffee machines, Wi-Fi speakers, connected air purifiers and even full blown connectivity libraries. Currently he is the main responsible for the official Philips Hue apps\n\nJeroen Mols has a real passion to build things, which continuously challenges him to experiment and learn. In the process refocussed his master in Electrical engineering to become an Android developer. Starting off with highly technical prototypes for Wi-Fi connected products, he build his own file sharing platform (Wi-FileTransfer). Currently he drives the innovation for the official Philips Hue Android and iOS apps.\n\nOne of a kind, never-been-done before apps are what he enjoys most and complex systems, highly technical apps have become his expertise. Currently Jeroen helped realize four huge connected products, various high profile apps (e.g. Nieuwsblad), actively contributes to open source and loves interacting with the Android community."
