language: English
recordingDate: 1518237351
description: "Data sketches is a collaboration between Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu, where we choose a topic and visualize it by the end of the month, and write about our process. In this talk, we will share our favorite months of data, sketches, and code: what made them our favorites, the mistakes we made along the way, and how we overcame them. We want to share our lessons learned to highlight that, though many of our visualizations had humble, ugly duckling beginnings, we were able to produce unique and compelling results through many (embarrassing) iterations.\n\nShirley is a freelance software engineer specializing in data visualization. She combines her love of art, math, and code into colorful, interactive data visualizations. She enjoys finding fun insights in data and weaving them into stories and exploratory tools for the reader to discover. Her work can be found at sxywu.com. \n\nNadieh is a graduated Astronomer, turned Data Scientist, turned self-taught Data Visualization Designer. After working for a consultancy & fintech companies where she discovered her passion for the visualization of data, she's now working as a freelancing data visualization designer under the name Visual Cinnamon.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 25 January 2018\n\nSource: https://2018.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
