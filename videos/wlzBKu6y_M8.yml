description: "Pivotal has a very aggressive release cycle, which creates a challenge to many development and operation teams. How do you know when there is something new published to Pivnet today?\n\nIn this session, we'll explore how Cerner treats PAS and PKS as a product through continuously delivered updates from Pivotal Network to production within 7â€“21 days. We'll explore how to leverage Pivotal Platform automation to not only track version updates but also configuration changes, all through GitOps flows. We'll then discuss how we've scaled this approach to multiple regions and IaaS to ensure that all foundations are leveraging consistent configuration and are on the same product versions striving for N- days from release on Pivnet.\n\nSpeaker: Bryan Kelly, Principal Software Engineer, Cerner Corporation\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: Coming Soon"
