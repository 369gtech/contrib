title: 'OAuth 2.0: A Standard Is Coming of Age'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784687
description: "OAuth is a widespread Web-based standard. Its purpose is to provide safe interapplication access to Web resources without having to reveal passwords or other credentials across the wire or to third-party applications. After discussions spanning two and a half years, version 2.0 of this standard was released in October 2012. Not being backward-compatible, it claims to have adopted the strengths of version 1.0 while fixing its weaknesses and filling in the missing pieces. This session gives you an introduction to OAuth 2.0. You will understand its concepts as well as its limitations and pitfalls. You will also learn how it feels to write your own OAuth 2.0-based application based on real-life code examples. Get ready for OAuth 2.0!\n\n\nAuthor:\nUwe Friedrichsen\nUwe Friedrichsen travels the IT world for many years.
