description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotgo.eu on November 6th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nGo is not a functional language. Not by a long shot. But that doesn't mean we can't leverage principles from the domain of functional programming when designing our Go programs.\n\nSam demonstrates this by laying out the foundational design principles behind dep, which is built atop concepts of memoization and immutability."
