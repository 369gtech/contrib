description: "The investment into both offensive and defensive technologies has grown dramatically in line with the Internet’s rise as the pivotal system for communications, critical infrastructure, and global finance. Security of the Internet, cloud data, and personal devices, once an afterthought, is now a significant expense and stress on governments, organisations, corporations and individuals. No one remains untouched. Yet, as the offensive scope spreads, so do the defensive barriers, leading to a technology arms race on various fronts. Where are we in that race? And, looking to the future, can we predict the near-term balance of power between defensive mitigation and offensive ingenuity?\n\n=== \n\nMark Dowd is an expert in application security, specializing primarily in low level Operating System flaws for desktop and mobile platforms.
