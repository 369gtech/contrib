description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nThis talk provides an introduction to scalameta (http://scalameta.org/) from the perspective of code generation. So far the documentation and discussion center mostly around using it for code analysis and transformation (scalafix), but code generation is an equally if not more important subject for metaprogramming. \n\nI will do a live demo walking to walk you through the basics, demonstrate how nice and composable the scalameta DSL is, and describe some more advanced use cases / ideas. It is still very early days for scalameta, so we'll have a discussion about other potential use cases and differences to old style macros which are still more widely used and known. \n\nI published scalameta-serialiser (https://github.com/mpollmeier/scalameta-serialiser), an easy to use library that generates functions to serialise and deserialise any case class, and wrote a blog post (http://www.michaelpollmeier.com/2016/12/01/scalameta-code-generation-tutorial) about code generation with scalameta."
