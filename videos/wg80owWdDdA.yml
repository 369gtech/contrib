description: "Processing in Storage Class Memory\n\nJoel Nider, Craig Mustard, Andrada Zoltan, and Alexandra Fedorova, University of British Columbia\n\nStorage and memory technologies are experiencing unprecedented transformation. Storage-class memory (SCM) delivers near-DRAM performance in non-volatile storage media and became commercially available in 2019. Unfortunately, software is not yet able to fully benefit from such high-performance storage. Processing-in-memory (PIM) aims to overcome the notorious memory wall; at the time of writing, hardware is close to being commercially available. This paper takes a position that PIM will become an integral part of future storage-class memories, so data processing can be performed in-storage, saving memory bandwidth and CPU cycles. Under that assumption, we identify typical data-processing tasks poised for in-storage processing, such as compression, encryption and format conversion. We present evidence supporting our assumption and present some feasibility experiments on new PIM hardware to show the potential.\n\nView the full HotStorage '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotstorage20/workshop-program"
