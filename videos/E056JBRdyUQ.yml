title: 'Building a Data Exchange with Spring Cloud Data Flow'

recordingDate: 1571262092
description: "A Data eXchange in the context of this talk is a system or group of applications that gets data from various sources, validates and transforms that data, and then disseminates the data to various consumers; maybe an evolution of the traditional ETL concept. \n\nThe Banking Technology team at Schwab is building a Data eXchange with Spring Cloud Data Flow based on a set of finite patterns for data consumption and dissemination that facilitate reuse, pattern-based architecture and implementations, industry standard protocols and security, and data governance. \n\nThe talk would be a case study in the distillation of the finite patterns on \"each side of the exchange\" and a discussion of the patterns and how they facilitate each of the items above. Additionally, we'll touch on the analysis we go through as we look at a data pipeline and discuss the merits of whether it fits better into the stream paradigm or the batch paradigm.\n\nSpeaker: Channing Jackson, Technical Director, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/building-a-data-exchange-with-spring-cloud-data-flow"
