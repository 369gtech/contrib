description: "During a classic cyber attack, one of the major offensive goals is to execute code remotely on valuable machines. The purpose of that code varies on the spectrum from information extraction to physical damage. As defenders, our goal is to detect and eliminate any malicious code activity, while hackers continuously find ways to bypass the most advanced detection mechanisms. It’s an endless cat-and-mouse game where new mitigations and features are continuously added to the endpoint protection solutions and even the OS itself in order to protect the users against newly discovered attack techniques. In this talk, we present a new approach for malicious code to bypass most of endpoint protection measures. Our approach covertly proxies the malicious code operations over the network, never deploying the actual malicious code on the victim side. We are going to execute code on an endpoint, without really storing the code on disk or loading it to memory. This technique potentially allows attackers to run malicious code on remote victims, in such a way that the code is undetected by the victim’s security solutions. We denote this technique as “malproxying”.\n\nHila Cohen\nHila Cohen is a passionate Security Researcher at XM Cyber, where she investigates new attack techniques and develops detection and mitigation capabilities.
