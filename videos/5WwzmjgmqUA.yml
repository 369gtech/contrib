Most of the already available frameworks like Java or PHP take care of one layer or a part of the application development.\n\n.NET provides application development in Object Oriented Programming model and support to develop Windows Application, Web Application and Web Services. .NET also allows the development of applications in different Layered/Tiered models to work on the main business logic rather then worrying about non-application code. Visual studio has many features like intellisense, intellitrace, intellitype, reference highlighting, code snippets and it makes the application development fast and increases the productivity of developers.\n\nFor more information, Please write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll free)"
