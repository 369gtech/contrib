description: 'A distributed systems practitioner and machine learning enthusiast, Ali currently is a solution architect building web-scale solutions. A performance and scalability junkie, he loves HTTP, API design, and business-modeling DDD-style. He is an author, blogger and OSS contributor and enjoys Natural Language Processing on Big Data and has published a couple papers in the field of Machine Vision. An interesting fact about him is that he started his career as a Medical Doctor and gave that up for the love of coding.'
