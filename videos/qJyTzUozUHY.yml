title: 'Managing User Roles - A TimCo Retail Manager Video'
language: English
recordingDate: 1571659208
description: "In this video, we are going to create a management system for adding and removing roles from users. We will use the built-in entity framework tools to make this happen. We will do a little work in the API, a little work in the class library, and finally, we will do some work in our view model and view for our user management user control.\n\nPatreon ($5/month or more gets source code for this course as it comes out): https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts, giveaways, and more):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nOne-off tutorials are awesome but they aren't the only thing you should be doing to learn C#. Another vital part of learning is learning how to put it all together. This interactive course is all about putting the pieces together. You can watch each video on its own or you can watch them in order and see a bigger picture. The choice is yours.\n\nThis course focuses on real-world development. As such, we are simulating that we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions on a brand new product, the TimCo Retail Manager. Just like in the real world, we are starting out with one set of requirements but know that over time they will change."
