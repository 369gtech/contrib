description: "WebSockets is a relatively new addition to W3C's HTTP specification that allows bidirectional, low-latency communication between browsers and web servers. This is particularly useful for applications that need to stream data to a browser. Most mainstream Java web servers/servlet containers don't yet support web sockets, and the few that do are either encumbered with APIs that make them hard to test or complicated to use.\n\nAslak Hellesøy is a Senior Software Engineer at DRW Trading in London (and the creator of Cucumber).\n\nFor more on YOW!
