title: 'Write code faster with fewer errors: is it possible? (Nikolay Chashnikov, Russia)'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1437577361
description: 'Developers want to make very few errors in their code and to spot them as early as possible: with the help of unit tests, or earlier, during compilation, or best of all, immediately after they typed something wrong in their IDE. This is what static code analyzers are for. Some of them are built-in, others need to be run separately, some check just about any code, the others require it to be annotated first, and there are tools that are a little bit of all. Do the ends justify the means? Is it even worth trying? What kind of errors can be spotted by static code analysis? How sure can we be if what an analyzer gives us is a real error or a false positive? This talk hopefully helps you answer these questions.'
