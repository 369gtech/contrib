description: "Nora Jones, Netflix\nAbstract: \nChaos Engineering is a helpful tool in understanding your system’s unknowns, but it is not the means to an end for achieving resilience. Instead, it helps to instill higher confidence in the ability to cope and be resilient in the face of inevitable failures.\n\nThis session will go over lessons learned and the impact to this confidence that Chaos Engineering has had at Netflix. As John Allspaw has said, \"Resilience is the story of the outage that didn’t happen.\" The session will cover those stories from Chaos vulnerabilities that the Netflix team has found, how we follow those vulnerabilities, and how Chaos Engineering is incorporated into our day-to-day culture.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
