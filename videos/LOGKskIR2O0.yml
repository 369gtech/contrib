description: "\"GREETINGS PROFESSOR FALKEN“ is the opening in a conversation between computer “Joshua” and its inventor, Dr. Stephen Falken, in the movie “War Games”, released in 1983. In the movie, artificial intelligence is used to enable man to machine conversation. Today, conversational interfaces are becoming reality in mobile computing, the next big thing in consumer and enterprise mobile application development. Paired with artificial intelligence, chatbots help to simplify the mobile communication between users and services. Like in human conversation, well chosen wordings allow users to do many common tasks. Another way to look at messengers and chatbots is as the mobile application being a chat session. This session explores chatbots from a business perspective and explores the positioning. You learn about the buzzwords and the types of chatbots you can build and use.\n\nJoe Huang\nProduct Manager\nOracle America, Inc."
