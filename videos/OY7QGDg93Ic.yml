title: 'Webinar: Decomposing Applications for Deployability and Scalability'
recordingDate: 1369089418
description: "Speaker: Chris Richardson\nSlides:http://plainoldobjects.com/presentations/decomposing-applications-for-deployability-and-scalability/springsource-webinar-may-2013/\nToday, there are several trends that are forcing application architectures to evolve. Users expect a rich, interactive and dynamic user experience on a wide variety of clients including mobile devices. Applications must be highly scalable, highly available and run on cloud environments. Organizations often want to frequently roll out updates, even multiple times a day. Consequently, it's no longer adequate to develop simple, monolithic web applications that serve up HTML to desktop browsers.\n\nIn this talk we describe the limitations of a monolithic architecture. You will learn how to use the scale cube to decompose your application into a set of narrowly focused, independently deployable back-end services and an HTML 5 client. We will also discuss the role of technologies such as Spring and AMQP brokers. You will learn how a modern PaaS such as Cloud Foundry simplifies the development and deployment of this style of application."
