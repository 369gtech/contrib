description: 'We’ll talk about how development methodology has changed in the Java world for the last 15 years. You will see examples of architectural mistakes, frequently involving buzzword heavy hyped technologies, like “NoSQL”, “Microservices” and so on. Often popular “innovative approaches” aren’t more than yet another viewpoint to a known technological business problem. If you are responsible for architectural decisions, the thought “Hey, I’ve seen something like it before!” is helpful and gives you a chance to avoid inventing the wheel from scratch once again.'
