Try the hands-on codelab at: https://goo.gl/I6RVxP\n\nIn 1998, Google set out to index the web and make content easily accessible and discoverable. Today mobile app adoption is growing rapidly and we’re bringing the same accessibility and discoverability to apps. App Indexing is the ability for Google to index apps just like websites. Deep links to your Android app appear in Google Search results so users can get to your native mobile experience quickly, landing exactly on the right content within the app.\n\nDrive return visits to your app\n\n￼￼For users who have your app installed, having deep links appear in search results will help drive organic traffic back to your app.\n\nRe-engage your users\n\nFor users who have viewed pages in your app, and later searches for similar content, you can use the App Indexing API to have deep links appear in search suggestions. For example, a user visits a pizza restaurant page in an app. The next time the user searches for pizza, a deep link will appear in search suggestions before seeing search results.\n\nCreate a seamless experience for your users \n\nApp indexing is flexible—you can direct search users to your app or website on a page by page basis. Moving from search results to apps is seamless, without any pop-ups or extra taps to slow users down.\n\nTo learn more, check out: https://goo.gl/NOAclz"
