It has a huge ecosystem that allows you to build out web apps with frameworks like react, desktop apps with electron and mobile apps with react native.\n\nFlutter is a framework created by google that allows you to create ios and android apps with one codebase.\n\nAffinity photo and designer allows you to composite amazing images and affinity designer helps you create beautiful illustrations, logos, and svgs for your websites and game assets.\n\nUnity is a game engine that uses C# to create cross platform 2d and 3d games with ease. This combined with blender gives you the power to create full fledged games.\n\nüõ¥ Follow me on:\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/developedbyed\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/developedbyed\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/developedbyed/\nGithub: https://github.com/developedbyed/\n\n#software #development"
