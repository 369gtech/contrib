title: 'ENHANCE! Upscaling Images with Neural Networks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1517340600
description: "When characters on a TV show “enhance!” a blurry image, you probably laugh and tell your friends that it’s impossible to do that in real life. But over the past year, deep learning research has actually made this kind of possible! How will you explain this to your friends!?\n\nIn this talk, you’ll get an intuitive introduction to generative adversarial networks, a new machine learning technique that’s surprisingly good at upscaling images. You’ll learn how these systems are inspired by human art forgers, and how you can use them to do other things like transform a horse into a zebra, convert a sentence into a photo, and so much more!\n\nGeoffrey builds software for public schools at Panorama Education. He enjoys learning about machine learning and playing the cello, and occassionally posts on his blog.\n\nEVENT:\n\n!!Con 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nGeoffrey Litt\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhUmSeko1ZE"
