recordingDate: 1506326708
description: "On a given project, data scientists can spend upwards of 80% of their time preparing, cleaning, and correcting data.\n\nIn this session, we will look at different data cleansing and preparation techniques using both SQL Server and R. We will investigate the concept of tidy data and see how we can use tools in both languages to simplify research and analysis of a small but realistic data set."
