title: 'Osvaldas Grigas - Simplicity. Demystified'
recordingDate: 1381907665
description: 'Simplicity enables agility. Yet most of the software written today is too complex for our limited ability to comprehend it, no matter how smart we think we are. Incapable of reasoning about our own code, we developers have a hard time changing it. Curiously, much of this complexity should not be there at all. The way to deal with it is to choose simpler tools and disentangle complex pieces it into simple, focused units. I will attempt to distill what ''simplicity'' really means, why it is hard to achieve, and what are some of the practical means to get there.'
