title: 'CON8342 - Improving the Performance of Your Java Application: Getting Beyond the Basics'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450130896
description: "Most Java applications are used in performance-critical situations where a small gain in responsiveness or throughput can mean success or failure. Typical applications have some low-hanging fruit, and improving this can lead to significant performance gains. The challenge is finding where the next gains will come from. This session demonstrates how Oracle Performance Analyzer can help identify performance opportunities in the most aggressively optimized applications and how you can drill down into the data to isolate and fix performance bottlenecks.\n\nSpeakers:\nMartin Itzkowitz, Senior Principal Software Engineer, Oracle\nMarty Itzkowitz received an A.B. degree from Columbia College and a Ph.D. in Chemistry and Physics from CalTech. After a post-doctoral fellowship at UC-Berkeley, he worked on operating systems and distributed services at LBL. He was head of Operating Systems at Vitesse Electronics, and then worked on operating system performance and performance tools at Sun Microsystems and then at Silicon Graphics. He returned to Sun in 1998 as project lead for the Sun Studio Performance Tools, and and continues as the lead for the Oracle Solaris Studio Performance Tools. His interests include operating system design and performance, multiprocessor performance, performance tools and scientific visualization. He is avid handball player and cook. He is married to Gloria Golden, a clinical psychologist in private practice. He has written and/or presented papers at various conferences, including: The Second International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems, Paris, 1981; AFUU Convention Unix 90, Paris, 1990; Supercomputing Debugging Workshop, Albuquerque, 1991; Workshop on Debugging and Performance Tuning for Parallel Computing Systems, Cape Cod, 1994; SuperComputing '96, Pittsburgh, 1996; WOMPAT 2000, San Diego 2000; SuperComputing '03, Phoenix, 2003; the OpenMP BOF at SuperComputing '06, Tampa, 2006; the CommunityOne conference San Francisco, 2009; and the 3rd Parallel Tools Workshop, Dresden, 2009; JavaONE, San Francisco, 2012; and JavaONE, San Franciso, 2013.\n\nYukon Maruyama, Studio Performance Tools, Oracle\nYukon Maruyama received a degree in electrical engineering from Stanford. He has worked on various software and hardware projects for Siemens AG, DIBA Inc., Sun Microsystems Laboratories, and the Oracle Studio Performance Tools group."
