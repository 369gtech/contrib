title: 'Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) in the enterprise: how Microsoft scales ML - BRK3012'
language: English
recordingDate: 1557353072
description: 'AI, machine learning, deep learning, and advanced analytics are being infused into every team and service at Microsoft—understanding customers and the business, operating services, and delivering innovative new features. But doing machine learning at the scale of Microsoft is challenging. ONNX (open neural network exchange format) has bridged the different model formats for ML frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, Pytorch, MXNet) to a single execution environment with the ONNX Runtime. Learn how Bing, Ads, Speech, Office, Cognitive Services, and others use frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Caffe for training and rely on ONNX Runtime for high performance inferencing. You’ll also learn how to use ONNX and ONNX Runtime in your AI application with Azure ML.'
