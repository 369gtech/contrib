title: 'NodeJS: Let It Crash!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1574111292
description: "One common issue I have found working on the field with customers adopting Node.js is that they don’t have visibility around what happens when their applications crash, also, on specific critical applications these unexpected crashes don’t allow the server to exit gracefully missing opportunities to store state for possible recovery actions. This talk presents a series of best practices on how to deal with `uncaughtExceptions` and `unhandledRejections` in a way that gives developers visibility on errors, post-mortem information and how to handle graceful shutdowns.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNearForm 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJulián Duque\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nNearForm provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish NearForm conference talks.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNearForm YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp2Tsbjd3P8itnBHUNHi82A"
