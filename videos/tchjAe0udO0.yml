However, in our day-to-day life, we often use RxJS alongside other libraries and patterns that make our life easier, but also distance us from pure Functional-Reactive Programming (FRP). What would an app that has been written completely in RxJS, and in-line with the principles of FRP, look like?\n\nIn this talk, we will examine such an app â€“ a Pomodoro productivity timer with start and pause functionality â€“ and use it to understand what truly functional-reactive code in JavaScript looks like, and what are the principles that underlie it.\n\nmore:\n- ðŸŽ¤ Like A Surgeon â€“ Dissecting a completely Functional-Reactive JavaScript app for the very first time ðŸŽ¶ (remember?)\n- repo: https://github.com/NettaB/reactive-pomodoro\n\n\nWhat are the key takeaways from this talk?\n- What are the main concepts of Functional-Reactive Programming, and how are they expressed in JavaScript/RxJS code?\n- What is the structure of an FRP app, and how is it different from how we usually write code?\n- How can we integrate more FRP concepts in our everyday code?\n\n\nNetta (@_bondit_) is the co-founder of Israelâ€™s largest community of women in R&D, and a senior JavaScript developer designing and building web apps. She often codes useless things out of sheer curiosity and stubbornness.\n\n\nSign up for our Newsletter to receive preview-links every other Thursday starting 2019, April 04: https://js-kongress.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9c3420f6b5269855b07422fb5&id=f490a69da5"
