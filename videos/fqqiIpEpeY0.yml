description: "The internet versus your sites: Taking action against internet volatility (sponsored by Oracle Dyn) Kyle York (Oracle Dyn)\n\nWhen the internet is not bombarding your DNS with bogus requests, it’s trying to execute malicious SQL queries and crawling your site with bots (some good, some bad). We’re experiencing a perfect storm of volatility: application complexity meets a complex and evolving threat landscape with increasing attack vectors (shadow IT, the IoT, bots, ransomware, DDoS for hire, etc.) coupled with a terrifying lack of infrastructure resilience.\n\nKyle York explores the scale, complexity, and volatility of the internet and the risk it poses to your applications and infrastructure. He then introduces a new resource to help the good guys better understand these threats and take action.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Oracle Dyn.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
