description: "DOES18 Las Vegas — When Christophe De Boeck moved from Ops to Dev in the Kiwibank, he expected more of my peers would be open to a different way of working. Unfortunately he noticed a lot of people did not want to own their own work, for various reasons. This presentation is a summary of what he did to make people feel more proud again.\n\nDiary of a Servant Leader - Kiwibank\n\nChristophe De Boeck, Technical Delivery Manager Core & Lending, Kiwibank Ltd.\n\nI am a 43 year old husband, father and IT professional, who enjoys hiking, scuba diving and stacking firewood. In my professional life I want to make my colleagues in IT better off by offering guidance and leadership in the domains of Lean IT and DevOps. I am a seasoned IT manager with demonstrated expertise in IT (service) management and IT governance. Founded on many years of traditional service management consultancy, I have re-oriented myself in the last four years towards a more nimble approach. I am passionate about helping people and pay a lot of attention to the human aspect for I am convinced that truly exceptional results can only be achieved through “positive drive” and “happiness at work”. Being an innovator by nature, I strongly believe in the power of gamification and visual management to make magic happen.\n\nDOES18 Las Vegas\nDOES 2018 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit 2018\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
