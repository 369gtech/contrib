language: English
recordingDate: 1449807299
description: "HTTP 1.1, the backbone of pretty much everything we’ve been using on the internet, has been around for more than 15 years. Recently the HTTP 2.0 specification has been completed, and gradually application servers will start supporting it. It does make you wonder, though: Why change something if it has been working for so long? This session examines the shortcomings of HTTP 1.1 and how 2.0 intends to address them. It also looks at what we need to know and how it’s going to affect our existing applications and future ones.\n\nSpeaker:\nHadi Hariri, Team Lead, JetBrains\nDeveloper and creator of many things OSS, his passions includes Web Development and Software Architecture. Has authored a couple of books, a few courses and has been speaking at industry events for nearly 15 years. Currently at JetBrains leading the Developer Advocacy team. Spends as much time as he can writing code."
