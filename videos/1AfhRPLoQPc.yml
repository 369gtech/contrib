description: "The Yin and Yang of DevOps Transformation\n\nSteve Brodie, CEO, Electric Cloud\n\nIn Chinese philosophy, Yin and Yang represent seemingly opposing, yet complementary, elements that  must work in harmony to maintain balance and effectiveness. In todayâ€™s software economy, DevOps requires traditionally conflicting teams (Dev and Ops) to work in harmony to maintain stability while delivering continuous change. But delving deeper, we discover other significant DevOps dualities that must interact in harmony to form an effective dynamic system. This session will explore these DevOps dualities and elements and highlight ways organizations can empower DevOps teams by providing the necessary mindset, culture and technologies they need to flourish and accelerate the rate of software innovation they deliver to the world.\n\nDOES16 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
