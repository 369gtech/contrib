description: "Notifications on the web help users receive important updates for a wide range of applications including messaging, calendars, email clients, ride sharing, social media and delivery services. Unfortunately, notifications are also used for abusive purposes. Browser notifications can be used to spam, mislead, show ads, phish or promote malware.\n\nThis year we've made major changes in Chrome to reduce abuse of notifications and create a safer, better web browsing experience for Chrome users.  This session reviews the recent changes, demo techniques for improving your website’s use of notifications and discuss the future of notifications on the web. \n\nRelated Playlist:\nDay 2 → https://goo.gle/WDL20Day2\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nSpeaker:\nPJ McLachlan\n\n#webdevLIVE #webnotifications"
