description: "Antonio Roberts will show you the ways artists are using code to make music and visuals and how to do it yourself! This live stream is a fundraiser for Coders of Colour, please donate if you are able! https://chuffed.org/project/coders-of-colour \n\nAntonio Roberts is an artist and curator based in Birmingham, UK, working primarily with video, code, and sound. He is critically engaged with the themes surrounding network culture and in his practice explores how technology continues to shape ideas of creation, ownership, and authorship. As a performing visual artist and musician he utilises live coding techniques to demystify technology and reveal its design decisions, limitations, and creative potential.\n\nHis work has been featured at galleries and festivals including databit.me (2012), Furtherfield (2013, 2019), Tate Britain (2014, 2015, 2020), Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art in Chicago (2014),Birmingham Open Media (2015-2016), Jerwood Arts (2016), Whitney Museum of American Art (2017), Green Man Festival (2017), Barbican (2018), Victoria and Albert Museum (2019), and the Czurles Nelson Gallery (2019).\n\nHe has curated exhibitions and projects including GLI.TC/H Birmingham (2011), Bring Your Own Beamer (2012, 2013), Stealth (2015), No Copyright Infringement Intended (2017), Copy Paste (2020), and Rules of Engagement (2020). He is part of a-n's Artist Council, is an Artist Advisor for Jerwood Arts and from 2014 - 2019 he was Curator at Vivid Projects where he produced the Black Hole Club artist development programme.\n\nWebsite: https://hellocatfood.com\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/hellocatfood\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hellocatfood\nYouTube: https://youtube.com/hellocatfood\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/hellocatfood\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/hellocatfood\nGithub: https://github.com/hellocatfood\n\nCoders of Colour (https://codersofcolour.org/) is an organisation aimed at \"Empowering and enabling young underrepresented people of colour to pursue a career in tech by providing them with a safe space for them to learn, explore and grow\". We do this primarily by running free coding workshops for young people.\n\nAt Coders of Colour, we have a very 'hands-on' approach to support. We believe that all our attendees should leave each of our events with the ability to do something new. We are also there for them if further support is required.\n\nSo far, we have supported over 750 young people through workshops and programmes. Out of the young people we have supported, some have continued studies in Computer Science up to undergraduate level and others have secured their first job in tech with our help and support.\n\nFrom 2020, we have committed to tackling the Digital Divide. We are currently donating spare laptops to young people in need of them across the UK. We have also had requests from people based in New Orleans (US), Morocco and Nigeria. If you're based in any of these cities/countries and have a spare laptop please reach out to us!\n\n🚂 Website: http://thecodingtrain.com/\n👾 Share Your Creation! https://thecodingtrain.com/Guides/community-contribution-guide.html\n🚩 Suggest Topics: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Topics\n💡 GitHub: https://github.com/CodingTrain\n💬 Discord: https://discord.gg/hPuGy2g\n💖 Membership: http://youtube.com/thecodingtrain/join\n🛒 Store: https://standard.tv/codingtrain\n📚 Books: https://www.amazon.com/shop/thecodingtrain\n🖋️ Twitter: https://twitter.com/thecodingtrain\n📸 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/the.coding.train/\n\n🎥 Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\n🎥 Intro to Programming: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA\n\n🔗 p5.js: https://p5js.org\n🔗 p5.js Web Editor: https://editor.p5js.org/\n🔗 Processing: https://processing.org\n\n📄 Code of Conduct: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Code-of-Conduct"
