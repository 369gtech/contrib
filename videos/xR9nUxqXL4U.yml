description: "by Jean-Pierre Rosen\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.125/ada_introduction.webm\n\n\nAn overview of the main features of the Ada language, with special emphasis on those features that make it especially attractive for free software development. Ada is a feature-rich language, but what really makes Ada stand-out is that the features are nicely integrated towards serving the goals of software engineering. If you prefer to spend your time on designing elegant solutions rather than on low-level debugging, if you think that software should not fail, if you like to build programs from readily available components that you can trust, you should really consider Ada! \n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 10:35:00+01"
