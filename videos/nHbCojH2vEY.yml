description: "ServerlessDays Paris - https://paris.serverlessdays.io/\n\nUsing the right messaging patterns between your services can help with durability, availability, and reducing custom code. This talk shows how to use AWS services to build robust messaging patterns into the foundation of your application architecture. Introduce fan-out, queuing, and decoupling between your services and combine multiple services to create powerful architectures that make your workloads scale.\n\n\nAbout Julian\n\nI help developers and builders learn about and love how serverless technologies can transform the way they build and run applications. I was an infrastructure architect and manager in global enterprises and start-ups for more than 25 years before going all in on serverless at AWS."
