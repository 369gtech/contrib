description: "If you ever talked to a functional programmer, you know that they'll use functional ideas in any language they use. As a long-term functional programmer, this is exactly what I did when working on a recent project using TypeScript. In this talk, I will reflect on the good and bad of using functional programming ideas in TypeScript.\n\nContrary to the title, this talk is suitable for anyone interested in TypeScript or functional programming. I will discuss a number of powerful functional ideas and show how they look and work in TypeScript. You'll see which of those fit well with the language and which of those are better left for more functional programming languages like F#. In other words, this talk is about what makes functional programmers coming from F# happy about TypeScript and what makes them sad.\n\n\nCheck out our links below, and don't miss our next conference!\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndccopenhagen.com/"
