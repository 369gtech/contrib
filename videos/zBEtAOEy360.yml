Developing consumer applications on computing platforms have their own magical experience for the end users. Consumer facing software companies always attempt to put their best foot forward when they develop an application for these platforms. However, the biggest challenge in application development only begins after companies roll out the first version of the application.

In this talk I will share some of our challenges and successes behind one such detection system, that helped find problems outside the application layer but still adversely impacted the user experience."
