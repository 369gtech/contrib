description: 'Elixir Umbrella applications allow you to break down complex systems into smaller sub components. But are these applications a good fit for microservices or do they end up being a more complex monolith? Learn more about them in this talk. After an introduction to Umbrella applications, an example project is used to demonstrate common challenges with Umbrella projects and how to work around them. Different deployment options are then explored to show how little change is required to deploy an Umbrella in a distributed manner. This talk gives a practical understanding of the pros and cons of using Umbrella applications as well as an understanding on how flexible they are when it comes to deployment.'
