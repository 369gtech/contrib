description: "When to Choose Cloud Foundry Over Kubernetes? - Julian Fischer, anynines\n\nKubernetes became ubiquitous which comes with the risk well phrased in the proverb: if you got a hammer, everything you see is a nail. In this talk you'll examine where Cloud Foundry has a strong benefit over Kubernetes: The right tool for the right job. You will learn how factors such as the structure of an organization and the nature of the workload are key to make an informed decision. This will also include a brief comparison of the applicability of both the classic CF-for-VMs and CF-for-K8s stack. At the end of the talk you will know where CloudFoundry provides clear advantages over Kubernetes and which CF stack is right for you.\n\nTo learn more about Cloud Foundry, The Proven Developer Experience For Kubernetes click here: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
