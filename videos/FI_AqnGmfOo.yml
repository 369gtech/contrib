description: "Speaker: Eduards Sizovs\n\nTalk: Beyond Software Craftsmanship: From Dev to Architect\n\nAbstract: \n\nJohnny is a full-stack developer with 5+ years of experience under the belt, M.Sc degree and ‘get sh%t done fast’ mentality. Although Johnny possesses exceptional technical skills, Milton – his manager – doesn’t promote Johnny, because Johnny lacks some important skills. What skills Milton is talking about? Together with Johnny, you will walk the thorny road to his remarkable career as a Chief Software Architect; the road full of struggles, discoveries, and actions that will turn your career around."
