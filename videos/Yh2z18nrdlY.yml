description: "Deep Dive: Kubernetes SIG Multicluster - Irfan Ur Rehman, Huawei & Paul Morie, Red Hat \n\nMulti-cluster Federation Deep Dive: Multi-cluster Federation is an API and control plane that actively manages multiple Kubernetes clusters and applications in those clusters. Federation v1's API mirrored the Kubernetes API directly, using annotations to achieve necessary multi-cluster extensions. Federation v2.0, now in Alpha, has it's own Multi-cluster aware API, and a more and a more customizable control plane composed of lower level re-usable building blocks. In this deep dive we will discuss the existing API and control plane architecture, and it's primary target use cases. But most of all we would like to solicit input on what other use potential cases exist, and what additions or amendments might be required to make Multicluster Federation even more generally useful for your real-world stuff. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grds"
