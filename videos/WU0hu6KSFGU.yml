description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia February 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nYury Niño - Site Reliability Engineer & Chaos Engineer Advocate\n\nABSTRACT\nChaos Engineering is becoming common practice for development teams. Many companies and technology experts have done a great job promoting a premise: \"Reliability\" is the most important feature in software applications. \"Resilience\" combined with \"Chaos Engineering\" is key for reaching this. However, the complete equation requires observability. Chaos Engineering and Resilience without observability [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:25 Agenda\n02:21 Example: US flight 1549\n03:22 Chaos foundations\n05:53 Observability\n12:04 Reliability & resilience\n16:17 Chaos engineering\n22:56 Outro\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/february-2021/sessions/1719/combining-chaos-observability-and-resilience-to-get-chaos-engineering-making-chaos-engineering-boring-debunking-myths-hampering-adoption\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ChaosEngineering #Resilience #Observability #BuildingResilience #Resiliency #Programming #SRE #Programming #GameDay #DigitalTransformation #Reliability\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
