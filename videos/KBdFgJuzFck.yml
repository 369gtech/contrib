title: 'Home Alone: How working for a fully remote company actually works - David Boike'
recordingDate: 1528730927
description: "A pair of bumbling burglars has never caused me any trouble, but working from home for a fully distributed company (where there is no office, anywhere) is not without its perils.\n\nI'll describe what it's like to work for Particular Software, a fully distributed company that makes NServiceBus, a popular .NET Service Bus framework. We have no office, no managers, and only get to see each other in person once per year. Despite all that, we build and support an amazing product, and I'll tell you how we do it, including how we're organized, our processes, and the tools we use."
