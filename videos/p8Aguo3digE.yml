title: 'Michael Zick: How to Handle Difficult People at Work | February 2021'
language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1616449066
description: "I'd like to talk about handling difficult people and effective communication at work. Having been on many different teams with a variety of characters, I've learned a lot about emotional triggers, setting boundaries, and personality types.\n\nAs a former frontend engineer, I know the ins and outs of working in tech, and would like to be a resource for anyone who's struggling at work or life in general. I specialize in assertiveness training and overcoming toxic beliefs that keep us stuck."
