description: "Om nom nom nom\nHave you ever needed an easily customisable dashboard? Or needed to visualise data in a browser but was overwhelmed by d3.js? This talk will cover basics of React and Om, some data visualisation libraries and techniques, ways to handle live data and combining all that into an easily customisable dashboard. Expect demos, code and maybe, just maybe, om nom nom nom cookies.\n\nAnna is a Data Engineer at Mastodon C. She crunches big data with Clojure, Hadoop and Cassandra and visualises it with open source technology. She's been a developer on a variety of projects ranging from banking to robotics. When she's not programming, she's either hiking, reading sci-fi or looking for the next thing to explore."
