description: "Securing Your Cloud from Criminals—A View from SophosLabs on Securing Linux Assets\n\nChester Wisniewski, Sophos\n\nCriminals have embraced the cloud to a greater degree than even private enterprise. What's the best cloud for a crook? Yours. This talk will take a look at how criminals are leveraging purloined Linux and Unix assets to build out their infrastructure and some simple methods to thwart their efforts.\n\nSophosLabs' primary goal is publishing threat information to protect our customers. This requires us to monitor millions of malicious attacks each day providing a large data set to mine for information.\n\nOur experience shows that more than 80% attacks originate from compromised assets, the majority of which are running a Linux-based operating system. Administrators of Linux systems can step up and have a serious impact on reducing the criminal footprint and making our friends, families and organizations safer.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
