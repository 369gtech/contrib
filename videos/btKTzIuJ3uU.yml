title: 'Saving the DoD $800M: How Portfolio Management is the Missing Link Between Agile and Waterfall'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327211
description: "Throughout the DoD, many branches of the military are starting to see the value in agile software delivery as a way to deliver capabilities faster and cheaper. Yet despite the favor for agile, many are still skeptical that agile is only for one-off \"cute\" apps and cannot be successfully applied to complex war-fighting capabilities that make the need for waterfall processes feel inevitable.\n \n Is it possible to bridge the gap between agile's iterative approach to software delivery and waterfall's rigor in planning and requirements? Can teams focused on \"narrow\" user value delivery transition into collaborating on an integrated system?\n \n Join us for a case study on how one program within the US Space Force implemented portfolio management as a strategy to iteratively deliver an integrated weapons system. Learn how we went from five teams delivering software independently to a cohesive portfolio of products all aligned towards a unified vision.\n\nJackie Ho, Staff Product Designer at VMware\nOscar Chacon, Portfolio PM at United States Space Force"
