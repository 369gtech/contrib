description: "BPM + Cloud Foundry One Year On - James Myers & Aram Price, Pivotal\n\nSince BPM debuted last year, nearly all of the release in cf-deployment are converting to use BPM, and v1.0 is available. This talk will discuss BPM’s evolution over the past year, why you should convert your release to use BPM, and some cases where BPM might not (yet) make sense. James and Aram will discuss some of the challenges and tradeoffs of adapting BPM for the releases which have been able to adopt it. They will also discuss where we might go in the future so that we more BOSH releases can adopt BPM.\n\nThis talk will also look at what future benefits BPM enables for the release-author community. Examples we hope to cover:\n - BPM’s declarative config which enables static analysis of job-process requirements, and could be transliterated into other container scheduling platform formats (ex: K8s pod spec).\n - Bring consistency to the Operator job-process debugging experience.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/GEWK/bpm-cloud-foundry-one-year-on-james-myers-aram-price-pivotal"
