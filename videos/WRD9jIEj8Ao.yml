description: 'http://baratunde.com/howtobeblack Baratunde Thurston is a politically-active, technology-loving comedian from the future. He co-founded the black political blog, Jack and Jill Politics and serves as Director of Digital for The Onion. He''s known for a brand of digital performance art that includes personifying the swine flu on Twitter and treating a Foursquare mayoral campaign with the earnestness of real politics. In this Web 2.0 talk, Baratunde shares the story of how he wrote his new book, "How To Be Black" (Harper, Feb 2012) using digital interactive lessons he''s learned over the years. Specific examples include "live-writing" several chapters by sharing his screen publicly during the writing process and using Facebook to beta test certain chapters.'
