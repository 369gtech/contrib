description: "Rafael Benevides\nDirector of Developer Experience\nRed Hat\n\nThe JVM knows how to auto-tune itself to achieve the best possible performance in the environment it’s running. So far, the environment has been a single physical or virtual machine. But now you have containers, and it changes everything: you need to know how containers manages their own resources, and you need to apply this knowledge when running and optimizing your JVM running in a container. Want to get ready to really run Java on docker in production? Then come to this session to learn a lot about JVM and containers and avoid the highway to debugging hell. You’ll get simple tips & tricks that will save you hundreds of hours of debugging & logging to figure out what is wrong with your containers."
