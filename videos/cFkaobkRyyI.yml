language: English
recordingDate: 1573862525
description: "Surveillance detection routes are a daily occurrence for clandestine operatives and agents all over the world. These mentally taxing counter-surveillance measures often mean the difference between life and death. Surveillance Detection Scout hopes to ease that burden. Scout currently supports Tesla Models S, 3 and X, running license plate recognition on 3 camera feeds to alert you in real time if you're being followed. When you park, Scout remains vigilant, implementing familiar face detection as well. By combining timestamped vehicle location data & video, computer vision and an intuitive web interface, it becomes apparent that Scout has just as many offensive as defensive applications. Over time, SDS captures and reports on observed patterns of life, allowing you to quickly gain an overview of your surroundings (or your target) with minimal effort. Whether you're conducting or evading surveillance, Scout has got your 6.\n\nTruman Kain\nTruman Kain has a background in design and marketing, which he utilized to develop Dragnet, an intuitive, AI-powered social engineering framework released at DEF CON 26. This year, he has combined his machine learning and design experience to make Surveillance Detection Scout look and feel as OEM as possible.\n\nTwitter: @trumankain"
