description: "We all want to stay ahead of the curve – after all, that’s what you go to a conference for. But have you ever considered how being ahead of the curve might be dangerous?\n\nUsing a new language before you understand it, putting technology into production so you can learn it, abandoning “old practices” before you’ve got the benefit from them… These things are common practice, under the guise of Progress and Keeping Up To Date.\n\nBut while we shouldn’t be running around like headless chickens chasing the next Shiny New Thing, we do need to see to our Continuous Learning and, of course, we should Embrace Change.\n\nHow do we balance these two extremes? And how do we see to our own growth and learning as techies while meeting the needs of our project, team and organisation?\n\n\nAbout Trisha Gee\n\nTrisha has expertise in Java high-performance systems, is passionate about community in tech, and dabbles with Open Source development."
