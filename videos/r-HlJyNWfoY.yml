description: "Spammy traffic consumes resources and degrades the user experience. This has long been a problem on desktop and is even worse on mobile. CAPTCHAs have traditionally been the first line of defense for fighting automated spam and abuse. However, as spammers have grown more sophisticated, the increased complexity of CAPTCHAs can be frustrating for end users, resulting in increased drop-offs.\n\nGoogleâ€™s reCAPTCHA API has been on a mission to change this by providing an effective spam & abuse fighting tool with minimal user interaction. In this talk, we will introduce an updated UI and discuss a broad set of reCAPTCHA use cases. We give a sneak peek into the machinery behind our spam and abuse fighting, and end with a demo of how easy it is to integrate reCAPTCHA into your site or app.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
