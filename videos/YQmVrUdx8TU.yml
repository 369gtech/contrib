description: "f(by) 2020\nScala track\n\nTaste the difference with Scala 3: Migrating the ecosystem and more - Jamie Thompson @bishabosha\n\nScala 3, also known as Dotty, is the next version of the Scala programming language, bringing many new features, reducing boilerplate and removing warts.\nIn this talk, Jamie will show you work being done at the Scala Center to help the transition from Scala 2 to 3: how we are utilising the TASTy interchange format to bridge the gap between their two compilers to ensure binary compatibility under separate compilation; how you can gradually migrate your Scala 2 projects by depending on libraries that have already transitioned to Scala 3; and finally the steps you can take to migrate your own code to the new compiler.\n\nGeneral Partner - Evolution Gaming https://eng.evolutiongaming.com/"
