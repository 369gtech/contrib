title: 'Agile Development at Scale With Autonomous teams - Thomas Malt & Jan Henrik Gundelsby'
recordingDate: 1538401760
description: "How do we successfully build scalable agile organisations? How do we coordinate effectively across autonomous teams in a growing technology organisation? How do we avoid creating a large bureaucracy with time consuming, rigid, processes?\nThrough the years multiple frameworks for scaling agile have been developed. The speakers have independently of each other been through these processes several times, with quite similar experiences, at Oslo kommune, Fronter, NRK and the consulting industry.\n\nIn this talk the speakers aim to share some of their experiences and observations from the last 10 - 15 years. On how we can create self organising cross functional product development teams, and an organisation where people continuously learn, adapt and innovate. They will try to distill some advice and best practices on what works and what doesnâ€™t, based on experience and known research.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
