description: "Cracks in the Foundation: Operating Cloud Foundry in the Real World - Josh Ghiloni, Pivotal \n\nThere are dozens of talks from various conferences over the years that talk about how successful Cloud Foundry has made their business.

Stephanie has seen her fair share of bumps as a Technology Manager and Product Manager for a Cloud Foundry platform team as they deploy massive foundations, and in his role as a Solutions Architect with Pivotal, Josh has seen common and uncommon problems that plague customers from all industry verticals. In this talk, they will present 10 problems they (and maybe you too!) have encountered, and how they can be avoided, mitigated, or solved altogether. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
