Having heard that machine learning plays an important role, you may be wondering what all the fuss is about. How does it work? How can you get started using it yourself?\n\nThis session serves as an introduction to machine learning, based on a practical use case. We will be utilizing Spotify's API to extract features from music, before we visualize and cluster the data, and also train classifiers for discovering new music. We will give you an introduction to several algorithms used for clustering and classification of data. In addition to digging into some traditional machine learning algorithms, such as K-means and SVM, we will also take a look at artificial neural networks, which in recent years have produced remarkable results in various fields. For all of this, we will be using frameworks like Keras and Sklearn.\n\nIf machine learning has been a mysterious domain to you, this session will most likely leave you with a greater understanding of the process and aid you in how to set up projects of your own.\n\nJoakim Lehn From Knowit\nJoakim is a technical team lead with the Nordic consultancy Knowit, currently digging deep into modernizing the sales and ticketing solutions for rail operators in Norway as well as creating a national travel planning service across all public transport modes. He is passionate about the possibilities of AI/machine learning and building an awesome team culture with his colleagues.\n\nManu Gopinathan From Knowit\nManu is a machine learning enthusiast who works as a software developer for Knowit, a Nordic consultancy company. Currently, he is a part of a team tasked with building a new sales and ticketing solution for public transportation in Norway. During his MSc studies at UCSB and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, he specialized in artificial intelligence, with his thesis doing an extensive study on gender identification of authors using deep learning and natural language processing.\n\nMalte Loller-Andersen  From Knowit\nMalte is a passionate software engineer and IT consultant for the Nordic consultancy Knowit. He spends his time writing code and is currently in charge of Knowits internal Artificial Intelligence group, The Artificial Chapter. Here, he manages summits and workshops, gives presentations and talks about artificial intelligence."
