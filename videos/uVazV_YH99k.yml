language: English
recordingDate: 1620833777
description: "Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications pose a new challenge for infrastructure and development teams. Classic monitoring tools fail to capture relevant data in a timely fashion. Disconnected tools make it very difficult to follow up on issues through the whole stack as data and tool know-how is captured in slios. This is where observability tools shine. We take a look at the Why and How of Tanzu Observability in this session, to solve these needs.\n\nVMware Tanzu Up Close session presented by Lutz Lange\n\nLearn more about VMware Tanzu here: http://bit.ly/3bP6mi2​​​ \n\nGet VMware Tanzu news and updates here: http://bit.ly/3lh54PE"
