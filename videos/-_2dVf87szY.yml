description: "by Juliette Tisseyre\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2213/ml_on_code_automatic_refactoring.webm\n\n\nEvery code base needs to be modernised at some point, either to reduce the technical debt or to migrate to another language. In such complex and challenging projects, automation is a key point to reduce the workload of low added-value tasks as monotonous refactoring or redundant paradigm translation. \n\nTo do so with our clients, struggled with deeply in-debt code bases, we built an in-house toolkit to support the developers in modernisation projects from detection to transformation. We created a language-agnostic model to represent code and several engines based on it: code smells and custom pattern detection, quality metrics, automatic refactoring, code generation… With this talk I would like to share what are the steps to build a toolkit to automate code’s transformation and share a few practical use cases. \n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:10:00+01"
