description: "Is a single DNS vendor enough? Discussion about complexities of multi-vendor deployment, and why you should do it anyway.\nby Petr Špa?ek\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.601/dns_is_single_vendor_enough.webm\n\n\nWhy is using a single DNS implementation not enough? Discussion about complexities of multi-vendor deployment, and why you should use multi-vendor setup anyway. In theory all the DNS server implementations do basically the same thing, so why bother with deploying and maintaining software from more than vendor? \n\nIn this talk we will look at consequences of having single DNS implementation, and give basic recommendations on DNS diversity. \n\nAfter an introductory presentation we will together discuss complexities of multi-vendor deployments, and try to gather ideas for common configuration interface which could help people to deploy software from multiple vendors. \n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 14:00:00+01"
