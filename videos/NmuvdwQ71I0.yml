title: 'Fault Tree Analysis Applied to Apache Flink'
recordingDate: 1635787801
description: "As Flink's adoption grows, Flink applications wind up in the critical path for many companies. Due to how important Flink becomes, questions\narise about whether applications will meet specific reliability guarantees. For example, can Flink maintain a data freshness guarantee lower than 5 minutes? This session dives into how an age-old reliability technique can be applied to guide Flink platform and application developers who want to tune and monitor their Flink-based solutions and avoid over-promising and under-delivering for their users. We present a calculator and step-by-step guide that we came up with to show what can be tuned to improve Flink application reliability. Throughout the session, we visualize failure probabilities by growing a Fault Tree in order to systematically find strengths and weaknesses with Flink.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n2:08 Critical Use Cases\n5:27 Introduction to Fault Tree Analysis\n10:58 Flink Fault Trees\n24:56 SLO Calculator\n30:40 Summary"
