description: "Machine Learning is often discussed in the context of data science, but little attention is given to the complexities of engineering production ready ML systems. This talk will explore some of the important challenges and provide advice on solutions to these problems.\n\nCameron has been working with Big Data for several years and been involved with machine learning for even longer. He loves the practical application of data engineering and machine learning to solve real world problems. He also really enjoy functional programming (currently in Scala).\n\nFor more on YOW!
