description: "Raffaele Rialdi\nVevy Europe\n\nWriting IoT applications with NetCore 2 on the Raspberry PI\n\nNetCore is the new cross-platform flavor of the .NET Framework which can smoothly run on Linux machines and ARM devices too.\nDuring this session we will dig into this exciting world to see what is necessary to build applications leveraging the power of sensors and peripherals the Raspberry PI offers. In particular we will see a real-life scenario leveraging an ASP.NET Core application with database and authentication whose same codebase can run both on Windows and the PI.\nDuring the session I will also show a tool that makes the development lifecycle much easier by allowing the continuous deployment on the device.\n\nhttps://codefest.ru/"
