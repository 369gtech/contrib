description: "Are you tired of little toy examples for individual HTML5/JS features? I am. So I set out to create a single app that weaves together all the most powerful JavaScript features of HTML5 (and friends!). What I built is an real-time, multi-player, cooperative/competitive game called \"We Puzzle It!\". This talk will show the code and motivations behind the game, illustrating practical uses for the various advanced HTML5 JavaScript APIs. \n\nTopics include:\nWeb sockets\nWeb workers\nCanvas\nDrag & Drop\nLocal file access\nAudio/Video\nHistory\nLocalstorage/sessionstorage\n\n** Check out more educational content on open source software at http://marakana.com\n** Head to http://html5devconf.com for more info on the event"
