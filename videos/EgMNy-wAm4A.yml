Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nClusterAPI: A Guide to Get Started - Katie Gamanji, American Express \n\nIn the past years, Kubernetes has been the nucleus of container orchestration frameworks. With the growing number of microservices, managing clusters at scale has become an imperative requirement. Additionally, from a technological landscape standpoint, the cloud platform teams are highly focused on delivering scalable, reliable and highly available platforms. At Condé Nast, this constitutes in having a stable and coherent approach to deploy, manage and upgrade multiple Kubernetes clusters that are distributed globally. Also, it is imperative to keep the life-cycle management of the clusters consistent across all regions. Henceforth, this talk aims to present an overview of how Condé Nast prototypes tools, such as ClusterAPI, to ensure a sustainable cluster provisioning mechanism.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zenm"
