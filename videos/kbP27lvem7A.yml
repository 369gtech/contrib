description: 'Did you ever want to port that cool game you built to the browser? Or have your 3D design app work there as well? It''s already possible now, but it will get even better in the future! We have asm.js as a subset of JavaScript, optimized for use cases like games, compression or image editing. Now WebAssembly promises to take this one step further by reducing storage size and decoding time while providing the same safe sandboxed environment with near-native performance. It takes your native code, no matter if C or Rust, and turns that into something that runs blazingly fast in your browser.'
