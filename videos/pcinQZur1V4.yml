description: "Spring I/O 2018 - Barcelona, 24-25 May\n\nAt Spring I/O last year, we introduced the functional web framework as an alternative to the existing annotation-based MVC. This year, we follow up with a presentation where we go beyond the basics, and show more advanced features, including:\n\n* Predicates: how to create your own custom predicates,\n* Nesting routes: how to remove duplication from your predicates,\n* Route organisation: how to organize route functions into a nearly arranged whole,\n* Filtering routes: how to introspect and manipulate both request and response with a filter\n* And more!"
