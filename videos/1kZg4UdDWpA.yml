description: "Have you ever wanted to suggest an idea, drive a project forward, or take on more responsibilities within Drupal? Have you tried and failed or don't quite know the best way to go about it?\n\nI will be sharing my experiences and ideas on how to get your idea out there and get others on board.\n\nLearn about the numerous communication challenges that you may face within a large, worldwide open source community. More importantly how you can overcome them.\n\nI'll cover how you should ask for help when the workload gets too much and a boost is needed.\n\nI will be sharing my experiences of taking on the initiative of refactoring the Bartik theme in Drupal core. From a casual suggestion that it should be thought about, to becoming a maintainer of Bartik, with all of the highs and lows included.\n\nGet yourself heard in the community!"
