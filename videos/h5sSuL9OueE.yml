title: 'Geoffrey Broadwell - ‎The Need for Speed: Benchmarking Perl 6‎'
recordingDate: 1372086217
description: 'Comparison of the various Perl 6-related implementations and VMs, using microbenchmarks attempting to measure very small runtimes of particular features (such as invocation, taking closures, passing arguments, boxing, compilation, coercion, aggregate access/storage, lexical access/storage, unicode property lookup, regexes, etc). Also microbenchmarks of the usual "toy" programs in Perl 6 versus several other languages/environments. Discussion of general measurement and optimization strategies.'
