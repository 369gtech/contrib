description: "Google I/O 2010 - GWT Linkers target HTML5 Web Workers, Chrome Extensions, and more \r\n\r\nGWT 301 \r\n\r\nMatt Mastracci \r\n\r\nAt its core GWT has a well-defined and customizable mechanism -- called Linkers -- that controls exactly how GWT's compiled JavaScript should be packaged, served, and run. This session will describe how to create linkers and explains some of the linkers we've created, including a linker that turns a GWT module into an HTML5 Web Worker and one that generates an HTML App Cache manifest automatically. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
