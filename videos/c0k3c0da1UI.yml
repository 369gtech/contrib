description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nThis talk gives an introduction about MediaPipe which is an open source Machine Learning Solutions that allows running machine learning models on low powered devices and helps integrate the models with mobile applications. It gives these creative professionals a lot of dynamic tools and utilizes Machine learning in a really easy way to create powerful and intuitive applications without having much / no knowledge of machine learning beforehand. So we can see how MediaPipe can be integrated with React Native, one of the most popular frameworks for creating cross platform applications. Giving easy access to include machine learning use cases in cross platform apps built using React Native. \n\nAbout the speaker:\nShivay Lamba is a software developer specializing in DevOps, Machine Learning and Full Stack Development. \n\nHe is an Open Source Enthusiast and has been part of various programs like Google Code In and Google Summer of Code as a Mentor and is currently a MLH Fellow. He has also interned at organizations like EY, Genpact. \nHe is actively involved in community work as well. He is a TensorflowJS SIG member, Mentor in OpenMined and CNCF Service Mesh Community, SODA Foundation and has given talks at various conferences like Github Satellite, Voice Global, Fossasia Tech Summit, TensorflowJS Show & Tell.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/howdevelop\nGitHub: https://github.com/shivaylamba"
