recordingDate: 1262658235
description: 'The State of Utah Department of Public Safety is dedicated to protecting the community.  With its DPS Media Portal, the public can find out about incidents more quickly and DPS employees can focus on protecting the public rather than communication with the media.  The Media Portal uses innovative Web 2.0 technologies that provide the media with a current comprehensive view into statewide law enforcement activities.  Through this session Sergeant Jeff Nigbur will discuss the background information and recent developments of the DPS Media Portal as an effective public communication tool.'
