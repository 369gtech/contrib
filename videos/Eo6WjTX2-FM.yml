description: "Until the widespread use of 802.11n, wireless LANs traded lower connection speed for convenience. With 802.11n, wireless LANs blow past Fast Ethernet through a combination of new radio techniques and improvements to the efficiency of the underlying protocol. Join Matthew Gast to learn why 802.11n is so fast, how to build a network based on it, and take a peek ahead at the coming gigabit standards.\n\nAbout Matthew Gast\n\nMatthew Gast is the director of product management at Aerohive Networks responsible for the software that powers Aerohive's networking devices. He has been active within the Wi-Fi community, serving as the chair of both security task groups at the Wi-Fi Alliance, where he leads efforts to extend the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) certification to incorporate newly developed security technologies and drive adoption of the strongest forms of security by network administrators. He also led the Wi-Fi Alliance's Wireless Network Management marketing task group's investigation of certification requirements for new power saving technologies.
