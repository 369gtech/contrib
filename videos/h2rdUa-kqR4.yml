description: 'See how new self-service provisioning capabilities in vSphere will allow developers and cloud admins to deploy and operate Docker Datacenter in a ticketless manner. This demo will give a sneak preview of current development work aimed at giving developers access to container frameworks on demand â€“ while at the same time leveraging the advanced performance, availability, and security capabilities of vSphere.
