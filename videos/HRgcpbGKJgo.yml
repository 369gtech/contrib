description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune,  4 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe present a novel technique that speeds up state-space exploration\n(SSE) for evolving programs with dynamically allocated data. SSE is\nthe essence of explicit-state model checking and an increasingly\npopular method for automating test generation. Traditional,\nnon-incremental SSE takes one version of a program and systematically\nexplores the states reachable during the program's executions to nd\nproperty violations. Incremental SSE considers several versions that\narise during program evolution: reusing the results of SSE for one\nversion can speed up SSE for the next version, since state spaces of\nconsecutive program versions can have significant similarities. We\nhave implemented our technique in two model checkers: Java PathFinder\nand the J-Sim state-space explorer. The experimental results on 24\nprogram evolutions and exploration changes show that for non-initial\nruns our technique speeds up SSE in 22 cases from 6.43% to 68.62%\n(with median of 42.29%) and slows down SSE in only two cases for\n-4.71% and -4.81%.\n\nJoint work with Steven Lauterburg, Ahmed Sobeih, and Mahesh Viswanathan\n\n\nSpeaker: Darko Marinov\nDarko Marinov is an Assistant Professor in the Department of\nComputer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He\nobtained his Ph.D. from MIT in 2005. His main research interests are in\nSoftware Engineering, with focus on improving software reliability using\nsoftware testing and model checking.
