title: 'CloudSphere: Apps in the world of Hybrid Cloud by Wojciech Kocjan & Daniel Liszka'
recordingDate: 1571396324
description: "Deploying cloud-native applications in an environment that is both on-prem and cloud based is difficult and error-prone. Or is it?\n\nIn this demo we’ll explain how VMware’s Bitnami application catalog can be used along with NSX-T software-defined networking to seamlessly deploy an application across the data center and public cloud. We’ll walk through building and updating a microservices-based, polyglot application. We will deploy it on top of Kubernetes running on-prem and leverage a database deployed as a VM in the public cloud.\n\nWe will show how NSX Cloud, VMware’s hybrid networking solution, can be used to create a private network that spans both on-prem data center and private clouds.\n\nThe session also shows how you can automate application updates with CI/CD built on the GitLab Certified by Bitnami VM – creating a pipeline that builds and pushes each microservice app on each change.\n\nFinally, we’ll demo how Bitnami’s open source project Kubeapps can be leveraged for managing and versioning deployments of our application."
