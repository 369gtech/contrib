description: "Lightning Talk: Providing Service Access with Service Keys Using HAProxy and Floating IPs - Christian Brinker, evoila GmbH\n\nService brokers provide a well-proven way to manage services in Cloud Foundry. This way applications can be easily connected to services like databases or message queues. But there are situations where direct access to a service is required. For this scenario Cloud Foundry provides the concept of generating service keys that hold credentials that allow access to a service instance. \n\nBut what about situations in which the service is deployed in a private network that is only accessible from Cloud Foundry? In this talk the speakers Sebastian BÃ¶ing and Christian Brinker present a solution to achieve this with Floating IPs within OpenStack. Furthermore they provide an approach that uses a remote mechanism for configuring HAProxy for accessing multiple different service clusters at the same time while only requiring at least one Floating IP.\n\nAbout Christian Brinker\nAs long-standing member of the evoila Automation and Technology team and Automation Engineer Christian Brinker is well experienced in the automation of cloud environments.
