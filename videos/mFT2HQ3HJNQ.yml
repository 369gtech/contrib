recordingDate: 1438606060
description: 'This talk introduces the Java EE 7 platform, the latest revision of the Java platform for the enterprise. The focus of Java EE 7 is on the cloud, and specifically it aims to bring Platform-as-a-Service providers and application developers together so that portable applications can be deployed on any cloud infrastructure and reap all its benefits in terms of scalability, elasticity, multitenancy, etc. Furthermore, Java EE 7 continues the ease of development push that characterized prior releases by bringing further simplification to enterprise development. It also adds new, important APIs such as the REST client API in JAX-RS 2.0, vast improvements to Java Message Service 2.0, and plenty of improvements to all other components.'
