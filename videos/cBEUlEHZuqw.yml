description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/Vdc3n\n\nIn this part of the code refactoring tutorial, I'll show you how and when to use the Adapter Design Pattern.\n\nWith the adapter pattern we can create a new class without disturbing any other code. On top of that adapters make it easier to swap in code at runtime. They also allow you to communicate with code using method names that make sense to you.\n\nI refactor code sent in by one of you and show you how to add a ton of flexibility."
