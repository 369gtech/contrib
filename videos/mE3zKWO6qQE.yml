title: 'Barry Stahl - Design Patterns for Loosely Coupled Applications'
recordingDate: 1557957421
description: 'Building loosely coupled applications is critical to creating solutions that follow good development principles. These principles help make sure our applications are testable, maintainable and extensible. In this session we will explore several design patterns that are key to building applications that maintain loose coupling. We start by reviewing a tightly coupled legacy application. Then, we explore several key design patterns by using them to convert that application into a maintainable and extensible solution that can be validated using unit tests. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/5NYvjSCMHMD'
