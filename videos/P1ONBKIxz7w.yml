Not sure where to start in contributing a fix for an issue?  Getting involved in the Fluentd ecosystem and submitting a PR helped make it possible for Amgen to effortlessly collect CloudTrail logs from hundreds of AWS accounts owned by separate teams.  We'll take a look at the details of how to collect and annotate logs stored in any format or account in AWS with Fluentd where hundreds or any number of accounts are in use. We'll also follow the details of contributing this now merged PR to the Fluentd S3 plugin that made it possible.   Whether you're a new or long-time user of Fluentd, come and be inspired to consider contributing back to observability related open-source projects like Fluentd and the benefits it can bring to your organization and the community. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaYe"
