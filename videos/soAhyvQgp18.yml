description: "by Benny Siegert\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.121/netbsd_not_just_for_toasters.webm\n\nNetBSD may seem like an exotic choice for an operating system. But it is actually a decent desktop OS for developers and a rock-solid server OS, in the cloud as well as on old hardware. Come for the freedom from systemd, stay for the great packages, modern features and enthusiastic community! In this talk, I will give reasons why adopting NetBSD makes sense, show some cool hardware that you can run NetBSD on, and talk about new features in the upcoming NetBSD 9 release.\n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 10:05:00"
