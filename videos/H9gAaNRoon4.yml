In this talk, we will explore the uses of string_view, when it is appropriate to use it, and when it is not. Along the way, I will discuss other possible \"_view\" classes, with an eye to the upcoming \"ranges\" proposal before the standards committee.\n— \nMarshall is a long-time boost participant.
