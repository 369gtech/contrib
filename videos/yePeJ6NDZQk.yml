description: "Speaker: Dave Syer\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/dsyer/security-for-microservices-with-spring\nSecurity for Microservices with Spring and OAuth2 OAuth2 is a lightweight security protocol that is well-suited for use with HTTP, the protocol at the heart of many modern architectures. Spring Security OAuth2 has a load of new features, not the least of which being the `@Configuration` support in version 2.0. Combine these with Spring Boot and you have a platform which can get you a secure HTTP service application in about 20 lines of code. This presentation shows how the combination of rapid development and production-ready features in the modern Spring stack are a perfect mixture for developing secure components in a system composed of microservices. We explore the new features in Spring OAuth2, guide you through the choice of which to use and when, and show how easy they are to enable quickly.\nLearn more about Spring Security OAUTH: http://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth"
