description: "Tutorial: Cloud-Agnostic Serverless - Sebastien Goasguen, TriggerMesh \n\nServerless design patterns have grown in popularity because they allow developers to move faster by focusing on business logic without worrying about the underlying infrastructure where their code is run. However, many enterprises use diverse infrastructure including on-premises servers and multiple clouds. In this tutorial, we will leverage Knative, Google's Kubernetes-based open source platform to build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads. We will push serverless functions and apps to production on any cloud of choice and switch the provider as necessary. We will leverage GitLab and TriggerMesh technology in the tutorial and also share how developers can use other options. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPgx"
