description: "Focusing on making websites is bread and butter for many, but what happens when you start to think beyond frameworks and APIs and into the realms of strategy? Switching from day to day development to a higher level can be hugely rewarding, but is also not without its challenges, both in terms of personal identity and emotional hurdles, as well as knowledge gaps.\n\nIn this talk we’ll look at: \n• The different levels of focus that we can work at \n• Why you might want to begin to focus more strategically \n• The challenges that you might face on the way \n• Examples of how having a technical brain in more strategic activities can be beneficial.\n\nAbout Sally Jenkinson\n\nSally is a consultant and digital solutions architect based in the wilds of East Anglia. Through her company Records Sound the Same she helps organisations from big to small with their digital transformation, discovery, planning, and strategic decisions, with clients including the RNLI, Manor Racing F1 team, and Hotelplan.
