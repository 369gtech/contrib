description: "You've probably seen a number of warnings in AdMob's documentation saying \"Always test with test ads!\" But why is that so important, and what's the best way to go about it?\n\nIn this episode, you'll learn exactly why it is that test ads should always be used when developing and testing integrations of the Google Mobile Ads SDK. You'll also get tips on two different ways to enable them, and how to know that the ads you've loaded aren't from production.\n\nUseful Resources:\n\nThe Android test ads guide → https://goo.gl/TwcoRs\nThe iOS test ads guide → https://goo.gl/6mEYvu\nThe Unity test ads guide → https://goo.gl/rMC8fZ\nThe Mobile Ads SDK support forum → https://goo.gl/LLCMX8\n\nWatch more episodes of Mobile Ads Garage here → https://goo.gl/BDQvw6\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel → http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
