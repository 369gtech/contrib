description: "With functions as a service, cloud providers have signaled the smallest billable unit of computation is a single function execution. Itâ€™s a beautifully simple idea, rejecting the metaphor of a server, and freeing developers to design smaller and simpler services. We can iterate on our code with a high degree of isolation, without fear of affecting other parts of the system; deploy systems in seconds with zero downtime; and always be available regardless of load.\n\nHowever, building serverless-y apps is very new and as such fought with early days complexity:\n\n    Configuration tooling was designed for the last generation of computing metaphors (and often lags behind the releases of new functionality)\n    AWS is massive and overwhelming with many similar, but not the same, products\n    The web console is confusing, with divergent interfaces between interlocking services\n    Deep proprietary knowledge is required to configure and maintain common infrastructure primitives\n\nIn this talk Brian will walk you through a new approach to architecting applications with plain text using arc.codes to create apps in minutes and subsequently deploy in seconds with zero downtime and unprecedented availability.\n\nBrian LeRoux is the co-founder / CTO of begin.com which is a new breed of app that helps teams stay organized in Slack. In the process of developing begin.com, an entirely serverless cloud functions thing emerged called arc.codes. In a former life Brian worked at Adobe on PhoneGap and its open source upstream Apache Cordova. A longtime fan of the open web he created wtfjs.com and sports a questionable tattoo. Brian believes the future is mobile, seamlessly running in the cloud, on open source software and will be created by hackers like you.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
