description: "NorDevCon 2014 - 28th February 2014\n\nPulp Prototyping\nby Rupert Redington and Harry Harrold\n\nIf good agile coding means showing working software early, then testing your thinking before you’ve even opened an IDE is even better.\n\nAgile development means small steps, tested early and often. That means conversations, but without something to talk about, they can just wander. At the beginning of a project, code is too slow to produce something to spark that conversation. Even wireframes can take time, and obscure interface detail. That’s where a paper prototype is most useful. It’s not a sketch, it’s working paperware.\n\nWe take paperware everywhere. Most usefully, out to test with real people who'll really use the software we’ll build, and feedback is fast. There’s no barrier between developers, designers and the people who'll use the digital product later. Everyone has made things from cardboard and sticky tape, and everyone can see there’s nothing there they couldn't change. Paperware inspires them to be actively involved in the testing process, rather than being the passively subjects of a demonstration. It gives us permission to be terribly, dreadfully, wrong about an interface without it costing too much time. We don't promise to make every change, but we promise to listen, and be inspired by what people feel.\n\nPart stand-up show, part evangelism, this session will preach the joy of really, really, low fidelity prototyping in software development. Harry and Rupert turn up with a paperware system to choose which sessions you're going to go to at a conference, and a lucky attendee or two will be intimately involved in cutting that idea around…\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/nordevcon2014/"
