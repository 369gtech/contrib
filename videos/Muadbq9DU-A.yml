description: "Andrea Morena\nDirector of Product Management Common Cloud PaaS\nOracle\n\nServerless computing is gaining popularity because it allows developers to focus on the functionality of their code and not be worried about the target deployment environment. Developer's code can scale as needed automatically and another advantage is that Serverless is elastic in its compute utilization which means you use computer resources only as they are needed in an on-demand fashion. Anyway, there are still some challenges as polyglot programming languages support, portability across multi-cloud platforms and on-premise."
