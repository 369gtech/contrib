description: 'Despite the media attention given to the diversity in tech problem, many technology practitioners don''t see how a lack of diversity affects their daily lives. So, it is not surprising that they neither understand the magnitude of the problem nor how they can help fix it. However, the skills needed to debug software are directly applicable to making technology companies more inclusive and diverse.'
