description: "Your social network could be more valuable than the work you’re doing today, because it could (and should) lead to the opportunities you get tomorrow. Your next post could result in your next recommendation, job, collaboration, exhibit, and next level experience.\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn how to hone and build your online social media presence to attract brands and engage in the modern-day endorsement deal. Get a behind-the-scenes perspective on the things brands look for in creative profiles and the rules of engagement.\n\nLindsay Munro\nSocial Strategist, Adobe XD\nhttps://twitter.com/lindsaymunro\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lindsaymunro/\nhttps://fitc.ca/speaker/lindsay-munro/?event=25399\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
