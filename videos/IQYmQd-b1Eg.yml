description: "Jenkins does not scale. There's no denying it. If we need more power because the number of concurrent builds increased, we cannot scale Jenkins. We cannot hook it into Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscaler to change the number of replicas based on metrics like the number of concurrent builds.. At times, Jenkins is struggling under heavy load. At others, it is wasting resources when it is underutilized. As a result, we might need to increase its requested memory and CPU as well as its limits to cover the worst-case scenario. \n\nAboutL\n\nViktor Farcic, Developer Advocate, CloudBees\n\nViktor Farcic is a Developer Advocate at CloudBees, a member of the Google Developer Experts and Docker Captains groups, and published author.
