And, what do you need to do to ensure that your organization uses the microservice architecture successfully?\n\nIn this talk, Iâ€™ll answer these and other questions using shapes as visual metaphors. You will learn about the motivations for the microservice architecture and why simply adopting microservices is insufficient.
