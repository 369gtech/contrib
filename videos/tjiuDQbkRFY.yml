description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2019\nhttps://dddeurope.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nDomain Modelling \n\nDomain models are the heart of DDD. They allow us to share and evolve our understanding, and express it across code, documentation, tests, user interfaces...\n\nBiography\n\nHe's a very passionate human being, passionate about what he does and how he lives his life. Apart from the constant improvement of his skillset, he also gives back, sharing what he's learned. Loyal, \"firm but fair\", empathic are traits people have come to associate with him. Though getting results is what counts, he fully realizes the journey is what gets us there.\n\nHis past work involved building web-native, multi-user products with enterprise scale features such as high configurability by end users, authentication & authorization, printing & reporting, integration with third parties & devices using both messaging and remote procedure calls. He analyzed, designed, documented, fleshed out models, architected solutions into bite-sized portions, wrote automated test specifications at the unit, integration, story, and UI level, wrote code at every layer and tier in the stack, scripted deployments and engaged in the operational side of running software at customer sites, all in order to satisfy requirements and customer happiness.\n\nAs a technical and team lead, he bridged the gap between product owner, technology, team, problems and solutions. Facilitator during agile planning meetings, teacher during coding dojos, presenter during knowledge transfer sessions, are but a few of his past efforts. It's safe to say that, throughout his career, teaching and learning have been the only constants."
