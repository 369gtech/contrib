title: '"Practical Quantum Computing Today" by Alex Condello'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634045248
description: "Until recently, quantum computing was largely restricted to researchers and scientists who had access to physical computer systems. Today, cloud access – like D-Wave’s Leap quantum application environment – and improvements in quantum computing hardware, software, and developer tools are empowering programmers around the world to code on live quantum computers in real-time via their browsers — quantum mechanical knowledge not required.\n\nUsers and companies have already built over 250 early applications on D-Wave’s computers in industries ranging from automotive to machine learning, aerospace, finance, and more. The quantum application era is here, and the growing quantum developer community is making it a reality.\n\nIn this session, Alex Condello, Manager of Applications Development Technology and Tools at D-Wave, will talk about the growing quantum application development ecosystem and how developers can start learning to code on a quantum computer today. Alex will also explore some of the early applications that developers and companies have built to-date using D-Wave's system.\n\nAlex Condello\nD-Wave Systems Inc.\n\nAlex Condello is D-Wave’s Manager of Applications Development Technology and Tools. He is one of the creators of Ocean software, D-Wave’s suite of quantum tools. Condello attended Queens University, Canada, where he earned a Bachelor of Applied Science in Mathematics and Engineering (Computing and Communication), as well as a Masters of Applied Science in Mathematics.\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop 2021\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"
