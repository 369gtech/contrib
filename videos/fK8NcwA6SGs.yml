description: "Speaker: Leonardo Losoviz\n\nCOPE (Create Once, Publish Everywhere) is a technique which allows to publish content across different platforms from a single source of truth, enabling to feed content to dissimilar platforms such as web, emails, or an iOS or Android app, while minimizing the amount of duplicated information and reducing maintenance to the minimum possible.\n\nThrough Gutenberg, WordPress splits the post content into blocks which can be handled independently, thus enabling the implementation of the COPE strategy. This makes WordPress an ideal platform for hosting the content that will be distributed to different platforms. In this talk we will take a look into a WordPress-based architecture to implement COPE, and how it works.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nLeonardo Losoviz is an independent open source developer, creator of a framework for building modular websites called [PoP]. The only non-musician in his family, this doesnâ€™t bother him, because coding is also making art. He lives in a loop: he dreams of code and, when he wakes up, he codes his dreams. He is based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nEvent Page: https://2019.singapore.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-1070\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/BEH5Q/"
