description: "Presented by Bryan Hughes at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday June 25th 2015 - Hacking in your spare time is a lot of fun, but how do you actually finish that project you've been dreaming about? This talk will discuss these constraints and requirements, and how a little creativity goes a long way. Key to this is dreaming big while being realistic, and just getting something out there is important. I will also discuss the role of open source in personal projects, from leveraging existing work to how you actually open source a project properly.\n\n* twitter.com/nebrius\n* github.com/nebrius"
