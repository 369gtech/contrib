description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Amsterdam 2018\nhttp://gotoams.nl\n\nFull Title: Deep Learning in Medicine: An Introduction and Applications to Next-generation Sequencing and Disease Diagnostics\n\nAllen Day - Developer Advocate at Google\n\nABSTRACT\nDeep learning has enabled dramatic advances in image recognition performance. In this talk I will discuss using a deep convolutional neural network to detect genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing human read data. Our method, called DeepVariant, both outperforms existing genotyping tools and generalizes across genome builds and even to other species. DeepVariant represents a significant step from expert-driven statistical [...]\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotoams.nl/2018/sessions/436\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotoamst\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
