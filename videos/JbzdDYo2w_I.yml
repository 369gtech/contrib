title: 'Let''s Deploy an Open Source Library - Eunjae Lee - JSConf Korea 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1602810001
description: "Deploying an open source library can be scary. You anxiously stare at the screen hoping that it'll be a success, that you didn't make any mistakes. There are many tools that can ease your worries, but perhaps can't eliminate them.\n\nSo I present to you a new process for deploying open source libraries. This process dramatically reduces the likelihood of making mistakes, and most of the process will happen asynchronously, allowing you to review with your teammates before deployment. I will also introduce Ship.js, a tool created for this purpose. With this newly defined process, let's continuously deploy our open source libraries without fear!"
