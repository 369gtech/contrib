description: "Hi, I am Prof. JavaScript.\n\nI work in my hidden laboratory on incredible machines that will help us improve our living standard. I aim to be the first scientist in the world who builds a JavaScript-powered Rube Goldberg machine for making breakfast eggs. My earlier inventions are \"The unbelievable cat play-o-matic\" and \"The retrotirized Video-Tweet-Phone-Reader\".\n\nIn this talk, I will reveal my newest inventions and share their secret blueprints with the audience.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
