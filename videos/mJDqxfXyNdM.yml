description: "You know Hibernate, you have been using it for years. But I bet you don't know it as well as you think. You know how to do full-text and geospatial searches? You know how to implement a change audit process, persist in a NoSQL store, do faceting? You know how to cache reference data in an efficient way, know about lazy property groups and bytecode enhacements?\n\nNot everything? This presentation is for you. Come discover what's new in Hibernate ORM 5 and in the other projects of the Hibernate family. After this talk, you will get a list of concrete features to contemplate for your application and potentially new tools to use.\n\n# Sanne Grinovero\nSanne Grinovero is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat working on the popular Hibernate project. He leads the Hibernate Search project and is passionate about performance, concurrency, open source and scalable data related problems. He aims to make high performance Search and NoSQL capabilities easy to use and well integrated into the mainstream Java stack, sometimes contributing to Hibernate OGM, sometimes to caching and distributed storage, and has been contributing various performance enhancements to the WildFly project. He lived in Holland, Italy, the Caribbean islands, Chile, Portugal and currently hacks in London."
