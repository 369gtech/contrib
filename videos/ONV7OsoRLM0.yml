title: 'DEF CON 29 Aerospace Village - Joshua Smailes - CPDLC Man in the Middle Attacks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630569696
description: 'The Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) protocol replaces voice-based air traffic control with a text-based protocol. With no real security protections, this system is open to a wide range of message injection attacks. It has long been assumed that air traffic controllers and flight crew should be able to detect such attacks, but this is not always the case.'
