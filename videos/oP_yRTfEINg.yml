description: "This talk is geared towards getting people up to speed with how Modern Javascript works. The bulk of this talk will be used to cover the newer Javascript syntax, since that syntax will be used in the following React Talks. The Modern JS talk will also cover how to navigate the board Javascript ecosystem, and we will be touching on topics such as Node, NPM, and some of the various build tools that exist. Additionally, we will discuss some more advanced Javascript topics like Async Programming, and building modular Javascript applications.\n\nSLIDES:\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/KevinLangleyJr/modern-js-with-es6\n\nEVENT:\n\nWordPress Camp 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nKevin Langley Jr.\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQO-o5lXSE"
