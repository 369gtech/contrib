description: "Leadership is a relational skill; it is about how we interact with and relate to others. Becoming a leader from an engineering background can be rather challenging especially from this perspective, but the way we relate more effectively as leaders can be learned and improved.\nTaking a non-deterministic approach we created a framework for personal and team development that supports many leaders at many stages of their careers in growing in to a more conscious, more relational, and more successful leader, enabling others to create real business value. The Leadership Toolbox is a set of simple and practical tools that has the potential to become part of a leaders’ everyday life. We expect that those tools will transform into habits and best practices that will help every leader to grow and lead effective teams with happy people. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch"
