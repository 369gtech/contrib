description: "Speaker: Eden Shochat\nAleph VC\n\nThe http://geekcon.org un-conference hosts more than 170 makers, designers, artists, hackers and code monkeys for the 10th year this year. Participants get unlimited coffee, food & accommodations for 3 days when they team up to build anything from a laughing swing, solar sausage cooker, a tomato tank, \"Superman\" flight simulator, full body security access authenticator or large-scale kitesurfing simulator. The only requirement is that the project needs to be utterly useless. Join to talk innovation, organized chaos and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
