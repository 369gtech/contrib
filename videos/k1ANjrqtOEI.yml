description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nELIXIR VS SCALA\nby Ludwik Bukowski  \n\nABSTRACT\nBoth Scala and Elixir take advantage of functional programming concepts and provide the right tools for building highly concurrent, scalable and distributed systems.\nOne can wonder which of the two is a better choice for a certain use case, especially when it comes to compute-intensive tasks - like machine learning algorithms.\nAs engineers, we prefer concrete numbers to all the buzzwords, so we load tested a simple pattern recognition app implemented in both technologies. Join our talk to see the results!\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/ludwik-bukowski/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - LUDWIK BUKOWSKI\nErlang/Elixir Software Developer\n\nLudwik is an Elixir enthusiast who works as a software developer at Erlang Solutions.\n\nMore on Ludwik Bukowski: https://codesync.global/speaker/ludwik-bukowski/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
