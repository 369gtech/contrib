description: 'If we choose to build a distributed system using messages, we are creating a conversation between the components in that system. So that those conversations are meaningful, not just babble, we need to use one of two principles: choreography and orchestration. In this presentation, we look at what those are, and how we can use them to make messaging work for us.'
