description: "OpenSocial Across Containers\r\nArne Roomann-Kirruk and Lane LiaBraaten (Google)\r\n\r\nOpenSocial provides a common set of APIs that developers can learn in order to create applications that run on multiple social sites. However, since social sites vary widely in functionality, OpenSocial provides ways to extend the core APIs so containers can implement site-specific functionality.\r\n\r\nThis session will cover best practices for how to extend the OpenSocial API for your container, as well as how to write applications that will run on multiple OpenSocial sites."
