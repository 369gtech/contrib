description: "Spatial computing has arrived. Yes the hype arrived first but the next pattern of computing is now a dev kit you can buy, use and develop for. This means that following in the footsteps of pocket monsters and ARKits will be our digital lifestyles joining us in the physical world. Is this going to be a huge leap or just a transition from hand held mobile to wearable mobile. Letâ€™s discuss.\n\nThis session is a near to far term vision of the purpose and reality of spatial computing heavily influenced by wearable mixed reality computers like Magic Leap One as told by one of their strategic design partners. A resonant space reflecting on what can you do today, what will you do tomorrow & why that might be valuable or meaningful!\n\nJared Ficklin\nargodesign.com\nhttps://twitter.com/jaredrawk\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttps://fitc.ca/events\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at https://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description"
