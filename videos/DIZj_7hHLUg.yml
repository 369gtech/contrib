description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nUnite And Conquer\nby Viktória Fördős, Laura M. Castro & Natalia Chechina |\n\nABSTRACT\nDivisions are popular in our days often comparing “them” and “us”: be it research vs industry, men vs women, Erlang vs Elixir... but unity is what makes us stronger and enables us to aim for new horizons. In this talk, Natalia, Laura, and Viktória will discuss their vision on creating fault-tolerant, scalable opportunities together to achieve diverse ambitions. All BEAMers unite!\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER\nViktória Fördős\nViktória is passionate about consistency models, highly available and scalable software. She first came in contact with Erlang in 2010 when she joined the RefactorErl project. Has been active in R&D, and of course in Erlang, ever since. She was contributing to FP7 EU projects (PharaPhrase, RELEASE, SYNCFREE), co-authored papers in the ACM SIGPLAN Erlang Workshop, in ‘Proceedings of Trends in Functional Programming’ (TFP), in ‘Lecture Notes in Computer Science’ (LNCS), in Computer Languages Systems & Structures (COMLAN), in ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, and in IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems. She was Member of Program Committee for the ACM Erlang Workshop between 2016 and 2018. She is Co-chair for the ACM Erlang Workshop 2019 and 2020. She joined Cisco Systems in 2019. She is an NSO core engineer, she solves (network orchestration) problems in Erlang everyday.\n\nLaura M. Castro\nLaura became fascinated with Erlang during her studies in Software Engineering and has been an advocate of our beloved technology ever since. Nowadays, this means she introduces the BEAM to the next generations of CS graduates, preaches it to local developer groups and FP-related events, introduces it in new projects with local companies, and exploits it as a research tool in collaboration with colleagues all around the world.\n\nNatalia Chechina\nNatalia is passionate about distributed systems, cooperative robotics, scalability, fault tolerance, and as a result is in love with Erlang. Her research investigates approaches and techniques to enable scaling and efficient performance on commodity hardware where components are loosely coupled, communication is significant, and any of the components may fail or disconnect at any time.\n\n---\n\nCode BEAM V 2020 was sponsored by Duffel, PepsiCo, Klarna, WhatsApp, DNSimple, Flyiin, Erlang Solutions, Forza Football, BlockFi, App Unite, Pleroma, Simplabs, Telnyx, Clever Bunny, O'Reilly, Manning Publications\n\nCode BEAM V\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
