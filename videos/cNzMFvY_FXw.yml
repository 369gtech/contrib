description: "The 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering\r\nMountain View, California, USA\r\nSeptember 19-22, 2011\r\n\r\nCitation Pattern Matching Algorithms for Citation-based Plagiarism Detection: Greedy Citation Tiling, Citation Chunking and Longest Common Citation Sequence\r\nBela Gipp, Norman Meuschke\r\nPresented by Bela Gipp.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPlagiarism Detection Systems have been developed to locate instances of plagiarism e.g. within scientific papers. Studies have shown that the existing approaches deliver reasonable results in identifying copy&paste plagiarism, but fail to detect more sophisticated forms such as paraphrased, translated or idea plagiarism. The authors of this paper demonstrated in recent studies that the detection rate can be significantly improved by not only relying on text analysis, but by additionally analyzing the citations of a document. Citations are valuable language independent markers that are similar to a fingerprint. In fact, our examinations of real world cases have shown that the order of citations in a document often remains similar even if the text has been strongly paraphrased or translated in order to disguise plagiarism. This paper introduces three algorithms and discusses their suitability for the purpose of Citation-based Plagiarism Detection. Due to the numerous ways in which plagiarism can occur, these algorithms need to be versatile. They must be capable of detecting transpositions, scaling and combinations in a local and global form. The algorithms are coined Greedy Citation Tiling, Citation Chunking and Longest Common Citation Sequence. The evaluation showed that common forms of plagiarism can be detected reliably if these algorithms are combined."
