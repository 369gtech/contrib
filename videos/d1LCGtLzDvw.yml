description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — In the follow-up to Damon’s 2018 “Operations: The Last Mile” keynote, this talk will examine incident management in the era of DevOps and SRE. Responding to incidents has always been the core job of Operations. Today, the influences of DevOps and SRE are changing how Operations work gets done — and even who is doing the work. This talk will look at how high performing organizations are applying DevOps and SRE practices to shorten incidents and reduce escalations. Less frustration for the engineers. Lower costs for the business. Everybody wins.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
