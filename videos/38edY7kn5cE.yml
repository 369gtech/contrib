language: English
recordingDate: 1571181385
description: "Spring Cloud products for the Pivotal Platform build on top of the open-source Spring Cloud projects to provide a batteries-included, fully platform-integrated solution for developers who don’t want to implement, deploy, maintain, and upgrade their own microservices infrastructure. Developers can focus on delivering business value, while Pivotal secures, maintains, and operates these components for you. \n\nPivotal Spring Cloud Services has been rebuilt to leverage the latest open-source components, adding new features and bringing improvements to scalability and security. It’s also been streamlined to make it easier to operate than ever before. Pivotal Spring Cloud Gateway is a new product that builds upon open-source to offer an API Gateway pattern with distributed configuration and fully integrated with the Pivotal Platform. In this talk, we'll introduce the features provided by these latest Spring Cloud products.\n\nSpeakers: Gareth Clay, Staff Software Engineer, Pivotal; Bella (Yuxin) Bai, Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/whats-new-in-pivotal-spring-cloud-products/SpringCentral/whats-new-in-pivotal-spring-cloud-products"
