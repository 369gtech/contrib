description: "Roy Derks - GraphQL Without a Database\n\nI do conferences, workshops and open-source projects on #reactjs, #JS, #GraphQL and #ReasonML | Work with @AmsterdamNL @reactgqlacademy\n\nYour frontend developers are pushing to get started with GraphQL, but you don’t have the backend capacity to migrate your existing REST APIs to GraphQL? Or you want to have a GraphQL API next to your existing endpoints that are based on REST, without having to rewrite all your controllers? In this talk I’ll show how to wrap existing REST APIs into one single GraphQL endpoint on both the client and server side. This allows you to access the power of GraphQL without having to change any of your existing code or connect to a database.\n\nFrontend Love 19th Feb 2020\n1132 Attendees\nFlying in from 50+ Countries\n16 Talks from JS Leaders\n20+ Sponsors\n\nAll part of the Largest Javascript Conference in the Netherlands\n\nSign up and be first to get notified about Frontend Love 2021 \nhttps://confirmsubscription.com/h/t/DD88027477DDD5A4\n\nFollow us on Socials\nLinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontendlove\nTwitter https://twitter.com/Frontend_Love\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/frontendlove/\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/frontend_love/\n\nPowered by Passionate People\n\nWant to join their quest to be the lead Software Development Consultancy on the planet? ;)\n\nhttps://passionatepeople.io/careers\n\nFollow on Social\nLinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/passionatepeoplefrontend\nTwitter https://twitter.com/passionpeopleNL?s=20\n\n#frontendlove #frontenddeveloperlove #vuejsamsterdam #vueamsterdam"
