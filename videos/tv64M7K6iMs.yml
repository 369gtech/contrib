description: "Learn about the heat map and image layer visualizations in side of Azure Maps.\n\nHeat maps are used to represent the density of data using a range of colors. They are often used to show the data \"hot spots\" on a map and are great to help understand data. The heat map layer also supports weighted data points to help bring the most relvant information to the surface.\n\nThe image layer allows you to overlay georeferenced images on top of the map so that they move and scale as you pan and zoom the map. This is great for building floor plans, overlaying old maps, or imagery from a drone.\n\nHeat Map Layer documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/map-add-heat-map-layer \nImage Layer documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/map-add-image-layer \nCode samples: https://aka.ms/AzureMapsSamples \nAzure Maps Blog: https://aka.ms/AzureMapsBlog\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aft-iot"
