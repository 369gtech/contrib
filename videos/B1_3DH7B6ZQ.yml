title: 'Anatomy of a Java Zero-Day Exploit'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433507596
description: "Java was recently hit by several major exploits. These exploits were written in pure Java and relied on several obscure components of the Java library. Understanding how exploits undermine Java security is a fundamental step in understanding and improving Java security and producing secure Java code. Consequently, this session demonstrates and examines a public exploit. It dissects the code of the exploit and illustrates how the exploit managed to attack an unpatched Java Virtual Machine, focusing on the techniques the exploit used, with references to relevant guidelines from the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java. The session concludes with an explanation of how Java was patched to defeat the exploit.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDavid Svoboda\nDavid Svoboda is a Software Security Engineer at CERT/SEI. He co-authored _Java Coding Guidelines: 75 Recommendations for Reliable and Secure Programs_ and _The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java_. He also maintains the CERT Secure Coding standard websites for Java, as well as C, C++, and Perl, and he has taught Secure Coding in C and C++ all over the world, to various groups in the military, government, and banking industries.\nView more trainings by David Svoboda at https://www.parleys.com/author/david-svoboda\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
