description: "Micosoft Azure has a drag and drop interface that lets you build, train, and test models pretty easily. In this video, I'll explain how Azure compares to other cloud offerings, the idea of the hybrid cloud,  what its services are, and then we'll use its Machine Learning service to build an automobile price prediction model (linear regression).
