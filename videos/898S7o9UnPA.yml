description: "Speaker(s):\nSebastian Thrun\n\nDescription:\nIn the next 10 years, the world's population will grow to 8 billion people of which the majority will be in developing regions. Traditional universities will not be able to keep up with this demand and employers will struggle to find the best talent. With a predicted 5 billion people online by 2025, online education could be the answer to giving billions of people access to affordable, lifelong learning. This session will highlight a new approach to education developed by Google and Udacity, share data on early field results and introduce new credentials that could change the way we view education in our lifetime.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
