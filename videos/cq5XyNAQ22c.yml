language: English
recordingDate: 1521505646
description: "YOW! Conferences have been bringing world-leading industry thought leaders in software and technology to speak and deliver workshops in Australia and Asia for ten years.\n\nChange happens at lightning speed in IT, and knowing what trends and practices to follow and adopt can be confusing. YOW! aims to assist by remaining vendor independent. You won't find any vendor sales pitches, technology platform bias or language preferences at our events.  Speakers are chosen based on their expertise and because they can provide excellent, technically rich content; not on who has a product to sell or who is willing to sponsor an event. \n\nNext events:\n- May 14-15 - YOW! Data in Sydney\n- May 21-23 - YOW! Lambda Jam in Sydney\n\nSign up for our mailing list at yowconference.com.au for more information."
