description: "Ближайшая конференция — Mobius 2020 Piter\n22-25 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/mobius2020piter\n\n. You have a really cool and impactful project, but as soon as your codebase gets bigger, and more and more contributors come into play, things can become challenging in regards to aspects like: code consistency, technical debt, refactoring, application architecture and team organization. Let's jump onboard on this journey and walk through different techniques that can help us keep our code sane and healthy for better scalability. Disclaimer: This talk is going to be focused from a mobile standpoint but most of the practices included can also be applied to any software project under development."
