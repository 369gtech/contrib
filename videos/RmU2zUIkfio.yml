description: "I recently flew to Singapore to give a keynote on AI in healthcare and attend a panel discussion on the same topic hosted by School of AI and sponsored by Accenture. School of AI is a nonprofit with a goal of giving everyone on Earth a world-class AI education for free. This was a launch event for our first global hackathon called Health Hack that will be hosted in over 30 cities around the world by our Deans (community representatives). In this video, you'll learn about automated diagnostics, synthetic biology, drug discovery, and the ethical implications of AI. Enjoy! \n\nLink to the hackathon (RSVP at the city closest to you if there is one): \nhttps://www.theschool.ai/hackathon/\n\nPlease Subscribe! And Like. And comment.
