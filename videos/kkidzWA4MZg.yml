But writing scripts to test your application can be a hassle, especially for specific frameworks or tools like GraphQL. Sure, you could think about unit, integration or E2E-tests. But how do you specifically test your GraphQL schemas and queries? In this talk I'll discuss the approaches to efficiently test a GraphQL server, using patterns and tools that you're probably already are familiar with.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/GraphQLHongKong/events/269158848/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/C0I3P/"
