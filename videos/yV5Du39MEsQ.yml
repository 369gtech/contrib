title: 'Evaluating when it’s time to tackle technical debt'
language: English
recordingDate: 1611831217
description: "Working on technical debt is a necessary part of every engineering teams’ business as usual priority list; but how do you balance work on features and technical debt work? Investing too heavily in feature work could lead to cumbersome systems with potentially cascading failures, and investing too heavily in technical debt work can lead to features necessitated by the customer being left unmade and can effect the sense of progression, and morale, within your teams. \n\nIn this panel, we’ll be taking a look at how to decide when to work on technical debt and when to stop. We’ll be thinking about how to plan ahead, how to prioritise tech debt work and watch for warning signs of larger problems, and discuss how to convey this work to your teams."
