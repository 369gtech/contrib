title: 'RubyConfBY 2018: Sergey Dolganov "Make External API Dependency Great Again (API Contract Testing)"'
recordingDate: 1525773376
description: "Nowadays, unit tests are an essential part of our development process. While we are proud we have 100% test coverage; it does not mean that our code behaves as expected, notably when we deal with external APIs.\n\nI'm working on the eBaymag project which mostly built around various API interactions: eBay API, Google Translate API, DHL API and so on.\nI solve different sophisticated problems based on unexpected API behavior on my daily basis.\n\nSo I want to introduce a contract-based testing framework that aims to get rid of unexpected behavior of your app. I'll share the tools and approaches that will minimize the risks of being dependent on some external system API."
