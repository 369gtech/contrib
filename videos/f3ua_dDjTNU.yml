description: "PyData LA 2018 \n\nBusinesses derive value from their customer base. This makes it critical to forecast the value of a customer to the business -- critical but tricky. We'll introduce probabilistic models for estimating customer lifetime value, look at real world data across industries, and talk about how this fits into a business analysis toolbox (spoiler alert: it's everywhere).\n\nRepo - https://github.com/b11z/pydata-la-18-clv\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
