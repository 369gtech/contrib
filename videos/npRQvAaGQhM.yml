description: "When the browser puts pixels on to screen, there’s a lot of work happening behind the scenes.\n\nWhile it’s well known that “GPU accelerated” is good for silky smooth animations and apps, it’s surprisingly hard to figure out what that really entails and means. This talk is a tour of what goes into painting pixels onto the screen and what we can do to help the browser do it better.\n\nWe will learn more about tiles, layers, compositing, painting and why the GPU is so great at pushing pixels around.\n\nI will also lay out what’s the difference between using CSS, 2D Canvas and WebGL for image manipulation and how antialiasing, filtering and blending work.\n\nEVENT:\n\nFull Stack Fest 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMartin Splitt\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published on Codegram Technologies YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuifyagAeu4\n\nCodegram Technologies YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoOpKfkyCQHW562hXXQAGg"
