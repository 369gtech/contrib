Including\nKubernetes integration and how CNI was born.\n\n\nWeave Net is written in Go, using many Linux kernel features such as veths, bridges and iptables.\nAimed at developers rather than network engineers, Weave Net tries to be self-configuring and\nfind the best available transport between nodes. The control plane operates via gossip,\nwith no central point of control.\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 12:30:00"
