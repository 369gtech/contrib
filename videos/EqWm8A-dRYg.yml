description: "Lets predict the price of Bitcoin using social media data from both Reddit and Twitter with the power of machine learning! We're going to use a technique called sentiment analysis to find the emotions behind the users and try to see if the price correlates with how people are feeling about the popular cryptocurrency. We'll use the CoinDesk API to retrieve bitcoin price data and python to program our app. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/bitcoin_prediction\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like.
