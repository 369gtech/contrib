title: 'Johnny Hooyberghs - Quantum Computing deep dive'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620020872
description: "You've probably heard of Quantum Computing, but it still remains a mystery?\n\nIn this deep-dive session, I will explain important concepts like qubits, superposition, and entanglement. Theoretical knowledge about quantum physics, quantum gates, and quantum algorithms will be associated with practical examples using a real quantum computer on the IBM Q Experience and simulated using Microsoft Q# and Azure Quantum."
