description: "Is it possible to use machine learning without needing to code? The answer is yes! Uber's AI lab recently open sourced python library called Ludwig that they've been using internally for 2 years. The tagline is that it allows anyone to use deep learning without coding. It will require some configuration and unix commands to setup, but I'll show you how in this video. I'll also talk about other code-free tools like Azure ML Studio, DataRobot, and DeepCognition. Enjoy! \n\nCode for this video: \nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/ludwig\n\nPlease Subscribe! And Like. And comment. Thats what keeps me going.\n\nWant more education?
