recordingDate: 1433517223
description: "Visual tools are key for successful modern software products, because they provide an essential competitive advantage in terms of usability trends. This session presents best practices in the development of visual tools—that is, drag-and-drop and graph-oriented components such as those provided by libraries such as JavaFX, JFreeChart, and the NetBeans Visual Library. The session includes a brief case study of the development of UML tools as well as how-to instructions for building customized visual tools. It is intended for developers interested in visual tool development on the Java desktop.\n\n\nAuthors:\nSven Reimers\nundefined\nView more trainings by Sven Reimers at https://www.parleys.com/author/sven-reimers-4\n\nZoran Sevarac\nZoran Sevarac is Assistant Professor at the Department for Software Engineering at University of Belgrade, and a Java Champion. He teaches basic Java course on undergraduate studies, NetBeans Platform as the part of advanced software engineering course \nOpen Source Software, and gives NetBeans Platform trainings. Besides teaching and givin trainings, he contributes to the NetBeans project as the member of the NetBeans Dream Team. He is the founder of Open Source Software Development Center at University of Belgrade, and leader of the local NetBeans community. He also leads development of the open source neural network framework Neuroph, which won the Duke's Choice Award 2013.\nView more trainings by Zoran Sevarac at https://www.parleys.com/author/zoran-sevarac\n\nJaroslav Tulach\nJaroslav Tulach is the founder and initial architect of NetBeans, which is not just a well known IDE, but also the first modular desktop application framework written in Java. \n\nJaroslav will share his API experiences while talking about API Design Checklist - a must have set of rules to follow by every programmer writing code that is consumed by another being.\n\nRegardless how revolutionary NetBeans architecture was at the end of last century, most of it is not slim enough to fit into small devices that rule the world today. NetBeans IDE (as it is) cannot fit into your phone or tablet. Still we want Java that is small enough to run on small devices, phones, plugin-less browsers and more. \n\nThe HTML+Java technology, as designed by Jaroslav fulfills that gap. It is a way to write business ready, yet slim applications once and deploy them everywhere!\nView more trainings by Jaroslav Tulach at https://www.parleys.com/author/jaroslav-tulach-1\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
