description: "DOES18 Las Vegas â€” The presenters look at what holds ITIL back from more successful transformation of IT work, and how we can help it succeed, as DevOps and ITSM finally converge on each other in the common ground of service operations.\n\nCrossing the Streams: 2018 in the Year of ITSM/DevOps Crossover\n\nRob England, Managing Director, Teal Unicorn\nCherry Vu, CEO, Teal Unicorn\n\nRob England B.Sc., CITP is an independent IT management consultant, trainer, and commentator based in Wellington, New Zealand.
