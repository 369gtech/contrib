description: "For the longest time, making a great experience for the user was a business-strategy luxury item. A great product only had to work and ship. A great experience was a nice-to-have, not a requirement. Times have changed. The cost of delivering a product is no longer a barrier to entry. Quality is no longer a differentiator. What’s left? The user’s experience.\n\nEvery part of the organization must be infused with an understanding of great design. Your organization has to cross the UX Tipping Point. You must increase everyone’s exposure to users, communicate a solid experience vision, and install a culture of continual learning. With that, design will become your organization’s competitive advantage.\n\nJared will show you and your team:\n\n- Which path organizations take to become design-infused\n- How a centralized UX team is a stepping stone to a more UX capable organization\n- Why the market needs to demand a better experience before it will matter\n- What your organization will need to do to cross the UX Tipping Point\n\nAbout Jared: https://www.uie.com/\nFollow Jared: https://twitter.com/jmspool\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
