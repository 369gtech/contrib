description: "Jim Grisanzio talks with Amanda Bennett, Tamara Orth, and Alistair Hofert, about their experiences being mentors at the Hackmakers World Innovation Day Hackathon in April 2021. The conversation ranged from what tools and platforms were used, what projects were being worked on, who the participants were, and the overall passion everyone brought to the event. Oracle and other organizations sponsored the event in collaboration with UNESCO and UNEP. The areas of focus for the projects included health, education, and work -- all based on the larger list of United Nations world development goals. #hackathon​​ #oracle​​ #worldinnovationday\n\nAmanda Bennett, Innovation Specialist, Qrius Alliance\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-bennett-a3515b3\n\nAlistair Hofert, Co-Founder, Synapse Squared\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/alistairhofert\n\nTamara Orth, President, QUT BANDS\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/tamaraorth\n\nJim Grisanzio, Sr. Community Manager, Oracle\nhttps://twitter.com/jimgris\n\nHackmakers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9FhYWj0R7LtXLlTE1gZ0Jw"
