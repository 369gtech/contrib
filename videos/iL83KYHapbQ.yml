description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Garrett Wampole, MITRE\nData / Integration Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/applications-of-enterprise-integration-patterns-to-nearreal-time-radar-data-processing \nEnterprise Integration Patterns, a set of software design concepts described in a book by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf and implemented in software by the Spring Integration project, are traditionally applied in the application domains such as business intelligence, supply chain management, and customer relationship management. The topic of this presentation is to describe an experimental methodology of applying Enterprise Integration Patterns to the near-real time processing of surveillance radar data and the engineering trade-offs encountered in the areas of development, deployment, operation, and analysis of ground-based surveillance radar systems with a focus on the Modular Experimental Radar program developed by MITRE for its sponsors."
