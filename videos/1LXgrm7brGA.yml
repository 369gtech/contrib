description: "One of the cornerstones in Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana are cognitive services. Instead of the traditional Screen / Keyboard / Mouse combination for user interaction with your application, it offers different ways of handling user input.\nThink about vision, speech and language – the new way of communicating with your devices – but also how to analyze and structure these kinds of user input.\n\nThis session will give you an introduction on the Cognitive Services Platform – show how it can help your end-users – and with live coding examples you will experience how easy it is to start using this incredibly cool API."
