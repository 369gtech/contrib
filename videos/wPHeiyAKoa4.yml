description: "“With microservices every outage is like a murder mystery” is a common banter. But it doesn’t have to be! This talk gives an overview on how to monitor Spring Boot applications, since they are increasingly popular for building microservices.\n\nWe dive into:\n• System metrics: Keep track of network traffic and system load.\n• Application logs: Collect and parse yourlogs.\n• Application metrics: Get the information from Boot’s metric and health endpoints and store it.\n• Request tracing: Use Sleuth to trace requests through a distributed system.\n• Uptime monitoring: Use Heartbeat to ping services and actively monitor their availability."
