It becomes extremely important for them to maintain consistency and avoid content proliferation. Would you create separate content repositories for each channel such as web, mobile, and business applications? That will create content silos leading to unmanageable synchronization and loss of traceability. How do you prepare for User Interfaces that don’t exist at the time of project inception? Find out how Oracle Content and Experience Cloud Service’s API-first approach allows you to create content just once and deliver it various channels. See how content can be delivered across unforeseeable channels with CEC’s rich set of REST APIs; ChatBots included."
