Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nServerless Performance on a Budget - Erwin van Eyk, Platform9\n\nServerless promises on-demand, optimal performance for a fixed cost. Yet, we see that the current serverless platforms do not always hold up this promise in practice; serverless applications can suffer from cold starts, platform overhead and unreliable performance.  In this talk we will investigate optimizations used in current FaaS platforms and research that helps to optimize the trade-off between cost and performance: function reuse, autoscaling, resource pooling, function locality, predictive scheduling, and autoscaling. Along the way we focus on how users can optimize the Fission FaaS platform to achieve specific goals around latency, throughput, resource utilization and cost.  Following this overview we take a look at the horizon; where lie the opportunities and challenges to make FaaS even faster?\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKT"
