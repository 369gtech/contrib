title: 'Velocity Europe, Jeff Veen, "Designing for Disaster"'
recordingDate: 1320881001
description: 'A few months ago, Jeff sat on a couch in the Typekit offices, staring out the window, and wondering if everything their company had been working towards was about to slip through their fingers. How that story ends is interesting (spoiler alert: the company is still going strong), and Jeff will share lessons on how they got through it and why they were ready for it. But beyond that, he''ll look at how you, your team, your clients, or your company can cultivate a culture of making amazing thingsâ€”not just on the next project, but on everything you work on for the rest of your career.'
