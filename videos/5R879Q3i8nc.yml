recordingDate: 1413464373
description: "Some people contend that the use of data represents an abdication of judgement. Tim O'Reilly (O'Reilly Media) and Doug Cutting (Cloudera) flip the script, exploring the ways in which data helps improve judgement. \"Fundamentally, if you have more data you can make better decisions,\" says Cutting. O'Reilly and Cutting also discuss algorithms outracing humans and how data policy makers can get up to speed on data's real applications.\n\nAbout Doug Cutting:\nDoug (@cutting) is the founder of numerous successful open source projects, including Lucene, Nutch, Avro, and Hadoop. Doug joined Cloudera in 2009 from Yahoo!, where he was a key member of the team that built and deployed a production Hadoop storage and analysis cluster for mission-critical business analytics. Doug holds a Bachelor’s degree from Stanford University and sits on the Board of the Apache Software Foundation.\n\nAbout Tim O'Reilly:\nTim O’Reilly is the founder and CEO of O’Reilly Media. His original business plan was “interesting work for interesting people,” and that’s worked out pretty well. He publishes books, runs conferences, invests in early-stage startups, urges companies to create more value than they capture, and tries to change the world by spreading and amplifying the knowledge of innovators.\n\nTim is also a partner at O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, a founder and board member of Safari Books Online and Maker Media, and on the boards of Code for America and PeerJ.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop World 2014: http://goo.gl/UUfrR7\nFind out more about the conference: http://strataconf.com/stratany2014\n\nDon't miss an upload!
