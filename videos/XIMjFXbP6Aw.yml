description: "Understanding design in our age is like being able to read in the Middle Ages, it gives you an advantage in communication. No matter how technically advanced your product is, design is what sells it. Unfortunately, not every project has a dedicated designer. Furthermore, to effectively implement graphical designs, it is necessary for a developer to understand why a design is the way it is. In this session we would like to discus a concepts like proportions, composition and color that can help developers understand design and employ these in those moments when no designer is available. This talk gives the developer some practical insights into the world of design which are immediatly applicable to his/her job.\n\nErwin is a Software Architect in the Sogeti Java Center of Excelence. He designs software solutions based on open source technology and helps teams getting started with their projects. Next to this he is a certified Scrum Master and trainer of several Java courses. He also supervises graduates during their final thesis. Erwin likes to share knowledge by giving workshops and presentations."
