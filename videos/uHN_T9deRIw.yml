Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in Barcelona, May 20–23 (https://bit.ly/2B2vhMl), in Shanghai, June 24–26 (https://bit.ly/2JZcBjs), or in San Diego November 18–21 (https://bit.ly/2K031wW) in 2019.\n\nKube-Arbitrator: A Batch System of Kubernetes - Da Ma, IBM & Ti Zhou\n\nKubernetes started as a general purpose orchestration framework with a focus on serving jobs. But as it gains popularity, users want to run BigData and AI frameworks on Kubernetes, such as Spark, TensorFlow, etc. When running these batch processing frameworks in a multitenant system like Kubernetes, advanced scheduling features, e.g. fair-share scheduling, gang scheduling, become more important. In 2017, we launched a project into incubation, named kube-arbitrator, to provide policy-based resource scheduling for BigData and AI frameworks to meet these advanced scheduling and resource sharing requirements.  In this presentation, we will describe how we're trying to do batch scheduling in Kubernetes, and our journey building these components out of core.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKC"
