description: "No doubt, companies have optimized their processes and structure according to the needs of traditional software development methods. The ones that start using Agile methods understand, that the they need to change management of projects/products portfolio as well as teams composition to get the full value of Agile. This very often means company organizational structure changes.\r\nIn the presentation I share my experience gathered while changing structure of two organizations to be applicable for Scrum. I give advices how to organize project/product portfolio, so that company could respond to clients requests quickly, do all support work, and do not to multitask (which is one of the greatest bottlenecks for efficiency). I will also give few tips how to organize the work so that it could be accomplished by stable teams. Practice shows that stable teams become up to few times more productive that \"project teams\" created for each project."
