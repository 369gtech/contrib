description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nDuring this tutorial, weâ€™ll build a serverless Slack bot to help identify & classify aircraft images using Machine Learning services on AWS. This will include creating and configuring an AWS Lambda-backed Slack bot for interacting with users, and configuring & using Amazon Rekognition and SageMaker for object detection and classification.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
