title: 'Bayesian Data Analysis of Nonparametric Models in Clojure - Michael Lindon'

recordingDate: 1507842288
description: 'A research team of statisticians and neuroscientists at Duke University are using Clojure to analyze how neural codes in the brain encode information from two simultaneous sources. It is hypothesized that neurons may interleave signals through a process commonly used in telecommunications known as multiplexing. We have formulated a Bayesian model which addresses such a hypothesis and performed inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo in Clojure. We have found evidence of such multiplexing behaviour and have found Clojure to be well suited to performing Bayesian data analysis.'
