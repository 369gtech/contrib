language: English
recordingDate: 1540498847
description: "José Pereda, Software Engineer, Gluon\nJohan Vos, CTO, Gluon BVBA\n\nStarting with JDK 11, JavaFX has become available as a separate download, decoupled from the core JDK. Different bundles of JavaFX 11 can be downloaded for different platforms. When it comes to embedded devices, where JavaFX hasn’t been supported, the challenge is getting the native binaries for the ARM platform in the first place. This session explains how to get started with JavaFX 11 on embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi and showcases the successful story of a Belgian project in which a Pi was used in kiosks as an autonomous check-in device for handling passes for cultural events."
