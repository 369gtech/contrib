recordingDate: 1372706052
description: 'The with() function makes it easy to access many variables (columns) in a data frame for one-off calculations, the within() function can be used to create new columns that are merged with the original data frame, and aggregate() is useful for aggregating variables in a data frame across groupings based on one or more variables.'
