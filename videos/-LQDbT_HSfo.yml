description: "Deconstructing Apache Hadoop: A Dialogue About a Cloud-Native Refactor - Anu Engineer & Marton Elek, Cloudera \n\nMany existing applications like the Big Data stack is in a community debate over moving to K8s. They see it as the future, but there are lots of unknowns and complex problems to solve. This is a dialogue between two developers who are exploring and trying to finding the true path to becoming Cloud Native.    In this talk, we will discuss in detail our experiences and issues that we have faced in moving the Hadoop Object store Ozone as a Cloud native storage solution that runs on top of K8s.    We will take a deep dive into the advantages and challenges that we faced during this journey â€” having a cluster manager like K8s allows us to move away from managing physical details and instead focus on the storage part. Some of the challenges were things like security and how we tackle that. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYI"
