title: '"Functional Composition" by Chris Ford (2013)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1617628189
description: "Music theory is one of the most naturally elegant and functional domains. It's a perfect fit for Clojure, which is why the Overtone audio environment makes hacking sound so much fun.\n\nChris will start with the basic building block of sound, the sine wave, and will gradually accumulate abstractions culminating in a canon by Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\nBy the end you should agree that anyone who's a developer is a musician too - even if they don't know it yet.\n\n\nChris Ford\nhttps://twitter.com/ctford\nThoughtWorks\n\nChris Ford has been fascinated by functional programming since he first stumbled across Haskell during a misguided attempt to study electrical engineering. He came to his senses, and has spent the last six years happily coding in various countries across the world. He now lives in Kampala, working for ThoughtWorks Uganda."
