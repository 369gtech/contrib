description: "by Jon 'maddog' Hall\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/Janson/fossh.webm\n\nmaddog reviews the past twenty years of FOSSH, and dares to predict the next twenty years.\nLast year maddog gave a talk about computer science and FOSSH from 1969 to the present, but compressing fifty years of computer science into fifty minutes (OK, maddog took more time) was hard.\n\n\nThis year maddog will be talking about the twenty years leading up to today and making projections (always dangerous with maddog, because they often come true) into the future.\n\n\nWith only another fifty years to cover, maddog may actually stay within his time slot, but bring a beer (just in case).\n\nRoom: Janson\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 15:00:00"
