description: 'With the N preview Google introduced Java 8 for Android platform. Java8 *Language Features* that is. Sadly/luckly it''s not full Java 8 support and only some cool features are now available such as: static and default interface methods, a few extra annotations and ... everybody''s favourite Lambda expression! But that''s all boring. So in the second part of my presentation we''ll learn about Jack & JIll, and Jayce and .jack file format too! I will try to explain who the hell they are and what is the difference between the old and the new Android toolchain.'
