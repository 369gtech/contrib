title: 'Java EE Microservices with WildFly Swarm by Peter Palaga'
language: English
recordingDate: 1504105801
description: "In this talk, we will explain how Java EE applications can fit into architectures based on Microservices. After a brief introduction to Microservices, we will introduce WildFly Swarm, its purpose, core concepts and capabilities. We will demo how to \"swarmify\" a traditional EE Application into a single JAR containing the Application together with \"just enough\" Application Server. We will cover not only the basics (build, package and run) but also a few advanced topics, such as configuration, secure access (Keycloak), Load Balancing & Circuit Breaking, Service discovery and API documentation (Swagger).\n\nPeter Palaga\nPeter Palaga is a Senior Sustaining Engineer for JBoss EAP at Red Hat and the main author of srcdeps. Maven builds and maintenance of complex dependency hierarchies belong to his daily duties. In his present and past roles, he was involved in various efforts to package and provision WildFly/EAP applications and runtimes."
