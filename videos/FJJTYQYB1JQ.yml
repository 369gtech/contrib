It is a fundamental task in Computer Science, both on its own and as a step in other algorithms. Efficient algorithms for sorting and searching are now taught in core undergraduate classes. Are they at their best, or is there more blood to squeeze from that stone? This talk will explore a few less known – but more allegro! – variants of classic sorting algorithms. And as they say, the road matters more than the destination. Along the way, we'll encounter many wondrous surprises and we'll learn how to cope with the puzzling behavior of modern complex architectures.\n— \nAndrei Alexandrescu\nThe D Language Foundation\nVice President and Treasurer\nBoston MA\n\nAndrei Alexandrescu is a researcher, software engineer, and author.
