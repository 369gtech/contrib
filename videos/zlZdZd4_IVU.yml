description: "ANViL: Advanced Virtualization for Modern Non-Volatile Memory Devices\n\nZev Weiss, University of Wisconsin—Madison; Sriram Subramanian, Swaminathan Sundararaman, and Nisha Talagala, SanDisk; Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau and Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau, University of Wisconsin—Madison\n\nWe present a new form of storage virtualization based on block-level address remapping. By allowing the host system to manipulate this address map with a set of three simple operations (clone, move, and delete), we enable a variety of useful features and optimizations to be readily implemented, including snapshots, deduplication, and single-write journaling. We present a prototype implementation called Project ANViL and demonstrate its utility with a set of case studies.\n\nView the full FAST '15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast15/technical-sessions"
