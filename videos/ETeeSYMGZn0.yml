language: English
recordingDate: 1495227205
description: "Find out how you can make use of Google's machine learning expertise to power your applications. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers five APIs that provide access to pre-trained machine learning models with a single API call: Google Cloud Vision API, Cloud Speech API, Cloud Natural Language API, Cloud Translation API and Cloud Video API. Using these APIs, you can focus on adding new features to your app rather than building and training your own custom models. In this session we'll share an overview of each API and dive into code with some live demos.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/D0D4VE\nWatch more Android talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/c0LWYl\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/Q1bFGY\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/pmO4Dr\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\n#io17 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2017"
