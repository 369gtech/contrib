language: English
recordingDate: 1573074628
description: "Jenkins X, an open-source project introduced to the community by CloudBees, enables the rapid creation, delivery, and orchestration of cloud-native applications based on continuous delivery best practices and the proven Kubernetes platform. Reimagining Jenkins in a Kubernetes world, Jenkins X puts the developer experience front and center. It is providing all the (CI/CD) tools, an intuitive command-line interface, and pre-build workflows to hit the ground running.\n\nAfter introducing what Jenkins X does and how it is opinionated, we'll explore some of the commonly used features of Jenkins X.\n\nWe will kick-start a CI/CD pipeline for a new application, import an existing application, and last but not least look at creating temporary environments (previews) for handling Pull Requests.\n\nJoost van der Griendt:\nJava developer turned CI/CD/DevOps consultant. I am working as a consultant at CloudBees, where I help customers implement CI/CD, Pipelines, and scale good practices throughout their engineering org. We base our flagship product on Kubernetes, and our latest OpenSource product - Jenkins X - helps automated CI/CD with GitOps on Kubernetes. Iâ€™m also a contributor to Jenkins X."
