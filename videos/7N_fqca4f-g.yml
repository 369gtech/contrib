title: 'Dieter Hubau - Spring Cloud Stream: a new Rick and Morty adventure'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531299559
description: "Any fans of the adult animated science-fiction sitcom Rick and Morty will be very curious after reading that title! We will go on an adventure inside the Microverse and create several microservices called Rick, Morty, Mr Meeseeks and McDonalds. The mission: to spam McDonald's with requests in our search for the long-lost 1998 Mulan Szechuan sauce.\n\nJoin me in their adventure and experience the wonders of messaging with Spring Cloud Stream and a reactive frontend powered by Vue.js and event streams."
