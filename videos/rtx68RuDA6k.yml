During those years, Mr.Yu painted thousands\nof watercolors\nand countless sketches. After coming to America in 1997, he was till\ntrying to express my feelings toward Chinese folk houses through\npainting.\n\nAt the age of globalization and information technology, Mr.Yu found\nthat most people have a hard time to appreciate the traditional\nChinese culture he fought\nto preserve.
