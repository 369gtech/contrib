recordingDate: 1540310341
description: "Matt Raible, Developer Advocate, Okta\n\nMicroservices are all the rage and are being deployed by many Java hipsters. If you’re working with a large team that needs different release cycles for product components, microservices can be a blessing. If you’re working at your VW restoration shop and running its online store with your own software, having five services to manage and deploy can be a real pain. Share your knowledge of and experiences with microservices in this informative and code-heavy session. You’ll learn how to use JHipster (a Yeoman generator) to create Angular + Spring Boot apps on separate instances with a unified front end. You’ll also learn about options for securing your API gateway and individual applications with JWT and OAuth."
