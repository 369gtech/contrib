description: "In this talk we’ll look at GenStage, an Elixir library to structure demand-driven data flows.\n\nThe talk will be example-driven: we’ll start with a data-pipeline application written without GenStage and put it under heavy load. By doing that, we’ll have a first-hand account of the issues that GenStage aims to solve.\n\nWe’ll then look a revised implementation of the same data pipeline that uses GenStage to see how it solves the issues found in the original version of our application.\n\nKey takeaways\nEvent processing with Elixir\nWhat problems may arise when processing events\nHow GenStage can solve them\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
