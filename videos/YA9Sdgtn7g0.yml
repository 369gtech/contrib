title: 'Mirror Your Users Session - Shilo Magen'
recordingDate: 1544358509
description: "Understanding our users’ behavior in our application, is super important, but how many of us are really familiar with how to build an application that records every step, click and scroll of the user.\nWhy we shouldn’t just understand the behavior, only by investigating complex tableau tables? \n\nWhy do we need to watch it? Isn’t it a total waste of time?\nAnd we understand that it's not, how can we record a session, watch and investigate it on another machine?\n\nA few months ago, Shilo asked himself the same questions. He built a simple and powerful prototype which does all of the things I described above.\n\nIn his talk, he demonstrates an easy way you can mirror your user’s session and provide yourself with a fast solution, in 30 minutes only!\n\nThis talk was given by Shilo at Web Standard Days Conference (https://wsd.events/), Kiev, Ukraine.\n\nShilo Magen is a software engineer @Wix.com. A Frontend enthusiast since the age of 12. He loves to simplify the magic and provide my own interpretation to things that blow my mind."
