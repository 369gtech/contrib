title: 'Curtis "Ovid" Poe - "Modeling a Universe in Perl"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498106608
description: "With Tau Station, we're building a sci-fi universe in a browser. However, in object oriented design, what does the \"single responsibility principle\" mean when your combat armor serves as armor, a weapon, and medkit?\n\nAnd when many different behaviors have long chains of duplicated requirements (for example, do you have enough money to buy a medkit, or refuel your ship, or repair your blaster, or bribe a guard), how do you handle that in an efficient an easy to read manner?\n\nAnd how do you avoid god objects when your character in the universe drives almost everything?\n\nThis talk explores some of the techniques we've developed for the Tau Station to easily model complex behaviors.\n\n\nI'm Curtis \"Ovid\" Poe, the CTO of All Around the World, a consulting firm specializing in Perl. I sit on the board of directors of The Perl Foundation and have written or co-written two books on Perl. I've also written or hacked on many of the testing tools you use on a daily basis and am a prolific CPAN author."
