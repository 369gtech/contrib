description: "Mobile isn't everything, but it's not far off. The mobile web of today includes devices out at the edge of the web’s considerable reach, with unexpectedly harsh limits on available CPU imposed by batteries and thermal throttling. Our assumptions about what we can “afford” are off. Not by a little; by a lot. Modern apps often include an order of magnitude too much script...and your Macbook Pro doesn’t make this obvious, and your framework might have hidden costs. Frameworks and apps need to adapt. Learn how to diagnose bloat for yourself, techniques for attacking it, and how to keep your app under a reasonable performance budget from start to finish.\n\nMissed the summit?
