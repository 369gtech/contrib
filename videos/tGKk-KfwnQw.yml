recordingDate: 1544126022
description: "Change is inevitable, but performance and development enthusiasm is optional. Kubernetes can become very complex with all the objects that need to be handled in addition to releases that you operate with. The goal of this session: address complexity with development passion.\nIn this session Ana will explain and demonstrate (in code) how you can simplify Kubernetes complexity with Helm: templates, values, requirements and pod specifications made easier and reusable."
