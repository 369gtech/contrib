description: "\"Data-driven and machine learning-based equipment monitoring solutions have become increasingly sophisticated and prevalent. Continuous cloud-based execution of trained workflows is now a key requirement of gaining operational value from those solutions.\n\nThis talk is aimed at data scientists and machine learning engineers developing machine learning-based workflows for equipment monitoring in heavy asset and other industries. Specifically this will be of interest to third party developers like ourselves who are interested in learning how off the shelf offerings for deploying such workflows as web-hosted APIs compare between the major cloud providers.\n\nWe will present some example workflows developed using open source python packages including pandas, scikit-learn, Keras and ADTK (anomaly detection toolkit). We will then compare the frameworks for deploying those workflows as cloud-based web services using Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. In particular, we will present comparisons of the wrapper code required and our findings on any current framework limitations in moving these offline trained workflows to the cloud.\"\n\nMachine learning based workflows for heavy asset equipment monitoring are becoming more prevalent. We will present example workflows typical in these industries developed using Python. We will then compare options for 3rd party developers like ourselves in deploying those workflows as web hosted APIs using frameworks provided by the major cloud service providers, namely GCP, Azure and AWS.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
