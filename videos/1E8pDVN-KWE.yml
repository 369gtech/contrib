description: "Building a NLP pipeline to detect relationship between fictional characters\n\nAbstract:\nWho's this guy again ? Every time we start watching the new season of our favorite show, we find ourselves asking this question. What if we didn't need to binge watch all the previous seasons ? What if we could just look at a graph summarizing all the characters and their relationship to one another ? All this information is available on the Internet, but there is no easy way to use it because the data is unstructured.\nThis talk will demonstrate how to use Natural Language Processing to extract a relationship graph from any TV show\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
