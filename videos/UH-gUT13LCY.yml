title: 'DOES15 - Cornelia Davis - My Great Awakening: Top “Aha” Moments As Former Dev Manager'
recordingDate: 1446773246
description: "Cornelia Davis, Sr. Director, Platform Engineering, Pivotal\n\nAfter spending her entire career as a software developer, with nary a moment doing operations, Cornelia Davis found herself working on an application platform that serves operations as much as development. In order to better understand that world, she spent one month on the team that runs that platform in production. The experience brought lessons in organizational design, the value of pair-ops (in addition to pair programming) and test-driven development, the importance of addressing continuous integration as a first class concern, and how separating infrastructure ops from application ops serves the business and their customers better. In this session Cornelia will share the “prod incidents” that brought these teachings; the audience will gain an appreciation not only for what, but why these practices and tools are so important."
