description: "You've got a JavaScript project and you're coming round to the idea of TypeScript. You like the idea of static typing and improved IDE experience. It is finally time to make the move, but how do you go about it? Is this going to be a big and inconvenient change to the codebase?\n\nWhat if I said you could take it step by step? What If I said you could stop halfway and still gain a lot? \n\nOver this talk we'll take an existing JavaScript project and move it to TypeScript, noting the new benefits we get at each step of the transition. By the end you'll have a blueprint for moving your project to TypeScript and be confident that you can go as far as you and your team needs to."
