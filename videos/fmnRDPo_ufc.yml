description: "This year one of our speakers will be James Turnbull (CTO of Kickstarter), who would you rather network and learn from as a Lithuanian CTO of a growing start-up?\n\n“Build Stuff” is a Software Development Conference created for developers, academics, team leaders, software architects and technical project managers.\nSoftware development is a worldwide industry, so it’s not surprising that there are many developer conferences around the world that are worth participating in and attending. However, in November 2012, when the conference was first held, there were no such dedicated conferences for developers in the Baltic States, let alone Lithuania. Now, Build Stuff has become the largest developer event in the region."
