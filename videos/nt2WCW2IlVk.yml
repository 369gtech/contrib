language: English
recordingDate: 1499694603
description: "We're all agile now, but some of us are still more productive than others. In this talk you'll gain an insight into one of the key characteristics of a successful continuous delivery SaaS business; in a single word: Feedback! With an interesting collection of stories from rocket engineering, electrical engineering, and software engineering, we're going to re-examine why agile development is now the norm. Take away lessons can be applied to everything you do including how you design software, how you release software, how you maintain software, and even how you get promoted.\n\nBjorn Freeman-Benson joins New Relic as the Vice President of Engineering following an interesting career in software tools, most recently with the Eclipse Foundation supporting the leading open source Java IDE. Prior to that, he ran engineering for a reconfigurable hardware startup. Earlier in his career he held senior engineering positions at Amazon.com, Rational, and OTI. Bjorn holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Washington and spends his spare time orienteering, bicycling, or flying.\n\nFor more on YOW!
