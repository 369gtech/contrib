description: "Let’s imagine a perfect release of feature(s)? What development process is needed? How organize life-cycle stages in terms of decision-making points? How to reduce risks and bottle necks impact? What about the team properties? What can you change in own project or product right now?\n\nI will try to answer for all these questions. All answers based on my long-year development (sometimes rapid :) experience of complex fintech projects/products."
