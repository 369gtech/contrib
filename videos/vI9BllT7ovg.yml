description: "Why was AlphaGo's Move 37 against Lee Sedol so significant? Why was it so important that I named my 10 week course on deep reinforcement learning on it? In this final video of my course, I'll explain what move 37 symbolized for humanity and detail 3 examples of how it will affect healthcare, design, and decision-making. We'll go through a code example of a Generative Adversarial Network and even discuss China ambitious 2030 AI initiative.  Theres a lot that I cover in this video, I hope that it helps connect the dots. Enjoy! \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/minigo\n\nWant more education?
