description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nReal-time Kubernetes: How Entain Australia 10x'd throughput with Linkerd - Steve Gray, Entain Australia\n\nEntain Australia operates a large scale Kubernetes deployment consisting of 300 microservices, 3000 pods, and multiple Kubernetes clusters across multiple regions. Due to the nature of Entain's business, this system must be as close to real-time as possible. In this talk, the Entain team describes how they moved from connection-level load balancing to request-level load balancing and increased overall application throughput by an order of magnitude by installing Linkerd. They discuss the impact of Linkerd's load balancing on gRPC calls, the decision-making process for choosing a service mesh, and lessons learned rolling out a service mesh to production."
