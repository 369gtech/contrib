We will talk about tools, the disputed use of email, Skype, Slack but more specifically about time management, what you can expect from yourself and from other members of the remote team. Is your company “remote-friendly” or rather “remote-first”? When it’s time to spend a few days in physical proximity with your colleagues? We will share some examples out of the experience of a distributed team actively working with Python and Django on a daily basis, and show how you can make it all work, if you work on it.\n\nAlessio Bragadini"
