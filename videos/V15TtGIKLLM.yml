description: "Speaker: Florian Hopf\n\nFlorian Hopf is based in Germany and will be visiting us in Singapore. He wrote a book on Elasticsearch, blogs on http://blog.florian-hopf.de and has tons of experience on anything that is search-related as well as Java technologies. \nFlorian will walk up through Java clients for Elasticsearch. As communication is based on HTTP and JSON, Elasticsearch can be used with nearly all programming languages. But still, using Elasticsearch with Java is special. The current standard client connects via an internal protocol \nthat brings some advantages and disadvantages and there are different alternative clients and abstractions. \nThis talk will show you the basics of Elasticsearch and how to choose a client that suits your needs.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/234987866/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/ZtlI/"
