description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nModern C++ includes ample facilities for manipulating types a compile time. These facilities have evolved from a small bag of miscellaneous tricks to an large bag of miscellaneous tricks. It turns out we can select a subset of these tricks to build a representation of abstract algebra within the C++ type system. This methodology will help programmers select and exploit the C++ type manipulation facilities to create more transparently correct, efficient and maintainable programs. \n\nThis session does not presuppose and particular mathematical background. It depends upon only the most basic and key ideas of abstract algebra which will be explained as part of the presentation. \n\nThis work was initially inspired by work by Barton and Nackman as well as some ideas from Denotational Semantics.\n— \nRobert Ramey\nRobert Ramey Software Development\nProprietor\nSanta Barbara, CA\nRobert Ramey is a freelance Software Developer living in Santa Barbara, California.
