language: English
recordingDate: 1510141205
description: "Today’s applications need real-time, not only for data but also for events. You want your users to know immediately when something new happened: mention, blog post, pull request, ... But what is the best way to interact in real-time with APIs when the refresh time is unpredictable?\n\nYou’ve probably heard about WebHooks, and perhaps about WebSub too. Perhaps you even know that one is based on the other. But do you know what are their differences, how to implement each and more important: when to use each?\n\nIn this session we’re gonna dive into each technologies to find the answer to previous questions and, of course, we’ll see them in action with some live coding demo!\n\n# Audrey Neveu\nAudrey is a passion driven developer with experience in both web frontend and backend development, specialised in APIs and BigData. Heavily involved in the European wide Java Community, she’s part of Devoxx4Kids, a not-for-profit global initiative to get children coding."
