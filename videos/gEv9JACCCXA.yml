title: 'Webinars: Encrypting data in Kubernetes deployments. Protect your data, not just your Secrets'
language: English
recordingDate: 1588800484
description: "The DevSecOps migration has many steps and Secrets is a good start, but it only provides storage and management of sensitive information such as passwords, tokens and keys. What about the data? Data encryption is considered a fundamental security requirement in any enterprise deployment, but the legacy method of implementing an encryption solution breaks down in Kubernetes environments. Weâ€™ll discuss why granular data-at-rest encryption integrated into a Kubernetes storage layer is the best strategy to address security vulnerabilities unique to Kubernetes deployments.\n\nPresenter:\n\nMaksim Yankovskiy, VP of Engineering @Zettaset"
