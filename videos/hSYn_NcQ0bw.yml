description: 'Django Girls is a non-profit organization that empowers and helps women to organize free, one-day programming workshops by providing tools, resources and support. Our goal is to bring more amazing women into the world of technology and increase the diversity in the Django community. We believe that technology is for people and everyone should be able to build it. We are making technology more approachable by creating simple tools and resources designed with empathy. In my talk, I will share on how Django Girls was started and the journey travelled so far in empowering women across the globe.'
