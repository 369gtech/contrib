description: "Adam  Powell, Richard Fulcher\n\nAn app is useless if people can't find their way around it. Android introduced big navigation-support changes in 3.0 and 4.0. The Action Bar offers a convenient control for Up navigation, the Back key's behavior became more consistent within tasks, and the Recent Tasks UI got an overhaul. In this talk, we discuss how and why we got where we are today, how to think about navigation when designing your app's user experience, and how to write apps that offer effortless navigation in multiple Android versions.\n\nFor all I/O 2012 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/io/"
