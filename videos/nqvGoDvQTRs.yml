description: "RustConf 2019 - The Symbiotic Relationship of C++ and Rust by Isabella Muerte\n\nFor better or worse, Rust and C++ have a shared future ahead of them. C++ will affect the design of Rust, and so too will Rust affect the design of C++. Rust's future is most likely the same path as C++, but what does that mean exactly? In this talk, we'll learn about the evolution of these languages, how much they have in common, the power their respective communities have to shape them, and the responsibility these communities have to each other."
