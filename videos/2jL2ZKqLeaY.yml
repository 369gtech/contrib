description: "DevOps-as-a-Service: Towards Automating the Automation\n\nKeith Pleas, DevOps Architecture Senior Manager, Accenture\n\nt’s clear that DevOps is evolving – but to what end? Software maturity models show that while we’ve come far at automating infrastructure, we are only about half-way on the journey to automating DevOps itself, or what will be called software-defined DevOps.\n\nAccenture has been operating a multi-tenant enterprise CI/CD pipeline for clients for more than 10 years in what has become DevOps-as-a-Service, and we will be share our patterns for success, as well as the pitfalls. Then we will look to the future, where history has shown that models and a higher-level of abstraction will thrive.\n\nWhether you view evolution as a theory or fact, our corner (or curve) of the software lifecycle will be next to be automated – with profound implications for all of us.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
