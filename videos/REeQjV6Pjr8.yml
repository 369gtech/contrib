Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nKubernetes Explained the Easy Way, Using Computer Games... - Steven Trescinski, Gluo\n\nHow do you explain some of the basic Kubernetes constructs (i.e. nodes, pods, rolling updates, image tags, deployments,...) together with their concrete use cases in a fun and memorable way to people that have never heard of Kubernetes before?  The above was the challenge I was faced with when preparing my talk titled \"Orchestrating the Container Chaos\" for a group of Belgian students. So I started looking for something that most engineering students can relate to...  I ended up modding a first-person shooting computer game to interact with the Kubernetes API to visualise some of the main Kubernetes constructs. During this talk I will explain the tools/technologies used and hopefully inspire others to think outside of the box when preparing for technical talks.
