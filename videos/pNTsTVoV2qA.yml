description: "Speaker: Michael Plod, InnoQ\nIn the second installment of Pivotal’s five-part webinar series on Domain-Driven Design, we will take a look at how domains, subdomains and especially bounded contexts relate to each other.\n\nYou will leave this webinar knowing how to use context mapping and the context map’s patterns, like shared kernel, anticorruption layer or published language, among others, to analyze existing applications or application landscapes for possible transformations of monolithic applications. And you will understand how the idea of a bounded context can relate to microservices.\n\nPart 1: Overview and Core Values of Domain-Driven Design\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0zpSB85XGs"
