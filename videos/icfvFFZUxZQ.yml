One opportunity is the liberty to choose the tech stack one deems most fitting (or likes best). Yet a wrong decision will cause major headaches in the future.\n\nThis talk will shed light on how Elixir helps to build reliable products in a short amount of time. It will also discuss what drawbacks it has compared to other languages.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/michael-schaefermeyer/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MICHAEL SCHAEFERMEYER\nSuccessfully taught Elixir to juniors and built start-ups in it.\n\nMichael started using Elixir in 2014 at his job at Bleacher Report, where he introduced first proof of concepts in Elixir, some of which developed into crucial services still in use today. He went on to co-found Inverse.com, where he wrote the vast majority of backends services in Elixir. He wrote a few hex packages, including CORSPlug and Boltex, a driver for the binary protocol that Neo4j. After Inverse Michael joined the company builder lab25 in MÃ¼nster, where he acted as interims-CTO for startups written in Elixir.\n\nMore on Michael Schaefermeyer: https://codesync.global/speaker/michael-schaefermeyer/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
