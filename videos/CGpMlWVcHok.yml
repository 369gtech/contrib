title: 'Building a Custom React Renderer | Sophie Alpert'
recordingDate: 1572485843
description: 'There''s a little-known npm package named react-reconciler that lets you build your own React renderer. React DOM and React Native themselves are built on top of it. And with it, you can build your own. In this talk, we''ll build a simple version of React DOM. With any luck, you''ll walk away with a better understanding of React.'
