description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: will be added soon\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\n“Microservices” is certainly a buzzword. Everybody wants to work on microservices applications. However when working on such a project you’ll soon realize that a buzzword doesn’t magically make your application work. And there will be a lot of challenges that you’ll face on this journey. During this session I will share my experience from the trenches of a microservices project aiming to make developers aware of the different challenges you’ll mostly won’t see at conferences. I will also try to illustrate my experiences with relevant code samples."
