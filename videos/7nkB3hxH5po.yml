description: "Come hear a lively overview of the new features in JDK 7, including the language changes of Project Coin, the filesystem and other I/O features from NIO.2, and the new invokedyamic JVM instruction.\n\nJoe Darcy\n\nOracle\n\nJoe was the lead engineer of Project Coin and specification lead for JSR 334, the effort to select and implement a set of small Java language changes for JDK 7. From its inception in 2007 until March 2011, Joe was also the release manager, lead engineer, and quality lead for OpenJDK 6, an open source implementation of the Java SE 6 platform. A longtime member of the JDK engineering group, Joe was previously specification lead for JSR 269, the Pluggable Annotation Processing API, which delivered a standardized annotation processing API and mirror-based language model into JDK 6 to supersede the earlier apt tool from JDK 5. Joe assisted in implementing the JDK 5 language changes with work spanning core reflection, javac hacking, and general library support. Joe blogs at http://blogs.oracle.com/darcy."
