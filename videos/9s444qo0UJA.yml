title: 'Crafting hiring processes that reduce bias and create consistency | Panel discussion'
language: English
recordingDate: 1606131773
description: "Nobody builds a hiring process with intentional bias, but sometimes practices that are commonplace in the tech industry can unintentionally create unequal starting grounds for candidates. And data shows that it’s not just about what happens within an interview, but also about how job descriptions are written and shared, how candidates are treated throughout the hiring funnel, and in the offers that are made.\n\nIn this webinar, we’ll explore how to create equitable hiring processes. We’ll consider how to write job descriptions that don’t create artificial barriers for potential applicants, how candidates can be assessed consistently and comparatively across interviews, and how to minimise practices that amplify biases."
