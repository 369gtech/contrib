Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Secure, Least Privilege Cloud Service provisioning with Crossplane - Lewis Marshall, Appvia Ltd\n\nProviding production ready and secure cloud services for applications, whether that’s a database, cache, or object store is more of a challenge than just provisioning. Security and resilience is essential for application teams to deliver lasting business value. Crossplane provides a self service developer capability but challenges exist around ensuring secure and suitably scoped cloud service provisioning. We’ve investigated “least privilege” for Crossplane resource provisioning. We uncover how to enable the best practice of cloud managed identities with Crossplane with appropriately secure access. Through collaboration with large organisations and a desire to contribute to the Crossplane community, we aim to enable developer self service with maximum security."
