recordingDate: 1605206078
description: "Understanding, maintaining and securing Envoy's supply chain - Michael Payne, Harvey Tuch\n\nEnvoy depends on over 60 external dependencies for its data and control plane functionality, as well as for its build, test and features such as observability. This talk will provide an overview of the third party dependencies that constitute the Envoy software supply chain. We will enumerate, categorize and describe the key dependencies, with a focus on security and how they relate to the Envoy threat model. The talk will cover how Envoyâ€™s dependencies have been maintained, versioned and tested, how the Envoy community plans to evolve and increase confidence in the supply chain, as well as how organizations can apply strategies to minimize unnecessary dependencies."
