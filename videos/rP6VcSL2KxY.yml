title: 'Use Azure Custom Vision to Repurpose the Lunar Rover'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604077218
description: "The Lunar rover has been instrumental in helping us advance our understanding of the Moon and our Universe, and in the new Netflix Original, Over the Moon (https://www.netflix.com/title/80214236), it makes an appearance when Fei Fei lands on the moon with her buddy Bungee and brother Chin. In this video, Dr. G will build an image classifier using Azure Custom Vision to identify Bungee so that the Lunar Rover can capture in-the-moment pictures of Bungee (and not rocks) on the Moon and send them to Fei Fei to keep as memories!
