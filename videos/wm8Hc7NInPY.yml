description: "Lions, Tigers and Bears!!! Kids, technology and Code!!! That Conference and Family!  \n\n4 years ago we said we wanted to create a family friendly conference and over the years we've worked hard at creating exposure to today's technologies in a fun and safe environment but we're just getting started. Between the Water Park, Robots and Animals there is a lot going on at That Conference. Come here about our family vision, understand why we have had to make some hard decisions all while getting a few camping tips.   \n\nMore importantly I want you to hear from a few of our fellow parents, and kids who have been involved since we pitched our first tent. We're proud of their journey and think you should hear their story too.\n\nListen to Katelyn, Cori and Richard talk about the importance of kids being exposed to software programming."
