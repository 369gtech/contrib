description: "Open source usage is accelerating rapidly with Gartner predicting by 2018 that 80% of the global 2000 codebase will be open source. Why? OSS results in more time and cost efficiency in application development, with higher quality code, tested by a broad community. Chances are, open source is already in your mission-critical applications. However, not having a policy around open source is one of the problems organizations now have to address. If you’re like most of us, you think about open source entering your codebase when a developer, under a tight deadline perhaps, grabs a pre-built component from the internet, perhaps from Github or a similar website. But open source can get into your applications in a number of ways – and keeping track of all of them can become pretty difficult. On top of this, in 2015 there were over 3,000 open source CVE’s published in vulnerability databases. This is up from 283 published in 2000. During this breakout session, we will discuss the reasons for the increase in open source vulnerabilities published, why open source has become such an attractive target for hackers and the best practices for organizations to protect themselves.\n\n# Ron De Jong\nRon de Jong is the Sales Engineer for BeNeLux and Southern Europe at Black Duck Software. Organizations worldwide use Black Duck’s industry-leading products to automate the processes of securing and managing open source software, eliminating the pain related to security vulnerabilities, open source license compliance and operational risk."
