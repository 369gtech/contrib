description: 'In game design, we trust our senses. Is this mechanic fun? Is this Environment beautiful? Is this story emotional? Is the game GOOD? However, as time passes and our project evolves, so do we. We are not the same person we were a minute ago, a month ago, a year ago. How can we maintain a steady vision if we ourselves are a constantly changing, complex interlacing of feelings and ideals? A practical look at how to establish a strong identity for a project: the beacon which will lead future decisions in design, art and production.'
