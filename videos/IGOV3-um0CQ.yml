description: "Presenter: Nathan Schutta\n\nRich Hickey once said programmers know the benefits of everything and the trade-offs of nothingâ€¦an approach that can lead a project down a path of frustrated developers and unhappy customers. As architects though, we must consider the trade-offs of every new library, language, pattern or approach and quickly make decisions often with incomplete information. How should we think about the inevitable technology choices we have to make on a project? How do we balance competing agendas? How do we keep our team happy and excited without chasing every new thing that someone finds on the inner webs?\n\nAs architects, it is our responsibility to effectively guide our teams on the technology journey. In this talk, I will outline the importance of trade-offs, how we can analyze new technologies and how we can effectively capture the inevitable architectural decisions we will make. I will also explore the value of fitness functions as a way of ensuring the decisions we make are actually reflected in the code base.\n\nLearn more about the VMware Tanzu portfolio here: https://cloud.vmware.com/tanzu"
