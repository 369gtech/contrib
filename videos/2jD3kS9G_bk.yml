description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nAugust 31, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nImplementing a National Health Monitoring Evaluation and Case Surveillance Interface in Haiti (Lessons and Perspectives)\r\nPresented by Kurt Jean Charles.\r\n\r\nThis talk is about the experience of SOLUTIONS' team of software developers on a project financed and piloted by CDC's office in Haiti in support to the Ministry of Health. It will include a demo of the solution deployed actually in Haiti and used by all the institutions (private, public and ngo) involved in HIV care in the country but will also stress the challenges this team went through in: a) designing simple, time sensitive yet effective processes and electronic tools underlining the national data collection system b) defining a consistent electronic approach for data collection at different aggregated level and at the individual electronic medical record level (HMIS flavors) c) promoting awareness, transparency, accountability and advised decision-making based on publicly available statistics. It will be also an opportunity to share positive vision and ideas about continuously improving this tool for Haiti and soon for other countries."
