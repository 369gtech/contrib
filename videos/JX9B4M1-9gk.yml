description: "Scala is currently riding a wave of popularity, and consequently many Scala web-application frameworks have emerged. Lift is one of the earliest Scala web frameworks and is used by the likes of Foursquare, The Guardian and other high-profile websites. Lift offers several unique approaches to web development. For example, it has a very distinct view-first rather than controller-first approach.\nIn this session we will explore how Lift uses Scala and functional programming to create a highly productive, secure and interactive web-application development stack."
