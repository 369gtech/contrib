language: English
recordingDate: 1495023456
description: "Microsoft has changed significantly. Microsoft has joined the Linux Foundation, is the largest contributor to GitHub, joined the Eclipse Foundation as a Solutions Member and has just brought out Visual Studio for Mac. This session will look at how the cloud based Visual Studio Team Services can help drive DevOps through continuous integration, continuous deployment and continuous testing. Youâ€™ll see a demo of a Java Maven based project, with source in GitHub being built and deployed into the cloud onto a Linux server. No Windows OS will be used in the delivery of this demonstration.\n\nGiles Davies enjoys working with solutions that support the entire software development team. In his role as a Visual Studio technical specialist at Microsoft he covers the full Application Lifecycle Management tooling of Visual Studio, Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Online, using the cloud for Dev and Test and enabling DevOps with continuous integration, deployment, delivery and telemetry.\n\nGiles joined Microsoft in 2008 and previously held various roles including that of developer, technical lead, software architect, consultant and project manager. He has used a range of development processes including formal methods, Rational Unified Process and Scrum and is a regular speaker at both Microsoft and independent events."
