title: 'YOW! West 2017 Rob Ciolli - Reactive Programming in the Real World'
recordingDate: 1498912205
description: "Reactive programming can be a difficult concept to grok. Even once a you have an understanding of the basic principles it can be difficult to see how to use this technique in a real world context.\n\nThis presentation will attempt to bridge the divide between conceptual understanding and day to day usage. Through the use of (redacted) code examples from production code, I will illustrate how reactive techniques can be used. Also I will make a case for why these patterns should be adopted.\n\nWhile these code example are from a swift app running on iOS (using RxSwift and ReactiveCocoa) these concepts are relevant to Reactive programming in any language.\n\nSenior Software Developer at REA Group\n\nFull stack polyglot Futurist, Agilist and Junglist.\nMobile developer with no religious affiliation with either iOS or Android.\nCurrently slinging code at REA.\n\nFor more on YOW!
