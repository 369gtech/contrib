title: 'YOW! 2016 Matt Ranney - What Comes After Microservices?'
recordingDate: 1483401030
description: "The results are in: developers LOVE microservices! But are microservices in their current form solving more problems than they create? Many early adopters are finding new limitations as they deploy hundreds or thousands of microservices. Are there perhaps better abstractions than microservices that we could be using instead?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll cover the limits that some companies have encountered in their large microservices deployments and some non-microservices approaches to those same problems. Since I work at Uber on this very problem, we’ll also talk about the non-microservices systems that Uber is building to maintain developer productivity with a large and growing engineering team.\n\nMatt works on architecture and distributed systems at Uber. Like most engineers, he spends a lot of time thinking about distributed databases. Before Uber, Matt was co-founder and CTO of Voxer where he wrote a lot of software for node.js, including node_redis and node_pcap.\n\nFor more on YOW!
