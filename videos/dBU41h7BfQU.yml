description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nClient-side tokens seem to be the default answer to the authentication challenge with Single Page Applications nowadays - but for questions like 'Where to store them?' or 'How to revoke them?' the answer is not that straight forward. This talk outlines attack vectors and trade-offs to make when using JSON Web Tokens to build a secure authentication solution for Single Page Applications.\n\nStefan Achtsnit is Head of Advanced Services at Best Gaming Technology (www.best-gaming.com). Stefan guides the data driven journey at BGT. Developing software in the .NET and Java enterprise space for 12 years, he constantly strives for the right balance between being innovative and pragmatic of what is actually needed.\n\nThis talk was held at the WeAreDevelopers Conference 2016 in Vienna, Austria: www.wearedevelopers.org"
