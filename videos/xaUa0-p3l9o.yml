title: 'Create: DevOps'
language: English

description: "Microsoft’s Donovan Brown defines DevOps as, “the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.” \n\nMicrosoft Create is back again and we are going to talk about everything DevOps. Together with our community speakers, we share with you how to break down the silos of development and operations teams with the tools and processes that set them up for success. DevOps is more than just CI/CD, it’s about cultural shifts within your organization.  \n\nJoin us at \"Create: DevOps\" as we discuss about automation, cloud native, infrastructure as code, and security.  To put this all into practice, we will end off with a short workshop on creating infrastructure using Bicep and GitHub Actions."
