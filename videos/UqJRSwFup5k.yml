description: "Subscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nYou probably work on a distributed system. Even if you don't yet face a serverless microservice architecture using fancy NoSQL databases, you might simply call some remote services via REST or SOAP. Welcome to a world without ACID transactions which leaves you in charge of dealing with difficult problems yourself e.g. eventual consistency, distributed transactions, compensation or message delivery semantics like \"exactly-once\". In this talk, Iâ€™ll briefly describe why this will become the new normal and which challenges arise for us as developers. I will discuss strategies to deal with it and present real-life experiences, recipes, patterns and frameworks. Expect fun little live hacking sessions with Open Source components like Spring, Hystrix, Kafka and Camunda.\n#Serverless #Kafka #Spring\n\nPresented by Bernd Ruecker\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
