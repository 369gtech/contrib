recordingDate: 1581616935
description: "A quick code blog to talk about some things I've learned about DataURIs and trying to get 60fps animations. The audio wasn't nearly as good in this one as it was the previous. I'll make sure to figure out why.\n\nAs always checkout Level Up Tutorials here: https://www.leveluptutorials.com/\n\nand listen to myself and Wes Bos on Syntax here: https://syntax.fm/\n\n\nLet me know what you think of this VERY relaxed format. \n\n\n* Disclaimer - This was not paid for in any way by any service mentioned in this video, these are my honest real-time opinions."
