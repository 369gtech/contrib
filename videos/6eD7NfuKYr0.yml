What is left to be done, in order to obtain a flat panorama, is projecting the spherical image onto a picture plane. This step is unfortunately not obvious: the surface of the sphere may not be flattened onto a page without some form of distortion. Distortions are also unavoidable when mosaicking images taken while the point of view changes or/and the scene changes (e.g., due to objects moving). In such cases no geometrical consistent mosaic may be obtained. Artists have explored this problem and demonstrated that the geometrical consistency is not the..."
