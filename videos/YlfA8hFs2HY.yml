title: 'Onyx: Distributed Computing for Clojure - Michael Drogalis'
recordingDate: 1447699048
description: "Does your application need to manipulate more data than a single machine can handle? Have you tried Hadoop, Storm, or Spark but felt it didn't quite fit your problem?\n\nOnyx is a new distributed, masterless, fault tolerant computation platform written specifically with Clojure developers in mind. It gracefully composes many concerns that other frameworks complect: computational structure, data flow, stateful lifecycles, deployment, and more. Its superpower is its ability to create distributed workflows at runtime in an ad-hoc fashion. In effect, Onyx allows you to bridge the gap across programming languages, execution environments, machines, and time. Since its release, Onyx has become one of the highest performing open source streaming platforms, burning in on official benchmarks at over millions of messages per second.\n\nAbout the speaker: Michael Drogalis is the inventor of Onyx and founder of Distributed Masonry. He specializes in designing high-throughput analytics products."
