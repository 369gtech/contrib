description: 'Gradle has evolved quite a lot since its inception. It is a well-recognized build tool in the JVM ecosystem. Many worship its power, but also many complain about its design, excessive flexibility and integration options. Let us see the good parts of Gradle (and also mention some of the not so good ones). Gradle provides great power, which should be used responsibly.'
