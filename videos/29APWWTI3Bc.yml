description: "These days new Ruby releases are regarded with less and less fanfare. We rejoiced at all the new features and support of Ruby 1.9 and 2.0! Since then, we've become a bit jaded: \"Refinements? Yeah, they're OK.\" \"Immutable String pragma? Yawn!\" \"yield_self? Don't we already have tap?\n\nIn fact, Ruby has delivered in myriad ways over the last several releases. From more support for functional-style programming to vast speed improvements, the Ruby core team is firing on all cylinders. Let's talk about what's been done, what's on the horizon, and get excited about programming Ruby again!\n\nEVENT:\n\nGORUCO 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJoe Leo\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjR3GU0-vpc&t=341s"
