title: 'Jani Eväkallio - When “Good Enough” - Just Isn’t Good Enough'
recordingDate: 1536920819
description: "The history of UI programming is littered with frameworks that failed because they compromised user experience in favour of rapid development. As a technology, React Native has what it takes to avoid this fate, but it’s up to us to prove it by building delightful experiences that feel native to the platform. The question “does it feel native?” encompasses a breadth of topics: predictability, performance, gestures, motion, sensors, sound, and more. For those of us coming from web development, there’s a lot to learn. This talk explains what users really expect from our apps, and how we can use React Native to not only meet, but exceed their expectations.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
