description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThis presentation will describe how we bootstrapped a C++11/C++14 environment from the ground up, to essentially provide the ability to execute “user-space” like applications inside the Linux and Windows kernel. We leveraged this C++ environment and the Standard Template Library (STL) to create the first open source, cross platform, cross architecture, hypervisor that can support both baremetal (i.e. type 1) and late launch (i.e. type 2) virtualization models. Topics include the benefits of using C++ over C when creating a hypervisor as well as how we handled compilation, module loading, global constructor / destructor support, and of course, full exception support. If you have ever wondered how C++ works under the hood, or are interested in learning more about C++, this presentation is for you.\n— \nRian Quinn\nAssured Information Security, Inc.\nPrincipal Investigator\nDenver, CO\nDr. Rian Quinn is a Senior Principal Investigator in the Trusted Information Systems Group at Assured Information Security, Inc. were he has focused on trusted computing and hypervisor related technologies for nearly 10 years. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering with specializations in Information Assurance and Computer Architectures from Binghamton University. He is a lead developer and co-founder of the Bareflank Hypervisor, and is an active member of several open source projects including OpenXT. Specialties: computer architectures, virtualization, operating systems, kernel programming, cyber security, and open source.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
