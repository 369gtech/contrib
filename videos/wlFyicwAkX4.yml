description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Csaba Kozák, Supercharge.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=175149\n\nEveryone was crazy about annotation processing, but then Kotlin started to appear on the horizon. With Kotlin growing up, developers began to back away from annotation processing gradually, mainly due to its performance issues and the new Kotlin features that were able to replace it in some of the cases. But developers could not get away from it 100% - there were, and are plenty of scenarios when their co-existance with Kotlin is still required. In my talk, I am going to introduce you to how to write and test annotation processors that behave well even in Kotlin projects."
