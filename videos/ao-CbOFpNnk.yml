This presentation brings up how and why we decided to make the switch, what our development infrastructure looks like, and the joys and sorrows of starting to use Python in a traditional Windows shop.\n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
