title: 'Is It a Car? Is It a Computer? No, It’s a Raspberry Pi JavaFX Informatics System'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784670
description: "Since 2001 all gasoline engine cars sold in Europe have been required to be fitted with a European On Board Diagnostics (EOBD) interface. Low-cost connections to it provide WiFi access to raw car system data. The Raspberry Pi provides a low-cost ARM-processor embedded system for multiple uses. This session looks at how Embedded Java can communicate with the diagnostic and management systems of an Audi S3 to process this data. With the addition of a touchscreen, the presentation shows, JavaFX can be used to provide an in-car informatics system for less than $200. With an accelerometer to measure the forces affecting the car, the acceleration and speed can be calculated and added to the display. The session includes videos of the system in action.\n\n\nAuthors:\nThomas Angelucci\nTom Angelucci, Director of Product Marketing is part of the Oracle Fusion Middleware team and primarily focused on product marketing for Java & the Internet of Things (IoT).
