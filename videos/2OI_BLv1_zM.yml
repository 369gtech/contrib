description: "With ES2015 the JavaScript specification changed to a yearly release schedule. Since then we already got another three updates, namely ES2016, ES2017 and most recently ES2018. This puts a lot of pressure on JavaScript VMs to not only keep up with implementing all these new proposals, but continuously think about ways to optimize them, so that developers can not only rely on them being available, but also having reasonable performance.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll give an update on the state of the ES201X features and their performance in V8, the JavaScript engine that powers both Node.js and Chrome.\n\nEVENT:\n\nYou Gotta Love Frontend 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBenedikt Meurer\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuWSbTEkzSU&t=31s"
