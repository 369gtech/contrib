description: "Kubernetes at Reddit: An Origin Story - Greg Taylor, Reddit, Inc \n\nDespite being ranked in the top 20 busiest sites in the world, Reddit has been a small engineering organization for most of its 13 years. However: the last few years have seen us multiply in size by 7x, causing our tooling, process, and culture to creak and groan. Discussion, evaluation, and experimentation led to our decision to incorporate Kubernetes.  This session takes the audience through the motivations, the story, and the results of rebasing our infrastructure on Kubernetes. Today, Kubernetes forms the core of our internal Infrastructure \"product\", which is a paint-by-numbers experience that engineers of all backgrounds make use of.  The audience will see how and why a small (but rapidly growing) organization operating at a unique scale shifted to Kubernetes, get practical tips and advice, and _maybe_ some dank memes. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrRp"
