description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nOur objective was to build a connected intelligent shopping cart/basket, which will detect, which products have been placed in it and will generate shopping recommendations for the current cart user. We have used the state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system - YOLOv2, which deep architecture has been reduced to accelerate the evaluation on the Raspberry PI device and the IntelÂ® Movidius.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
