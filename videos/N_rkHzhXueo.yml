description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nRegular expressions are widely used in application development and data processing, yet it is challenging to design and implement a regular expression library that is expressive, efficient and safe.\n\nIn this talk, Tim Shen, the current maintainer of libstdc++'s ＜regex＞, will introduce the basics of implementing regular expressions in C++, the status of existing implementations, and what is expected from the standardization process.\n\nFor the implementation, several data structures and algorithms will be introduced, with pros and cons listed; we will show how several popular implementations (Boost.Regex, Boost.Xpressive, ＜regex＞ from standard library implementations, RE2, etc) pick their algorithms. Several popular features/patterns that hurt performance will be explained, with a \"safe\" regex usage suggested. Finally a wishlist of features will be presented, in order to deliver a more efficient and usable regex library.\n— \nTim Shen\nSoftware Engineer, Google\nTim Shen is a compiler engineer in Google LLVM team. His major focus is the performance of C++ on various LLVM backends. He also maintains libstdc++'s ＜regex＞.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
