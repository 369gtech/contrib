description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/brianleroux/after-html5-mobilism-2011\n\nThe world is enthralled with this next ambitious iteration of the web labeled HTML5. An amazing array of new features including: offline access, client storage, media, webfonts, new form elements, canvas, svg, css and more. While the spec is still being worked on most of these things are here today in most modern browsers. So what will be next? There are more web enabled handsets than television sets. But this isn't the whole story. Mobiles bring a whole new level of intelligence to computing by way of enhanced sensors and contextual data. This next revolution, Device APIs, is being prototyped in the PhoneGap project. Join Brian for a rowdy look at the not so distant future of the web.\n\nAbout Brian: https://brian.io\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
