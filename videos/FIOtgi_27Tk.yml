title: 'Offline first and search on steroids with Couchbase Mobile and Elastic Search - Vegard Haugstvedt'
recordingDate: 1574361421
description: 'Wouldn''t it be great if you could have a single, use-everywhere solution to creating offline-first apps? One that takes care of synchronization of data, has a flexible data model and workes with iOS, Android and Windows Phone? Coucbase Mobile is that solution! I will show you how easy it is to get up-and-running, as well as how to integrate with Elasticsearch to get state-of-the-art search capabilities (when online). As a bonus, I will show you how PouchDB can use the same infrastructure for Progressive Web Apps.'
