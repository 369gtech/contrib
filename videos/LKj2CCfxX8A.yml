title: 'React Native EU 2021: Lars Thorup - Sub-second integration tests for your RN app & Bluetooth device'

description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nThis talk is targeted developers creating apps for a Bluetooth device, such as a loudspeaker, a toothbrush or a dishwasher. I report on my experience using the technique of \"mock recording\" to get very fast and robust integration tests. \n\nIn collaboration with SOUNDBOKS, a Bluetooth speaker company, I have developed an open source tool for creating and using recordings of Bluetooth (BLE) traffic to test a React Native app using Jest. The tool makes it possible to run several integration tests per second as opposed to several minutes per end-to-end test. The tool is based on years of production experience using mock recording for web traffic. \n\nIn this talk I introduce the methodology, perform a live demonstration of the tool, and report on our experience using the tool during app development: how is the quality and speed of feedback from these tests, and how easy is the tool to use for developers? \n\nThe tool is available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-ble-plx-mock-recorder.\n\n\nLars is an experienced software developer, architect and coach. Lars is an expert in fast and robust test automation with a track record of successfully running 200+ integration tests per second. Currently Lars focuses on web and mobile development with React and React Native.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/larsthorup\n\nGithub: https://github.com/larsthorup\n\nAdditional Links:\nLink to slides: https://www.fullstackagile.eu/2021/09/02/react-native-bluetooth-ble-mock-recording/"
