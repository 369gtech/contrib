title: 'Mobile at Scale with React Native - Lev Vidrak'
recordingDate: 1571747912
description: "At Wix.com we are building our mobile app with React Native from the first commit. We started working with React Native three years ago and today we are one of the biggest projects written with React-Native. We are tens of mobile developers, across many different teams, writing code that is integrated into one mobile app and able to release a version to production almost every day.\n\nScaling a production-grade application without compromising on performance and dev velocity, drove us to think more like an OS to allow each team easily integrates their module into the main Wix’s React Native mobile app.\n\nIn this talk, we will start from the basic concept of React-Native and understand how it fits with multi-module architecture in mobile. Following that, Lev demonstrates the full mobile development process at Wix, starting from developer’s push, through the building process, testing and releasing the app to the stores.\n\nFor more engineering updates and insights:\n\n* Follow us on Twitter → https://twitter.com/WixEng\n* Subscribe our monthly newsletter →  https://www.wix.engineering/subscribe\n* Visit our blog →  https://www.wix.engineering/blog\n* Follow our Medium publication →  https://medium.com/wix-engineering"
