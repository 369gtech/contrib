description: "With the introduction of Async/Await .NET developers never had asynchronous code this easy before. Finally, every programmer could create a multi-threaded app.\nYeah, right!\n\nIt’s nearly four years since that official launch of .NET 4.5 and there is still a significant level of misunderstanding on what Async/Await actually provides and when to use it.\n\nI think it’s time to rewind and get back to basics and ask some fundamental questions.\n\n* Is your application CPU intensive, or I/O intensive?\n\n* How many CPU threads will your application actually be running on?\n\n* Are your business requirements suitable for asynchronous processing anyway?\n\nWe’ll check out the great advantages of Async/Await, highlight some gotchas and take a look at the other ways of creating multi-threaded applications so you can select the right approach for the problems you have."
