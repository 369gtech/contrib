description: "Presenter: Hannah Foxwell\n\nGood collaboration between Platform Teams and Application Teams is critical for delivering any production service. Practices such as site reliability engineering and continuous delivery must be understood by everyone to be effective, but creating that shared understanding can be hard in an existing organization. In this talk, Hannah and Jérôme will provide a simple guide to getting started.\n\nOur experience has shown us that Platform Teams and Application Teams don’t talk enough, and we don’t talk about the right things. This session will give you four simple questions to start that dialogue—you might be surprised what you learn if you ask the right questions!"
