description: "LISA16 - Behind Closed Doors: Managing Passwords in a Dangerous World\n\nNoah Kantrowitz\n\nSecrets come in many forms, passwords, keys, tokens. All crucial for the operation of an application, but each dangerous in its own way. In the past, many of us have pasted those secrets in to a text file and moved on, but in a world of config automation and ephemeral micro-services these patterns are leaving our data at greater risk than ever before.\n\nNew tools, products, and libraries are being released all the time to try to cope with this massive rise in threats, both new and oldâ€”but-ignored. This talk will cover the major types of secrets in a normal web application, how to model their security properties, what tools are best for each situation, and how to use them with major web frameworks.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
