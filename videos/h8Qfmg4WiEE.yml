In a ferromagnetic Ising model, for any v, w ?V(G), setting the spin of v to +1 makes the spin at w more likely to be +1. A natural and elegant conjecture due to Kenyon, Mossel, and Peres states that the strength of this \"influence\" of v on w can only decrease when some other vertices' spins are fixed. We prove some partial results in this direction and discuss the obstacles to a full proof. We also discuss a related conjecture of Peres on a monotonicity..."
