description: "\"Microservices involve many, many moving parts. Many organizations have dozens, if not hundreds, of services in production. Each service is more than source code, with a wealth of surrounding context, such as who works on it, what endpoints it exposes and how it’s built.\n\nImagine if you could update all relevant projects to use a new version of a framework, introduce a new monitoring technology, change an important configuration option or modify how deployment takes place, in a single operation. \n\nImagine if you could route a piece of information to precisely those developers who care about it: For example, developers who work on a particular service or on services that consume it.\n\nIn this talk Russ Miles will show you how all of this is achieved using the new Atomist suite of open-source, Chatops tools and services.\""
