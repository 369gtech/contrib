title: '"The magical fantasy land of Linux kernel testing" - Russell Currey (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579238170
description: "Russell Currey\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/106/\n\nThe Linux kernel does a lot of stuff, and runs on a lot of stuff.  I'm sure we can all agree that this is a good thing, however the matrix of stuff it does and stuff it runs on continues to get bigger and bigger!  With thousands of commits each release and a widely distributed and decentralised developer community, how do we make sure that the kernel still works on everything, does everything it's supposed to do, and hasn't slowed anything down in the process?\r\n\r\nIn this session we're going to be looking at the huge variety of automated kernel testing projects to figure out what's going on, covering a variety of different areas, including:\r\n\r\n- per-patch CI to quickly test if a developer broke something,\r\n- built-in kernel selftests and the push for more unit testing,\r\n- performance testing of the kernel itself and userspace,\r\n- regression testing, especially for known security issues,\r\n- hardware testing, from enormous 512TB machines to huge farms of small SOCs.\r\n\r\nBy understanding the huge web of projects out there, hopefully we can figure out how we could get more stuff done more effectively.  It's a difficult problem in the broad and uncoordinated space of Linux kernel development, but it's all in pursuit of the dream: \r\n\r\nthe magical fantasy land - with no duplication of code or effort, where everything is tested, where everyone knows where everything is, and where bugs are never introduced again.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
