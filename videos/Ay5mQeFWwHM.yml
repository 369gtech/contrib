Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKeynote: Accelerating Adoption of Fluentd/Fluent Bit With Confidence- Hisatomo Takana, ITOCHU Techno-Solutions (CTC) America, Inc.\n\nFluentd/Fluent Bit CNCF projects have been accessible to everyone as we embrace the community effort to bring vendor-neutral, unified, and robust approaches. Through our Fluentd community survey, we have discovered some challenges that community members have when using Fluentd/Fluent Bit.\n\nIn this session, we will discuss our approaches on how to reduce operational challenges. We have been contributing to \"Diagtool\", which is already available in td-agent, allowing you to automate troubleshooting. In terms of security, we developed the \"Sanitizer\" plugin which masks sensitive information on the fly and helps you to solve security incidents such as data breaches by making data meaningless for attackers.\nWe, ITOCHU Techno-Solutions America, Inc, are a part of the community to accelerate the adoption of Fluentd/Fluent Bit through commercial services and contributing plugins/tools for our community."
