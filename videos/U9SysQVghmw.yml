description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nPanel: Navigating Your Career in Open Source - Megan Bigelow & Rachel Leekin, VMware; James Munnelly, Independent; Ria Bhatia, Independent; & Faz Sadeghi, Red Hat \n\nThe goal of this panel is to share with a broad audience that it does not require a singular path or skill-set to arrive into this space. Additionally, everyone sitting on this panel has access and privilege that must be acknowledged, so we will also dive into what they are doing personally, with this access, to effect positive change within their sphere of influence and how others can do the same.  Panelists will engage in an honest discussion framed by the following questions:  Discuss your career journey, how did you get where you are? Where do you think you got help in getting where you are? What personal steps are you taking to ensure open source, and particularly Kubernetes, is a community that has opportunities for a broader audience (read: those outside of dominant culture)? What’s one key piece of information you want the audience to take away from this talk?\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zes2"
