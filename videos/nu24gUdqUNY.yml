description: "How do you move on-premises enterprise applications to a Software as a Service model? Using Kubernetes and Java Application Server Operators, Intris NV, an end-user, moved to the cloud without any overhead of re-design and re-development. In this session we will discuss options considered for migration and show how Intris is making use of Kubernetes, Kubernetes Operators and Prometheus.\n\nRe-developing applications can be a costly endeavor both in time and skills. This session will be useful for software vendors looking to improve agility and cost-savings while leveraging existing skills and knowledge."
