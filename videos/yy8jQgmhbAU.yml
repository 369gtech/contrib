description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nFor decades C++ developers have built software around OOP concepts that ultimately failed us - we didn’t see the promises of code reuse, maintenance or simplicity fulfilled, and performance suffers significantly. Data-oriented design can be a better paradigm in fields where C++ is most important - game development, high-performance computing, and real-time systems. \n\nThe talk will briefly introduce data-oriented design and focus on practical real-world examples of applying DoD where previously OOP constructs were widely employed. \n\nExamples will be shown from modern web browsers. They are overwhelmingly written in C++ with OOP - that’s why most of them are slow memory hogs. In the talk I’ll draw parallels between the design of systems in Chrome and their counterparts in the HTML renderer Hummingbird. As we’ll see, Hummingbird is multiple times faster because it ditches OOP for good in all performance-critical areas. \n\nWe will see how real-world C++ OOP systems can be re-designed in a C++ data-oriented way for better performance, scalability, maintainability and testability. \n— \nStoyan Nikolov, Coherent Labs AD\nChief Software Architect\n\nStoyan Nikolov is the Chief Software Architect and Co-Founder of Coherent Labs. He designed the architecture of all products of the company. Stoyan has more than 10 years experience in games. Currently he heads the development of Hummingbird - the fastest HTML rendering engine in the industry and of LensVR, the first VR-centric web browser. Previously he worked on multiple graphics & core engine systems and on large-scale ERP solutions. Stoyan has degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computer Graphics. He is interested in high-performance computing, graphics, multithreading, VR and browser development.\n\nCoherent Labs AD\n\nCoherent Labs is a leading game middleware company that develops cross-platform game user interface products. It aims to solve complex problems for major gaming companies such as Arena Net, NCSoft, Bluehole, and hundreds of others, and to help them create stunning and high-performance UI. Using its experience in web, game technologies, and user interface, the company is developing a Virtual Reality browser.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
