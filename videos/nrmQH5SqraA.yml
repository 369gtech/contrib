This deep dive provides a holistic end-to-end view of how to secure microservices using industry standard protocols and Spring. The goal is to present how standards such as JWT, JWA, JWS, JWE, JWK, OAuth2, OpenID Connect, TLS can be combined to make writing secure microservices easy.\n\nThe deep dive will alternate between slides that explain the security standards and protocols and code walkthroughs/live coding showing how to apply the patterns and standards using Spring Security 5.1. We will demonstrate the following patterns and their implementations.\n\nWeb SSO Login\nImplementing OAuth2 resource servers\nImplementing edge service gateways\nToken Exchange in a microservice call chain\nToken Relay in a microservice call chain\nIntegration with OpenID Connect / OAuth2 Servers\nFeatures of Spring Security 5.1 that make it easier to secure microservices\nWe assume no prior experience with security standards or Spring Security. However, we assume that you are comfortable reading Java code and web development.\n\nJoe Grandja \nFrom Pivotal\nJoe Grandja is a core committer on the Spring Security team. He has been leading the efforts in building the next generation of OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect 1.0, and JOSE framework support in Spring Security 5.\n\nJoe has over 20 years of industry experience in the role of Solution Architect, System Architect, Software Engineer and Consultant.
