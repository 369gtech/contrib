description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nDocker is a platform that helps developers and ops teams to build, ship and run their applications. It's a complex system made up of a number of components, many of which are open-sourced under the Moby Project umbrella. This talk looks in detail at one of these components, LinuxKit, which is an open-source toolkit for building custom, minimal, and immutable Linux distributions. Docker uses LinuxKit to create the minimal host OS (a container OS) which ships as part of the Docker Desktop editions — in active use by developers all over the world. We will go through how LinuxKit is put together and demo how to use it to build your own, customised container OS within minutes — without compromising on security or usability. This talk will also cover announcements made at DockerCon and how LinuxKit enabled those features and integrations."
