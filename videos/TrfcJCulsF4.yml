description: "Why use Reverse Polish Notation? How does it relate to trees in Computer Science? Professor Brailsford explains how RPN arises naturally, as a linearized form of a tree. \n\nFor further research, the Prof suggests you seek out material on the topics of \"Postorder Tree Traversal\" and \"Dijkstra's Shunting Yard\" \n\nCorrection: In the graphic at 06:30, on the illustration of the second tree, the A is incorrectly labelled as a C.\n\nReverse Polish Notation & the Stack: http://youtu.be/7ha78yWRDlE \nThe Dawn of Desktop Publishing: http://youtu.be/1rCNnMZrFUQ \nUpside Down Trees: http://youtu.be/umTbivyJoiI \nDomino Addition - Numberphile: http://youtu.be/lNuPy-r1GuQ \n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
