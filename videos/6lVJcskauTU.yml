The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nIntroduction to Data Protection WG in Kubernetes - Xing Yang, VMware & Xiangqian Yu, Google \n\nData Protection WG in Kubernetes was formed following discussions at KubeCon in San Diego. This is a Working Group dedicated to promoting data protection support in Kubernetes, identifying missing functionality and working together across multiple SIGs to design features to enable data protection in Kubernetes. In this session, the co-chairs of this WG will explain the motivation behind the formation of this WG, the charter of this WG, who are involved, what is the current state of data protection in Kubernetes and where it is heading in the future. They will also talk about how interested parties (including backup and storage vendors, application developers, and end users, etc.) can join this WG and contribute to this effort. Details of the WG can be found here: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-data-protection.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeuM"
