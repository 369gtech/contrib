recordingDate: 1563984048
description: 'Essential part of modern UX is to get rid of forms, especially on mobile devices. Implementing the standard Web Payment APIs will not just improve the user experience, but increase the chance of maintaining your users. In this presentation we will discuss the basics of implementing the APIs, the available gateways, and show some demos and how they resonate in the era of PWA. We will also discuss the current limitations, and how the future will look like towards standardizing those APIs.'
