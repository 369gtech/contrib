description: "From Engineering Operations to Site Reliability Engineering\n\nNathan Mische, Comcast\n\nOver the past three years my team has transformed from an operations team composed of System Administrators who ran services developed by other teams or vendors into a DevOps team composed of SREs who work closely with other engineering teams to create exceptional entertainment and online experiences. This presentation will share some of the strategies that helped make this transition a success, including having a strong vision for the team, fostering management and HR support, strategic performance management, a refined interview processes, internal and external networking, playing “Moneyball”, and using internal programs to grow the team.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
