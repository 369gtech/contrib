But once you have functions deployed, how do they interact with each other? How message navigates between them? Maybe, just maybe, it's time to look back again at EIPs - Enterprise Integration Patterns, and their use in this new way of deploying code to the Cloud. This talk will cover primarily the use of one of the key EIP frameworks - Apache Camel - and top patterns applicable to Serverless Computing using Functions services by Cloud vendors as part of the demonstrations.\n#Serverless #ApacheCamel #EnterpriseIntegrationPatterns\n\nPresented by Bruno Borges\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
