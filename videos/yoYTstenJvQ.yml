The bug, which affected the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library, notably compromised the confidentiality of 4.5 million US patient records and cost the industry an estimated $500M. \n\nIt was soon revealed that the root-cause of the issue was that OpenSSL was precariously understaffed. Open source sustainability became a major theme overnight. Stories of maintainer burn-out made the headlines. And tentative solutions started to emerge, most of them donation-based. \n\nIn this talk we'll explore a number of existing strategies to fund open source and make it more sustainable, from patronage to dedicated ad networks. And we'll defend the idea that the best path to open source sustainability is to help companies understand the tangible business value they can get from contributing to open source. \n\nRoom: UB5.132\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:30:00+01"
