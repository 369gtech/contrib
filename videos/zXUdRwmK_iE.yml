title: 'Nick Heiner - How to Run a High Functioning Team @ DevConf 2017'
language: English
recordingDate: 1506671204
description: "What’s the difference between teams that hit their goals quarter after quarter, and those that miss? Why do some teams become life-long friends, whereas others are riven by drama and rage-quitting? How does a team get the most value out of a practice like standup, and when is it just going through the motions?\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss both philosophical approaches and specific methods to constructing a high performing team. We'll look at high- and low- functioning ways to do specific practices, like code review, as well as the big picture of how to keep everyone working happily together.\n\nBy the end, you’ll be inspired to process-hack on your own team to improve velocity and team happiness! \n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
