description: "Google Tech Talk\nOctober 22, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by Raymond Blum\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSystems like GMail and Picasa keep massive amounts of data in the cloud, all of which has to be constantly backed up to prepare for the inevitable. Typical backup and recovery techniques don't scale, so Google has devised new methods for securing unprecedented volumes of data against every type of failure.\n\nThere are many unique challenges, both obvious and subtle, in delivering storage systems at this scale; we'll discuss these and their solutions as well as some alternatives that didn't make the grade.\n\nAbout the speaker: Raymond Blum leads a team of Site Reliability Engineers charged with keeping Google's and its users' data safe and durable. Prior to coming to Google he was the IT director for a hedge fund after spending a few lifetimes developing systems at HBO and on Wall Street. In his meager spare time he indulges his interests in robotics and home automation and reads too much science fiction."
