description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nSpring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development move swiftly and enjoyable.\nIt's ideally suited for building microservices and distributed systems and makes streamlining devops practices simple."
