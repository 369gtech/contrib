title: 'Introduction to MongoDB - O''Reilly Webcast'
recordingDate: 1282685645
description: "MongoDB -- from \"humongous\" -- is an open source, non-relational, document-oriented database. The goal of the MongoDB project is to bridge the gap between key-value stores (which are fast and highly scalable) and traditional RDBMS systems (which provide rich queries and deep functionality). This talk will provide an introduction to MongoDB from one of the developers working on the project. The webcast will be accessible to those who are completely new to MongoDB and non-relational databases, but will touch on some of the advanced functionality that makes MongoDB a compelling option for all web developers.\n\nDon't miss an upload!
