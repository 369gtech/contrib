title: 'Interviewing, Fast and Slow: Use Behavioral Science to Ace Tech Interviews'
language: English
recordingDate: 1535737093
description: "As developers, we're used to getting near-instant feedback on the quality of our work. The test either passes, or it doesn't. As a result of that quick feedback loop, we consistently improve our coding ability. More time equals more skill. When it comes to job interviews, though, there’s no compiler, no unit tests, and no quick feedback loop. We feel like we're learning, but are we?\n\nWe’ll draw on lessons from the groundbreaking book Thinking, Fast and Slow and mistakes I’ve made across a decade of startup engineer hiring. We'll break down the typical python developer interview process. Then, we'll use the lens of cognitive bias to identify specific tactics for acing existing interviews and for making our interviews better at predicting team success.\n\nEVENT:\n\nIndyPy Meetup February 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nWes Winham, Founder/CEO at Woven\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSdWhA873xA"
