title: 'Implementing PII Encryption with PDX Serialization'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538631558
description: "After many publicized security breaches, many firms are scrambling to add encryption for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data to their applications. In this session we'll describe an implementation of PII encryption for Geode applications via use of custom PDX Serialization. This approach encrypts PII data on the Geode Client with no or minimal changes to existing application logic, while covering all Three key vulnerabilities: On Disk, In Memory, and on-the-network. The presentation will include discussion of how this approach to PII encryption impacts data search patterns such as key-based lookups and OQL queries.\n\nThe following white paper serves as a supplemental companion to this presentation and dives deeper into some of the key challenges for executing Geode data migrations, with a focus on minimizing or eliminating related service downtime: https://goo.gl/Yfn21u\n\nSpeakers:\nGideon Low\nData Engineer, Pivotal\n\nNiranjan Sarvi\nSr. Data Engineer, Pivotal"
