description: "As a UX designer, you are the de facto champion of the people who use your product — heck, the word “user” is part of your title. And to create the best product experience for your users, you need to get everyone on your team thinking like UX designers too. Because the more people on your team who understand UX principles and empathize with the user’s needs, the more effective your product will be. And the more you understand the other disciplines you work with and bring them into your process, the smarter and faster you’ll be able to design.\n\nMaya Bruck\nSenior Product Designer, Etsy\nhttps://twitter.com/mayabruck"
