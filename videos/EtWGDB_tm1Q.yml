description: "Cognitect’s Vase library promises data-driven microservices. While its data-driven properties become apparent even after superficial inspection, it might not be obvious how Vase’s value proposition is specific to microservices.\nI am going to show how many of the specific requirements that arise from a microservice architecture are orthogonal to the problems Vase is solving. Furthermore, I am going to demonstrate how these specific needs such as load-balancing, failure isolation, telemetry and service discovery can be addressed in an elegant and non-obtrusive way by using a transparent proxy like linkerd (linkerd.io)."
