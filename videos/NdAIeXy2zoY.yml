title: 'DEF CON 29 - Vivek Nair - Time Turner   Hacking RF Attendance Systems To Be in Two Places at Once'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628440243
description: "It's a tale as old as time: a graduating senior needs two more courses to graduate, but the lectures happen to be scheduled at the same time and the school's new high-tech wireless attendance tracking system makes it impossible to attend both courses... in theory. By reverse-engineering the attendance devices and emulating them using a hidden Arduino, the system can be tricked into giving attendance credit for both courses without being physically present. It's a real-life \"time turner,\" allowing him to be in two places at once.\n\nREFERENCES:\nhttps://github.com/wizard97/iSkipper/releases/download/v1.0.0/iskipper.pdf\nhttps://courses.ece.ubc.ca/cpen442/termproject/reports/2010/iclicker.pdf\nhttps://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2015/cs886_kdv8/cs886_kdv8/cs886_kdv8/index.html\nhttps://github.com/wizard97/iSkipper\nhttps://github.com/charlescao460/iSkipper-Software"
