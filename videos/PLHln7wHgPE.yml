description: "Flutter / AngularDart – Code sharing, better together\n\nHow many times did you have to implement the same app on Android and iOS? Even though it might give you a sense of pride of accomplishment, doesn’t it feel like a waste of time? Flutter immensely helps with that, but what if you also have to implement a web app? But hey! AngularDart is also based on, well, Dart, so how much code can we share among Flutter and AngularDart apps?\n\nTurns out, it’s a lot.\n\nOn this talk, we’ll present a simple pattern for defining the business logic of your app, then write Android, iOS and AngularDart apps where almost all business logic is shared.\n\nAbout Paolo:\nPaolo is a Software Engineer on the AdWords Express team at Google, having previously worked on mobile testing infrastructure and the dark arts of iOS test tooling, including the EarlGrey testing framework.\n\nHe thinks life’s too short to be spent solving the same problem multiple times, so he’s helping his teammates at Google to figure out how share as much code as possible among Android, Angular and iOS apps with Flutter.\n\nWatch the rest of the Dart Conference 2018 session videos here: https://goo.gl/4bwhE5\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
