description: "Speaker: Stephane Maldini \nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/smaldini/introduction-to-reactor-and-reactive-streams\nWhat is the role of asynchronous, non-blocking style-communication in microservices? Join Stephane Maldini for a revealing look at why reactive components are so important in an eventually-consistent approach like microservice architecture. When services own their data and are completely independent, having a (reactive) abstraction layer can perform a variety of roles. Being able to parallelize resources a microservice owns is an important technique. Another might be as an event bus, pulling state data from various micro services dynamically, checking against the cached, fairly up-to-date local copy. While a microservice has “all” the data it needs from other services to respond to a request, this data is not necessarily up-to-date—an important constraint to be prepared to accept. Stephane will also discuss other async use cases outside of microservices and how www.reactive-streams.org protocol support allows levels of portability across vendor implementations.\n\nLearn more about Reactor at http://projectreactor.cfapps.io/"
