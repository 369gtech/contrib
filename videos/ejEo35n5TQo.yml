description: "Join the chat and ask questions live at https://aka.ms/LearnLiveTV\n\nStarting Monday, May 3, 2021 (PST), join John Papa and Peter de Tender live on Learn TV and explore Episode 4 of this this four-part Microsoft Learn Git series. Each week, Microsoft experts will be walking through Learn modules live and answering your questions.\n\nGit can seem a little cryptic at first, and it can even be frustrating at times. But if you learn it step by step, you'll find that there's a reason Git is quickly becoming the world's most popular version control systemâ€”not just for software developers, but also for teams that write documentation and collaborate on other work.\n\nMay 17 - Episode 4 - Use the GitHub integration in Visual Studio Code, including authentication, publishing repos, and viewing your repo timeline. Then, use GitHub to find open-source projects and tasks to contribute to. Discover how to create pull requests and communicate with project maintainers effectively to get your changes accepted. Learn about the benefits of getting involved with open-source communities.\n\nMiss an episode? No problem, catch it on-demand: https://aka.ms/learnlive\n\n#Git #LearnLive"
