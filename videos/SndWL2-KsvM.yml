title: 'Leveraging your code with APIs from Excel 3.0 to Office 365 Azure Power BI and Flow - CFS2021'
recordingDate: 1557347755
description: "Can your code “live long and prosper” amid ever-changing technologies and APIs?  How about your users’ investment in your app?  With architecture and code examples from “ancient” Excel 4 macros, VBA and XLLs for Excel, C++ and C#, JavaScript and REST APIs for Power BI and Flow, and multiple Azure services, this session will describe how one ISV has re-used and leveraged its own code and its users’ application investments over almost 30 years – and how the latest JavaScript APIs and tools enable richer, more powerful extensions than ever.\r\n\r\nFrontline Systems, creators of Solver for Excel 3.0 way back in 1989, has used nearly every tool and API Microsoft has offered to build powerful analytic modeling extensions for Excel and now Power BI, from “DDE” in 1989 to async JavaScript APIs in 2019.  And these extensions have become more ambitious over time:  Now with nearly 9 million lines of code for optimization, simulation, decision analysis and machine learning – using more data, richer UI, and more platforms, from Windows and Mac to browsers and tablets.  Yet a user’s Excel 3.0 Solver model from 1989 still works without changes in cloud, server and desktop apps in 2019."
