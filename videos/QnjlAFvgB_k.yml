title: 'Implementing loosely coupled microservices with Grails'
recordingDate: 1501170316
description: 'Grails 3 is s a great starting point for creating microservices and many projects are following this path. However many microservice landscapes are still based on synchronous calls to REST Resources which obviously increases coupling between those applications. This talk focusses on building loosely coupled microservices that are based on Domain Events, which are becoming more and more popular in the Domain Driven Design community. We will take a look at how Grails 3 helps us in building such systems by introducing the Grails 3 event system and by taking a look how we can leverage Domain Events for a decoupled communication between Grails applications.The talk will have slides for the theory and many practical examples.'
