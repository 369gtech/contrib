description: "Register on www.wearedevelopers.com/live for the full experience. \nThere will be required actions before the workshop (like setting up a free account), so please register to get the necessary access and information.\n\nIf you are monitoring your stack with different tools then you’ll be familiar with some of the challenges of working with different sets of data coming from multiple sources:\n- Troubleshooting issues take more time\n- Data management, storage, and cost as you scale \_\n- Managing data security.\n\nIn this session, I will look at how you can bring together all of your open source, or vendor-specific telemetry data, together into a fully managed, highly-scalable platform using OpenTelemetry standards.\_\n\nUsing New Relic’s Telemetry Data Platform, I’ll show how you can:\n\n- Monitor your stack for free\n- Make use of the connected data in one place to resolve issues quickly\n- Integrate with open source tools like Prometheus and Grafana\n- Analyse and visualise data in the platform, or use existing dashboards\n- Set up Alerts\n\nIn hands-on interactive labs, you’ll get to ingest, query and visualise sample data and create custom dashboards to showcase operational data.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers\nMeetup: https://www.meetup.com/WeAreDevelopers-Community\n\n#WeAreDevelopers #WeAreDevs \n#WeAreDevelopersLive #WeAreDevsLive #newrelic #opentelemetry #prometheus #grafana"
