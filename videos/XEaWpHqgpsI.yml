description: "This first part of this talk will introduce Oden, an experimental, statically typed, functional programming language being built for the Go ecosystem. We will look at how Oden aims to leverage the great features of Go — static linking, cross-compilation, goroutines, channels and the great set of libraries and tools — and enable higher-level abstractions, generics and a safer yet more flexible type system.\n\nThe second part will delve more deeply into the implementation of the Oden compiler. Why was it first written in Racket and then rewritten in Haskell? What pros and cons are there in writing compilers in Haskell? We will look at how the type system can help us build safe and robust intermediate representations and transformations between them.\n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
