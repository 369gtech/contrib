description: "DOES18 Las Vegas — In an environment of uncertainty, complexity, and rapid change - in other words, what we see when we come to work every day - good business leadership looks very different. The way we assess risk, the way we make investment decisions, the way we structure our organizations, and even the way the senior leadership team of an enterprise collaborates - all must change to accommodate the realities of the digital world. An enterprise can turn risks into opportunities and unleash innovation … well, if they learn the right lessons from Napoleon and bobbleheads. In this talk I will draw on some of the ideas in my upcoming book War and Peace and IT: Business Leadership, Technology, and Success in the Digital Age to demonstrate how to succeed in the digital world according to one of its great experts, Leo Tolstoy.\n\nNapoleon, DevOps, and Delivering Business Value\n\nMark Schwartz, Author, \"A Seat at the Table\"\n\nMark Schwartz is an iconoclastic CIO and a playful crafter of ideas, an inveterate purveyor of lucubratory prose. He has been an IT leader in organizations small and large, public, private, and nonprofit. As the CIO of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, he provokes the federal government into adopting Agile and DevOps practices. He is pretty sure that when he was the CIO of Intrax Cultural Exchange he was the first person ever to use business intelligence and supply chain analytics to place au pairs with the right host families. Mark speaks frequently on the role of the CIO, innovation in IT, and Agile and DevOps approaches in challenging and low-trust environments. With a BS in computer science from Yale, a master’s in philosophy from Yale, and an MBA from Wharton, Mark is either an expert on the business value of IT or just confused and much poorer.\nMark is the author of The Art of Business Value, which - he is proud to report - has been labeled by his detractors “The Ecclesiastes of Product Management,” and “Apocryphal.” The book takes readers on a journey through the meaning of bureaucracy, the nature of cultural change, and the return on investment of an MBA degree, on the way to solving the great mystery … what exactly do we mean by business value and how should that affect the way we practice IT? Mark promises that his new book, Seat at the Table, is more canonical and less apocryphal.\n\nMark is the winner of a Computerworld Premier 100 award, an Information Week Elite 100 award, a Federal Computer Week Fed 100 award, and a CIO Magazine CIO 100 award, which strongly suggests that there are less than 99 other people you could better spend time reading.\n\nDOES18 Las Vegas\nDOES 2018 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit 2018\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
