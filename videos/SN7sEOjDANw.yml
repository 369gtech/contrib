recordingDate: 1251328791
description: "This is a 9-minute preview of the full webcast. The Social Web is about communities, collaboration, peer production and user-generated content: where business reputations are defined by customer opinions and ratings, where press is delivered by independent bloggers, and product development is driven by customers. As digital natives--those who have grown up with the Internet--flood the workplace, your employees will expect to be part of the Social Web and they'll have a lot to contribute.\r\nHow do you harness the benefits of increased employee participation and customer engagement while mitigating the risks? This webcast will review guidelines for corporations considering how to responsibly integrate social media in the workplace. After delivering the framework, Joshua will open the webcast to a Q&A discussion."
