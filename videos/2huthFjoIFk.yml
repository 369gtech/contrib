language: English
recordingDate: 1602681210
description: "If we want computers to be intelligent and able to interact with us we need to ensure that they can recognize, understand, and express emotions. This is the basic assumption of Affective Computing. \n\nFirst, an introduction to the field will be described starting with established findings from psychology on how we best can measure emotions. Technology enablers that have made Affective Computing a hot topic will be highlighted as well as examples of API and services that we can use today. \n\nThe second part will cover application scenarios such as retail, medical, education, and social. \n\nThe presentation concludes with some recommendations on how Affective Computing affects us as developers going forward."
