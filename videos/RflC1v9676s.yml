recordingDate: 1550509203
description: "Features always come with costs. Either of performance or code-footprint. With C++11 and its successors we got some exciting new features. As the spirit of C++ is \"you pay only for what you use\" it is vital for developers to know what the costs are.\n\nThis talk presents the cost of features like Lambdas or the all time static. The focus is on modern C++. At the end attendee are able to rate features more precisely whether to use them in a project or not.\n---\nAndreas Fertig holds an M.S. in Computer Science from Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. Since 2010 he has been a software developer and architect for Philips Medical Systems focusing on embedded systems. He has a profound practical and theoretical knowledge of C++ at various operating systems. He works freelance as a lecturer and trainer. Besides this he develops macOS applications and is the creator of cppinsights.io.\n\nhttps://cpponsea.uk/sessions/fast-and-small-what-are-the-costs-of-language-features.html\n\nFilmed and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
