description: "Episode #3: why do people choose NoSQL databases ? Because it's fashionable! Yes, but what is the engineering reason ? Well, that takes a bit more time to explain. We will spend the next 2 episodes with Nacho Coloma, the CTO of Koliseo and author of SimpleDS to help you make an informed decision between SQL and NoSQL.\n\nKoliseo is a ticketing platform built on App Engine that is designed to handle the rush hour peaks that ticketing platforms have to weather. In this first part, Nacho Coloma explains which project requirements you have to consider in order to make a smart choice between SQL and NoSQL.\n\nIn the second part, he will share his tips, tricks and code to help you cope with the new breed of scalable NoSQL databases such as the App Engine datastore.\n\nFollow-up links:\n\nMartin Görner: http://plus.google.com/+MartinGorner\nNacho Coloma: https://plus.google.com/112843640399200525430\nSimpleDS: https://github.com/icoloma/simpleds\nObjectify: https://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/\nNative Java Datastore API: https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/\n\n\"root access Berlin\" is recorded at the new studio at the Factory in Berlin.
