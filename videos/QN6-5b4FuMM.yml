description: "When /bin/sh Attacks: Revisiting \"\"Automate All the Things\"\"\n\nJ. Paul Reed, Netflix\n\nOne of the core tenets of both modern SRE and DevOps professional practices is \"\"Automate all the things!\"\"\n\nBut are there processes we shouldn't automate? And what if HOW we automate actively causes us and the systems we're responsible for harm? We'll take a look at what human factors have to do with automation as well as at some of the impacts and challenges pervasive automation has presented for system administrators and SREs, along with some important considerations when automating our complex, living socio-technical systems, and some strategies to cope when the shell scripts strike back!\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
