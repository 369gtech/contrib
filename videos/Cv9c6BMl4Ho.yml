description: "While many tutorials cover one single way to accomplish WebSockets in Perl, they often leave users wondering \"but how do I do this on my favorite technology stack?\" This talk will attempt to cover all the popular modules you could use to accomplish WebSockets and give the audience a good survey of their options. It will also clarify the advantages or disadvantages of each, and leave the viewer with a good idea of which path to take if they want to implement a project involving WebSockets.\n\nThere will also be a short intro to WebSockets and Event Driven programming. This should help bring everyone up to speed on the challenges involved, in case they've never experienced them first-hand."
