description: 'Security incident response is a reactive and chaotic exercise. What if it were possible to flip the scenario on its head? Security focused chaos engineering takes the approach of advancing the security incident response apparatus by reversing the postmortem and preparation phases. Contrary to Purple Team or Red Team game days, Security Chaos Engineering does not use threat actor tactics, techniques and procedures. It develops teams through unique configuration, cyber threat and user error scenarios that challenge responders to react to events outside their playbooks and comfort zones.  - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf3'
