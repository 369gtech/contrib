description: "Tutorial: Using Istio - Lee Calcote & Girish Ranganathan, SolarWinds (Limited Seating Available - See Description for Details) \n\nIn the adoption of cloud native technologies engineers find one of the greatest challenges is the management of services in distributed systems. Service management challenges include service discovery, load balancing, fault tolerance, end-to-end monitoring, dynamic routing for canary deployments and securing communication. Istio solves these problems by providing a layer of infrastructure between the services and network that allows service communication to be controlled outside the application code. During this workshop you will gain hands-on experience as we walk through deploying Istio alongside microservices running in Kubernetes. In a series of hands-on labs, we see:• Traffic Management, Resilient Communication and Load Balancing• Policy Enforcement and Rate Limiting• Telemetry, Monitoring and Reporting• Securing Communication• Canary Deployments \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/Gram"
