description: "Google I/O 2010 - Measure in milliseconds redux: Meet Speed Tracer \r\n\r\nGWT 201 \r\n\r\nKelly Norton \r\n\r\nIt turns out that web apps can be slow for all sorts of opaque and unintuitive reasons. Don't be fooled into thinking that bloated, slow JavaScript is the only culprit. This session introduces you to Speed Tracer, a new GWT tool that can tell you exactly where time is going within the browser. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
