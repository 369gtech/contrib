description: "Yo my fellow web ninjas! In this CSS tutorial for beginners we're going to explore what a block-level element is. I've mentioned already that the box-model governs the spacial properties (padding, margin, width, height & border) of all block-level elements, but not yet talked about what a block level element is!\n\nA block level element is one which occupies the full horizontal width of its parent element. \n\nAn in-line element stacks from left to right... IN LINE. Hence the name :P. Box model properties do not apply to in-line elements, but we can set the display types of these elements to inline-block, so that we can control the spacial properties of them too!\n\nAnyway, peace out, have fun & keep coding :).\n\nLINK TO LIST OF BLOCK-LEVEL AND IN-LINE ELEMENTS - http://www.w3resource.com/html/HTML-block-level-and-inline-elements.php\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n========== HTML Basics Course ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
