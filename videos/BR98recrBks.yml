title: 'Deploying Kubernetes, a Container Cluster Manager - Ben Hall'
recordingDate: 1473018801
description: "Docker in development is very different to Docker in production. When running 100s or 1000s of containers you’re faced with different concerns and problems.\n\nBen will introduce Kubernetes, a Container Cluster Manager originally from Google. Now an established open source project, Kubernetes helps manage your containers running on a cluster.\nThe talk will cover:\n\n- When to implement Kubernetes\n\n- Launching a cluster\n\n- Managing mutli-host networking\n\n- Managing Secrets and Security\n\n- Running Kubernetes on Bare Metal, AWS, GCE and Azure\n\n- Auto Scaling Containers\n\n- Nomad vs Kubernetes vs Mesos vs Swarm\n\nAt the end attendees will understand the foundations of Kubernetes, when they’ll require a cluster manager and the details of running it on bare metal and in the cloud."
