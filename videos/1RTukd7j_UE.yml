description: "Speaker: Jack Chen Songyong, Technical Director, Skymatters Limited\n\nMany great developers love to contribute to open source code base. But you don't have to be very experienced before doing so. This short talk is to take one of my pull requests to a Ruby gem library as an example, from the incentive, the conversations between maintainers and me, to what I learnt.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\nJack works at Skymatters Limited as the technical director. He is keen to open-source projects and gave talks at tech conferences (esp. Codeaholics HK). He also believes running a marathon and coding a project have so many in common.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.reddotrubyconf.com\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/ONqK/"
