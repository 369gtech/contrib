language: English
recordingDate: 1607435126
description: "Creating an innovation-driven culture is difficult and requires deliberate and well managed change to how you operate. Scaling it to a large organization is even harder. You also need the organizational context and norms - the culture - that allows innovate practices and thinking to thrive. Nailing these down, let alone what “culture” even is, can be hard. This talk will define what an innovative culture is and then cover several proven methods for leading culture change. Throughout, we’ll draw from use cases from large organizations that have tackled the challenge of changing to a innovation-driven culture.\n\nFree book, The Business Bottleneck: https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/cote/the-business-bottleneck?utm_source=cote&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=tanzutalk\n\nBook office hours: https://tanzu.vmware.com/office-hours?utm_source=cote&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=tanzutalk\n\nFind out more about VMware Tanzu, including our kubernetes distro: https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu?utm_source=cote&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=tanzutalk\n\n——\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00 - Intro.\n00:50 - Origin of the culture talk.\n01:32 - Slides overview.\n02:32 - The Reward - European baking differences.\n03:28 - Start of actual talk - agenda.\n05:11 - How to draw an owl.\n06:10 - My bio.\n06:47 - Possible special guests.\n07:17 - What’s driving all this?
