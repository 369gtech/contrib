description: "http://ucosp.ca\r\nhttp://www.oscon.com \r\n\r\nUCOSP brings together students from coast to coast to work together on joint capstone projects. Students learn first-hand what distributed development is like. Each team has students from two or three schools, and uses a mix of agile and open source processes under the supervision of a faculty or industry lead."
