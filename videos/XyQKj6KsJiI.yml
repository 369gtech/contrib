description: "Dan Quagliana\nHead of Developer Relations\n\nHERE BE DRAGONS* - THE ENTERPRISE MOBILE SECURITY JOURNEY\nFrom Golden Images to Rolling Releases\n\nSince 2016 I've been involved in multiple projects explaining to enterprises how the new mobile security scenario requires new rules of engagement.\n\nIt’s now necessary to move from a \"Golden Image\" mentality to the idea that mobile devices need to be updated regularly with \"Rolling Releases\".\n\nThis talk is about the challenges, and the opportunities, that enterprises needs to be prepared to address when deploying a modern mobile solution.\nWe’re going to look into some of the common questions, like:\n\n\n\nWhat does security mean for an enterprise?\nWhat needs to be in place to support a secure solution?\nWhat are the biggest surprises?\n\n\nand present the state of the art solutions available in 2018.\n\n\n* \"Here be dragons\" means dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of a medieval practice of putting illustrations of dragons, sea monsters and other mythological creatures on uncharted areas of maps."
