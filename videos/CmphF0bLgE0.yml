description: "So you were asked by a few devops teams to make them more secure. So you pick up their assets, review them and help them forward. But after that, when you leave them behind, more vulnerabilities get introduced. The question is: did your hacks bring long term value? Did you help them to get sustainable? Probably not. So how can you help them on the long term? How can you teach them how to fish instead of feed them?\n\nJoin us for a journey in how you can help teams to become sustainable in security when devops and agile are applied. We will start our journey with an assessment, then go through training the SRE, Devops and security teams, after we coach people to make better decisions. In the mean time we can do some sightseeing in automation, agile risk management and some darker pitfalls we fell for more than once.\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nJeroen Willemsen\nPrincipal Security Architect, Xebia\nJeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect at Xebia.
