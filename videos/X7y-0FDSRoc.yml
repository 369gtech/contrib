description: "Java has changed significantly since 1995. Back then it was new and different and weird and cool. But from today’s perspective, it’s amazing how old-fashioned things looked: not only code and APIs, but everything. In Java 1.0, there were only eight public API packages. The main data structures were Vector and Hashtable (with a small t), and enumeration was the way to iterate over the elements of a data structure. The documentation (javadoc) seemed minimal and also woefully underspecified. Concurrency was threads, synchronized, wait, and notify. This presentation is a brief survey of the evolution of Java APIs and their impact on programming. The survey includes collections, generics, concurrency, and general programming issues.\n\nSpeaker:\nStuart Marks, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\nStuart Marks is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Java Platform Group at Oracle.
