recordingDate: 1431009730
description: "Real Time Bidding (RTB) revolutionised online advertising by offering unparalleled targeting and cost efficiency to buyers and helping web site publishers maximise revenue.\n\nIn 2013 AOL launched Marketplace by Adtech, a new RTB system that serves billions of online advertisements every day. The team at ADTECH / AOL have traditionally been using C++ for the adservering infrastructure, however the introduction of RTB brought along its own unique challenges where a highly concurrent and fault tolerant system was a key requirement.\n\nJoin us on 6 May at 4pm BST (GMT+1) for a discussion with Philip Clarke - AOL Senior Developer, Ronan O’Rafferty - AOL Technical Manager and Ken Wilson - Chief Architect with the ADTECH advertising division of the AOL group.\n\nThe webinar will cover:\n\n    How the new RTB exchange was implemented in Erlang with the support of Erlang Solutions\n    How it interfaced with C++ components \n    How it performed when it was brought into a production environment with exponential growth\n\n \n\nSpeakers:\n\nPhilip Clarke\nPhilip has been working at AOL for almost 3 years as a Senior Erlang Developer. Before that he worked at Ericsson developing software for 2G and 3G mobile telephone switches. He is very familiar with concurrent and fault tolerant problems that Erlang was designed to solve. Originally while working on 2G he programmed in PLEX which predated Erlang.  After a few years he moved into software development for 3G systems where development was in C++. It was only when Philip moved to AOL that he got the opportunity to develop highly concurrent soft real time systems in Erlang.\n\nRonan O’Rafferty\nRonan is a technical manager with AOL with over 15 years in commercial software development in Digital Advertising, Telecoms and Financial Services. He spent most of those 15 years working in Java based environments and only recently (2012) exposed to Erlang development. He is interested in scalable web architectures and technologies. He likes the constant challenges of the technical problems presented by the adserving space. \n\nKen Wilson\nKen is a Chief Architect with the ADTECH advertising division of the AOL group. Over the last 22 years he has worked on a variety of different areas from export software, embedded building management systems, EDIfact data engines, Web solutions and social networking. For the last 5 years Ken has been the lead Architect in the Adtech group delivering highly scalable Ad Serving solutions."
