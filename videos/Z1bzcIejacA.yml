description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\n面向 Gitee 项目的开源软件项目健康指标 | OSS Project Health Metrics for Gitee Projects - Yehui Wang, Huawei & Georg Link, Bitergia\n\n本演讲涉及衡量开源项目的健康性和可持续性。GrimoireLab 是一个开源工具，已经存在了很多年，但是到目前为止还不支持 Gitee。对于不断发展的中国开源社区来说，Gitee 是一个很受欢迎的平台。以一种真正开源的方式，国际贡献者为 GrimoireLab 工具添加了 Gitee 支持。我们将分享此种改进可以给开源项目带来何种见解。我们将展示 Gitee 平台上的人如何通过 GrimoireLab 获得相关指标和见解来帮助了解他们项目的健康和可持续性。为圆满结束本演讲，我们将分享衡量开源项目健康状况的最佳实践。CHAOSS 项目已经确立了最佳实践并提供了相关建议，可以帮助项目维护人员、开源项目主管或社区经理通过指标理解他们的开源项目。\n\nThis talk is about measuring the health and sustainability of open source projects. GrimoireLab is an open source tool for this and has been around for many years but up to now was not supporting Gitee. Gitee is a popular platform for the growing China open source community. In a true open source way, international contributors added Gitee support to the GrimoireLab tools. We will share what kind of insights this improvement can give to open source projects. We will show how anyone on the Gitee platform can now get metrics and insights with GrimoireLab to help understand their projects’ health and sustainability. To round off the presentation, we will share best practices for measuring open source project health. The CHAOSS project has established best practices and recommendations that can help project maintainers, open source program officers, or community managers to get started understanding their open source projects through metrics."
