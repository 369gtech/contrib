description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeakers: Tom McCuch, Oleg Zhurakousky\nFor modern applications many businesses are faced with some new messaging challenges for modern applications, such as horizontal scalability of the messaging tier, heterogeneous messaging systems and access methods, and extreme transaction processing. This presentation/demo will cover how businesses can overcome these messaging challenges with the use of Spring and RabbitMQ technologies.\n \nTom will build a case for AMQP, explain how SpringSource is providing AMQP support via Spring AMQP and Spring Integration, explain how RabbitMQ is a modern messaging solution that offers a reliable, highly available, scalable and portable messaging system with predictable and consistent throughput and latency, and demonstrate how Spring Integration and RabbitMQ can be progressively introduced into a standard Spring web application."
