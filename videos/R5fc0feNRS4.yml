description: "Experienced Python, Node, React, and Java developers can find it difficult to adopt Kubernetes. Successful deployments require a strong DevOps pipeline. This session will highlight personal experiences working with Tekton, Argo CD, and Kubernetes in production environments. We will demonstrate code and patterns that our team developed in these real-world deployments. (https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud). Examples include using Argo CD to deploy Tekton Pipelines with Kubernetes Configurations. The session will also highlight end to end pipeline examples inclusive of CI/CD/Artifacts/Testing/Ops stack.\n\nPresenters:\n\nRoland Barcia, CTO Solution Engineering @IBM\nSean Sundberg, Lead Architect, Cloud Native Toolkit @IBM"
