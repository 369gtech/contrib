title: 'JUnit: time to shift into 5th gear! Julien Topçu & Juliette de Rancourt'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573162196
description: "Did you know that JUnit 5 is almost two years old?\n\nHowever, a large number of Java projects are still tested with JUnit 4, which came out ... 13 years ago! A lot of things have changed since 2006, Java went from 5th to 12th version! Isn't it time to bring our tests up to date?\n\nThe JUnit team took advantage of this opportunity to completely rethink the framework. Many features have been added or reworked in order to fit with the new paradigms of the Java ecosystem.\n\nDuring this talk, we'll see that even though JUnit 5 introduced many changes, the mechanisms of retro compatibility guarantee an easy and progressive migration.\n\nJulien Topçu:\nSenior Lead Developer for Société Générale, I'm an active evangelist on \"value creation\" focused methodologies, such as DDD/Hexagonal Architecture, Extreme Programming and Kanban #NoEstimates. As an OWASP fundation member, I strive to convey the DevSecOps mindset to the community.\n\nJuliette de Rancourt:\nAs a curious and passionate developer, I am beginning my journey into the world of Software Craftsmanship.\nI am a consultant for the french company Carbon IT, and I participated in the JUnit 5 migration of some Java/Kotlin microservices at Société Générale, where I currently work.\nAlways looking for new knowledge, I binge tech talks like Netflix."
