description: "Tod Thomson\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/14/\n[\"Microsoft ♥ Linux\"](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/microsoft-loves-linux-as-it-makes-azure-bigger-better/) is not generally something one expects to hear, but we should not be surprised as [\"nearly 1 in 3 Azure virtual machines are Linux\"](http://news.microsoft.com/bythenumbers/azure-virtual). The Microsoft of old is gone (dead and buried) and \"from the ashes\" a new Microsoft has emerged, one embracing both FOSS and Linux as first-class citizens. Enter [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/platform) a \"ground up\" rewrite of Microsoft .NET which is 100% open source and cross-platform.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial we will show you how to get up and running with .NET Core and [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/) on your Linux distribution of choice. We will introduce you to the [`dotnet`](https://github.com/dotnet/cli) CLI, self-hosting web applications and APIs with the [Kestrel HTTP Server]( https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer) (based on [libuv](http://libuv.org)) and then running everything inside OS level virtualisation via [Docker](https://www.docker.com). We will also introduce to you [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) a new open-source, cross-platform IDE built on top of [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).\r\n\r\nBy the end of the tutorial you’ll have the tools you need to build your next application with the .NET Core ecosystem."
