recordingDate: 1388580258
description: "\"Making the browser render millions of shaded triangles per second is just the first step. The challenge now is doing something interesting with all these triangles. For that we need to attract artists, designers, animators, modellers, etc. Frame.js is a library and editor that aims to do just that.\nIn this talk we'll look at the current version of the tool - the internals, the usage and maybe find new uses for it.\"\n\nRicardo is a self-taught computer-graphics programmer from Barcelona, Cabello. His work ranges from simple interactive digital toys — Google Gravity, Ball Pool and Harmony — to full featured experiences — The Johnny Cash Project, The Wilderness Downtown and ROME. Nowadays, Ricardo spends most of his time developing open source libraries and tools — three.js, frame.js and stats.js — making design and development simpler for everyone.\n\nJSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Hotel H2O and Manila Ocean Park, Philippines - 28 + 29 November 2013.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.asia/blog/2013/11/8/jsconfasia-2013-mrdoob-ricardo-cabello-framejs\nDemo: http://www.mrdoob.com/files/temp/xplsv_obsidian/index.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
