title: 'Concepts: The Future of Generic Programming'
language: English
recordingDate: 1537980124
description: "Concepts have arrived. They will change the way we think about programming. Implementations are available in GCC and Clang. Many fundamental concepts are in the standard committee’s working paper and the next generation of the STL depends critically on concepts. \n\nAfter briefly introducing concepts, I consider their role in design. What makes a good/useful concept? How do you design good concepts and use them well? \n\nFrom a language-technical point of view, concepts are a way of constraining template arguments. From a design perspective, they are a focus comparable to user-defined types (classes): The intent is for a concept to represent a fundamental concept in an applications domain (hence the name “concept”). \n\nI will mention technical issues recently resolved or currently being resolved in the committee, but my primarily focus is not concepts as a language mechanism but as a support for the development of good software.\n\nEVENT:\n\nCppCon 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBjarne Stroustrup\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nCppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HddFGPTAmtU"
