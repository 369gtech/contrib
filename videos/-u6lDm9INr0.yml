title: 'Accelerate the path to production: Secure your software with DevSecOps'
language: English
recordingDate: 1626793978
description: "When building new innovative software products, businesses’ first priority is often time to production - how quickly can I get this market disrupting idea into the hands of users. Code is often of low quality with little attention paid to best practices and security; the idea being “let's get the thing built and we’ll deal with quality later on when we have the investment / sales / talent”....\n\nHowever this pressure to build fast can often lead to vulnerabilities in software code that can be exploited by attackers and lead to problems down the line - low quality software and a lack of process drives greater technical debt which can become unmanageable as a company scales ultimately slowing down innovation and competitiveness.\n\nIn recent times, organisations are realising that a change in culture is required to build securely and at speed, notably adopting DevSecOps - where security is baked into the rapid-release cycles that are typical of modern application development and deployment.\n\nIn this webinar, Tomas Gonzalez, from Cloud Native Application Security vendor at Snyk and Rodrigo Nascimento, from software consultancy at Codurance, will show you how to overcome the challenges of implementing DevSecOps in a growing organisation. They'll be joined by host Amelia Bampton from Codurance who will be on hand to pose attendees' questions to the speakers throughout the session.\n\nBy the end of the webinar you’ll gain a deeper understanding on why DevSecOps is an important consideration for any ambitious organisation - from greenfield startup to ambitious scaleup and beyond.\n\nTo catch up all our events, please visit: https://codurance.com/events/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=eventbrite_webinar&utm_content=secure_your_software_with_DevSecOps\n\n\n0:00 - 3:00 Introduction\n3:00 - 5:47 About Snyk and Codurance\n5:47 -  33:33 DevSecOps\n33:33 - 54:19 Demo\n54:19 - 58:11 Wrap up"
