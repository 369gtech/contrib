title: 'Make Your Diversity Count (Dr. Shola Mos Shogbamimu, 2018)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636120840
description: "We all know diversity matters and should be a commercial imperative in every industry. It's time to stop talking and start doing. In the critical era of technological advancement, its time for Women to take their rightful place amongst Technology giants and demand (not ask) for the same opportunity, legitimacy, recognition and credit men get.\n\nWomen won't get this by waiting their turn or suffering in silence. They must create opportunities where there are none and bring their folding chair to sit at the table where no extra chairs exist. Corporate responsibility can only take us so far - individual responsibility for your representation (be it gender, race, sex, etc) is critical to making diversity matter. This talk will explore how women can make this happen in and out of the workplace. Stop Talking - Start Doing!\n\nWatch thousands more tech talks in our SkillsCast library at https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts"
