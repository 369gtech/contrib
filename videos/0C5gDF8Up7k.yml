description: "Making a mainstream film that is culturally resonant, critically acclaimed and financially successful is a rare achievement, yet some filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan and David Fincher consistently tell stories that tick all of those boxes.\n\nUnder the surface of their most celebrated films lies a hidden architecture that operates on an unconscious level. This talk is designed to illuminate the techniques that great storytellers use to engage a global audience on a deep and meaningful level through psychological metaphor.\n\nMike Hill\nDesigner, Mike Hill Design\nhttps://twitter.com/_mikehilldesign\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mikehill.design/\n\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
