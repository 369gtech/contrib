description: "There is an increasing interest in Quantum Computing. Hardware is getting better, and more reliable and powerful prototypes are being released frequently.\n\nQuantum simulators are used to develop algorithms that will benefit from real quantum computers when they are available. Parallel with the development of quantum computers, the development of quantum networking is ongoing.\n\nA Quantum Network leverages many concepts of quantum computing, and it allows for e.g. secure communication. In this talk, we explain the notion of a quantum network, how it will benefit (and shake up) existing network protocols, and what the current state and challenges are.\n\nWe will show how Java developers can prepare for the exciting opportunities that are created by quantum computing and quantum networks.\n\nJohan Vos started to work with Java in 1995. He was part of the Blackdown team,  porting Java to Linux. His main focus is on end-to-end Java, combining back-end systems and mobile/embedded devices. He received a Duke Choice award in 2014 for his work on javafx on mobile.\n\nIn 2015, he co-founded Gluon, which allows enterprises to create (mobile) Java Client applications leveraging their existing backend infrastructure. Gluon received a Duke Choice award in 2015.\n\nJohan is a Java Champion, a member of the BeJUG steering group, the Devoxx steering group and he is a JCP member. He is one of the lead authors of the  Pro JavaFX  books, the author of Quantum Computing for Java Developers, and he has been a speaker at numerous conferences on Java.\n\nHe contributes to a number of projects, including OpenJFX, OpenJDK, GraalVM.\nHe is also the project lead for OpenJDK Mobile and the co-lead for OpenJFX."
