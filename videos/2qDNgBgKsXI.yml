title: 'YOW! Perth 2018 - Erin Zimmer - Adventures with the JavaScript Event Loop'
recordingDate: 1538620641
description: "The Event Loop underpins everything that happens in JavaScript. It’s how JavaScript handles I/O events without blocking, even though it’s single-threaded. It's responsible for executing callbacks and managing repainting.\nIn this talk, we'll have a look at how the Event Loop interacts with WebAPIs and the rendering pipeline and how it manages tasks and task queues. And we'll see what's so special about Promises and check out event loops outside the browser window, in Node and web workers.\n\nErin is a senior developer working at the Post Office in Australia. She has over ten years experience working in software development, but largely in languages nobody has ever heard of, like Model 204. If you see her at a conference, she'll probably be the one knitting.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
