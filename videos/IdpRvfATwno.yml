description: "Speaker: Erin Chen - Lila Sutra Founder (Sexual Wellness)\r\n\r\nHi, I'm Erin. It's time end the taboo that surrounds sex! I dream of a world where sex, intimacy, and orgasms are no longer a mystery. I founded Lila Sutra because I believe everyone can have great sex - and beyond \"sex\", experience deep connection, happiness, and pleasure. \r\n\r\nAs a sex and relationship counsellor, I also work with clients to explore their sexual confidence, expand their repertoire, and/or address specific sexual difficulties. \r\n\r\nI am total sex geek and have been since I was a teenager. I am also the co-founder of the Sex Geekdom Singapore Hub. Before Lila Sutra, for nearly a decade, I was a management consultant / corporate warrior. I am made in Taiwan and grown in Canada - east meets west!\r\n\r\nStay in touch: https://erinychen.com/\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fuckup-nights-singapore-vol-xv-tickets-32564684849\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
