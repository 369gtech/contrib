description: "by Peter Munch-Ellingsen\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/nim_metaprogramming.webm\n\n\nOver the years I've visited languages on all levels of abstraction and paradigms, both through my studies but also in a professional capacity. One of the languages that have caught my eye is Nim, which ticks a lot of boxes for me, and leaves me wanting it's features in many other languages. Of the many interesting features in the language one of the most mentioned is the metaprogramming capabilities. This talk will briefly introduce Nim for those unfamiliar with the language, before diving right into the possibilities metaprogramming offer, with interesting real-world examples of its utility. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:20:00+01"
