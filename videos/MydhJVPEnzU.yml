title: 'Reactive Microservices on the JVM with Vert.x by Burr Sutter'
language: English
recordingDate: 1497860241
description: "Everybody is talking about microservices and reactive programming these days. And there’s a reason for that: the high-demand and high-scale distributed world that we have today, reacting to events in an asynchronous and non-blocking fashion seems the right approach to deal with scalability. And to achieve microservices you need a lightweight, fast, modular, high-performance and un-opinionated environment. Meet Vert.x: a toolkit for building reactive applications on the JVM. Come to this session to see how you can use Vert.x to create reactive code using Java, Groovy, JavaScript or other JVM languages. We’ll demonstrate how to build Vert.x-based systems leveraging the unique Vert.x eventbus for creating apps with real-time communications from the modern web browser to the cloud and back again. Microservices are fundamentally about increasing business agility via faster deployment times. In this session we will also demonstrate how you can containerize your Vert.x-based applications via Docker and run them at scale using Kubernetes. We also also quickly demonstrate key microservice deployment patterns like blue/green and canary.\n\nBurr Sutter From Red Hat\nA lifelong developer advocate, community organizer, and technology evangelist, Burr Sutter is a featured speaker at technology events around the globe—from Bangalore to Brussels and Berlin to Beijing (and most parts in between)—he is currently Red Hat’s Director of Developer Experience. A Java Champion since 2005 and former president of the Atlanta Java User Group, Burr founded the DevNexus conference—now the second largest Java event in the U.S.—with the aim of making access to the world’s leading developers affordable to the developer community. When not speaking abroad, Burr is also the passionate creator and orchestrator of highly-interactive live demo keynotes at Red Hat Summit, the company’s premier annual event."
