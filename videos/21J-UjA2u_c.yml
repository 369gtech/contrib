CSPs are composed of variables with possible values which fall into ranges known as domains. Constraints between the variables must be satisfied in order for constraint-satisfaction problems to be solved. Those three core concepts—variables, domains, and constraints—are simple to understand, and their generality underlies the wide applicability of constraint-satisfaction problem solving."
