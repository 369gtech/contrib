description: 'Video sharing accounts for most of the bandwidth on todayâ€™s internet, but with Netflix and Youtube making up a majority of this traffic, room for a decentralized challenger has been forged. We have built a simple, peer-to-peer, distributed YouTube clone utilizing the Kademlia algorithm, implemented entirely in Clojure and ClojureScript. We will discuss the parts of this project that were made simpler and more difficult because of Clojure, and show some basic networking concepts in Clojure, such as dealing with UDP. The expected audience for this should have a rough understanding of networking protocols, and people who have been debating the use of Clojure for their next network-heavy project. No pre-existing knowledge on how peer-to-peer networks is required.'
