description: "Quickly Build Spring Boot Applications to Consume Public Cloud Services [I] - Colin Stevenson & Prasad Bopardikar, Pivotal    \n\nWe all know Cloud Foundry is a great platform for cloud native applications. However, what happens when you’re building an app that leverages services from public cloud providers such as Microsoft and Google? Service brokers make it easy to spin up service instances and bind to apps. What about the actual code itself?\n\nDevelopers leverage the popular Spring Boot framework to quickly build Java apps to deploy to Cloud Foundry. The Spring Boot Starters and Auto-Configuration eliminate the need to write boilerplate code to consume some services, but not all.\n\nWe’ve decided to give you a head start. This session is about extending the Spring framework. We’ll use examples from our recent work with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform services. As more services become available, developers will want to consume these on Cloud Foundry. Extend Spring to make it easier for developers to consume those backing services!\n\nColin Stevenson\nPartner Solution Architect, Pivotal\nColin manages Pivotal’s Partner Solution Architects within the Global Ecosystem team. Pivotal's GET team works with strategic system integrator, ISV, and cloud provider partners. Colin recently spoke at Microsoft Ignite.\n\nPrasad Bopardikar\nPivotal\nPrasad Bopardikar is a Partner Solutions Architect and Cloud Foundry Evangelist at Pivotal.
