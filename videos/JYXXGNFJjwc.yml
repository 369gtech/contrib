description: "In this month's episode Rick Viscomi and Jeff Posnick (Google Chrome Developer Relations) discuss the state of service workers. Service workers are a new kind of worker that gives progressive web apps more control over how resources are loaded over the network and cached. Jeff discusses some of the reasons why it might be a good idea for a website to include a service worker, some common mistakes developers make when implementing them, and how the Workbox tool can help.\n\nFor more info about everything discussed in this video, check out these resources:\n\nService worker support → https://bit.ly/2HT4lEf\nGuides on building service workers on web.dev →  https://bit.ly/2DVGtfb\nHTTP Archive report on PWAs →  https://bit.ly/2I4PPtw\nServiceWorkerControlledPage feature usage →  https://bit.ly/2RJEGOe\nWorkbox →  https://bit.ly/2GeBWaq\n[Video] Progressive Content Management Systems (Chrome Dev Summit 2018) → https://bit.ly/2HZrd5c\nThe service worker lifecycle →  https://bit.ly/2Ge9RQn\nThe offline cookbook →  https://bit.ly/2DWv1A5\nPWA book by Jason Grigsby →  https://bit.ly/2HUY8HW\nUsing Service Workers on MDN →  https://mzl.la/2HUY9vu\n\nWatch more State of the Web episodes here → http://bit.ly/2JhAzsh\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel to catch a new episode of The State of the Web every other Wednesday → http://bit.ly/ChromeDevs1"
