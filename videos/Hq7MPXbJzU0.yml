description: "Presented at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co\n\nThis video contains several periods of relative silence in order to provide the viewer with time to follow along and partake in the exercises.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/mkeeling5000/getting-started-with-architecture-decision-records\n\n\"\"\"\nDocumenting architecture design decisions is commonly considered a good practice and yet many teams don't take the time to write down the decisions they make. In our experience this happens for a few reasons: documentation is rejected as being too heavyweight, documentation has little influence since it is typically out of sight and out of mind, and many developers donâ€™t know what to document. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) address many of these problems by capturing design decisions in simple, lightweight templates that are stored close to repositories used by stakeholders -- often in the same repository as code affected by the ADR.\n\nIn this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to write effective ADRs and how to overcome road bumps teams often experience when first getting started with ADRs. By the end of this session, you will have the skills you need to champion ADRs and help your team start (or improve) your design decision log.\n\"\"\"\n\nMichael Keeling is an experienced software architect, agile practitioner, and programmer. He has worked on a variety of software systems including combat systems, search applications, web apps, and IBM Watson.
