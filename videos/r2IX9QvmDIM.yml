title: 'Securing Organizations Through Bad Behavior - Laura Bell Keynote'
recordingDate: 1432915425
description: "From Velocity Santa Clara 2015: BAD PEOPLE want to attack your systems and organizations. They may already have your information and for all we know they are already using your servers to stream movies. Your core application is horribly insecure and you should be DOING STUFF about it.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nInformation security is a challenging area for most organizations. We are all familiar with what happens when it goes wrongâ€”we are bombarded with news coverage. We can all name the victims of attacks and the harsh prices those organizations pay.\n\nKnowing we are at risk is not enough. We must have the skills and knowledge to not just understand security threats but prevent them.\n\nFor years we have dabbled in security testing and behaviors via outsourcing or isolating them from our workflows; but despite consistent increases in spending, the situation is getting worse. The number of attacks is increasing.\n\nWhat if we need to change direction? How can we learn to think and behave like our attackers, and make destructive security play part of our day-to-day business operations? Are we too well-behaved to be secure?\n\nThis talk will challenge the way we weave security into our testing, operations, and development workflows and asks everyone, at every level, to take a walk on the darker side of life. Outlining tools, techniques, and workflow strategies to make your organizations and applications safer and more secure, let me teach you how to think like an attacker so we can be more prepared to defend against them.\n\nAbout Laura Bell (SafeStack Limited):\nWith almost a decade of experience in software development and information security, Laura specializes in bringing security survival skills, practices, and culture into organisations of every shape and size.\n\nAn experienced conference speaker, trainer, and regular panel member, Laura has spoken at a range of events such as Kiwicon, Linux Conf AU, and Microsoft TechEd on the subjects of privacy, covert communications, agile security, and security mindset.\n\nLaura is the founder of SafeStack, a specialist security training, development, and consultancy firm.
