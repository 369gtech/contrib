language: English
recordingDate: 1492502737
description: "When you’re stuck while programming - who you gonna call? StackOverflow! It’s an invaluable source of daily help to many. Interestingly, you can also download the entire data dump of StackOverflow and let machine learning loose on the dataset.\nIn the talk I’ll look at what we can learn from the crowdsourced knowledge of developers worldwide. Meanwhile, you will also learn about ideas behind some machine learning algorithms that can give us insights into complex data - and also how does it all relate to cancer research! I will use a combination of statistical computing language R with functional language F# to show how you can easily access and process large-scale data the functional way."
