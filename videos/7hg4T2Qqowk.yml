title: 'GopherCon 2021: Felix Geisend√∂rfer - Go Profiling and Observability from Scratch'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639780643
description: "This talk is for anybody who is interested in reducing costs and latency, or debugging problems such as memory leaks, infinite loops, performance regressions, etc.\n\nWe'll begin by establishing a simple but useful mental model for the Go runtime and explain how Go differs from other compiled languages. This will serve as a foundation to understand the built-in CPU, Memory, Block, Mutex, and Goroutine Profilers as well as the Runtime Tracer.\n\nAdditionally, the presentation will cover eBPF, Linux Perf, and Delve. By the end, viewers should walk away with a solid understanding of the various tools one can use to optimize and debug Go applications."
