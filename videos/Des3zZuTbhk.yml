description: "One of the secret ingredients in many successful, big code bases is that they found a good level of abstraction. One helpful technique is to write declarative code: You describe \"what\" you want to do, but don't mix it with the \"how\". While this is not specific to Rust, the language and its ecosystem help us write declarative code. This talk will go over some examples, covering famous crates and APIs as well as more obscure ones, to then dive into ways to use this to your advantage in your own code.\n\nEVENT:\n\nRustFest Rome 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPascal Hertleif\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W20GPEqbcU"
