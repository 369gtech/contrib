description: "Continuous Integration and Collaboration in Managed Environments\n\nJoe Netzel, CFEngine\n\nOne of the great challenges faced by large IT organizations revolves around the automation of desired state while allowing a diverse set of stakeholders the ability to provide direct input into the configuration management process.
