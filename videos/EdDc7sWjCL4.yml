description: "San Francisco Java, PHP, and HTML5 user groups hosted an event on May 11th, 2010 on HTML5 with three amazing speakers: Brad Neuberg from Google, Giorgio Sardo from Microsoft, and Peter Lubbers from Kaazing.\n\nIn this first of the three videos, Brad Neuberg from Google (formerly an HTML5 advocate and currently a Software Engineer on the Google Buzz team) explains why HTML5 matters - to consumers as well as developers! His overview of HTML5 included SVG/Canvas rendering, CSS transforms, app-cache, local databases, web workers, and much more. He also identified the scope and practical implications of the changes that are coming along with HTML5 support in modern browsers.\n\nThis event was organized by Marakana, Michael Tougeron from Gamespot, and Bruno Terkaly from Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft was the host and Marakana, Gamespot, Medallia, TEKsystems, and Guidewire Software sponsored the event.\n\nhttp://marakana.com/forums/html5/general/132.html"
