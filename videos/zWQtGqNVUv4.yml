description: "What things are correlated with gender diversity: A dig through the ASF and Jupyter projects\nHolden Karau (Google), Matt Hunt (Bloomberg)\n\nMany of us believe that gender diversity in open source projects is important (for example, O’Reilly, Google, and the Python Software Foundation). (If you don’t, this isn’t going to convince you.) But what things are correlated with improved gender diversity, and what can we learn from similar historic industries?\n\nHolden Karau and Matt Hunt explore the diversity of different projects, examine historic EEOC complaints, and detail parallels and historic solutions. To keep things interesting, Holden and Matt conclude with a comparative analysis of the state of OSS and various complaints handled by the EEOC in the ’60s, along with the solutions, suggestions, and binding settlements that were reached for similar diversity problems in other industries. This comparison is not legal advice but rather examples of what we can learn from early equal opportunity commission decisions.\n\nTopics include:\n\nDiversity of gender among the different levels of a given project’s leadership (committers, PMC, etc.)\nThe existence of codes of conduct\nLanguage used in comments, code, and mailing lists\nThe rate of promotions for project participants\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
