description: "Derek Slater, Jen Pahlka, Jeremy Robbins, Kevin Callahan, Mike McGeary \n\nFrom SOPA/PIPA and CISPA, to immigration and patent reform, government is taking a renewed interest in the Internet and the businesses we're building on it -- in some cases, there is even a new focus on the use of technology which can solve government problems.\n\nAs a result, government is looking for input from our community of entrepreneurs and developers about what our needs are as a community, and how they can build better public policy in our interest.  \n\nSo, what are the most efficient, easy ways for you to get involved? Join us for a panel of some leaders in the Internet advocacy space to learn how you, as a developer, can get more involved in creating better policies that can affect your business.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
