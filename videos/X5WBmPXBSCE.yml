description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nStandardizing Applications For the Cloud at a Global Scale - Jared Watts, Upbound & Lei Zhang, Alibaba \n\nIn our rapidly maturing world of cloud native software, what exactly does it mean to be an “application”, especially as deployments become more complicated and move towards multiple clusters, regions, and even clouds at a global scale? In this talk, we will examine both the need and the benefits of a standard application definition model, as well as dive into the details of recent specific efforts in the ecosystem, such as the Open Application Model (OAM).  Once an “application” has a standard definition, it becomes easier to perform powerful higher level orchestration capabilities, such as scheduling the application and all of its infrastructure dependencies across multiple environments. We will learn about how scheduling works in Kubernetes and how the principles of scheduling pods to nodes can be applied to a global scale to schedule complete applications across multiple clouds.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zesr"
