description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKubernetes 上的 Vivo 人工智能计算平台 | Vivo's AI Computing Platform on Kubernetes - Ziyang Wu, Vivo\n\nVivo 是世界上最大的智能手机公司之一。人工智能实验室的数百名工程师和研究人员在 NLP、CV、推荐、演讲等各个领域工作，带来了各种各样复杂的模型训练和服务案例。人工智能计算平台的建立是为了解决两大挑战：1.为大规模分布式模型培训和服务提供有效的资源调度。2.实现计算资源的高利用率，特别是昂贵的 GPU 设备。今天，该平台有几个生产集群，数千个 GPU 节点和数百个 GPU 节点。每天会部署数百个服务，运行数百个 ML 作业。这一节将讨论如何使用 Kubernetes、kube-batch、kubeflow 和其他开源软件构建平台。它还将涵盖他们遇到的问题，来之不易的最佳实践和他们对开源社区的贡献。\n\nVivo is one of the biggest smartphone companies in the world. Hundreds of engineers and researchers of AI Lab are working on various areas like NLP, CV, recommendation, speech, etc., which bring various and complicated cases of model training and serving. The AI computing platform is built to address two major challenges: 1. Provide efficient scheduling of resources for massively distributed model training and serving. 2. Achieve high utilization of computing resources, especially expensive GPU devices. Today the platform has several clusters on production, thousands of GPU nodes and hundreds of GPU nodes. Hundreds of services are deployed and hundreds of ML jobs are run every day. This session will cover how the platform is built with Kubernetes, kube-batch, kubeflow, and other OSS. It will also cover the issues they ran into, the hard-earned best practices and the contribution they made to the open-source community."
