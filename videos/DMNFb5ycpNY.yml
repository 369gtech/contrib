description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nDebugging in graphical applications is done primarily by visual inspection. Either the correct visual effect appears on the screen, or it does not. When a visual effect does not appear correctly, programmers have to carefully step through code, often guessing and making small changes before rebuilding their entire codebase. In this talk, we are going to understand how to instrument OpenGL programs using code injection techniques to log and record information and ultimately understand why each pixel appears as it does on the screen. We will then discuss how we can build tools on top of the recorded data to help assist in debugging graphics applications. Attendees will leave the session with the ability to make a small logger capable of recording OpenGL function calls and be able to further extend it for their needs.\n— \nMike Shah, Assistant Teaching Professor\n\nMichael D. Shah completed his Ph.D. at Tufts University in the Redline Research Group in 2017. His Ph.D. thesis advisor was Samuel Z. Guyer. Michael finished his Masters degree in Computer Science in 2013 at Tufts University and Bachelors in Computers Science Engineering at The Ohio State University in 2011. Currently Michael is a lecturer at Northeastern University.\nMichael discovered computer science at the age of 13 when googling ”how do I make games”. From that google search, Mike has worked as a freelance game developer, worked in industry for Intel, Sony Playstation, Oblong Industries, and researched at The Ohio Supercomputer Center to name a few. Mike cares about building tools to help programmers monitor and improve the performance of realtime applications– especially games.  In Michael’s spare time he is a long distance runner, weight lifter, and amateur pizza maker.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
