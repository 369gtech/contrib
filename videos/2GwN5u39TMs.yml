title: '"Dao Programming Language for Scripting and Computing" by Limin Fu'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614441367
description: "Dao is a lightweight and optionally typed programming language with many interesting features. It includes features that make the language very expressive and make concurrent programming much simpler. Its virtual machine has well designed programming interfaces for easy embedding and extending. Additionally, Dao has a LLVM-based JIT compiler that is optimized for numeric computation, and a Clang-based tool that can generate Dao bindings for C/C++ libraries from header files automatically.\n\nLimin Fu\n\nLimin Fu has a multidisciplinary background, spanning from mathematics, through physics, computer science and bioinformatics. He has a very broad interest, and enjoys programming to do cool things. He created Dao programming language mainly out of curiosity in free time. Currently he is doing research and software development in the field of bioinformatics at UC San Diego.\n\n\n\nRecorded at the Emerging Languages Camp at Strange Loop (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Sep 2013."
