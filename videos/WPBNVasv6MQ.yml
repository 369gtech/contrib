title: 'Information saves lives - Anine Kongelf & Einar Ingebrigsten'
recordingDate: 1535372447
description: "Public health crises, such as disease outbreaks and famine most often occur in settings where health systems and public health surveillance are weak. This gap in national and global surveillance poses a risk to communities, as disease outbreaks can develop undetected.\nIn emergencies, whether sudden or slow onset, peopleâ€™s vulnerabilities to health risks increase, and infectious disease can quickly spread and cause life threatening outbreaks. At the same time, health services can become overwhelmed or put out of function, at a time where risk monitoring is most needed.\n\nRisk monitoring provides early detection, which enables early response.\n\nDigital volunteers have now since October 2017 been building a solution in the open for Red Cross. You'll learn more about how people in tech can contribute and how much of an impact you can do to other peoples lives and in fact save lives. \n\nA year ago we presented at NDC Oslo 2017 about the journey we were about to embark on - its been so great to see people from near and far gather around this project and really focus on the primary objective of helping other people."
