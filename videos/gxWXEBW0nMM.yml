description: "Speakers: Adam Shook, Dr. Mark Pollack\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/marklpollack/pivotal-hd-and-spring\nIn this session, Adam Shook will review Apache Hadoop basics and general concepts, covering HDFS, MapReduce, Pig, Hive, HBase, and other open source components. Then we will introduce Pivotal HD, our Hadoop distribution, and the role it has with enterprise Hadoop users.\n\nAnd finally, Mark Pollack will cover Spring for Apache Hadoop, bundled with Pivotal HD, which provides support for developing applications based on Apache Hadoop technologies. Spring for Apache Hadoop offers a simple POJO programming model for Pig, Hive and HDFS and can also integrate Spring projects like Data, Batch and Integration."
