description: "Making your code read like prose is not an esoteric panacea. It's achievable. In this video we look at the trivial Extract Method Refactoring (because our code is suffering from the Long Method Code Smell) but talk about the much broader concept of making your code as easy to understand as literature.\n\nBOOK MENTIONED\n?
