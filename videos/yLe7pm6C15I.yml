description: "Strategies For Managing Container Secrets At Scale - Matt Surabian, Zipcar\n\n Managing the deployments of thousands of apps for hundreds of developers wouldn't be possible for Matt's team at Zipcar if it weren't for Cloud Foundry. Doing so securely wouldn't be possible without HashiCorp's Vault.\n\nSecret management for containers at scale is a huge challenge, especially if you have compliance requirements like regular rotation of credentials, auditability, and emergency response time. Thankfully there are lots of great community projects that are able to help; the trick is knowing which to leverage given your threat model. This talk will outline some options for managing secrets in a containerized environment and propose a solution to the dreaded \"secure introduction\" problem.\n\nAbout Matt Surabian\nMatt is a full stack engineer on Zipcar's infrastructure team, which supports the car-sharing company’s custom Cloud Foundry architecture. This tooling gives developers the power to continuously deploy thousands of micro-services across multiple data centers. Matt all but owns Zipcar’s twelve Vault servers and is a contributor to the Bosh release of Vault. Matt’s background includes high availability application and infrastructure development at Alexa top 500 scale. Outside of work, Matt enjoys spending time working on his 103-year-old house, or being in the outdoors hiking, hunting, and fishing. You can bend Matt’s ear by finding him on GitHub in the JavaScript and Golang open source communities. Matt holds a BS in computer science and two HashiCorp certifications in Vault."
