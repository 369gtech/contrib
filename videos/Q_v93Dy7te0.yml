If you’re familiar with Spring MVC, you may wonder how Spring Boot can improve your web development experience and how its internals work.\n\nFirst we’ll go over the basics of a REST service powered by Boot. We’ll then gradually add more features that are typical to modern web applications. Along the way, we’ll see how Boot is helping us with front-end resources, security, error customization, template engines, embedded container configuration and devops features."
