SPIRE, a CNCF Incubating project, addresses these concerns by providing short-lived, automatically rotated identities to workloads based on the SPIFFE specification. This session will introduce the core design of SPIRE and how it can be leveraged in cloud-native architectures to provide defense-in-depth to production environments. To conclude, this session will take a look at some upcoming features that further extend the possibilities of SPIRE as a production identity platform."
