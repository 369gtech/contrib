title: '"KUnit - Unit Testing for the Linux Kernel" - Brendan Higgins (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579224059
description: "Brendan Higgins\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/97/\n\nKUnit[1] is a new lightweight unit testing and mocking framework for the Linux kernel. Unlike Autotest and kselftest, KUnit is a true unit testing framework; it does not require installing the kernel on a test machine or in a VM (however, KUnit still allows you to run tests on test machines or in VMs if you want) and does not require tests to be written in userspace running on a host kernel. You can read more about KUnit in this LWN article[2].\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the talk we will provide background on what unit testing is, why we think it is important for the Linux kernel, how KUnit provides a viable unit testing library implementation, and offer a brief demonstration of how it might be used.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the talk we will talk about the future. We will talk about KUnit's roadmap, the challenges that KUnit is facing, how to structure the Linux kernel testing paradigm, and how KUnit fits into it.\r\n\r\n[1] https://google.github.io/kunit-docs/third_party/kernel/docs/\r\n[2] https://lwn.net/Articles/780985/\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
