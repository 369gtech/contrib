title: 'Looking In, Looking Out: Designing for Social Implications of MR - Ray Noori'
recordingDate: 1522766585
description: "The rapid emergence of AR and VR will affect many aspects of our lives, from how we communicate, to how we get entertained, how we work, even how we dream. But will the prominence of singular, immersive realities risk isolating individuals from eachother even more than the cyberspace does today? Will we sacrifice traditional intimacy and messy, unpredictable face-to-face socializing in favour of a more idealized and focused way of bonding? Or will immersive mediums instead help us create instant communities of like-minded individuals in a faster and more meaningful way? Can we, by focusing inwards make it easier for ourselves to make outwardly connections? \n\nRay Noori - CEO at Block Zero in Malmö. Block Zero (http://www.blockzero.se/) is a design & innovation studio based in Malmö. We collaborate with a diverse array of clients, from small startups to multinational industry leaders, to envision, design and develop new products and services using groundbreaking and emerging technology. We help our clients find opportunities for developing new, meaningful experiences, through UX research and trend analysis. We then work together to find innovative solutions for those opportunities in an iterative way, designing and prototyping concepts, before refining those concepts into products and services of the future.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
