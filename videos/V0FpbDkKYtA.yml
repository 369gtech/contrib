description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Peter Niederwieser\nG&G Special Topics\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/continuous-delivery-with-gradle-and-jenkins\nGetting software from a developer's machine to a production environment without a fully automated process is time-consuming and error-prone. Continuous Delivery enables building, testing and deploying of software through build pipelines with well-defined quality gates. In this session, we will discuss how to build such a pipeline with the help of Gradle and Jenkins.\n\nWith Jenkins as the centerpiece of our build pipeline, we will model our way from build to deployment. We will start by introducing an examplary application and learn how to build it with Gradle. Step by step, we will touch on topics like automating unit, integration and functional tests, incorporating popular code quality tools, as well as packaging, publishing and deploying the deliverable."
