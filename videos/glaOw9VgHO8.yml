title: 'Samuel Giddins Empowering iOS Developers at Mobile Era'
recordingDate: 1574413422
description: "We often think of “platform engineering” as a discipline reserved for back-end engineers, but investing in developer happiness is valuable, no matter which part of the stack they work on. As a Mobile Developer Experience engineer, it has become my job to turn “it would be nice…” into production products & processes that save every iOS engineer time. From investing in CI architecture, build tools, and internal documentation, we’ll cover all the ways you can help empower your team to be productive, and turn complaints into quality-of-life improvements on a daily basis.\n\nAbout the speaker\nSamuel is a developer well-versed in the rituals of writing developer tools that occasionally work. By day, Samuel works on making the mobile developer experience at Square less arduous; by night he can be found breaking Bundler and CocoaPods. Before this whole \"developer\" thing, Samuel studied in the highly impractical Mathematics & Economics departments at UChicago, learning subjects such as \"numbers\", \"social theory\", and \"memes\". When not coding, Samuel is often in the kitchen, marveling at the fact that dinner smells better than it looks.\n\nAbout Mobile Era\nMobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo. We're passionate about developing mobile apps and want to see a kick-ass event in Oslo for people like ourselves. The organizing committee consists of developers who are also active in organizing open events, conferences and meetups in the Oslo developer community.\n\nOur topics: iOS / Android, Mobile web / PWA, Cross-platform / JS-to-Native, IoT / Hardware, Mobile UX / Accessibility\n\nFollow us on:\n\nWebsite: mobileera.rocks\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mobileeraconf\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mobileeraconf/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mobileeraconf"
