description: "Beauty in Code 2018 was a single-track full day IT-conference held at the Malmö Live conference center on March 3, 2018, featuring seven different speakers from three continents.\nAslam Khan about his session \"Complexity sucks\": Building software is mostly about trying to wrap our heads around the complexity of a domain. If we understand the domain, we have a better chance of producing a simpler design. The harsh reality is that there is a pretty good chance of deforming that simple design over months and years. The challenge we face is dealing with inherent complexity up front and insidious complexity that sneaks in later. In this talk I will share some techniques that I find useful in tackling domain complexity."
