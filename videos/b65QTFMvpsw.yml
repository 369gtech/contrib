description: "Gabriele Provinciali\nInnovation Business Solution Architect\nOracle\n\nThe Proxima City project is a cloud-connected and intelligent city model, based on LEGO, Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Oracle Cloud resources to provide an integrated experience to citizens, administrations and industries. Proxima includes a plethora of Edge Services components coded in different languages and environments (C, Java, JavaScript, Python) such as Smart Trash, Smart Lighting, Energy Monitoring, Smart Parking, Smart Safety. The Edge Services are connected, via IoT and a serverless architecture, to a number of Cloud Services (Chatbot, Dashboards, Stream Analytics) allowing data-at-rest and data-in-motion analysis and a range of value-added services provided to citizens. The Proxima City model can be used as an SDK to generate events from the physical world and process events both in the Edge environment and the Cloud environment, allowing to design and test a new generation of user-centric services."
