description: "# Developer Experience (Opening Keynote)\n\nChris O'Dell - Monzo\n\n\"When building software, we almost always think of our customers - the users of our product. But, what about the software we use to build our product? The tools the engineer uses for the job? Regardless of whether you adopted “off the shelf” solutions, or built tooling in-house to support your unique operational use-cases, they’ll often be put together by someone who had an itch to scratch or was tired of doing the task manually.\n\nThese tools build the Developer Experience of your engineers. This is an oft-neglected aspect of the software building process. Bottlenecks and ease of use for these tools tends to be overlooked as it is generally only visible to the engineers themselves.\n\nAt Monzo we gathered metrics around our development and deployment process to try and find the bottlenecks. We also turned to our UX experts for guidance and applied their discovery techniques to our engineers so we could learn about and improve their development experience. It’s an ongoing process as new bottlenecks and improvements can always be found. By sharing our experience, I hope to inspire you to grow your own Developer Experience by treating it as a product.\"\n\n## About nor(DEV):con\n\nThe eastern region's biggest tech conference runs annually in February with a fantastic line-up of speakers and workshops. In our fifth year we joined 41 speakers, over 5 tracks, speaking on a wide range of subjects. Day 1 kicked off with technical deep dives into popular and important languages, frameworks and process. Our key theme for 2020 was wellbeing, with plenty of talks on the main stage around the subject on Day 2, alongside Workshops and plenty of tech talk too.\n\nYou can read more about the line up for 2020 at https://2020.nordevcon.com/ or watch 2021 shape up on our main site https://nordevcon.com/\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes.
