In this session, we will explore how developers are targeted as a vehicle for malware distribution, how immensely we depend on open-source maintainers to release timely security fixes, and how the race to the cloud creates new security concerns for developers to cope with, as computing resources turn into infrastructure as code.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\nSnyk → https://snyk.io/\nToptal → https://www.toptal.com/freelance-jobs\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nSonarSource → https://www.sonarsource.com/\nmabl → https://www.mabl.com/\nLambdaTest → https://www.lambdatest.com/\nThundra → https://www.thundra.io/\nNeuraLegion → https://www.neuralegion.com/\nMicrosoft → https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStream → https://getstream.io/\nBirds Eat Bug → https://birdeatsbug.com/"
