Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nK9P: Kubernetes as 9P Files - Terin Stock, Cloudflare \n\nK9P, a virtual file system, exposes the state of a Kubernetes cluster as files. Our terminals have been optimized over the last 40 years towards working with files, kubectl not so much. K9P allows us to carry the mantra of \"everything is a file\" to the distributed computing extreme.    K9P allows you to integrate Kubernetes resources into an existing workflow, or create new ones. Scale a Deployment by writing to a file. Locate failing Pods with grep. Update configuration in ConfigMaps with sed. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaa3"
