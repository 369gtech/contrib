description: "Questions:\n\n1. How useful do you think is ITIL for an IT service management team that strives to embrace DevOps? (I work in an Public Sector IT organization where ITIL is quite predominant, unfortunately).\n2. In the Accelerate book, you define (delivery) Lead Time approximately as from commit to delivered in Production. In general literature this is referred to as Cycle Time, while Lead Time is defined as from idea to delivered in production. This has led to quite many confusions and discussions in our company :-) So I just wonder why you did not use the cycle time definition to define what you have defines as Delivery Lead Time.\n3. The new found in interest in Digital Transformation is same as using technology for business decision making you have touched in Phoenix Project. Can you comment on the current trend?\n4. I’ve got a coworker that’s looking for some good DevOps success stories from medium sides businesses (say around 40-500 employees). This is something I’ve found quite hard to search for as a lot of the press out there are (as I’m sure you’re aware) pretty fluffy, hype driven by marketing / PR firms. I was wondering if you had a few good examples (or even stories if you have the time) from small to medium sides business that have embraced a DevOps culture and implemented DevOps aligned processes - or if you know of a reliable source for these stories if you could point me in that direction?\n5. Does quick implementation of TOC /Lean/ Six Sigma usually take a mentor like Jonah or Eric.\n6. Do you see Dev(Sec)Ops progressing beyond the CI/CD pipeline to continuous scanning and active prompts to developers to prevent insecure code.\n7. How do you see the role of the Software Test Engineer fit into the world of DevOps?\n8. Is DevOps only for engineers? Should anyone else in the value stream even care?\n9. Hi, I am a strong believer in the value of DevOps and I’m working in my organization to promote DevOps culture and practises. DevOps, however, is almost always linked to web companies, whereas the one I work for mostly develops non web-oriented software, and engineers struggle to see how DevOps applies for them. Can we do more to help non web-companies embrace DevOps?\n10. I’m considering attending DOES London since the travel fees would be reduced. I’ve watched a lot of the Youtube videos of previous conferences. What benefits would I get from attending that I wouldn’t be able to get from watching the Youtube videos later?\n11. Still many companies including where I work, IT group’s objective (reporting to CIO) is operational metrics whereas business needs Strategic needle movers and are not aligned. Do you think only CEO level urgency to break this barrier and democratize technology initiatives and resources would only change things. The challenge is IT think providing infrastructure vs Business expecting IT to deliver value without partnership is still prevalent.\n12. Culture is a result of and input to a healthy environment.  I have not seen many successful cultural improvement efforts; what are the usual missing ingredients for achieving a good culture for rapid deployment environments.\n13. Where do you see Devops going in the next 5 years.\n14. How important are AI and DevOps for the future of companies? Is one more important than the other?\n15. What IT operating model shifts an organization should consider when implementing (a) Agile and (B) DevOps\n16. How has DevOps changed over the last decade?\n17. When can we expect your next book?\n18. What new projects are you working on now? I saw something about a podcast?"
