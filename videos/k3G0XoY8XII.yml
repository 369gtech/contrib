description: 'Visual Studio App Center is creating two new Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) features: Auth and Data. Join us as we discuss how app developers can authenticate their users to their apps and track their identities across App Center. In addition, using our Data service, developers can persist their app data in the cloud across multiple devices in both online and offline scenarios. In this demo-packed session, we''ll be demo-ing the Acquaint app to explore how these two services work together and across App Center to scale across a large number of users.'
