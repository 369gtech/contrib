description: "Service Mesh Security in a Nutshell - Venil Noronha & Manish Chugtu, VMware, Inc.\n\nSecurity is one of the greatest challenges in the cloud-native world today. Service meshes promise several benefits including better connectivity, and observability, and most importantly security. Securing a cloud-native service involves securing it at several levels i.e. at the perimeter (ingress/egress gateways), when accessing other services, when persisting data, when processing requests, etc., and using a service mesh one can address several of these issues in a consistent and maintainable manner.  In this talk, we will present some of the key patterns that one can use for securing cloud-native services when working with north-south and east-west traffic. We will talk about available TLS choices (passthrough, mTLS, etc.), AuthN/AuthZ constructs, JWT support, and extension mechanisms within Envoy/Istio that you can leverage for building customized policy frameworks. We will also discuss application security in the context of multi-cluster service mesh deployments. Come join us!"
