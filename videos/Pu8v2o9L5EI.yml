Many errors and headaches come from the difficulties involved in working and testing such code.\n\nIn this talk we'll look at a simple approach on how to write logic that is side-effects rich to make easier to maintain and test, no matter if we are interacting with databases, external apis or any other type of service.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/claudio-ortolina/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - CLAUDIO ORTOLINA\nWorking professionally with Elixir since 2014\n\nClaudio has got more than 8 years of commercial experience in complex web applications and apis, with expertise in Elixir, Ruby, Elm and JavaScript and he previously worked at New Bamboo Web Development Ltd.
