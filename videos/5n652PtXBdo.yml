recordingDate: 1530789612
description: "In this session, Simon Stiebellehner explains that text embedding algorithms are not only of great value for typical NLP problems involving text. Surprisingly, word2vec also beats state-of-the-art models in a variety of recommendation tasks. Moreover, its efficiency is of particularly great value for practitioners who often deal with large amounts of users and items, for instance in an online shop setting.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
