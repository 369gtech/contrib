description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary, 25 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe all love to hate large software systems. They are hard to build, \nhard to evolve, and don't work very well. Why is this? A lot of reasons,\nsome social, some technical, and some socio-technical. We believe that OSS\nprovides an excellent source of data to test hypotheses about the factors\nthat affect important phenomena/outcomes in software projects. Our group\nat UC Davis, comprising bio-informaticians, organizational behaviourists, \nphysicists, and software engineers, is using a range of different approaches\nto the analyze the veritable torrents of data pouring out of open source projects\nto understand how things work in OSS, and what tools and techniques can\nhelp. One important issue is IMMIGRATION: how do new people\njoin projects, and how can we help the difficult intellectual and social\nchallenges they face. We present two results:\n\n1.a) Can we build \"recommender\" tools that help programmers deal\nwith \"information overload\" by helping them focus their attention? \n\n1.b) Such tools have always been evaluated with user studies. Can\nwe do something more quantitative? \n\n2) What are the factors influencing immigration of new developers in Open source projects? \n\nJoint work with: V. Filkov, A. Swaminathan, G. Hsu, \nand students C. Bird, Z. Saul, and A. Gourley\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from NSF (Science of Design and\nHuman and Social Dynamics Programs), the IBM Faculty Fellowship Program, \nand the GrammaTech and SciTools corporations.\n\nSpeaker: Prem Devanbu\nPrem Devanbu is Professor of Computer Science at UC Davis, \nhe joined UC Davis after almost 20 years in Industry, including 17 years\nat AT Bell Labs and its various offshoots. He received his\nundergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering (Medium Current)\nfrom IIT Chennai, India, and his M.S., and Ph.D from Rutgers University\nin Piscataway, NJ."
