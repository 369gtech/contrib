description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. Building upon the low-level optimization primitives and techniques presented at \"Patterns for high-performance C#\" (DotNext Moscow 2017) and \"Scratched metal\" (DotNext Piter 2018), we'll explore advanced design principles to build configurable, composable and highly optimized code. We will present novel design principles that allow exploiting the JIT code emitting infrastructure rules to craft code that for those familiar with C++ it resembles metaprogramming. This is a hardcore talk aimed at engineers doing micro-optimization and high-performance computing library designers."
