description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/PayPal/open-identity-getting-to-know-your-users\nThis talk is going to shed some light on different techniques that help to authenticate users in your service via methods such as Basic Authentication and more advanced technologies like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Best practices will be presented and (dis-)advantages are going to be discussed.\n\nChoosing the right identity provider (like Facebook, Twitter, PayPal or Google Plus) can be difficult and there are different scenarios where it makes more or less sense to implement them. After leaving this session, the audience will have a broad overview of this topic and should be able to provide their users with a nice experience.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/tim-messerschmidt-getting-to-know-your-users.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
