title: 'RESTful Data Services with LinkRest (Andrus Adamchik, ObjectStyle)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1504536649
description: 'LinkRest (http://linkrest.io) is a small HTTP-based protocol and a Java framework that rethinks how REST APIs should be built and consumed. It turns each API endpoint into a graph query engine, giving the client full control over the shape and contents of the requested data sets, while the server controls query strategy and security. The talk will start with the easy parts â€“ how to reuse an existing Apache Cayenne ORM model for the REST service and write simple Java one-liners to get it up and running. Then we will delve into alternative backends, graph access security and parallel data processing.'
