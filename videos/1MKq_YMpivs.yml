He will show you the live information hints, which enrich your source code with information from running Spring Boot applications. That way, you can directly see in your source code which beans got created, how they got wired, what conditions evaluated to true, and a lot more. This gives you a unique insight into your running app, directly from your source code.\n\nTo learn more about the all-new Spring Tools 4, to download the latest version of the Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, or Atom, please visit: https://spring.io/tools"
