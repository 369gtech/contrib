description: "There seems to be a new programming language every week, and for us busy developers we just don’t have the time to keep up with them. But have you wondered what we might have missed out on whilst we’re busy working in our language of choice?\n\nHaving spent time with numerous programming languages the past few years, Yan Cui has learnt something new from each. In this talk, he will give a whirlwind tour of the interesting concepts and ideas he has encountered, from F#’s type providers and Rust’s borrowed pointers, to Elm’s signals and Idris’s dependent types to name a few.\n\nABOUT YAN CUI\n\nYan is a Server Architect Developer at Yubl, and a regular speaker at user groups and conferences. He keeps an active blog and is a co-author of “F# Deep Dives”."
