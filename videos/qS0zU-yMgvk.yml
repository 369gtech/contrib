description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nHUAWEI MOBILE SERVICES VS GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES? WE CAN USE BOTH!\nMarco Porcaro, Android Tech Lead, Synesthesia\n\nAs you know, with the ban signed by Trump last year, Huawei can no longer buy licenses from Google and other US companies.\nThis means that Huawei/Honor smartphone and tablets released in the last year doesn’t come with the Google Play Store and they are unable to use Google Play Services, but Huawei has created its own store (Huawei AppGallery) and its own ecosystem of services called Huawei Mobile Services.\n\nWhat does it means from a developer perspective?\nWhat are the services offered by Google that we can use also on Huawei devices?\nCan we use Google Maps and Google Ads without Play Services?\nThe FirebaseSDK will work on Huawei devices?\n\nIn this talk we will try to answer to all this questions and we’ll see how to setup a project to be ready to publish our app both on the Google Play Store and the Huawei AppGallery.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro​...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/​\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
