description: "Amongst all the platforms for app development, the web is arguably the only one that does not make good use of threading. On the web, the main thread has a lot of responsibilities, and we keep adding more by writing more sophisticated apps and using new web APIs. At the same time, the median phone is getting slower and device's screens refresh more frequently, leaving less time for our code to run.\n\nHow can we make sure our experience is great for everyone? How can we free up the main thread so our apps run smoothly on every device? The answer is architecture. Off-main-thread architecture.\n\nPresented by: Surma\n\nView the schedule → https://goo.gle/2nON8mp\n\n#ChromeDevSummit All Sessions → https://goo.gle/CDS19\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nEvent photos → \_https://goo.gle/CDS19Photos"
