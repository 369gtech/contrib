description: "One Stop Anomaly Shop (OSAS) is a complete machine learning framework aimed to discovered anomalies in a given dataset. The open source project represents an implementation of several Adobe’s Security Intelligence Team Patents and White papers.\n\n\n\nThe project aims to enable the user to create a custom pre-processing pipeline, using predefined recipes for numerical, categorical, text and combined datatypes. The output of the pipeline is a set of labels that describe the input data and that are later consumed by standard anomaly detection algorithms or supervised classifiers. The role of the pipeline/labels is to reduce data scarcity, while enhancing the accuracy of anomaly detection and supervised machine-learning algorithms even on small datasets.\n\n\nIts unique manner of tagging allows it to be used for a diverse range of datasets and projects. The Expert Knowledge Based tagging component makes it highly efficient at targeting security threats and shifts the underlaying operation from unsupervised learning towards a semi-supervised one.\n\n\nThe open source initiative contains the full source code of the project but also a dockerized version, equipped with an OSAS Web UI and an Elastic Search OpenDistro installation and integration for fast graphical analysis of the results.\n\n\nThe presentation will contain an end to end hands on PoC of how to levrage the off the shelf OSAS or how to fully customize a pipeline in just a couple of minutes/clicks.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/adobe/OSAS\n\n\n=== \n\n\nI’m a Security Engineer specialized in Incident Response. Now working for Adobe’s Security Coordination Center, I made the transition from the public (military intelligence) to the private sector almost 6 years ago. A big fan of automation and machine learning enthusiast, I spend most of his time involved in monitoring and threat hunting projects, always trying to identify the latest unconventional attacks.\n\n\nI’m currently leading a small engineering team focused on ML research in order to identify the things that cannot be detected via the conventional ways.\n\n\n--- \n\n\nTiberiu Boros is a Ph.D. in computer science, specifically in the field of Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis. He is currently working for Adobe’s Security Coordination Center and is an associate of the Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the Romanian Academy. Additionally, he maintains three Machine Learning open source projects (TTS-Cube, NLP-Cube and Tripod) and is a contributor to the DyNet Machine Learning Framework (developed by Carnegie Mellon University and many others). His research is focused on applied Natural Language and Speech Processing."
