It's chock full of amazing new resources that you can share with your co-workers who might be new to Spring, or simply helping to introduce Spring to those who might not be familiar with it - people coding in other languages, frameworks, or platforms. You've asked us to help make it easier to win the comparisons, and we've listened. Attend this session to get the ammo you need to win that internal bake off, and learn the details about how the site was built and deployed.\nLearn more at http://spring.io"
