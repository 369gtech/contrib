title: 'Event Sourcing with RSocket—Now We’re Talking!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327470
description: "In last year’s hit SpringOne talk, “Getting Started With RSocket,” I showed you how to quickly build RSocket clients and servers that were robust, test-able, and fun! This year, we’re going to go one better by putting these skills to practical use building an event-sourcing application. I believe that event-sourcing is *the best* way to build mission-critical persistence, but it wasn’t always the easiest choice. With modern frameworks all that has changed, so it's time we took our architectures to the next level by combining these two exciting technologies into one killer stack. Who’s with me?!!\n\nSteven van Beelen, Lead Developer at AxonIQ\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/event-sourcing-with-rsocketnow-were-talking"
