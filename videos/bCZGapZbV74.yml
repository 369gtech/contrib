description: "So you've decided to use TypeScript. Great – but, how do you start?.. Converting countless modules to TypeScript can be overwhelming; however, it’s not necessary. Nobody needs to start building a code base from scratch to accommodate TypeScript – TS and JS are not enemies, they are meant to co-exist. In this presentation, we’ll be going over ways of including TypeScript in existing (or even legacy) projects. With simple examples and a live discussions, we’ll be exploring degrees to which a project can migrate. The first level is so easy that everybody can do it in a few minutes – even during the presentation!\n\nSlides: https://slides.com/cannahum/typescript_presentation-2#/"
