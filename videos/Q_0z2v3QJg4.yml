description: "Lambda Days 2015 - Konrad Malawski - Need for Async: In pursuit of scalable internet-scale applications\n\nKonrad Malawski\nAkka hAkker @ Typesafe\n\nKonrad is a late-night passionate dev living by the motto \"Life is Study!\", hakking on the Akka toolkit at Typesafe.\nHis favourite discussion topics range from distributed systems to capybaras. He's a very active member of the polish IT community, co-leading or founding multiple technology user groups in Krak√≥w. Over the last years he's been presenting at conferences such as: GeeCON, JavaOne SF, JFokus or Devoxx.\nIn those rare times he's not coding, he spreads the joy of computer science, through helping local user groups and whitepaper reading clubs.\n\nNeed for Async: In pursuit of scalable internet-scale applications\n\nIt's the year 2015, so unless you've been living under a rock for the last decade, you probably have heard about servers and platforms needing to go asynchronous in order to scale. But really, how deep did you dive into the reasons as why this need arrises? This talk aims to explain the various reasons and techniques that can be (and often are) used in developing high performance web applications - from the kernel depths, to the high level abstractions that all contribute to such designs.\n\nWe'll start with the lowest level of them all - the network transports we all use and how they impact latency in our systems.\nThen we will move on to operating systems' socket selector implementation details and the now legendary C10K problem, to see how implementations were forced to change in order to survive the ever-rising number of concurrent connections. Next we'll dive into processor and thread utilisation effects and how parallel programming - using either message-passing or stream processing  style libraries fits into the grand picture of pursuing the most stable and lowest latency characteristics we could dream of."
