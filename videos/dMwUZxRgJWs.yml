title: 'GTAC 2013: WebDriver for Chrome'
recordingDate: 1367254722
description: "http://g.co/gtac2013\nSlides: http://goo.gl/6rA9q\n\nKen Kania, Google\n\nFrom its start as a Windows-only browser, Chrome has expanded to Mac, Linux, ChromeOS, and most recently, Android and iOS.  User level testing of web applications across these platforms has been difficult and necessitated various automation approaches.  This talk will describe the work the Chrome team is doing to make WebDriver available for Chrome on all platforms.  This will include a technical look at the underlying approach but will focus on how developers can use the new ChromeDriver to write tests for Chrome's various platforms.  Also, the current state of the project and a roadmap for its future will be covered."
