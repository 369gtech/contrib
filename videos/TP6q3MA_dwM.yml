title: 'Think as a Platform - Tal Bebchuk (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1628633938
description: "Every software starts with a single line of code. When a company grows, its codebase grows, and ideally, more code should be shared between teams. This shared code, which lets developers focus on their applications, becomes the platform code and will typically be implemented by the infrastructure teams.\nHowever, are platforms only for big companies? For library developers?\nIn this talk, Tal will show how we are all kinds of platform developers.\nWhen refactoring, when building our components, we all use platform thinking principles.\nTal will share tips, tricks and challenges in platform thinking, and on how and when to best apply them.\n\nBio: Tal is a software engineer who worked on a variety of projects, from user-facing projects for millions of users to platform and infrastructure tools for developers. Eager about abstraction, design, and clean code.\nShe is also a redhead and believes anything is possible after getting together for a cup of coffee."
