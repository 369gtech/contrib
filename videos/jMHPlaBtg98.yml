description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nAt the dawn of mobile App Stores, Daniel was at the forefront of developers and published about 30 different apps within a short period of time - trying to take a market share of what was out there. One of the fun projects took off and led him towards founding his own mobile app agency. After working on big text recognition related projects for clients like Red Bull Mobile, Daniel and his team focused on shaping their robust text recognition solution into a powerful SDK: Anyline."
