title: 'BDD and browser automation with Geb and Spock (Bogdan Danilyuk, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1406704079
description: 'With application and team growth such questions as keeping documentation up to date, sharing of the knowledge, communication between stakeholder and development team became more and more actual. BDD as methodology is aimed to minimize negative impact of those issues. Spock and Geb frameworks will help us to illustrate BDD implementation on specific example.'
