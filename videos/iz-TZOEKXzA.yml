title: 'How to Generate Images with Tensorflow (LIVE)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492627383
description: "We'll build a Variational Autoencoder using Tensorflow to generate images. We'll go through several examples including digit images and pokemon images. VAE's allow us to generate, compress, denoise, and even fuse images together. They are an incredibly powerful tool and we'll go over the implementation details (math included) in this live session.\n\nCode: https://github.com/llSourcell/how_to_generate_images_with_tensorflow_LIVE\n\nPlease Subscribe!
