description: "Prasanth Anbalagan, Senior Software Engineer (QE and Analysis) on the Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence Team at Red Hat\nPresented at MLconf 2018\nAbstract: Machine Learning is widely used in Software Engineering to improve tasks like software development, testing, maintenance, etc., For the purpose of continued improvement, machine learning techniques will need to be integrated into existing infrastructure that support the different stages of software life cycle. Such integration often presents challenges like implementing the machine learning models, selecting and deploying the right infrastructure to experiment with the models, in addition to having the necessary data science background and skills, etc., In this talk, we present AI-Library, an open source machine learning framework that includes machine learning algorithms as well as machine learning solutions to several software engineering use cases. AI-Library enables users to work with machine learning models without worrying about infrastructure issues, model complexity or any data science expertise. We share the lessons learned in our machine learning experiments performed over software artifacts at Red Hat and also demonstrate usage of the framework with an example.\n\nSee Prasanth's presentation slides on our slideshare page here: https://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/ai-library-an-open-source-machine-learning-framework"
