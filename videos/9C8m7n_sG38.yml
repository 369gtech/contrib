description: "Metrics Driven Blue-green Deployments using Spinnaker’s Cloud Foundry Integration - Amith Nambiar & Pas Apicella, Pivotal\n\nBlue-green deployment is a technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called Blue and Green.\n\nAt any time, only one of the environments is live, with the live environment serving all production traffic. Traditionally, the decision to switch from Blue to the Green environment has been by doing some basic manual tests in the (new) Green environment and mapping and unmapping routes from the new and old environments.\n\nSpinnaker (www.spinnaker.io) is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes with high velocity and confidence.\n\nSpinnaker can be used for automated Canary analysis. Canary is a deployment process in which a change is partially rolled out, then evaluated against the current deployment (baseline) to ensure that the new deployment is operating at least as well as the old. This evaluation is done using key metrics that are chosen when the canary is configured.\n\nIn this talk, we will present to you on:\n1. What integrations exists in Spinnaker for Cloud Foundry and how to set it up.\n2. Why is Blue Green Deployments with Spinnaker better for Cloud Foundry applications?\n3. How to do Blue Green deployments on Cloud Foundry using Spinnaker.\n4. Configure a pipeline and metrics for Canary analysis\n5. End to end demo of configuring a pipeline and how it all works together on Cloud Foundry\n\nAbout Pas Apicella\nPas Apicella is a Advisory Platform Architect APJ SME at Pivotal where Pivotal's Spring and\nPivotal Cloud Foundry, combined with our unique approach to agile development and\ncontinuous delivery, are transforming how the world builds software. He has code\ncontributed to OSS CF Projects at Pivotal and constantly blogs about Pivotal Cloud Foundry,\nPAS, PKS and Spring.
