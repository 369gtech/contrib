recordingDate: 1511527655
description: "High maintainability is a necessary property of a code base for it to have long-term business value. Good code intuitively leads to high maintainability – but what is good code and how do you achieve it? If you discuss with fellow developers, things like readability, separation of concerns and inversion of control may come up. But how do you achieve those? In this presentation, Per Rovegård talks about five very important architectural principles for developing a code base towards higher maintainability and thus better code. The principles range from hygiene (automated tests) to wild (extreme separation between business logic and infrastructure) and will inspire you to start thinking about better code already tomorrow!\nPer Rovegård works as a software consultant at factor10. Per is a passionate architect and developer who firmly believes in an agile mindset and a focus on simplicity. He is interested of all aspects of software development, but in particular those related to software excellence and high business value. Per has over 15 years of professional experience as an architect and coach in a range of different industries, from telecom to government agencies.\n___\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
