description: "Data science, machine learning and analytics are changing the world – and the world of design won’t be immune to this transformation. Big data and tools such as machine learning can provide the types of insights that user researchers and user experience designers have always dreamed of.\n\nThis data-driven approach allows user experience designers to better target areas for further investigation and uncover what drives these behaviours, ultimately designing better products and services.\n\nRamy Nassar\nDirector, Service Innovation, Architech\nhttps://twitter.com/architechca"
