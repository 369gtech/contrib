description: "Monoliths Between Microservices by Vladimir Dementyev\n\n\"Rails applications tend to turn into giant monoliths. Keeping the codebase maintainable usually requires architectural changes. Microservices? A distributed monolith is still a monolith. What about breaking the code into pieces and rebuild a monolithic puzzle out of them?\n\nIn Rails, we have the right tool for the job: engines. With engines, you can break your application into componentsâ€”the same way as Rails combines all its parts, which are engines, too.\n\nThis path is full of snares and pitfalls. Let me be your guide in this journey and share the story of a monolith engine-ification.\"\n\n__________\n\nVladimir is a mathematician who found his happiness in programming Ruby and Erlang, contributing to open source and being an Evil Martian. Author of AnyCable, TestProf and many yet unknown ukulele melodies."
