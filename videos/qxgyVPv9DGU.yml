description: "In 2011, Thomas Thwaites spent 9 months and Â£1187.54 and built his own toaster.\n\nIn his own words, he described the toaster as a partial success because \"for about five seconds, the toaster toasted, but then unfortunately, the elements kind of melted itself\". He is right in the sense that his audacious attempt won him fame and attention, and his TED talk was viewed more than 1M times. But judging his creation on its own and it's an abject failure that was 300 time more expensive than a commercial toaster, took too long to build and was utterly unfit for purpose.\n\nAs a business that is competing in an increasingly competitive world enabled by advancements in technology, the questions we should be asking ourselves are: \"what are the business value, cost and risk in building our own infrastructure vs using a managed service?\". In this talk, let's take an objective look at the ongoing debate of containers vs serverless and look at the arguments of control vs responsibility, vendor lock-in and more!\n\nFull Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp4wchugWzHunbhpQtRRE1XQtliXIkuYU\nWebsite: https://milan.serverlessdays.io\nServerlessDays Map: https://serverlessdays.io/map"
