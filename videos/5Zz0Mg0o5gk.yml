title: 'GeeCON 2019: Charlie Gracie - Create your own Interpreter with a JIT in 1 hour'
recordingDate: 1563984049
description: 'During this talk I will describe how you can use Eclipse OMR technologies to easily create an Interpreter for a new or existing runtime and get a JIT for free! I will walk through the simple steps to create a small, efficient Interpreter and JIT using the new OMR InterpreterBuilder for any runtime. One of the major benefits is that once the Interpreter is written the same code is used to create a JIT for the runtime. This means there is only 1 place to modify code. Everyone understands the benefit of having a JIT so getting one for free is a huge advantage. By the end of the talk we will have successfully implemented a simple Interpreter and JIT using the InterpreterBuilder and compared the performance with an Interpreter written in C++. Runtime and language enthusiasts should definitely check out the OMR project to see how it can help. The OMR project is a set of open source C and C++ components that can be used to build robust language runtimes that support many different hardware and operating system platforms. One key feature of the OMR project is that it can be used to improve an existing runtime for languages with mature communities without forcing the communities to switch from their favourite runtime.'
