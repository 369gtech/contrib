description: "Extending Kubernetes or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Trust the Spec - David Zhu, Google \n\nKubernetes Storage is moving to a new model for volume plugin development with the new Container Storage Interface (CSI) specification, and engineers from multiple companies are now implementing CSI drivers. However, switching to this new paradigm is not without its fair share of challenges.    This talk explores some of the important lessons learned from writing a production-grade CSI driver and discusses some of the challenges that come with conforming to an actively evolving spec.     Attendees will learn about dealing with concurrent development across multiple projects, working with different interpretations of the same specification, and getting user traction on a new project when the current alternative “just works.” These issues become more relevant as Kubernetes moves towards an increasingly decoupled architecture. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrUU"
