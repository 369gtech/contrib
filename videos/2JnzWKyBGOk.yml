title: 'Java Day Minsk 2017 - Ruslan Ibragimov - Kotlin Coroutines: Asynchronous Programming Made Simple'
recordingDate: 1514027857
description: "Today more and more applications are written with asynchronous code. Languages have first class support for asynchronous programming: go with goroutines, C# and Python with async/await, and at the end JavaScript with callbacks, promises and async/await. There is already a lot of code in JVM ecosystem written for asynchronous applications: Netty, RxJava, Spring Reactor, etc. Even Java 8 provides CompletableFuture, and Java 9 Reactive Streams Interface. So clearly, asynchronous programming is our present and future. \nBut writing code with asynchronous primitives in Java adds complexity to our systems. Kotlin now offers means to tame this complexity by making coroutines first-class citizens in the language through the single primitive: suspending functions. We will see what are Coroutines in Kotlin, their practical use-cases and interoperability with Java."
