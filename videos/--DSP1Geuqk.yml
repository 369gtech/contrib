description: "Markus Junginger, CTO, ObjectBox\n\nCROSS PLATFORM APP CORES WITH MODERN C++\nCross-Plattform Development, Talk, Pro\n\nC++ is known for its efficiency, but did you know that modern C++ (C++11 and higher) is also fun to work with? For cross platform development, there’s hardly a better choice when it comes to performance sensitive code. And especially on Android with its VM based architecture, C++ outruns any Java/Kotlin based implementation by far.\nCross-platform development with C++ is not restricted to the mobile world. With the right setup, you can boost your productivity by running your code on the desktop with minimal turnaround times. Basically, there’s no Gradle build you need to wait for."
