description: "In this 2015 GDC talk, developers Matt Boch, Jon Moldover, Nick Bonardi, David Young and Brian Schmidt discuss specific case studies from Harmonix's \"Fantasia,\" Ubisoft's \"Rocksmith 2\" and Smule's \"Magic Piano\" and \"Sing! Karaoke\" to analyze how developers can give players ample opportunity to be expressive (as actual instruments do) while providing the \"musical training wheels\" that help make music novices sound good, no matter how they choose to play (as games do).\n\n\nRegister for GDC: http://ubm.io/2gk5KTU\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
