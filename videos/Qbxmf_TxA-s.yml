description: "RubyConf 2019 - How to lose 50 Million Records in 5 minutes by Jon Druse\n\nJoin me in re-living the worst catastrophe of my more than a decade long career as a developer. Enough time has passed that I can laugh about it now and hopefully you will too while being inspired to stop cutting corners.\n\r\n\nItâ€™s like a game of Clue and all the different parts of the system are characters. Which one was the killer? Spoiler alert, it was me, in the office with the keyboard.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
