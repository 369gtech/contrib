description: "JavaFX 8 offers a rich set of visually-appealing GUI components with a property binding mechanism for event handling. This session shows how JavaFX binding makes desktop client application development easier and faster to develop.\n\nThe session begins with an overview of JavaFX binding strategies as an alternative to event listeners. After showing how bindings work with JavaFX controls, you learn how JavaFX binding simplifies event-driven programming with effects, shapes, and animation. The session includes many useful examples, including stand-alone JavaFX programs and the integration of JavaFX into Swing-based applications.\n\nAll example programs use JavaFX 8 with Java 8 lambdas and functional programming. Prior experience with JavaFX is not required for this session."
