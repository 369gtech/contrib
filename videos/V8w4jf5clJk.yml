description: "Cost of Delay--How PCF Helped Demonstrate the DoD Can't Afford Business as Usual - Capt Bryon Kroger & Tory Galvin, United States Air Force\n\nIn partnership with Pivotal Labs, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) and Defense Innovation Unit Experiment (DIUx) are demonstrating that cloud-native cycle times can lead to astronomical impacts. Our implementation of PCF paired with the \"Pivotal Way\" decreased our initial release time from an average of five years down to 120 days! Additionally, as opposed to 1-2 year update cycles on minor releases, we have now achieved continuous delivery. In the case of our first application in production, doing business the old way would have resulted in a $391M cost of delay. Rather than focusing on Total Life Cycle Cost to make decisions, the proposal is to demonstrate the Cost of Delay to inform and guide. \n\nAbout Victoria Galvin\nAn Operations Research Analyst for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center that has provided cost estimates for weapon systems including: aircraft, tactical data links, satellites, sensors and now focusing on software cost estimating. Her integrated schedule/cost analysis work has earned her numerous awards-proving the value of her analytical background and fresh perspective on high visibility in defense programs. She has presented both locally and internationally with the International Cost Estimating and Analysis Association, and to senior leadership within the AF both military and civilian. \n\nAbout Capt Bryon Kroger\nAn Intelligence Officer turned Product Owner, Bryon now serves as COO for Project Kessel Run at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center. Having been on the receiving end of poor software from the Defense Acquisitions Cycle for seven years, he has a deep appreciation for just how steep the Cost of Delay can be--measured not just in dollars but sometimes in lives. His passion to reduce that cost led him to the acquisitions community where he embarked on a cloud-native journey for intelligence systems using PCF. He has made a career of presenting to the highest levels of military leadership on topics ranging from national security to DevOps."
