description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — As the #1 insurer of cars and homes in the United States, State Farm® has embarked on a journey to fundamentally change the way teams deliver software. State Farm is reshaping the way teams work and interact from the adoption of DevOps practices and behaviors, to the realignment into empowered product teams. With over 7000 IT professionals, a transformation of this magnitude requires extraordinary effort to lay the foundation for change through the availability of proper tooling, the disbanding of unwarranted processes, and the commitment to education through a DOJO experience. \n\nThis session provides attendees an in-depth look at the State Farm journey to revamp their approach to software delivery using Value Stream Mapping, DOJOs, and a lot of enthusiasm to encourage and accelerate adoption of DevOps by product teams. We will share how we used an organic, bottom-up approach to start changing the delivery culture at a traditional, top-down enterprise by breaking a few rules, but maintaining a focus on the customer.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
