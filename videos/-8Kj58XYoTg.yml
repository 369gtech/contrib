title: 'Your Car “Knows” You: Security in Connected Vehicles & Roadway Infrastructure - Tiffany Rad'
recordingDate: 1528191458
description: "Dystopian writer, Cory Doctorow, says, “A self-driving car is a computer you put your body in.” In the near future, the transportation infrastructure will interact with vehicles that are capable of making operational decisions for us. Connected roadway infrastructure and vehicles are already a reality in big cities.\n\nThis presentation will discuss how computer engineering decisions are being made regarding how our vehicles will get us where we want to go and how technologies are being developed to customize transportation experiences based upon our personal preferences; our smart phones connect to our cars and our cars connect to the transportation infrastructure. How secure are technologies that connect the transportation infrastructure to the computers in our cars? This will review prior attacks on transportation infrastructure, what we have learned from them, and share recent results of smart infrastructure pilot programs and the current state of semi-autonomous cars and trucks."
