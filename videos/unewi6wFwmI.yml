In this talk, Jorge and Dawn from SIG Contributor Experience will live out a week within the Kubernetes community by walking the audience through what happens in this busy community. As part of the day by day tour of the community, we will cover: * Getting started and locating meeting calendars * Finding and participating in SIGs * Attending meetings and what to expect * How to get involved * Where to get help  New contributors, users interested in contributing, engineering managers whose teams are contributing, and anyone interested in learning about new ways to get involved in the Kubernetes community will benefit from attending. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaVn"
