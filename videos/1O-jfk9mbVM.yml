title: 'Building Oracle NoSQL Database Applications with EclipseLink'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784724
description: "The database market is bursting with new technologies built especially to handle a new class of workload for applications dealing with frequent data format changes (agile production apps) or data that is semistructured (nested) in nature. Each of these new technologies has its own APIs, but EclipseLink NoSQL provides a consistent JPA-style API for NoSQL data stores that greatly simplifies application development. This session presents a quick review of EclipseLink NoSQL and discusses a range of common design and implementation patterns encountered in developing applications for NoSQL databases. It illustrates the concepts with concrete examples built with EclipseLink NoSQL and Oracle NoSQL Database.\n\n\nAuthors:\nShaun Smith\nShaun Smith is co-lead of the Eclipse Dali Java Persistence API Tools Project, Ecosystem Development Lead for the Eclipse Java Persistence Platform (EclipeLink), a committer on the EMF Tools Teneo project, and a product manager for Oracle TopLink. He's been building systems using object-relational mapping technologies for a decade in both Java and Smalltalk in the energy, telecommunications, and banking industries. Prior to joining the TopLink team at Oracle, Shaun was a consultant specializing in application architecture and agile software development methods with a particular focus on developing enterprise applications using test driven design. He's a SpringOne alumni speaker and a frequent conference presenter having recently spoken at EclipseCon, EclipseWorld, The Server Side Symposium, JavaPolis, and JavaOne.\nView more trainings by Shaun Smith at https://www.parleys.com/author/shaun-smith\n\nRobert Greene\nRobert Greene is a principle product manager / strategist for Oracleâ€™s NoSQL Database technology.
