description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/danilop/serverless-beyond-functions\n\nOne of the great advantage of serverless development is the possibility to “chain” multiple functions together and design event-driven architectures. Such applications are easier to maintain because our human minds are much better at looking for cause-effect relationships than understanding complex workflows. It's time to go beyond that, considering serverless in its broader definition of building applications “without thinking about servers”, and use all the available tools.\n\nJeffConf Milan - 29 September 2017\nhttps://milan.jeffconf.com"
