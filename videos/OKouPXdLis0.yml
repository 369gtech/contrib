description: "Speaker: Davey Shafik, Akamai Technologies\n\nHTTP/2 (H2) is coming, and along with it a whole new way of communicating over the web. Connection re-use, prioritization, multiplexing, and server push are just some of the features in H2. In this talk we'll look at the HTTP/2 protocol, and at how we can use asynchronous request now with HTTP/1.x. We will also look at what asynchronous requests and H2 mean for your API and clients in the future.\n\n*Davey Shafik* is a full-time developer with over 15 years of experience in PHP and related technologies. He is a Developer Evangelist at Akamai Technologies and has written three books, numerous articles, and spoken at conferences the world over. He is best known for his books, the Zend PHP Certification Study Guide and PHP Master: Write Cutting Edge Code, and as the creator of PHP Archive (PHAR) for PHP 5.3.\nDavey is passionate about improving the tech community. He co-organizes the Prompt initiative (mhprompt.org), dedicated to lifting the stigma surrounding mental health discussions, and has worked with PHPWomen since its inception.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/319757561702705/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VFt1/"
