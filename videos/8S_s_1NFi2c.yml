title: 'Understanding Microsoft’s Platform for Autonomous Systems with Machine Teaching - BRK2035'
recordingDate: 1557364668
description: 'In this age of rapidly emerging technology, companies have been harnessing automation to drive efficiency across machines and systems. We are now transitioning from an automated world to one that is increasingly autonomous. Instead of performing a specific repetitive task without any variation, autonomous systems are capable of sensing and dynamically responding to changing environments to accomplish the desired goal. In this executive session, you will see how Microsoft’s platform for autonomous systems is based on a new approach to AI development called machine teaching. With machine teaching, domain experts can leverage their knowledge to teach these systems, instead of requiring expertise on complex AI techniques such as deep reinforcement learning. Systems are safely trained in a virtual environment and deployed to the real world with explainable and auditable predictions, that keep humans in the loop.'
