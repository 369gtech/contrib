On the face of it, they should also help us create much more secure applications - the ability to protect in depth is a key part of protecting systems, and microservices make this much easier. On the other hand, information that used to flow within single processes, now flows over our networks, giving us a real headache. How do we make sure our shiny new microservices architectures aren’t less secure than their monolithic [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotober.com/2018/sessions/523\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotober\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
