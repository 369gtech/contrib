description: "From the 2015 Velocity Conference in New York: Getting bits out to customers as they’re ready is slowly becoming the norm for many organizations. But simply being able to ship software faster doesn’t actually mean we’re building better products. In this talk, Jeff will cover how our increasingly continuous capabilities are leading to an increasingly continuous culture. This has profound implications on how we build software, how we staff teams, how we manage and incentivize them, as well as their ever-increasing levels of empowerment and autonomy.\n\nJeff will cover practical tips for team structure, funding patterns, and incentive structures, to help leverage this continuous reality into a great company culture that ships successful products.\n\nAbout Jeff Gothelf (Neo Innovation):\nJeff Gothelf is Neo’s lean evangelist, spreading the gospel of great team collaboration, product innovation and evidence-based decision making.\n\nJeff is a speaker and thought leader on the future of user experience design, often teaching workshops or giving talks on building cultures that support teamwork and innovation. Jeff is passionate about advancing the principles that lie at the core of Neo, and often does so on a global scale.\n\nPrior to joining Neo, Jeff lead the UX design teams at TheLadders and Web Trends. Earlier he worked with and lead small teams of software designers at AOL. He is the co-author (with Josh Seiden) of “Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience” and the upcoming Sense and Respond (sensingbook.com)\n\nWatch more from Velocity NYC 2015: https://goo.gl/PZAqiY\nVisit the Velocity website: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
