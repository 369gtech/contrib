language: English
recordingDate: 1569832748
description: "Cyber-physical systems are attracting a lot of attention: attacks on connected cars received a lot of media exposure, as did attacks on industrial control systems, airplanes or medical devices.\n\nA lot of this interest is driven by vulnerability research (often in the form of “stunt hacking”). While engaging and attractive, does this research really help to answer the fundamental question of how to embed security analysis in design?\n\nWhy are we failing? What are the root causes? How do we do better and move beyond instilling fear? Walk with me in reviewing recent research, and in trying to find a way forward.\n\n=== \n\nStefano Zanero received a PhD in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, where he is currently an associate professor with the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria. His research focuses on malware analysis, cyberphysical security, and cybersecurity in general. Besides teaching “Computer Security” and “Computer Forensics” at Politecnico, he has an extensive speaking and training experience in Italy and abroad.\n\nHe co-authored over 90 scientific papers and books. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE, the IEEE Computer Society, and a lifetime senior member of the ACM. Stefano has been named a Fellow of ISSA (Information System Security Association) and sits in its International Board of Directors. A long time op-ed writer for magazines, Stefano is also a co-founder and chairman of Secure Network, a leading security assessment firm; a co-founder of 18Months, a cloud-based ticketing solutions provider; and a co-founder of BankSealer, a startup in the FinTech sector that addresses fraud detection through machine learning techniques."
