language: English
recordingDate: 1433259038
description: "This session outlines how to effectively test Java EE APIs such as JSF, Servlet, CDI, EJB 3, JPA, WebSocket, and JAX-RS. Java EE includes several new features that enhance testability such as generic dependency injection, CDI @Alternative, portable extensions, embedded containers, and JSF project stages. Using these features and best-of-breed tools such as JUnit and Arquillian, it is possible to perform unit, integration, system, and functional testing for Java EE APIs at all layers of the application. In addition to discussing tools and features, the session also demonstrates testing techniques such as designing for testability, mock objects, isolation, and test configuration.\n\n\nAuthor:\nReza Rahman\nReza Rahman is a long time former independent consultant and now officially a Java EE/GlassFish evangelist at Oracle.
