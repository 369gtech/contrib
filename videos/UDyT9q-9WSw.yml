description: "by Max Mehl\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2215/reuse_code_licensing.webm\n\nDeveloping Free Software is fun, dealing with the licensing and copyright information is not. The REUSE project changes that! With three simple steps, it makes adding and reading licensing and copyright information easy for both humans and machines. In this presentation, Max Mehl will guide through the REUSE principles and presents how to make clear licensing simple.\nIf you want to grant users the freedom to use, study, share, and improve your software, you have to grant those freedoms in the license of the software. To encourage people to develop Free Software, we help developers to understand and apply Free Software licensing. REUSE, started in 2017, contributes to this goal. Any project following the initiative's recommendations makes copyright and licensing information readable to both: humans and machines. This way, we want to ensure that individuals, organisations and companies who are re-using code are aware of the license terms chosen by the original author.\n\n\nREUSE does not reinvent the wheel. On the opposite, it integrates nicely into development processes and other best practices for Free Software licensing. Additionally, there are tools and documentation to help you get started. We will have a closer look at these during this talk.\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 12:20:00"
