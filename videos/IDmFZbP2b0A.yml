description: "Low Level JavaScript (LLJS) is an experimental language that lets you write memory-efficient and GC pause-free code less painfully. The research goal here is to explore low-level statically typed features in a high-level dynamically typed language. It can achieve predictable performance. It can make writing code that interfaces with WebGL almost pleasant. It's not pretty, but it gets the job done. \n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us. The speakers retain the copyright for their performances."
