description: "Ever wanted to build a car hacking prototype within a month to learn more about a car? We understand the frustration in looking for general tutorials on getting started.\n\nIn this talk, we will address the moving parts to achieve a working prototype on a test bench. We will demonstrate how to reverse engineer the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus communication protocol using individual car components, spoofing packets using open source tools, and demonstrating exploitability with actual crafted payloads. Through adopting a systematic methodology, we demonstrate how an attacker could potentially exploit cars by compiling a comprehensive database that expedites the exploit development process.\n\n=====\n\nAlina (0x410x54) Tan is the founder of Division Zero’s (Div0) Car Security Quarter (CSQ). Her expertise lies in securing Operational Technology (OT), Industrial Control System (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems — specifically on the offensive security of these systems. Her interest lies in pentesting OT and automotive systems.\n\n-----\n\nChun Yong is Cyber Data Analyst in the Government of Singapore. He is interested in threat emulation and creating larger interest in cyber security amongst the local community.\n\n-----\n\nTan Pei Si (Kaskrex) is a seasoned developer with a strong interest in cybersecurity. She is currently working in a cybersecurity film healing thyself in its own cybersecurity posture. Pei Si is an active advocate in the Singapore cybersecurity community — she actively contributes to Division Zero (Div0) and Infosec in the City (IICSG). She is also the pioneer member of Div0’s Car Security Quarter (CSQ). Pei Si’s interest lies in Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR), hardware hacking and DevSecOps.\n\n-----\n\nSolomon (swjs) Tan is currently waiting to start his university studies in Electrical Electronics Engineering (EEE). In the meantime, he develops his interest in radio communication, reverse engineering and cryptography."
