recordingDate: 1571253937
description: "West partnered with Pivotal to enable the consolidation and standardization of our portfolio. We identified over 170 applications running in diverse technology stacks for migration into Pivotal Platform and later enabled Pivotal Container Service for those that remained. West partnered with Pivotal Services to drive the technology, process, and cultural change necessary to complete the transformation, while simultaneously undergoing the organizational, staffing, and cultural changes that result for an ownership change.\n\nOne and a half years into this undertaking, we've learned many lessons we want to share with others starting their adoption journeys. The consistent theme is that Pivotal Platform and Pivotal Container Service just work, but that in order to be successful, an organization needs to enable their teams with supporting technologies, a streamlined process, and a culture of innovation.\n\nSpeaker: Terry Miles, Director, Portfolio Delivery, Intrado\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/170-live-apps-migrated-to-pivotal-platform-in-18-months-the-business-of-transformation"
