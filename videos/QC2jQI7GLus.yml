title: 'Unlocking secrets of proprietary software using Frida - Ole André Vadla Ravnås'
recordingDate: 1537869380
description: "Ever wanted to understand the internals of an application running on your desktop or smartphone? Want to know what data is passed to a particular crypto function? Then Frida is for you!\nFrida is a powerful and modern binary instrumentation framework which makes it easy to hook and trace arbitrary functions within target executables, and otherwise explore their functionality. Some similar tools include cycript, Introspy, Snoop-it. What really makes Frida shine is the rapid prototyping enabled through the use of its first-class scripting.\n\nFrida has many, many applications:\n- application pen testing\n- network tracing\n- fuzzing, error/fault injection\n- memory dumping\n- anti-jailbreak/root detection and evasion\n- custom developer tools\n- pokemon cheats\n\nIt it also very portable, supporting Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and QNX.\n\nThis talk will introduce Frida and show how it can be used to aid in analysis of binary applications. It will be packed with demos.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
