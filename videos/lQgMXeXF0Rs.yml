description: "by Jethro G. Beekman\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.4.601/rustsgx.webm\n\nIntel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) makes software secure from the outside. Rust makes it secure from the inside. This workshop will introduce you to Rust and the FortanixÂ® Enclave Development Platform (EDP) for Rust: how it works, what you can do with it, and why Rust is such a good fit for SGX.\n\n\nPlease note that this was previously scheduled for 11:15 and replaces the talk on \"Introduction to the CoSMIX Compiler\" by Yan Michalevsky.\n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 09:40:00"
