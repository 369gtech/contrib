description: "Smalltalk is coming back to the futureâ€”a future on the JVM. Redline Smalltalk is an implementation of the Smalltalk-80 language on the Java Virtual Machine. Redline goes from Smalltalk source code to bytecode on the fly. This session details how Redline works, generates bytecode, automatically adapts to Java classes, and uses the class loader ecosystem and how you can even emit bytecode with Smalltalk. It briefly covers the history of Smalltalk and what Redline hopes to be. If you like Smalltalk or are implementing a language on the JVM, this session will be of interest to you.
