recordingDate: 1532614023
description: "There has been much discussion recently about React Native from a development perspective, but I’d like to offer a different take. What are the pro’s and con’s from a managers perspective of React Native development? In this short talk I’ll talk about people, project and client management perspectives of a React native project.\n\nBio: Tom Melamed is the co-founder and Client Services Director of Calvium a thriving Mobile Development Agency. Throughout his career he’s spanned everything from app development to server architecture to sales and account management. He can often be found wearing a beard."
