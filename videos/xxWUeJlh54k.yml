title: 'Ring-Paxos: A High-Throughput Atomic Broadcast Protocol'
recordingDate: 1300225146
description: "Google Tech Talk (more below)\r\nMarch 3, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Prof. Fernando Pedone, University of Lugano.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nAtomic broadcast is an important communication primitive often used to implement state-machine replication. Despite the large number of atomic broadcast algorithms proposed in the literature, few works have discussed how to turn these algorithms into efficient executable protocols. Our main contribution, Ring Paxos, is a protocol derived from Paxos. Ring Paxos inherits the reliability of Paxos and can be implemented very efficiently. We report a detailed performance analysis of Ring Paxos and compare it to other atomic broadcast protocols. Ring Paxos can deliver nearly 1 Gbps of data to tens of servers in a local-area network. Ring Paxos is available as open source."
