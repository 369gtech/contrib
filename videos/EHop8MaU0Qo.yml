title: '"Creating More Inclusive Tech Spaces: Paths Forward" by Amy Wallhermfechtel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634227858
description: "Both technology companies and open source communities have undertaken various projects to try to improve the representation of underrepresented groups in tech spaces. Both have met with some success but also with substantial systemic barriers.\n\nThis talk will explore why it has proven both difficult and costly to move the needle on diversity in tech. It will analyze samples of practices used by technology companies, open source projects, and hacker/makerspaces as a means to understanding how various social systems, institutions, and ideologies have limited the scope and success of those efforts. It will then point to the concept of generative justice as a potential framework for rethinking the problem in a way that focuses on bottom-up, grassroots projects as the engine of broader systemic change.\n\nAmy Wallhermfechtel\nWorld Wide Technology\n@battleaxamy\n\nAmy is a labor and business historian and gender scholar turned software engineer.
