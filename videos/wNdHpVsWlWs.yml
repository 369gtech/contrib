title: 'Infoshare 2019 - Todd Palino: From Operations to Site Reliability in Five Easy Steps'
language: English
recordingDate: 1585308466
description: "This talk is based partly on talks that I gave at CA World and SREcon APAC, with some changes inspired by a talk that one of my colleagues gave on the evolution of SRE practices. Here is a starting abstract for the talk:\n\nAcross industries, modern operations teams have noted the emergence of a new role: the Site Reliability Engineer (SRE): an IT craftsperson who fuses software engineering and operations best practices to enable highly reliable software systems. Once the domain of technology giants, this discipline is both applicable and important for any organization looking to differentiate itself in a world increasingly defined by software.\n\nIn this session, Todd Palino from LinkedIn explores how SRE evolves from Operations by taking the ‘lid-off’ SRE at LinkedIn. He’ll describe how by crafting automation, problem-solving and building a partnership with software engineering teams, companies can build a high-trust and inclusive team culture that is needed to drive continuous improvement — and importantly, have lots of fun doing it!\n\nThe speech took place on 9th of May on Devtrends Stage during Infoshare 2019 in Gdansk, Poland.\n\n#DevOps #DataTech #DevTrends #SRE #Tech"
