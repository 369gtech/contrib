Television shows are now instigating online social interactions between viewers by requesting viewers, as part of the first broadcasts, to participate in simultaneous discussions about the shows. Examples include asking users to follow and comment on topics on Twitter. A more passive approach is also used that displays messages from social media participants on the TV screen during broadcasts. As a result of this trend of encouraging people to participate during TV viewing, social TV applications have arisen to facilitate the discussions even further. In this keynote I will discuss how TV networks and advertisers can derive value from all of the online social activity about TV."
