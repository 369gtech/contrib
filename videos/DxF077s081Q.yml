description: "Time is money. Understanding application responsiveness and latency is critical not only for delivering good application behavior but also for maintaining profitability and containing risk. But good characterization of bad data is useless. When measurements of response time present false or misleading latency information, even the best analysis can lead to wrong operational decisions and poor application experience. This presentation discusses common pitfalls encountered in measuring and characterizing latency. It demonstrates and discusses some false assumptions and measurement techniques that lead to dramatically incorrect reporting and covers ways to do a sanity check and correct such situations.\n\n\nAuthor:\nGil Tene\nGil Tene is CTO and co-founder of Azul Systems.
