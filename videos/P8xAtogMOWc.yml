recordingDate: 1389798263
description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nHigh Frequency Trading systems are in an arms race with no prizes for coming second. Today's environment is very different from a few years ago. New hardware architectures present opportunities and challenges. Costs are increasingly important. Richard will describe a typical trading system and then discuss how they are evolving to embrace new technologies including noSQL, FPGA's, GPU's, kernel bypass, RDMA and many core.\nA HFT system designer now needs to understand when to use these and how best to program them.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Give everybody a basic understanding of a High Frequency Trading system.\n\n- Describe how noSQL, FPGAs, GPU's, kernel bypass, RDMA and different programming models are being used to build the latest high frequency trading systems.\n\n- Guide developers as to what skill's are hot and where they need to strengthen their skills to get the best positions.\nTarget audience:\n\n- Existing HFT system designers, programmers who want to improve their systems and those seeking to learn about these high performant environments."
