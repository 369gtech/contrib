language: English
recordingDate: 1433236580
description: "This session discusses how Tomax moved to a new reactive architecture using Scala, Akka, and Play. It looks at how Tomax’s new architecture makes it possible to handle more transactions while saving money on server and cloud infrastructure and provides new ways of dealing with complex client interactions. The session takes a good look at what was involved in the transition as well as information to help the attendees implement a reactive architecture. It dives into the technical aspects of the architecture and looks at how to handle scale, resilience, and real-time event streams.\n\n\nAuthors:\nRyan Knight\nRyan Knight is a Senior Consultant at Typesafe on the Professional Services team where he does consulting and training for Scala, Akka and Play.
