title: 'M. Scott Ford - "Building a Bridge to a Legacy Application"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1561068276
description: "My team loves working on legacy code projects. It's all that we do. That's why a friend of mine reached out to us for some help.\n\nHis startup was building out a universal API across a very fragmented industry with little to no interoperability or standards. Up until now, integrating with the systems in that industry had been pretty easy, because the companies that built them were willing to help.\n\nBut now he'd found one that wasn't willing to help. There was no obvious API for getting data out of the legacy application so that it could be exposed via his company's API. A big client for his company was riding on his ability to be able to pull this off. He remembered how much I loved a challenge and how much my team loved legacy code, so he figured we were his best shot.\n\nThe goal was to be able to read from the application's database.\n\nIn this talk, I'll cover\nthe different approaches that we took\nthe one we really wanted to try because we thought it would be fun\nthe approaches that we needed to try before we could attempt the fun one\nthe excitement that we felt while working on it\nthe grind toward completion once the big technical hurdle was crossed\nthe sense of achievement when we got a read-only solution built\nthe hope that we'd get the green light to start working on a read-write solution\nthe disappointment when the plug got pulled and we weren't authorized to proceed any further\nIt was a fun journey, and I'd love to be able to share it."
