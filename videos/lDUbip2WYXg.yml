language: English
recordingDate: 1616503377
description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\n2,000 companies participated in the Global Crisis Survey 2019, 69% have experienced a crisis in the last 5 years and , just under 20% say they have been damaged by such an experience.\nMeanwhile, more than 40% say that they were “in a better place” post-crisis. Why wait for a crisis to be in a better place if we can learn to unleash that power in a controlled manner? Are you willing to risk being part of this 20% of companies that have been damaged or even destroyed after a crisis? Consider that only 5% say they do not expect to experience a crisis in the future, Is your company ready? What is this crisis going to bring to your business?\nCrisis simulations help organisations to unlock processes, informal structures, external connections and cultural values that allowed them to confront operational, technological, humanitarian, financial, legal, human capital, market and reputational crisis in a more structured, calm and successful way. Furthermore, crisis simulation can be the right spark to unlock your true innovation power.\nIn this workshop you will learn a simple and effective method to run crisis simulations in your organization. I'll be sharing experiences about how my customer benefit from this approach to build Resilience and innovation capabilities.\nTwenty years ago, new products appeared in the market every year and disruptive changes in the market happened every decade. Now new products appear in the market every month and disruptive changes in the market happen every year. What will happen in 10 years from now? In ten years from now Agile won’t be enough we'll need to build a new level of adaptability, organisational resilience. Understanding Resilience as the capability of an organization to recover quickly from unexpected difficulties.\nContingency plans are not enough. Crisis simulation help organisations not only to be ready to overcome extreme changes in the market and reshape for the new conditions faster, but to be the disruptive change in the market themselves.  \n \nWhy to wait for a crisis to be in a better place if we can learn to unleash that power in a controlled manner?
