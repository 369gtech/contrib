recordingDate: 1632935244
description: "Testing is an essential part of a quality API strategy. And API testing means taking an \"outside-in\" approach to writing and executing those tests. This talk shows you how to create simple request tests (SRTs) to probe your API endpoints as well as apply Dan Northâ€™s Behavior-Driven Approach (BDD) to writing powerful tests. Youâ€™ll also learn to apply a common model for writing API tests using the Protocol-Structure-Value pattern to create stable, reliable tests that continue to work as expected even as your API changes over time.\n\n\n***\n\n\nAn internationally known author and speaker, Mike Amundsen demonstrates how to improve your testing strategies and increase the success of your API program.\n\nTesting your APIs with Postman and Newman is a presentation by Mike Amundsen from live@Manning APIs conference, August 3, 2021.\n\nðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“š \nLearn with Manning | http://mng.bz/Q2j6\nTo save 40% use discount code: tcapis21 \nðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“š"
