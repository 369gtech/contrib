description: "Monday, June 8, was a great day in Milwaukee at Harley-Davidson Headquarters where we met with the local H.O.G, chapters for a motorcycle ride from the Headquarters to the Harley-Davidson Museum across town. We stopped in Milwaukee on our road trip with our Code the Road bus to celebrate the great work Harley-Davidson has done building the Harley-Davidson Ride Planner app using the Google Maps APIs.\n\nTo learn more visit http://g.co/codetheroad\n\nWatch all Code the Road episodes at: https://goo.gl/gw6uOP\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
