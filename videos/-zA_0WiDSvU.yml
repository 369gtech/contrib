description: "Performance Engineering and Testing of Apps and Services Deployed on Cloudfoundry - Siva Balan, GE\n\nPerformance engineering of apps and services deployed on Cloudfoundry is an art in itself. If there is any misconception that this is going to be very similar to performance engineering of on-premise apps, you are in for a rude awakening. This sessions explains the various nuances of doing non-functional testing and analysis of your services when deployed to cloudfoundry. The session will also cover some examples of how to effectively setup your environment for performance engineering and things to look for that may not be very obvious. We will also look at some performance engineering tools and frameworks that has been adopted successfully at GE Digital. The session will also showcase how this framework can be extended to include performance testing of your services as part of your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nAbout Siva Balan\nI currently wear a hat of a Performance Engineer for platform security services for GE Digital's Predix platform built on Cloudfoundry. I am actively involved in performance engineering of Predix services like UAA(User Account and Authentication), ACS(Access Control Service) and TMS(Tenant Management Service). I also wear a hat of Performance architect for the Predix platform and love to experiment with technologies to make performance engineering better. I am currently working on seamlessly integrating performance testing with the CI/CD pipeline and also making Predix Security Services auto-scale based on resource utilization."
