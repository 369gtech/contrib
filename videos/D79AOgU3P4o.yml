Java plays a key role in connecting all these devices and furnishing sensible information to farmers. This session provides insight into how Java (ranging from Java Embedded and Java EE to Swing and JavaFX) is used to evolve tech toys into precision agriculture instruments. Come see this multidevice, multiplatform architecture explained and demonstrated.\n\n\nAuthors:\nTimon Veenstra\nJava developer and architect for more then ten years.
