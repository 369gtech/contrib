Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nKubernetes VM Solutions for Multi-Tennant Applications - Guangxu Li & Yanqiang Miao, ZTE Corporation\n\nSometimes your app doesn't need a full-blown OpenStack implementation, but it's not quite ready for kubernetes to hold a full VM, either. Developers have launched several projects in the last year to meet these requirements. While there are many differences in technical details, at a high level these projects can be divided into two contrasting usage targets: Running traditional VM workloads alongside application container as part of a complex application and running application containers workloads with VM-level isolation for security. In this presentation, Guangxul Li and Yanqiang Miao will show how to run VM workloads on kubernetes with kubevirt,virtlet,rancherVM, and how to guarantee security containers with kata container, gvisor.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKo"
