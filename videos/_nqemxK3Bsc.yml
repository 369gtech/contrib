description: "London Erlang User Group\n\nSorry for the audio problems\nWe'll meet at 6 pm and start with some pizzas and beer, then move on to the TWO talks of the evening. The talks will be 30 minutes each, followed by 10-15 minutes for questions. \n\n1. Developing and Implementing the World’s First Post-Quantum Secure Messaging App - PQChat\n\nThe world’s internet infrastructure will be broken on the arrival of quantum computers as the majority of its public key security is dependent on RSA, elliptic curves and their variants.  PQ Solutions, www.post-quantum.com , is the world’s first company specialising in offering post-quantum solutions to customers in critical sectors including financial services, telecoms, healthcare, government and utilities.  Their first retail product is PQChat, www.pq-chat.com .  It is the world’s first post-quantum secure messaging app and is based on the NP-hard Robert McEliece cryptosystem which can withstand quantum computer attacks.  We have included in the app a number of patented and patent pending features which are unique to the IM environment.\n\nAndersen Cheng - Co-founder and CEO of SRD Wireless and CTO Cen Jung Tjhai will talk about the the journey of developing the PQChat app, key challenges and features - and why they chose XMPP \n\n2. Erlang-Lua: How to write an Erlang C Node\n\nIt is quite straightforward to integrate Erlang with other technologies, several mechanisms exist: NIF, linked-in drivers, port programs, C and Java Nodes.\nThis presentation will outline how you can combine the port program and C Node mechanisms to provide a coupling between Erlang and the Lua programming language. The following details will be covered (albeit briefly): starting and stopping the integration, message marshaling, error handling, communication difficulties.\n\nRobbie Rashke\n\nRobby is a polyglot programmer who has been building systems for almost 20 years. For the past 9 years, he's developed systems using mostly Erlang. He's always happy to talk about API design and concurrency. \n\nAfter working with a compiler company in the heart of Edinburgh, he's moved around the corner (literally) a couple of times, working on behavioural modelling (you know, the code that evaluates the data collected by your loyalty cards) and bringing diverse software systems to talk to each other (aka, more boringly, EAI). About a year and a half ago, he joined Erlang Solutions in London as a Senior Developer.\n\nTwitter: @rtraschke"
