description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nTextures and images are everywhere in today's world. Compressing those images well improves streaming performance, video, dramatically reduces the size and download times of apps. It can give you more realistic virtual reality experiences, more apps that can run on a small mobile device, a better digital map of our world, it can reduce our impact on climate change through storage savings, and so much more.\n\nIn the past few years, because of the rapid development in GPUs and innovations in algorithms, the way we approach texture compression has changed. Binomial is developing Basis, a supercompressed texture solution that will also provide an open file format standard in the graphics industry through The Khronos Group that's free for anyone to target.\n\nBasis is also written entirely in C++. Binomial co-founders Rich Geldreich and Stephanie Hurlburt will present their latest work in Basis and give insights into how texture compression will continue to evolve.\n— \nRich Geldreich: Graphics Engineer & Co-Founder, Binomial\n\nRich works at Binomial, were he's working on \"Basis\", a new transcoding-based texture compression system for GPU textures. He's also worked on several open source data lossless compression libraries, such as LZHAM and miniz.\n\n\nStephanie Hurlburt: Graphics Engineer & Co-Founder, Binomial\n\nStephanie is building Basis, a texture compressor, at Binomial. She loves all things VR/AR/MR, C++, optimization, graphics, and games. Previously, she worked with C++ and graphics programming at Oculus and Unity.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
