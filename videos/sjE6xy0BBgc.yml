description: "Reverse Geocoding is not easy How doing another mundane geocoding service can provide exciting geospatial challenges\nby Ilya Zverev\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.126/reverse_geocoding_is_not_easy.webm\n\nHaving seen a dozen of different OpenStreetMap-based geocoders, I did not expect to find myself writing another one. But here I am, tasked with making a reverse geocoder better than the industry-standard Nominatim. Turns out it is a fun and not so straightforward task. Let’s see what can go wrong.\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 11:30:00"
