description: "As screens and input types evolve, we’re managing more complexity in our designs than ever before: our layouts are becoming more flexible and responsive; our interfaces, more immersive. Maybe we can look for simpler approaches? In this session, Ethan—a singularly lazy person—will walk through some responsive designs, and show how we might use simple effects and selectors to do a bit more with less.\n\nAbout Ethan: http://ethanmarcotte.com\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or http://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
