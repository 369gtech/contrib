description: "Two Pythonistas, one city break, one challenge: re-create a train announcement board on a RaspberryPi-powered LCD\n\nHenry Morris, Dale Potter\n\nSaturday 15th, 14:30 (Room D)\nA talk (25 minutes)\n\nThis talk will tell our story â€“ two friends who were curious what trains were going past one of their houses every five minutes.\n\nRather than buy an over-priced Windows-powered monstrosity(!), we'll explain how we built an open-source train announcement board using an LCD display, powered by a RaspberryPi. We'll run through how we started with way too grand a plan, how we de-scoped the project and how we built it over the course of a weekend city break. Naturally, the talk will end with a demo!\n\nAttendees should come to learn what it takes to scrape train data and present it on a RaspberryPi LCD but stay to hear about coding city breaks!\n\n    The speaker suggested this session is suitable for new programmers."
