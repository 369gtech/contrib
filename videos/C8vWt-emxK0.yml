description: "In todayâ€™s heterogeneous system/application environments, enterprise developers and architects are often faced with complex integration challenges that frequently result in Moloch-like code. This session introduces common patterns for enterprise application integration (EAI) that can easily be used to integrate Java EE applications into heterogeneous system environments. Learn how to face the challenges of small and medium businesses by leveraging the benefits of Java EE APIs, and see different implementations with Apache Camel and Spring integration. An order management application of a logistics service provider that implements multiple interfaces of heterogeneous business partner systems serves as an example.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAlexander Heusingfeld\nAlexander Heusingfeld is a senior consultant for architecture and software engineering at innoQ Deutschland GmbH.
