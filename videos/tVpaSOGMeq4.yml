description: "Although parsers are generally considered to be tools for computer scientists to build languages, the reality is that a parser can be used in many real-life applications, and knowing how to build one can come in handy.\n\n\nIn this tutorial session, Sugu will lead everyone through the process of building a parser from the ground up using goyacc. Along the way, you'll see how to leverage some of Go's best features to craft some elegant constructs and use them in a toy application.\n\n\nAt the end, we'll review some of the patterns used in the sqlparser module of Vitess."
