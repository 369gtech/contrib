description: "@dominickendrick\n\nThe talk will showcase the improvements and benefits that come from putting data analysis and measurement at the heart of your agile processes.\n\nI will talk about the techniques we have used on various projects across The Guardian to help us save money and improve the impact of the work we deliver, and explain how you can use these to get all aspects of your business thinking hard about what features and projects they want to deliver.\n\nI will discuss how we use analytics throughout the agile development processes and how we approach feature development on ongoing projects like theguardian.com.\n\nI will also cover the different collection and dashboarding systems we use for analytics, and how you can even write your own!\n\nThis is aimed at developers, product managers and scrum masters.\n\n \n\nAbout Dominic\n\nDominic has been a software developer for 10 years. He has worked in small agencies and larger companies such as Amnesty International and The Guardian. He currently works at The Guardian as a team leader and senior full stack developer.
