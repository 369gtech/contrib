title: 'React Native Better Than Native - Mitchell Tilbrook'

description: "React Native allows developers to create native cross-platform using JavaScript, or really anything that will compile to JS C#, TypeScript, or even F#. But why would you use React Native? How run-time typed language like JavaScript be a better choice for developing apps than say, Swift, Java, Kotlin, C# ( Xamarin ) or C++ all compile time static type checked languages. Firstly is just that, there is no need for a compile step, React Native can update the JS without having to reload compile and replace the previous application. Compiling an app everytime can take a long time for a small project this might be 1-5min, but larger apps can easily take as long as 45 minutes or more to build a single app.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore how features like hot code reloading allow for much faster edit and run cycles, how you can use tools like Flow or TypeScript to add type safety without incurring the long compile times found in more native methods. To Prove the how simple and fast React Native is to builds apps we will create a simple app live on stage. To top it all off, you can even embed React into existing Native Apps, avoiding the need for a total rewrite."
