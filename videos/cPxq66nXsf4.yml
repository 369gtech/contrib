description: "Speaker: Sebastian Deleuze\nWeb / JavaScript Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/isomorphic-templating-with-spring-boot-nashorn-and-react\nThe first part of this talk introduces the upcoming Spring Framework 4.2 Script Templating support,\nshowing how you can use Nashorn, Jython or JRuby to render templates with Javascript, Python or Ruyby based template engines. We will see how easy you can extend out of the box capabilities on the scripting side.\nBased on benchmarks, features available and code samples, we will see if this can be a production ready alternative to templating technologies usually used with Spring MVC like JSP, Velocity, FreeMarker or Thymeleaf.\nThe second part of the talk will explain how to build an isomorphic application that performs the same templates rendering on client AND server based on Spring Boot, Nashorn and React, the the latest game changer Javascript library released by Facebook. The rendering of Javascript templates is performed initially on server-side thanks to a Spring MVC + Nashorn integration, then enriched on client side with a Server-Sent Events push mechanism.\nThis kind of isomorphic templating + the disruptive innovation brought by React with his virtual DOM mechanism make it possible to build a new kind of applications : responsive, with a great UX while being accessible."
