description: "Have you always wanted to add predictive capabilities or voice recognition to your application, but haven’t been able to find the time or the right technology to get started? Everybody wants to build smart apps, but only a few are Data Scientists. We had the same issue inside Amazon, so we created a Machine Learning engine that Developers can easily use. The same approach is now available in the AWS cloud. And we introduced Amazon Alexa to build engaging voice experiences for your services and devices: if you are a device maker, and your connected product has a microphone and a speaker, the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) enables you to add voice-powered experiences to your connected devices. And you can also use the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) to teach new skills to Alexa!\n\n[YQN-7342]"
