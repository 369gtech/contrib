description: "Rapid prototyping in data science often hits a wall when data is too large to fit into memory.

In this talk, I'll demonstrate how to leverage Dask and Scikit-learn to solve this problem.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyOhio 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDavid Ziganto\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFGUOfPEtJM&t=33s"
