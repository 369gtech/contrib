description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeaker: Rossen Stoyanchev\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/imperative-to-reactive-web-applications\n\nThe reactive programming model involves a fundamental shift from imperative to non-blocking logic and understanding what that means on the most basic level is an essential and required first step. In this talk we'll start by introducing reactive programming and discuss how it impacts application design. Then we'll take a look at the building blocks from a Java developer's perspective. Finally we'll complete the picture by checking out the upcoming Spring 5 support for reactive web applications."
