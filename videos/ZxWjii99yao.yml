description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nThere are many ways to initialize an object in C++, and much time spent analyzing the efficiency of the many options. We then think and rethink and overthink how to avoid copies and if a `std::move` would be more efficient in a certain case.\n\nBut if we understand what it means for a type to be trivial most of these questions now become meaningless. We can get all of the efficiency we could hope for, and probably more.\n\nWe will look at the trivial type traits, what they mean, and how they affect our code. Will will then examine the benefits of using trivial types and the impact on performance.\n— \nJason Turner\nDeveloper, Trainer, Speaker\nGreater Denver Area\n\nHost of C++Weekly https://www.youtube.com/c/JasonTurner-lefticus, Co-host of CppCast http://cppcast.com, Co-creator and maintainer of the embedded scripting language for C++, ChaiScript http://chaiscript.com, and author and curator of the forkable coding standards document http://cppbestpractices.com.\n\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
