title: 'Elasticsearch Data Exploration in Your Terminal - Brad Lhotsky'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623254341
description: "You've seen the pretty graphs. Visuals are great for signaling there is a problem somewhere. How do you go from pretty graphs to root cause analysis? Let's talk more about integrating Elasticsearch-based dashboards back to the command line workflows I love.\n\nThis talk is an overview of a tool I developed while working at Booking.com to drastically reduce the time and complexity of performing incident response against rich, structured data in Elasticsearch. It was developed with the help of the security and fraud teams to perform ad-hoc queries critical for incident response. The tool served the team well and it's been under active development ever since. It continues to grow in capabilities aimed to make ad-hoc analysis simple, easy, and accessible to hardened command line jockeys and command line newbies.\n\nJoin me to learn how to bring the logging data you love back to your terminal!"
