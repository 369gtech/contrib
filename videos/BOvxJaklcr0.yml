Everyone seems to be either going into that direction or is talking about doing so. But are they really the best choice for you?\n\nDevelopers! Architects! Buckle up as we're going to cut through the hype. Instead of going all-in on microservices or all-in on big ball of mud, we'll introduce a third choice: the Majestic Modular Monolith! We'll look at what it brings to the table, when it may be a good fit and how it compares to the other two approaches in terms of code organization, productivity, scalability and much more. We'll look at how this can be designed and implemented in practice. Get ready. We won't shy away from the hard questions.\n\nAxel Fontaine \nFrom Boxfuse GmbH\nAxel Fontaine is the founder and CEO of Boxfuse (boxfuse.com), the easiest way to deploy JVM, Node.js and Go applications to AWS, and the creator of Flyway (flywaydb.org), the open-source tool that makes database migrations easy.\n\nAxel is an entrepreneur, a Continuous Delivery expert, an Immutable Infrastructure expert, a Java Champion, a JavaOne Rockstar, a regular speaker at many large international conferences, a trainer and an author."
