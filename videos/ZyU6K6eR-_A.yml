description: "RubyConf 2019 - Escaping The Tar Pit by Ernesto Tagwerker\n\nNobody wants to inherit a project that reeks but here we are: Stuck in the tar pit. How can we get out? Could we have avoided it in the first place?\n\r\n\nIn this talk you will learn how to use a few, great Ruby gems that will guide you out of that sticky tar you are in. On top of that, you will learn a repeatable way to gradually pay off technical debt.\n\n#rubyconf2019 #confreaks"
