language: English
recordingDate: 1601026582
description: "When you’re faced with having to build a critical loan application for a number of financial institutions within a number of days during a pandemic, you need capabilities that enable your developers. As part of the Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program’s first round, close to $342.3 billion was approved, and $310 billion was added. So what does it take to deliver a solution in such a short period of time?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll provide you an overview of what we did to overcome this challenge to deliver a solution that processes those loans. We’ll focus on which technologies and platforms helped drive developer efficiencies and allowed us to scale to meet the large influx of applications.\n\nItems we’ll cover\n- Spring development and lessons learned\n- VMware Tanzu Application Service (TAS) developer efficiencies and scaling\n- CI/CD pipelines\n\nSrinivas Machani, Chief Architect at Fiserv; \nClint Myers, Vice President, Architecture / CTO - AP at Fiserv\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/what-does-it-take-to-deliver-a-solution-to-process-over-2b-in-loans-from-inception-to-production"
