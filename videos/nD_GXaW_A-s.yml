Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nBuilding a Medical AI with Kubernetes and Kubeflow - Jeremie Vallee, Babylon Health  \n\nEngineering AI systems at scale can be difficult, especially in highly regulated environments like healthcare. Many challenges arise, such as ensuring reproducibility, controlling data access policies, and running highly secure infrastructure. But with some planning and meticulous engineering, this can be achieved.  At Babylon Health, we've leveraged Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Argo, Istio, OPA, and many other Cloud Native technologies to provide a secure research platform for building and scaling medical AI models across the world.  In this talk, we will share our experience so far, give an overview of how these components fit together, and explain our vision for the future of our platform. We will demonstrate how using open-source CNCF technologies can help you achieve your goal of experimenting, training and serving your AI models at scale, while operating in a regulated environment. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaWf"
