description: "This talk is about a charity project to deliver free-wifi to Africa and how we built a mobile app and backend to connect the township residents with their local government.\n\nDiscover how we built the messaging backend, a lovely user-interface and used Javascript to tie it all together and make it work on low-end mobile browsers for 500k users. In only 10 days. This is the tale of how we designed a node.js-based microservice architecture, to build an open-source mobile app and worked around problems including frequent power outages, lack of sleep from lions roaring at night, and websocket reconnect issues, to build a valuable app for South Africa's township residents."
