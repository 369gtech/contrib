description: 'New version of the JUnit library changes a lot - starting from the modules structure and ending on the way how you write your tests. JUnit 5 adds powerful and useful features and many improvements over the previous version. And on top of that we finally get the Java 8 syntax. During the presentation we will explore new features of JUnit. We will find out what is new and what was changed in current library version. We will compare the way how we wrote tests with JUnit 4 and how we can do it with JUnit 5.'
