description: "Queues Don’t Matter When You Can JUMP Them!\n\nMatthew P. Grosvenor, Malte Schwarzkopf, Ionel Gog, Robert N. M. Watson, Andrew W. Moore, Steven Hand, and Jon Crowcroft, University of Cambridge\nAwarded Best Paper!\n\nQJUMP is a simple and immediately deployable approach to controlling network interference in datacenter networks. Network interference occurs when congestion from throughput-intensive applications causes queueing that delays traffic from latency-sensitive applications. To mitigate network interference, QJUMP applies Internet QoS-inspired techniques to datacenter applications. Each application is assigned to a latency sensitivity level (or class). Packets from higher levels are rate-limited in the end host, but once allowed into the network can “jump-the-queue” over packets from lower levels. In settings with known node counts and link speeds, QJUMP can support service levels ranging from strictly bounded latency (but with low rate) through to line-rate throughput (but with high latency variance).\n\nWe have implemented QJUMP as a Linux Traffic Control module. We show that QJUMP achieves bounded latency and reduces in-network interference by up to 300, outperforming Ethernet Flow Control (802.3x), ECN (WRED) and DCTCP. We also show that QJUMP improves average flow completion times, performing close to or better than DCTCP and pFabric.\n\nView the full NSDI '15 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi15/technical-sessions"
