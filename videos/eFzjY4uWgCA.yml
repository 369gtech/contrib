description: "How to leverage Angular Schematics to empower Developers of Enterprise Frontend Apps & Libraries [live coding]\n\nIn development, we often want to extract reusable parts of logic into self contained libraries. Modern tooling provided by Angular CLI enables us to provide amazing developer experience for the users of our libraries.\n\nLibraries can be added seamlessly, while automating all the necessary setup work. Providing built-in library specific schematics to generate desired code enables us to cut on the learning curve that is needed to get developers productive with our new shiny lib!\n\nThis presentation will be in form of live coding in which we explore how we can use Angular Schematics provided out of the box, how to create our own custom schematics and how to integrate them into Angular CLI workspaces."
