language: English
recordingDate: 1474223143
description: "Kittens is a proof of concept library built on top of shapeless[1] and cats[2] as an experiment of combining generic and functional programming. It can help Scala programs achieve higher flexibility with datatypes without compromising safety. Through several example projects using kittens, this talk will provide a peek at the power of datatype generic functional programming.\n\n[1] shapeless github.com/milessabin/shapeless \n[2] cats github.com/typelevel/cats"
