description: "Timely information about an applications health and performance is critical. In a clustered environment, knowledge about the overall health and performance of the cluster is more complicated to obtain. Add cloud and this task may become close to impossible to gain insight into the health of the system. Using Apache Geode and Micrometer it will be demonstrated how this can be achieved in a simple manner that can be applied to all types of applications.\n\nSpeakers:\nUdo Kohlmeyer\nSenior Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
