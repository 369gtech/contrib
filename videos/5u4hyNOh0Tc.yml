description: "Graphs are everywhere: When it comes to representing relationships between entities, there is no better mathematical model so far. Classical “SQL” databases perform very poorly in modelizing complex relationships, both in terms of response time and in writing (queries) time. Graph database have been designed to tackle those limitations and excel in many domains, such as fraud detection, recommendation systems, social networks, MDM… After having introduced the basic concepts of graph databases, this presentation shares our experience in fraud detection in the Belgian social security sector, using graph databases.\n\n# Vandy Berten\nVandy is ICT Research Consultant at Smals since 2013. He was previously Assistant Professor at ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles), teaching programming languages. He obtained his PhD at the same institution in 2007. Today, he mainly works on data analytics to fight fraud in the social security sector with various techniques, including graph databases, network analytics and data quality. He also teaches “Data Visualisation” at ULB."
