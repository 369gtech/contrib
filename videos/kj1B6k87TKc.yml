description: 'In the past few years I have helped a lot of customers optimising their elastic cluster. With each version elasticsearch has more options to track performance of your nodes and recently profiling your queries was added. In this talk I am going to discuss the steps you have to take when starting with elasticsearch. The choices you have to make for the size of your cluster, the amount of indexes, amount of shards, choosing the right mappings, and creating better queries. After the setup I''ll continue showing how to monitor your cluster and profile your queries.'
