language: English
recordingDate: 1607627812
description: "This video demonstrates how you can use Scribbletune and a little bit of JavaScript to create the common \"riffs\" we hear in electronic music. The riff is imported in Ableton Live in this video, but it can be used in any DAW.\n\nYou can do this without writing JavaScript via a Max for Live plugin I created for this same purpose: https://maxforlive.com/library/device/6146/scribble4max-riff\n\nYou need Node.js installed on your computer for this,\nMac: https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html\nWindows: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows\nLinux: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-linux/\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nScribbletune YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0OiF7m8xqtgzF02DZDoEcQ) provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
