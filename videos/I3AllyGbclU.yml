description: "PyCon Belarus 2019, Minsk\nPython Track \n\nMQTT with Python – Elena Nikolaichik\nMQTT is a publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol. It is open, light-weight and simple. These characteristics make it ideal for use for communication in Machine to Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) contexts. Python is also extremely popular in IoT world. So we have a great Python + MQTT combo. \n\nIn this talk Elena will introduce MQTT protocol and its main features. We'll discuss what's new in latest MQTT 5.0 version and why is it cool. Elena will also show some interesting usage examples, their experience and compare main brokers and clients implementations available right now (mainly concentrating on those implemented in Python of course).\n\nPresentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jR5L9ssIUSs9SARu5zHniCik6dlr5go2Nqbun213NjU/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nVideo Partner – Wargaming (https://wargaming.com/ru/)"
