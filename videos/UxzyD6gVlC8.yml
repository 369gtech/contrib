title: 'Custom Named Entity Recognition with Spacy in Python'
recordingDate: 1527122658
description: "Spacy is a Python library designed to help you build tools for processing and \"understanding\" text. It can be used to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems, or to pre-process text for deep learning. This talk will discuss how to use Spacy for Named Entity Recognition, which is a method that allows a program to determine that the Apple in the phrase \"Apple stock had a big bump today\" is a company and not a pie filling. We'll also cover how to add your own entities, train a custom recognizer, and deploying your model as a REST microservice. Expertise with Spacy (https://spacy.io/) is not required.\n\nPresented by Josh Smith at Code & Supply"
