description: 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away... well, not so far away, but in Redmond (WA) it seemed impossible to release big OSS projects on github, working with OSS communities, loving Linux, releasing Cortana for iOS & Android, etc... This is how Microsoft is working today, Visual Studio Code is one of the latest examples of products released under an OSS license and developed in the open. Microsoft partnering with Red Hat, acquiring Xamarin, integrating Chrome-debugging in his mac/linux tools, Windows 10 on the Raspberry, a partnership with Arduino, etc... Time flies when you''re having fun!'
