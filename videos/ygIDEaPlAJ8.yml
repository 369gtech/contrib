description: "PyData LA 2018 \n\nThis talk discusses using transfer learning and novel forms of feature engineering to detect and localize the absence of signatures in legal documents. This talk is targeted towards attendees with some familiarity with computer vision who are interested in an applied case study, learning how to leverage deep learning with small amounts of data, or applying computer vision to text documents.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
