title: 'GopherCon UK 2021: Sina Siadat - Building a small Language with Go for fun'
recordingDate: 1637596162
description: 'This talk is about language design decisions, parsing, static analysis, and code generation. I will go through my initial motivation (sum types in Go), demonstrate my journey of learning about parsing algorithms, writing a top-down parser using EBNF grammar (and eventually throwing it all away!), writing a static checker, and generating Go code.'
