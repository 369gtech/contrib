description: "Why we Worry About all the Wrong Things by Hilary Stohs-Krause\n\n\"Modern humans arenâ€™t great at risk assessment.\n\nWe often blithely ignore that which could harm us, and are conversely intimidated by things that are quite safe. This inability to recognize threat has vast implications for many aspects of our lives, including our careers.\n\nDo you want to be less stressed? Make better decisions? Learn strategies for identifying (and dealing with!) unnecessary worry? Let's explore the root causes of fear and anxiety together, and discover how we can start to deliberately rewrite our instincts.\"\n\n__________\n\n\"Hilary Stohs-Krause is currently based in Madison, WI, where she's co-owner and software developer at Ten Forward Consulting. She came to tech by way of childhood website-building (a \"\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"\" fansite, to be exact).\n\nShe volunteers regularly with several tech and community organizations, and co-runs Madison Women in Tech, a local group with more than 2,000 members. She loves sci-fi/fantasy, board games and bourbon barrel-aged stouts. She tweets at @hilarysk.\""
