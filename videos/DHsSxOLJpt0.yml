description: "Let’s come together and discuss how we can attract more people to programming in general and Clojure specifically. Learn strategies that you can use to build the Clojure in your backyard and beyond.\n\n\nKim Crayton (Moderator)\nKim Crayton, LLC\nKim has years of experience working with learners of all ages, skill level, and abilities and she would like to offer what she knows about student support and successful mentorship to her new community. She is the past co-organizer of CodeNewbie-Atlanta, founder of JrDevMentoring and the author of the “Tech Talk For Non-Techies” blog. Kim is currently pursuing a Doctors of Business Administration – Technology Entrepreneurship. Her doctoral study topic is: “Strategies some software development managers use to effectively mentor junior software developers.” She is also working on her passion projects #MentoringMinute, JrDevMentoring.com, and @100000Intros\n\n\nAmie Kuttruff\nJama\nAmie currently writes functional JavaScript at Jama. Amie previously worked at Little Bird, where she started as an intern and eventually helped rewrite their social network graph analysis application in Clojure and ClojureScript. By offering mentorships and mock interview opportunities, Amie helps code school graduates and interns transition into the industry with the goal of supporting a more diverse tech community. She lives with her partner in Portland, OR.\n\n\nByron Woodfork\n8th Light\nByron Woodfork is a software developer for the consultancy 8th Light. Upon developing software in Clojure for a client, he developed a love for both the Clojure language and the community itself. He enjoys exploring new technologies, mentoring fellow software developers and helping inspire others to become mentors for underrepresented groups in the software community.\n\n\nKatherine Fellows\nSimple\nkf is a coder based in Portland, OR, currently working as a data engineer in Scala and Clojure at Simple. In her spare time, kf has been an organizer for Philly ETE, Open Source Bridge, PLIBMTTBHGATY, Papers We Love, and ScalaBridge, as well as served on the boards of ClojureBridge and Bridge Foundry. Aside from tech, she enjoys weekend brunches, learning about modular synths, and taking selfies with her cat.\n\n\nMark Engelberg\nMark Engelberg has been an active member of the Clojure community ever since Clojure turned 1.0, and is the primary developer of math.combinatorics, math.numeric-tower, data.priority-map, ubergraph, and a co-developer of instaparse. He creates logic puzzles and games, using Clojure as a “secret weapon” to build his own puzzle development tools. His latest work is a line of programming-themed puzzle games for kids, produced by Thinkfun and slated to arrive in toy stores later this year. For 18 years, Mark has taught computer science and functional programming to a mix of new and experienced programmers — young kids, teens, and adults. He helped organize the 2016 Seattle ClojureBridge."
