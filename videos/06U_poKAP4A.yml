description: "https://ng-poland.pl\nKeynote Session: Magical TypeScript features and how they help projects like NgRx\nTypeScript is a powerful language for web apps and with 5 to 6 minor releases per year, it’s getting more sophisticated and enables its users to better describe their intentions and more code even more type safe. This is particularly exciting for library authors as it allows to enforce expected usages.\nIn this talk I’ll start from the basics of generics, type union and intersection, then cover new unknown type, build up to conditional types and how type inference can be used in them. We will also learn about callable objects and how to restrict specific property names in objects. All of the examples have real use case and are used in new NgRx v8, that allowed significant “boilerplate” reduction.\n\nAlex Okrushko - NgRx team, Google | Canada\nAlex is a software engineer at Google working on Firebase Console. He is also a core member of NgRx team and a passionate maintainer of this library at Google. At his free time, he writes and reviews articles at blog.angularindepth.com and provides NgRx workshops.\n\nNG POLAND 2019\nKeynote Session : The post-ivy world | Minko Gechev 🚀 https://youtu.be/GbR_Urdl8WU\nKeynote Session: Go Faster for Less Effort | Todd Motto 🚀 https://youtu.be/dEm_Efc4_UQ\nKeynote Session: Rethinking Angular Architecture & Performance | Mark Pieszak 🚀 https://youtu.be/C6sKq8eEbtY\nKeynote Session: Magical TypeScript features and how they help projects like NgRx | Alex Okrushko 🚀 https://youtu.be/06U_poKAP4A\nSustainable Angular Architectures with Monorepos and Strategic Domain Driven Design | Manfred Steyer 🚀 https://youtu.be/q75RUZreh2E\nYou can find it in the docs - Kamil Gałek 🚀 https://youtu.be/xzmEWvcu4JM\nUsing Elm's Json Decoders in Angular - Raul Jimenez 🚀 https://youtu.be/O87etoNFI7U\nPractice makes perfect - when it comes to RxJS | Jan-Niklas Wortmann 🚀 https://youtu.be/OmiztChGtdQ\nUnleash the power of Angular CLI Builders - Nir Kaufman 🚀 https://youtu.be/hX0KLxMJVyU\nMagic Dust in your apps?
