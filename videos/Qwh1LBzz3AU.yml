description: "Speaker(s):\nAlex Faaborg; Erica Morse; Jon Wiley; Manuel Clement\n\nDescription:\nDesigning great user experiences in virtual reality is considerably different than designing for the more traditional 2D form factors that you may be familiar with. Virtual reality introduces a new set of physiological and ergonomic considerations to your design work. Additionally, as a new medium users may not have established a familiarity with interacting with virtual reality applications yet. And with an infinite canvas inside of your application, there are some very real challenges with guiding the userÍs focus and attention. WeÍll review common interactive patterns for virtual reality applications that work well. We'll also discuss best practices for rapid prototyping in virtual reality, and what the Google VR design team has learned from crafting virtual reality applications.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
