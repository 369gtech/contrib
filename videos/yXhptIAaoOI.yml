title: 'Making Azure the Best Destination to Run Postgres | Microsoft European Virtual Open Source Summit'

description: "See why Umur Cubukcuâ€™s team is on a mission to make Azure the best destination to run Postgres. From acquiring the Postgres company Citus Data, to enabling applications that need to scale out Postgres horizontally, to hiring and investing in Postgres open source committers, to funding integrations between Postgres and the Azure ecosystem (with VS Code, Azure Data Studio, AAD, Azure Data Factory), and of course by launching the Azure Database for PostgreSQL managed service back in 2018â€”the Microsoft Azure team has been investing more and more in the Postgres database. \n\nSee how Hyperscale (Citus)â€”now available as a built-in deployment option on Azure Database for PostgreSQLâ€”is changing what is possible with Postgres. Based on the Citus open source extension to Postgres, Hyperscale (Citus) transforms PostgreSQL into a distributed database on Azure, empowering developers and applications to do things that were simply not possible before. \n\nVideo bookmarks:\nâ–º 1:03 Scaling out Postgres with Citus \nâ–º 3:35 Microsoft welcomes PostgreSQL committers \nâ–º 5:17 Growing popularity of Postgres open source database\nâ–º 13:31 What makes Azure really unique for Postgres\nâ–º 17:15 Use cases for Single Server Postgres on Azure\nâ–º 18:10 Oracle to Postgres use case\nâ–º 19:31 Hyperscale (Citus) use cases on Azure\n\nUmur covers real-world Azure scenarios that run on Postgres for both single server PostgreSQL deployments and Hyperscale (Citus) database clusters on Azureâ€”including Oracle to Postgres migrations, multi-tenant SaaS apps, operational real-time analytics, HTAP workloads that serve both transactional and analytical queries, and high-throughput transactional workloads. One great customer story Umur covers is how the Windows telemetry team uses Postgres and Citus on Azure to field over 6 million queries a day. \n\nDevelopers love Postgres, and in this video from the head of the Azure Postgres product team (who is also a co-founder of Citus Data), youâ€™ll see why the open source database team at Microsoft loves PostgreSQL, too. \n\nðŸ“Œ Letâ€™s connect:\nTwitter â€“ Umur Cubukcu, https://twitter.com/umurc \nTwitter â€“ AzureDBPostgres, https://twitter.com/AzureDBPostgres \nTwitter â€“ Citus Data, https://twitter.com/citusdata \n\nðŸ””  Subscribe to the Citus monthly technical newsletter:\nhttps://aka.ms/citus-newsletter \n\n\nâœ…  Learn more:\nAzure Postgres Blog: https://aka.ms/azure-postgres-blog \nAzure Database for PostgreSQL managed service: https://aka.ms/azure-postgres\nCitus open source GitHub repo: https://github.com/citusdata/citus \n\n#PostgreSQL #Azure #AzureDBPostgres"
