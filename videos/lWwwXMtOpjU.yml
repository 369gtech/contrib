title: '[Online Meetup] Wix Components Studio (Ukrainian)'
recordingDate: 1621411989
description: 'During this brief talk, you will get acquainted with the Wix Innovations team and what we do. In particular, you would get a glimpse of a new product inside the Wix ecosystem - Wix Components Studio. It is an IDE for React Components that enables team members from all disciplines to easily access, validate and discuss their components on the same platform. We will stretch a surface of a few technical challenges we are dealing with - pluggable architecture (and what that means), code analysis, and generation.'
