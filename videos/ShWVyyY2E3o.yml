description: "In this video Tiffany Jernigan (twitter.com/tiffanyfayj) talks about the Carvel toolset tool, kapp. This talk walks through the following guide: https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/kubernetes/kapp-gs/\n\nkapp (part of the open source Carvel suite) is a lightweight application-centric tool for deploying resources on Kubernetes. Being both explicit and application-centric it provides an easier way to deploy and view all resources created together regardless of what namespace theyâ€™re in. Being dependency-aware, it is able to wait for resources to be created, updated, or deleted, and provides a live status on the progress of the actions. Continue on to see how to get started with kapp."
