description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Jag Saund, Instagram.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=VQS-5461\n\nWriting multi-threaded software is hard. Debugging and chasing down problems like deadlocks, race conditions, and memory leaks is even harder.\nKotlin takes a different approach. It doesn't have to be so hard. Learn how you can write concurrent and asynchronous software using coroutines. And stop sharing memory to communicate mutable data. Leverage channels to safely communicate across coroutines.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
