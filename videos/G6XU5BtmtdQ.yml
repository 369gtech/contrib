recordingDate: 1314042643
description: "Once you have connected an Access accdb or mdb application to SQL Server, just how should you tackle the question of developing or adapting your application to be efficient and flexible? This session is sprinkled with VBA, TSQL, Access and the SQL Server Management Studio.\n\nThe best way to get an overview of how to develop with an Access application linked to SQL Server and use the associated tools is to watch someone building solutions. In this session we will be demonstrating the construction of DSN's, linking tables, views, and using stored procedures and views in pass-through queries. This will include a discussion of the benefits in using SQL Server Schemas and Synonyms. Following this we will look at techniques for using local temporary tables, SQL Server temporary tables and resolving performance issues.\n\nThe session provides an introduction to these topics which are further explained in my book Microsoft Access 2010 VBA Programming Inside Out."
