description: "During the Cold War, the CIA knew how to expose Russian spies disguised as American citizens with a 100% certainty. They used only a piece of paper and a few questions. How did they do that? Hacking your mind is easier than you think.\n\nLet’s explore how these mental hacks affects the code we all read and write. Moran & Jonathan take you on a stroll through the world of cognitive and social psychology, and shed some light on some of our industries’ best and worst practices.\n\nThey present a few interactive samples of our mind’s limitations, examine how these limitations manifest themselves in real code examples and engineering conventions, and hopefully, you'll take away a few techniques on how to write better code."
