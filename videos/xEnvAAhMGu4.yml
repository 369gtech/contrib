description: "What architectural patterns does Spring Security follow? This talk starts with an insecure application and secures it from the ground up. It’ll examine patterns that are repeated throughout Spring Security and explain why they are there. Among others, you’ll learn about Spring Security’s filter chain, its authentication manager, and its preference for final classes and private methods.\n\nJosh Cummings, Software Engineer at VMware; Eleftheria Stein, Software Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/spring-security-patterns"
