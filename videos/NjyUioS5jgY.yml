language: English
recordingDate: 1416461646
description: "While software development tools, processes and techniques evolve, experience and best practices are documented and the power of the tips of an average developer's fingers multiplies by the minute, the art of choosing the right abstractions in code, design and architecture remains a mysterious key to success in software development. Abstractions used wisely let you turn what you don't know into what you know well, keep cross-functional teams feel safe and happy and promote software development from a job to a craft.\n\nTarget group: This talk will be useful to software developers who care about the quality, elegance and maintainability of their code and want to be proud of what they deliver. It may also be useful to project managers.\n\nTakeway: A valuable experience of how to make most of whatever knowledge and skill set you have and make extremely diverse teams perform at their collective best.\n\nTags: architecture, design, clean code, collaboration"
