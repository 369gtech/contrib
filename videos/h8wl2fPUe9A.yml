description: "Eugene Fedorenko, Senior Architect, Flexagon LLC\n\nThis session focuses on a modern DevOps approach based on the concept of containerization. Learn how to decompose a complex multilayered microservice into Docker containers. Get familiar with building a CI/CD pipeline by means of containers, repositories, and container clusters. See how to configure development, test, and production environments as Kubernetes clusters in multiple clouds such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud Platform. Hear about best practices for orchestrating containers in the cluster, and understand the meaning of Kubernetes resources. The session explains how to go serverless and how to build, deploy, and test a microservice with Fn functions."
