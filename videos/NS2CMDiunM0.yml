language: English
recordingDate: 1595574194
description: "by Olivier Aubert\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.126/open_research_advene.webm\n\nAdvene is a video annotation platform (free software) that aims at accompanying scholars in their audiovisual analyses workflow. It promotes flexible and evolving annotation structures and interfaces in order to deal with the inherent dynamic nature of analysis. In this presentation, I will present the platform itself, and illustrate its usage through existing Digital Humanities projects that use it, from structuring videos for interview analyses to implementing a workflow for semantic annotation of movies.\nThe Advene project (Annotate Digital Video, Exchange on the NEt) aims\nat providing a model and a format to share annotations about digital\nvideo documents (movies, courses, conferences...), as well as tools to\nedit and visualize the hypervideos generated from both the annotations\nand the audiovisual documents.\n\n\nWith the Advene software, teachers, moviegoers, etc. can exchange\nmultimedia comments and analyses about video documents. The project\nalso aims at studying the way that communities of users (teachers,\nmoviegoers, students...) will use these self-publishing tools to share\ntheir audiovisual \"readings\", and to envision new editing and viewing\ninterfaces for interactive comment and analysis of audiovisual\ncontent.\n\n\nAdvene is a GPL desktop application, based on Python3/Gtk/Gstreamer.\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 13:00:00"
