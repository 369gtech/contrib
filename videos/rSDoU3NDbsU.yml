description: "Do More With Your Apps: Unleashing the Power of the V3 Cloud Controller API - Utako Ueda and Dan Wendorf, Pivotal\n\nSome of the biggest problems developers have had with the Cloud Controller API have traditionally revolved around lifecycle management of their apps. The lack of features like version rollbacks, zero downtime deployment, running one-off tasks, simplified database migration, and running multiple processes per application have frustrated many developers.\n\nThe CAPI team is working on making all this and more possible with V3 of the cloud controller API. The new application modeling provides much more flexibility and control over the workflows available to you for application deployment, while maintaining backwards compatibility with the Cloud Foundry interface you use today.\n\nUtako and Dan will explain how to take advantage of the V3 API, and get into the details of the strategies involved in ensuring both dependable backwards compatibility and exciting new resource modularity.\n\nAbout Utako Ueda\nUtako is a core contributor to the Cloud Controller API on the CF CAPI Team. She is a Pivotal CF software engineer with a background in physics. She is very excited about her escape from basement laboratories into the world of agile development and offices with windows.\n\nAbout Dan Wendorf\nDan is a consultant at Pivotal Labs who has been working with and on Cloud Foundry in multiple capacities since 2013. He is a core contributor to the Cloud Controller API. | Utako and Dan previously presented on the Cloud Controller API at the 2016 North American CF Summit."
