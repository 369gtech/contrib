description: "The talk from DevOps Fest 2020 Online conference. \nPresentation: https://bit.ly/3fT3qA7\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/DevOpsFest/\nWebsite: https://www.devopsfest.com.ua/\n\nDevelopers always expected databases to work out-of-the-box, but historically it is the exact opposite.\nWith the rise of Kubernetes StatefullSets and CRDs, we started thinking about running databases on it. But why should I do that in the first place? How hard is it? Which are the challenges? Is it production already? All those questions will be answered during a live demo where we will deploy a database, deploy an operator, fail nodes, scale up and down with almost no manual intervention."
