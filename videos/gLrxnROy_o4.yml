recordingDate: 1504532080
description: 'As a Java developer, you deal with strings almost every minute of every day. Every API consumes or produces them, and every interaction with processes outside the JVM requires them. But what do you really know about them? In this talk we’ll briefly survey the history of strings and character representations and then talk about some challenges dealing with a world of text using Java strings. I’ll also show some libraries that will help you route around Java’s string when necessary.'
