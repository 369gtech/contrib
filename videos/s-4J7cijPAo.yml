description: "Beacons are all about adding context to the world whether at a specific place like your favorite store or moving around like a taxi. With this context, you can provide an experience for your user that requires fewer steps while being richer and more relevant. \n\nWhen you use Google together with your beacons, you get an open and flexible beacon standard called Eddystone, as well as APIs that allow you to register, manage, and detect beacons. In this video, Timothy Jordan gives you an overview of the platforms and lifecycle of building with beacons.\n\nMore information:\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/beacons\nhttps://developers.google.com/nearby\nhttps://github.com/google/eddystone\n\n100 Days of Google Dev / 100 developer videos over 100 days / #GoogleDev100 \n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
