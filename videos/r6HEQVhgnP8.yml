title: 'Using MQTT in Real-World M2M Communication'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433233036
description: "MQTT has established itself as a handy and robust lightweight protocol for M2M communication. MicroDoc implemented MQTT for commercial applications with Java ME front ends and Java EE back ends. To reduce the development and testing effort, MicroDoc developed a Java-based stack with service provider interfaces that enable deployment of the same codebase on OSGi-based embedded clients and load-balanced enterprise servers. This presentation explains a general approach to M2M communication and describes some of the real-world requirements that led to enhancements of MQTT without breaking interoperability and compliance with the original specification.\n\n\nAuthor:\nHans Kamutzki\nHans Kamutzki studied physics and computer science and is co-founder and managing director of MicroDoc Computersysteme GmbH based in Munich Germany.
