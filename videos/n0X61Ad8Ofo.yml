description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nBOOSTING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH ELIXIR\nby Ricardo Corral-Corral\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nMachine learning\nArtificial intelligence\nRobotics\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nReinforcement learning (RL) is becoming a successful strategy for solving goal oriented problems and is emerging as the most promising framework towards general artificial intelligence. \n\nSome challenges of RL include deployment on intrinsically distributed and concurrent physical devices where Elixir naturally stands out and offers additional benefits for boosting RL on real-world applications. \n\nIn this talk, a framework (Gyx) for defining, solving and deploying Reinforcement Learning  problems in Elixir is presented.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/ricardo-corral-corral302/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - RICARDO CORRAL-CORRAL\nRationalist\n\nRicardo is an applied mathematician and Biochemistry Ph.D. CEO of Analitica Predictiva and co-inventor of three US patents around AR, deep learning and blockchain applications for health. He is currently VP of Engineering at Silicon Valley based company Suggestic Inc. His academic research is on structural computational biology, mainly based on predictive models for understanding molecular activity.\n\nMore on Ricardo Corral-Corral: https://codesync.global/speaker/ricardo-corral-corral302/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
