description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nContainer Checkpoint/Restore at Scale for Fast Pod Startup Time - Ritesh Naik, MathWorks\n\nAre you interested in a faster startup time for your container-based application? Are you also interested in pre-warming your container-based application for faster cold start performance? You can have your cake and eat it too!   In this talk, Ritesh Naik will talk about how MathWorks cloud infrastructure was able to achieve *both* of these seemingly contradictory goals, fast startup time and pre-warming, using Container Checkpoint/Restore. With several years of experiencing using this technique in production, Ritesh will share design considerations, lessons learned and best practices for supporting container checkpoint/restore non natively in Kubernetes. He will also share a vision for what native support for CRIU in Kubernetes can look like. If you are interested in improving system scalability and utilization, this session is for you!"
