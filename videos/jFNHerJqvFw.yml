description: "Chat is eating the world and React is eating front-end development, so why not learn React through building a chat app?\n\nThat's exactly what this course will enable you to do: at the end of it you'll both have a solid understanding of React.js and your very own personalized chat application. The chat will be built using the Chatkit API, meaning you don't have worry about doing any back-end coding.\n\n🔗Check the interactive version of this course on Scrimba: https://scrimba.com/g/greactchatkit\n\n⭐️ Course Contents ⭐️\n⌨️ 0:00 —1.
