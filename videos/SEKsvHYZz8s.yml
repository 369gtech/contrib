description: "So you're logging in to your favorite crypto currency exchange over https using a username and password, executing some transactions, and you're not at all surprised that, security wise, everything's hunky dory...\n\nThe amount of cryptography to make all this happen is staggering. In order to appreciate and understand what goes on under the hood, as a developer, it's really important to dive into the key concepts of cryptography.\n\nIn this session, we discover what cryptography actually is, and will use the JCA (Java Cryptography API) en JCE (Java Cryptography Extensions) in the JDK to explain and demo key concepts such as: - Message digests (hashing) - Encryption, both symmetric and asymmetric - Digital signatures, both symmetric and asymmetric.\n\nFurthermore, we'll show how these concepts find their way into a variety of practical applications such as: - https and certificates - salted password checking - block chain technology After this session, you'll have a better understanding of basic cryptography, its applications, and how to use the cryptography APIs in Java.\n\nMichel Schudel has been a passionate Java developer since 1998, building various Java solutions for banks, insurance companies and telecom providers. Since then he has seen the good, the bad and the ugly in Java land. He loves agile development and coding with frameworks like SpringBoot to get up-and-running as fast as possible. Futhermore, he likes to coach junior developers in Core Java. Michel is currently working for Rabobank in the Netherlands."
