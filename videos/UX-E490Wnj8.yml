title: 'YOW! 2013 Steve Vinoski - Exploring Riak’s Service Architecture'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513953970
description: "For decades we’ve known that modularity, loose coupling, and service orientation allow for the construction of large software systems that can be reasonably maintained and extended. In this talk, Steve explores from a services perspective the architecture of Riak, the open source distributed database from Basho Technologies, focusing on how it achieves fault tolerance and high availability based on modularity, supervision, replication, and message passing between services, as well as how it integrates subsystems written in different programming languages. He also discusses how Erlang, the language used to implement most of Riak, facilitates the construction of service-oriented systems.\n\nSteve Vinoski is an architect at Basho Technologies in Cambridge, MA, USA. He’s worked on distributed systems and middleware systems for nearly 30 years, including distributed object systems, service-oriented systems, and RESTful web services. His interest in software quality and development productivity led Steve to start exploring and using Erlang in 2006, and he’s used it as as his primary development language ever since.\n\nFor more on YOW!
