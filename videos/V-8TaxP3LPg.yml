description: "Automation at the Network Layer\n\nScott Garman and Rick Sherman, Puppet Labs\n\nAbstract: \nConfiguration Management tools have been primarily focused on server and application domains, but IT infrastructure includes more than just servers. Networking infrastructure has become increasingly complex and featureful, and managing the configuration of network devices has come under increased demands for higher velocity and consistency.\n\nThis talk will give an overview of the NetDev API, which was developed at Puppet Labs in collaboration with enterprise network vendors. It will demonstrate the power of the Puppet NetDev module ecosystem to maintain the same networking configuration across multiple devices and vendors, bringing network configuration management into the same \"Infrastructure as Code\" paradigm that the DevOps movement advocates.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
