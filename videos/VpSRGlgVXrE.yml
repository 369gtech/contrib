description: 'Get an introduction to Google’s new cross-platform, high performance app framework. Flutter aims to make it easier to write great apps for both iOS and Android, without the hassle of actually writing the app twice. Cross-platform development is a great idea, but you end up making trade-offs between customization and performance. Flutter does away with those pesky problems and enables you to create custom, cross-platform UIs with smooth 60 fps animations, while still getting native performance. It brings a high performance rendering engine, native code compilation, fantastic developer tools (including hot reload) and built-in support for UI testing. Flutter makes developing apps fun again.'
