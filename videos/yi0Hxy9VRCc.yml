description: "Principles of Chaos Engineering\n\nCasey Rosenthal, Netflix\n\nDistributed systems create threats to resilience that are not addressed by classical approaches to development and testing. We’ve passed the point where individual humans can reasonably navigate these systems at scale. As we embrace a world that emphasizes automation and engineering over architecting, we left gaps open in our understanding of complex systems. \n\nChaos Engineering is a new discipline within Software Engineering, building confidence in the behavior of distributed systems at scale. SREs and dedicated practitioners adopt Chaos Engineering as a practical tool for improving resiliency. An explicit, empirical approach provides a formal framework for adopting, implementing, and measuring the success of a Chaos Engineering program. Additional best practices define an ideal implementation, establishing the gold standard for this nascent discipline. \n\nChaos Engineering isn’t the process of creating chaos, but rather surfacing chaos that is inherent in the behavior of these systems at scale. By focusing on high level business metric, we side step understanding *how* a particular model works in order to identify *whether* it work under realistic, turbulent conditions in production. This fills a gap that arms SREs with a better, holistic understanding of the system’s behavior.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
