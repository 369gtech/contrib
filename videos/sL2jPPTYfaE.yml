description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Hoi Lam, Google.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=VUR-7482\n\nEven among machine learning experts, we have encountered many myths about on-device machine learning:\n1. Android is not powerful enough for machine learning\n2. Machine learning is not for me, it’s for people with PhDs\n3. Machine learning requires a lot of data - millions and billions of samples.\n\nIn this talk, Hoi will bust some myths with live demos and introduce best practices for developers to get around the reality of building everyday ML use cases including barcode scanning, AR stickers and more, on Android. Also, some core Android functionalities might surprise you… in a good way.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
