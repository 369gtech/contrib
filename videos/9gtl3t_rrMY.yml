description: "The past few months have been challenging and stressful for people all over the world with the COVID-19 global pandemic crisis. With Americans stocking up to stay at home, several grocery chains have experienced a huge increase in e-commerce and digital orders overnight, causing impact—both positive and negative—on applications, platforms, processes, people, and supply chain logistics.\n\nIn this session, we narrate the story of Albertsons Companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide a blow-by-blow account of events prior to declaring shelter in place, and the months following the declaration. We share how VMware Tanzu Application Service (TAS) played a pivotal role in ensuring that essentials successfully reached customers, and how TAS managed unprecedented traffic and yet managed to have zero downtime throughout this crisis.\n\nBhuvan Padakanti, Sr. DevOps Manager at Albertsons; \nGautham Pallapa, Global CTO at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/delivering-essentials-for-albertsons-vmware-tass-critical-role-during-the-covid19-pandemic"
