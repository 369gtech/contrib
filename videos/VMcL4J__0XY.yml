description: "Building a simple machine learning solution.\n\nTo most developers Machine Learning algorithms feel a bit like magic. We maybe know how to use them, or that you need a lot of data to train, but have little knowledge of how they actually work.\n\nIn this talk we will open up the magic box and build a simple Artificial Neural Network from scratch. Because as the brilliant lecturer and physicist Richard Feynman already noted: “Whay I cannot create, I do not understand”."
