language: English
recordingDate: 1608742820
description: "The Chrome DevTools codebase is around 150,000 lines of first-party JavaScript, with some parts being over ten-years old. As with any large, legacy codebase, there are a range of challenges to navigate, whether it be testing, code style and consistency, or simply understanding what the code is doing! This session steps through how we plan, implement, and maintain code migrations in Chrome's DevTools.\n\nResources:\nMigrating to JavaScript module → https://goo.gle/devtools-js-modules\n\nSpeakers: Paul Lewis, Tim van der Lippe, Jack Franklin\n\nWatch all Chrome Developer Summit sessions here → https://goo.gle/cds20-sessions\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers here → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\n#chromedevsummit #chrome #chromedevtools"
