description: "What's a module, why do we need them, how do we use them?\n\nFundamentally, Java modules were not created for you and me, they were created to make the Java programming language itself modular. If you ever wake up in the middle of the night and say \"I wish I had it,\" it is there waiting for you... in a module.\n\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is known for his contagious enthusiasm for software development. As a truly polyglot programmer, he believes in mastering technologies that improve robustness and productivity, irrespective of their source, and putting them to effective use.\n\nAn award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., and an instructional professor at the University of Houston, Venkat has mentored tens of thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with agile practices on their software projects.\n\nVenkat is a (co)author of multiple books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer. His latest book is Programming Kotlin: Create Elegant, Expressive, and Performant JVM and Android Applications. Venkat is a well-recognized person in the software communities. He was once a recipient of the MicroSoft MVP award. He has received JavaOne RockStar award three years in a row and was inducted into the Java Champions program in 2013 for his efforts in motivating and inspiring software developers around the world.\n\nVenkat has been in the training, consulting, and mentoring business since 1996. He is recognized for his pragmatic approach, dislike for accidental complexity, continuous effort to seek minimalistic design, and simpler solutions.\n\nPrior to starting his own company, Venkat worked in various positions, from Programmer Analyst to Systems Architect, at organizations like Halliburton, Raytheon, and Invensys.\n\nOver the past two decades, many organizations around the world have sought consulting and mentoring services of our organization. Some of our clients include Accelinnova, Aspen Technologies, Baylor College of Medicine, Beachbody, Bechtel, Best Buy, CME Group, Careworks, Consid, Energy Transfer, Fugro Chance, GE Health, Gilt, Halliburton, Idera, Invensys, Mentor Graphics, Nationwide, Neiman Marcus, NetIQ, Nike, Nokia, Perceptive, Pitney Bowes, Roche, Schlumberger, Seismic Micro, State of Georgia, Tideworks Technologies, and the US Government.\n\nhttps://www.agiledeveloper.com/\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\n\n#java\n#javamodules\n#softwaredevelopment"
