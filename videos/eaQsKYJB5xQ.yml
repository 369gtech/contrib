title: 'Two-Tier Adaptive Heap Management for Oracle WebLogic Server on the Oracle JRockit JVM'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784746
description: "This session shows an approach to managing the JVM heap to avoid OOME associated with temporary spikes and yet be efficient in physical memory utilization. It introduces the concept of a soft limit on the heap. The heap is divided into two tiers: the normal-heap tier, from zero to the soft limit, and the high-heap tier, between the soft limit and the maximum heap size. The –Xmx value defines a hard limit, and it has the existing semantics. The GC policy in the normal tier is unchanged from the current policies. The session’s speakers use a GC policy that favors compaction and release of free memory to the host in the high-heap tier. They developed an MXBean that is deployable to any Oracle WebLogic Server on the Oracle JRockit JVM. They improved load up to 32 percent with this technique.\n\n\nAuthor:\nRafiul Ahad\nRafiul Ahad is Vice President of Product Development IT.
