description: 'What would happen if we gave front-end developers the task of building a backend server that caters to their needs? What would it do? What capabilities would it have? How would it be different from the current backend servers, built by backend developers? I explore the possibilities and try to envision a future where the front-end developers are in charge of the servers that serve their own front-end code.'
