description: 'While developer tools and a typical SDLC are important to us all, it is not uncommon for field sales engineering organizations that make customer-facing product demos to have such a coordinated process. We will show how using Docker (and a CI pipeline) we modernized a field sales engineering "Demo Center", made it more efficient, flexible and a capable of handling lots of new use cases.has become truly enabling service.
