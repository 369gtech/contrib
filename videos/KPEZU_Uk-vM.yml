description: "How Do Your Packets Flow?\n\nLeslie Carr, Clover Health\n\nAs more of us move to the \"cloud\" we lose sight of how packets flow from our application to the end user. This is an introduction to how your network traffic flows. \n\nI come from a network engineering background. Talking with many SRE/Devops folks, I've realized that many don't actually understand how network traffic flows. This will be a 20 minute introduction to network traffic - concepts like peering and transit will be introduced, as well as DWDM and awesome cable maps. This will also introduce some of the monetary concepts in traffic - so that people have a better understanding of large fights between providers - like the Netflix/Comcast fight of a few years back.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
