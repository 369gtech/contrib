description: "Gmail add-ons are a powerful new way to add your app functionality alongside messages in Gmail. add-ons extend the functionality of G Suite applications such as Google Sheets, Docs, Forms, and now Gmail. Gmail add-ons appear as embedded \"mini apps\" in the  Gmail apps on desktop and mobile. In this video, we're going to explore a nifty little add-on that allows users expedite expense report creation using email receipts received by the user with the help of Google Sheets. Add-ons are powered by Google Apps Script, a JavaScript-in-the-cloud platform that lets developers build apps which can access data in G Suite plus other Google & external services.\n\nExpenseIt!
