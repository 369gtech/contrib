recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "In this brand new talk, Audrey and Sébastien will share with you how to develop your next Spring Boot application with Kotlin. They will cover the basics (getting started, learning materials), the different choices you have (Spring MVC or WebFlux, annotations or functional) and the latest features available in Spring Boot 2.4 (multiplatform serialization, improved Coroutines support). They will also demonstrate how to deploy Spring Boot native applications to lightweight container images with GraalVM, and give an update on KoFu, the experimental Kotlin DSL to configure Spring Boot in a programmatic and explicit way from Spring Fu project.\n\nSébastien Deleuze, VMware\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
