description: "Erlang on OpenVMS and in the HP Cloud -- an overview of what HP is wittingly and perhaps unwittingly doing with Erlang: Brett Cameron\n\nErlang Factory SF Bay Area 2012\n\nwww.erlang-solutions.com\nwww.erlang-factory.com\n\n\"The speaker has made something of a hobby in recent years of porting Open Source software to HP's heritage OpenVMS operating system. One of the most challenging and interesting porting exercises was porting Erlang/OTP. In this talk, the speaker will discuss the motivations behind this work, some of the challenges faced, progress to date, and future plans. In addition, the speaker has recently joined HP's corporate Cloud Services team, and in this capacity he will provide an overview of where and how Erlang is currently being used within the HP Cloud, and will outline potential future opportunities to further leverage Erlang technology in this space.\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
