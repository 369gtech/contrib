description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThis talk will explain what public blockchain systems like Bitcoin and Ripple are, the unique challenges of developing software for them, and how C++ helps to meet these challenges. \n\nSecurity issues are paramount. Blockchain systems are open source, have large attack surfaces, and can cause significant financial damage if they have exploitable defects. Performance and scalability are also major concerns. \n\nC++ provides a unique balance that helps meet these challenges. The language's design makes it possible to catch bugs at compile time, write modular code that can be tested, develop flexible data structures and manage resources. Yet, where performance is critical, it does not obscure what your code is making the computer actually do. \n\nThe primary purpose of the talk is to explain what blockchains are, increase understanding of the unusual challenges developers of blockchain software experience, and to demonstrate why C++ is a good choice to address them. \n— \nDavid Schwartz is the Chief Cryptographer of Ripple, a distributed payment network. Also known as \"JoelKatz\", he is a respected voice in the crypto-currency community. David has also developed secure messaging and cloud storage software for government and military applications.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
