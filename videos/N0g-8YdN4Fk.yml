Building a new n-layered application has never been so easy, and pushing from staging to production has never been so swift. But – where does this leave the security of these environments? Where does this leave the different security teams in terms of their ability to be proactive and timely responding to requirements by these newly established container-based applications?\n \nThis keynote will focus on how Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence provides a means to “shift left” security capabilities as well shorten the time between n-layered application readiness for production and its actual production. See how by employing AI/ML, security teams will be no longer regarded as the bottle necks of the application world and will allow themselves to lead in the continuum of securing containerized application delivery."
