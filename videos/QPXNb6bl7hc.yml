description: "Is an isomorphic web app right for you? React and the Virtual DOM make it possible to write code once that will run on the server and the browser. This has many potential benefits from SEO to performance to code maintainability. We will discuss the benefits and challenges present in building an isomorphic web application. Some of the challenges we will discuss will include how to handle asynchronous data with React's render cycle, synchronizing data and state between the server and browser and knowing when to write browser or server specific code. We will cover how to use React with Node and webpack to solve these problems.\n\nElyse Kolker Gordon\nVEVO\n@ElyseKolker\n\nElyse Kolker Gordon works as a Web Developer at VEVO working with Angular, React and Node.
