description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nPKI the Wrong Way: Simple TLS Mistakes and Surprising Consequences - Tabitha Sable, Datadog \n\nEffective management of TLS certificates and keys is a serious challenge when running Kubernetes at scale. TLS mutual authentication secures all the Kubernetes control plane components, but there are many details that must be right. This talk looks at some of the ways common mTLS configuration mistakes can be abused and how you can reduce that risk. The presentation begins with a tour of the basics of TLS mutual authentication and how it is used by each control plane component. Then, Tabitha will demonstrate several example misconfigurations, exploit them for your education and amusement, and share recommendations to prevent them in your own clusters. You'll leave with a stronger understanding of this essential element of Kubernetes cluster deployment. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekES"
