Weâ€™ll also talk about packaging and distribution of your Electron applications, as well as neat things that the Electron ecosystem is building.\n\nBy the end of this session you should have a good grasp on what sort of things Electron is good for, how to get started building your own Electron applications, and where to find resources to continue with your journey."
