description: "So you have deployed your application on your infrastructure, but how to keep an eye on it?\n\nWhen applications are deployed you will need to find a way to gather metrics on the performance and health status. Examples are memory/disk/io usage, number of requests etc.\n\nThese metrics can be used to build health dashboards and trigger alerts when your infrastructure is not working according to your wishes.\n\nIn modern infrastructures tools like Docker bring additional complexity and headaches on how to monitor your containers and host operating systems.\n\nThis talk will introduce Prometheus and will show you how you can use it to monitor your container based environments, host operating systems, creating dashboards and set alarms. The tools that will be used are Docker, Consul, Prometheus, Grafana.\n\nLevel: beginner\n\nMarco Pas is a software geek, hands on Software Developer/Architect/DevOps Engineer. Interested in all kinds of software related technologies (languages, architectures and methodologies). Strong believer in the fact that one should keep knowledge up-to-date, and seek inspiration in new things.\n\nSupporting the developer community by organising the yearly NextBuild Conference for Developers and by Developers.\n\nTech guy, wannabe cooking chef, traveller, likes to watch movies/series, beer enthusiast, tries to enjoy life."
