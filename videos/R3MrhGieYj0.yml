title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Developer to Manager: A Survival Guide'
recordingDate: 1523431383
description: "Good work leads to promotions -- and promotions from development to management come with more than increases in responsibility. While they're often awarded based on mastery of one skill set, they require you to learn a whole new one. Plus, the methods you've previously used for learning new skills might fail you -- this learning curve would be a lot easier if you could just google\_\"drush commands for management\" until you found some results.\n\nDuring this session, I'll talk about adjusting from life as a developer to life as a manager, including:\n\nAvoiding the pacesetting leader trap.\nGiving performance feedback that goes beyond code reviews.\nGiving room to make mistakes (while mitigating the big risks).\nCommunicating like a team leader, not a team member.\nInvesting time in people, not projects.\n\nThis session is targeted toward new managers and developers considering management, by a former developer who made the leap and loved it."
