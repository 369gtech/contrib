title: 'Kojak - Building software the Red Hat way - Salim Badakhchani'
recordingDate: 1410873115
description: "Collaborating with open source software communities can be a daunting task given the many constraints that can be imposed to ensure quality releases. Often the more mature a product is the harder it can be to overcome the learning curve required\nmake a valuable contribution. Kojak is part of a greater initiative at Red Hat to make our internal tools more accessible, to the wider open source community, with the aim of encouraging their adoption and breaking down barriers to entry. That greater initiative, however encompasses more that just tooling. It's the desire to produce the best software we can. As the world's leading supplier of open source software, Red Hat is the largest contributor to many open source projects. I want to share some personal insights that I believe were instrumental in achieving that status. I hope the audience will gain an appreciation of the Red Hat way and take home, not only some cool tooling but also an understanding of the principles that\ninformed the decision making process which inspired those projects."
