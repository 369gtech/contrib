So how do you write great unit tests? And how do you ensure failures are easy to fix? What are the best practices? And most importantly what are the pitfalls to look out for?\n\nIf you're already comfortable writing tests, come level up your testing skills with deep insights into the \"Why\" and \"How\" of fundamental testing principles. You will learn:\n\nWhat three criteria make tests awesome\nWhat to test and what not to test\nWhy you should optimise tests for failure\nHow many tests you should write per method\nHow to test literally everything\nWhat is code coverage and why it can be deceiving\nHow to use AssertJ to make test super readable\nWhat TDD is and what its benefit is\n\nJeroen has a real passion to build things, which continuously challenges him to experiment and learn. In the process, he refocussed his master in Electrical engineering to become an Android developer. Starting off with highly technical prototypes for Wi-Fi connected products, he has built his own file-sharing platform (Wi-FileTransfer). Currently, he is an Android GDE and the lead Android developer at Philips Hue.\n\nOne of a kind, never-been-done-before apps are what he enjoys most. So far Jeroen helped realize four huge connected products, various high profile apps, actively contributes to open source and loves interacting with the Android community. He is a passionate blogger and enjoys speaking at conferences."
