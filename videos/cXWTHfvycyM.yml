description: "The inspection paradox is a statistical illusion you’ve probably never heard of. It’s a common source of confusion, an occasional cause of error, and an opportunity for clever experimental design. And once you know about it, you see it everywhere.\n\nWhen you drive on a highway, have you ever thought that everyone drives too fast or too slow, and no one else is a safe, reasonable driver like yourself? If so, you have been fooled by the inspection paradox, an often subtle form of biased sampling. In this talk, I explain the inspection paradox with examples from social networks, transportation, education, incarceration, and other domains. Using simple Python code, I show how the effect can be quantified and how, with clever experimental design, you can take advantage of it. This talk is accessible for people who know basic Python and minimal statistics.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
