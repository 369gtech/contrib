description: '[BETTER AUDIO RE-UPLOAD] Attracted by AngularJS power and simplicity, you have chosen it for your next project. Getting started with DataBinding, Scopes, and Controllers was relatively quick and easy. But what do you need to effectively bring a complex application to Production? We discuss the new Component API, from ngOnChanges to selecting different ways for components to collaborate, from choosing between Two-Way Binding and One-Way Data Flow, to "smart" vs "dumb" components, sharing recipes from our real world experience so that you can productively & reliably build a complex application out of reusable Components.'
