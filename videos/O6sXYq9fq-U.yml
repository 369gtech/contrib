recordingDate: 1523445950
description: "Do you ever reach the end of your day and wonder what you actually accomplished? Even worse - do you have weeks where you feel like you didnâ€™t get anything done at all? This is a story about overcoming bad habits and getting shit done.\n\nThere's the Ivy Lee Method, 80/20 principle, and a laundry list of other lifehacks that all work... for awhile. Change happens. Rather than focusing on a single solution, we'll discuss how to nurture a productive lifestyle to help you roll with the punches. We'll learn how to bounce back from failure and feel good about the work we do.\n\nKey takeaway: \"It is within my means to become happier and more productive by thinking differently about myself and the work that I do. As a result, I will be a calmer, more reliable person.\""
