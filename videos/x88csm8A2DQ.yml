title: 'Mridul Seth - nbreproduce: Jupyter notebooks in reproducible environments| PyData Global 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609866593
description: "Talk\nCreating a Jupyter notebook with a coherent story and code blocks is the initial fun part but distributing it, making sure everything works as intended and is reproducible across all systems isnâ€™t always that fun. In this talk we will introduce a tool nbreproduce, which provides a wrapper around Docker Jupyter stacks to execute notebooks locally inside a docker container.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
