description: "Speaker: Padmal\r\n\r\nPocket Science Lab (PSLab) is a project developed by FOSSASIA. The goal is to create an Open Source hardware device (open on all layers) that can be used for experiments by teachers, students and citizen scientists.\r\n\r\nAt this meetup, PSLab Team will walk you through the entire development and production of the device. We will also share the latest updates.\r\n\r\nThis tiny pocket lab provides an array of sensors for doing science and engineering experiments. It comes with functions of numerous measurement devices including an oscilloscope, a waveform generator, a frequency counter, a programmable voltage, current source and as a data logger.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/FOSSASIA-Singapore-Open-Technology-Meetup/events/249484793/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael Cheng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/gaor/"
