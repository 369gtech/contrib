description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nTypes for All: From weak to strong, from static to dynamic\nrun by\nFelienne Hermans with Sophia Drossopoulou, Martin Odersky , Edwin Brady and Gilad Bracha\n\nABSTRACT\nBecause of deep learning, there has been a surge in interest in automatic differentiation, especially from the functional programming community. As a result there are many recent papers that look at automatic differentiation from a Category Theory perspective. However, Category Theorists have already been looking at differentiation and calculus in general since the late 60â€™s in the context of Synthetic Differential Geometry. In this talk, we will provide a gentle introduction to the ideas behind SDG, by relating them to dual numbers, and show how it provides a simple axiomatic and purely algebraic approach to (automatic) differentiation and integration. And no worries if you suffer from arithmophobia, there will be plenty of working Kotlin code that turns the math into something fun you can play with for real.\n\n---\n\nTHE HOST - Felienne Hermans\n\nFelienne is assistant professor at Delft University of Technology, in the Software Technology department where she researches programming education for elementary school children. What cognitive skills are needed for programming? What misconceptions can occur when children are learning to program? These are some of the questions that intrigue Felienne.\n\nShe runs the project for first year students, and has developed 'campuswide programming education at TU Delft. She is also one of the hosts of SE radio one of the most popular software engineering podcasts on the web.\n\nIf she is not coding, blogging or teaching, she is probably dancing Lindy Hop, running or playing a (board)game.
