Some developers write date/time-sensitive code without worrying about it — but also without thinking about it. Some developers write date/time-sensitive code and worry about it a lot because it's hard. In this talk Jon will provide some guidance to help you write date/time-sensitive code with a reasonable degree of confidence, and test it.
