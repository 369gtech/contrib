description: "Friday Hacks #171\r\n\r\nSpeaker: \r\nArun Sivakumar and Junaid Sakib (Circles Life)\r\n\r\nWith mobile apps getting more complex, we want to provide interactive solutions to users, where they never face a situation where the app hangs or freezes.\r\n\r\nWe introduce the reactive programming paradigm in Java and show how it can be used to build asynchronous, resilient and scalable apps and systems while keeping the code easy to reason about.\r\n\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
