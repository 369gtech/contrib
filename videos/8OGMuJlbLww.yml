title: 'Barclays Cloud Experience Report: “From Racks and Cables to the Cloud” - Nick Funnel'
recordingDate: 1531288131
description: "Nick Funnel leads development practices within CTO Application Hosting - an infrastructure function working to enable Public Cloud across the whole of Barclays. I’m also responsible for ‘ways of working’ and DevOps within GTIS (Global Technology Infrastructure Services), as the organisation moves from a traditional physical infrastructure function to a modern software-driven organisation. I’ve been in role since 2016, involved in setting up what was then a new function - an 'accelerator' group to focus on enabling Public Cloud within Barclays. In essence, as an infrastructure function, GTIS does not have a history or culture of enterprise software development - it manages the data centre estate, and where people are writing code, it’s largely scripting and provisioning. As an experienced enterprise developer, I was asked to grow a culture around development standards and practices. My role has expanded to encompass promotion and adoption of new ways of working (agile/lean and devops) within the function. This role has expanded to encompass ways of working, and helping the teams to be more cross-functional and customer-focused.\n\nDOES18 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
