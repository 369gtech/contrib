In this talk, Nicholas will share his methods for data collection as well as his narrative and design concerns while creating his reports.\n\nNicholas Felton\nInformation Designer, Feltron.com\nhttps://twitter.com/feltron\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Feltron\nhttps://instagram.com/feltron/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
