description: "Open Sourcing: Real Talk by Andrew Evans\n\nThis is a sponsored talk by Hired.\n\nHired open-sources some useful abstractions from our Majestic MonolithÂ® and we've learned a lot. Some tough lessons, and some cool knowledge. We'll cover: When & where should you pull something out of the code? Does it really help? What things are important to think about? What if it never takes off? We'll also look at some design patterns from our open-source work."
