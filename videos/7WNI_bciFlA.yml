title: 'How did Linux become a mainstream embedded operating system? - Chris Simmonds'
recordingDate: 1568722939
description: "Today, Linux is woven into the fabric of our technology. Printers, routers, TVs and Smartphones all have their own \"Inner Penguin\". Yet it was never intended to be used beyond desktops and servers. A lot of things had to happen before Linux could break out of the PC environment and make its way in the world as a jobbing jack-of-all-trades.\n\nThis talk follows the evolution of Linux as it morphed from a desktop operating system into something truly flexible that could be used to control devices of all shapes and sizes. It had to be made smaller, and more portable. It had to be able to read and write flash memory. Tools like Buildroot, OpenEmbedded and the Yocto Project had to be created to\nhelp put everything together.\n\nEach of these steps was initiated by individuals or small groups of people, each having a profound affect on the direction and capabilities of the whole project. Looking to the future, it is clear that embedded computing is going to play an ever increasing part on our lives. It is my belief that developers will continue to step up and adapt Linux to match the new computing landscape.\n\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
