description: "We have been talking about robots and artificial intelligence forever, or so it sometimes seems. Images of smart machinery have inhabited our thinking and our literary and cultural imaginations long before technology made such objects possible. It is tempting to keep separate the art and science of the robot and the artificial intelligence that underpins it. However, there are reasons to thread them back together. After all, the AI of our imagination is the AI we have built.\n\nGenevieve Bell explores the meaning of “intelligence” within the context of machines and its cultural impact on humans and their relationships. Genevieve interrogates AI not just as a technical agenda but as a cultural category in order to understand the ways in which the story of AI is connected to the history of human culture.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Intel.\n\nFollow @OReillyAI on Twitter for news and updates about artificial intelligence."
