description: "\"Speakers: Max Bélanger, Damien DeVille\n\nAt Dropbox, we’ve always used Python to power our application for Windows, macOS and Linux (until recently, Python 2.7). Over the years, a growing lack of features and the need for outdated compilers/toolchains made migrating to Python 3 a necessity. Join us to hear the tale of our unique journey from Python 2 to 3 and the lessons we learned along the way:\n\n- We’ll discuss the reasons that led to our decision to make the jump.\n- We’ll dive into how we sequenced the transition by using the C-API to ship both versions of Python and choose one at runtime.\n- We’ll reveal the tools we used to enforce a hybrid (2/3) syntax for over hundreds of thousands of lines of Python code.\n- We’ll discuss some of our most spectacular bugs and gotchas, and how you can avoid them!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
