Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nPythia: An Automated, Cross-layer Instrumentation Framework for Diagnosing Performance Problems in Distributed Applications - Emre Ates, Boston University \n\nIt is extremely difficult to understand where to enable instrumentation a priori to help diagnose problems that may occur in the future. We present Pythia, an automated cross-layer instrumentation framework, which explores the space of possible instrumentation choices and enables instrumentation needed to diagnose a newly-observed problem in production systems. Pythia builds on distributed tracing and uses statistical techniques to identify where instrumentation is needed. This talk will discuss 1) the scalable design of Pythia 2) our progress on identifying promising data structures to represent the instrumentation search space across multiple data center stack layers (e.g., application and kernel). These structures must trade-off between compactness, exhaustiveness, and accuracy. 3) Creating algorithms to search this space quickly while staying under a specific instrumentation budget."
