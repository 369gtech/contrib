description: 'CIL (Common Intermediate Language) is the execution code set used by the .NET runtime (the Common Language Infrastructure, or CLI) that is JIT-compiled into native opcodes at runtime. Find out how to read (and write) IL code directly, so as to better understand how the runtime works, learn what new type features were introduced in the .NET 2.0 release to support generics, and be able to disassemble key libraries, without the source, that you depend on.'
