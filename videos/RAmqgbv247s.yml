description: "Ryan Dahl: at JS.LA, the best JavaScript event in Los Angeles. Filmed at Fender in Los Angeles, sponsored by Cameo.\n\nDeno is a new command-line program for executing JavaScript and TypeScript built using V8, Rust, and Tokio. The goal is to provide users with a convenient tool for dynamic programming using familiar browser-like APIs. Trading backward compatibility for modernity, Deno is built around the new \"ES module\" standard. Third party imports are done via URLs, which Deno can fetch out-of-the-box, thus providing a standards-based distributed module system. Like in the browser, by default code is securely sandboxed - so users can run unaudited scripts with some confidence. \n\nhttps://www.github.com/ry"
