title: 'Monads in Python: why and how?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1600239802
description: "by Vincent Perez\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UB2.252A/python2020_monads.webm\n\nIn this talk I would give some motivating examples behind the idea of monads in Python, and show some implementation examples. I'd also show how we can leverage AST transformations to make the Python syntax more amenable to the use of monads. I have already given a talk on this topic during Pycon France 2018 in Lille. Unfortunately, the video footage has been lost, but the original slides can be found here: https://slides.com/v-perez/pythonic-monads-in-real-life#/\n\n\nIf this talk was selected, I'd probably update it a bit to account for the feedback I received, and new ideas I may have.\nIn this talk I would give some motivating examples behind the idea of monads in Python, and show some implementation examples.
