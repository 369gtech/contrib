description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJeff Hawkins - Brain Inspired Computing\n\nABSTRACT\nUnderstanding how the brain works and building machines that work on the same principles is one of the greatest quests of our time. In this talk I will describe recent advances in neocortical theory, including why the brain uses sparse distributed representations and how the brain makes predictions from high velocity sensory data streams.\n\nI will demonstrate a product called Grok, that uses a detailed model of neocortical memory to act on machine generated data and how developers can contribute to the development of intelligent machines via the NuPIC open source project (www.numenta.org). \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
