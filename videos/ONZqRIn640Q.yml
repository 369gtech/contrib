language: English
recordingDate: 1510260670
description: "In this session we will demonstrate how we address continuous delivery at Axians.\n\nTopics we'll address: * our gitlab and openshift setup * using openshift templates to simplify openshift setup * using pipeline as code in gitlab * continuous integration in gitlab and gradle * continuous delivery on the Openshift platform\n\n# Frédéric Pape\nI'm a software engineer at Axians for more than a decade. My passion is to create and deliver software as a whole, this mainly means translating customer needs into working applications but also create builds using Gradle, configuring CI in Gitlab, setting up environments/servers on Openshift.\n\nDiscovering DDD filled the void for me, to reason about the problem domain in a certain project. From being a pure Java developer my programming-love has shifted to other JVM languages like Scala, Groovy and recently Kotlin. The testing framework of my choice remains Spock."
