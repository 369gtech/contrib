language: English
recordingDate: 1534356048
description: "In this episode of The Boring Show, Andrew and Matt develop a Flutter plugin that can talk to the pressure sensor on Android and iOS devices. They define a Dart interface that apps can use, and wire it up to Java code with Flutter's Platform Channels, bringing data from the Android pressure sensor back to their Flutter UI. \n\nThey also talk with a special guest from the Flutter engineering team about Dart internals for plugins, static vs dynamic dispatch, and the many ways you can instrument and profile your apps.\n\nGive us your feedback in the comments, and let us know what app you would like us to build next! You can reach out in the comments below or on Twitter using #BoringShow.\n\nWatch more episodes of the boring show here → http://bit.ly/BoringShow\n\nGet started with Flutter → https://flutter.io\nTry a Flutter codelab → https://goo.gl/d3fHPo \nJoin the conversation → https://goo.gl/68oUnb \n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel → http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
