recordingDate: 1513430694
description: "If code is the colouring pens and lego blocks of our times – the tools of creation – how do we teach the curiosity, joy and wonder to our kids? I spent last summer looking at programming and play: how to create experiences that go deeper than just learning logic. So, just like Alice, I swallowed the blue pill and fell down inside the machine. This talk summarises my three principles of play and a few experiments I’ve learned with little Ruby and the journey I’ve been on with her\n\nLinda is the author and illustrator of Hello Ruby, a children’s picture book about the whimsical world of computers, as well as the founder of Rails Girls, a global movement to teach young women programming in over 260 cities. She loves Muji, Zelda Fitzgerald, software and sparkly things.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit, www.yowconference.com.au"
