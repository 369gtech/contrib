language: English
recordingDate: 1632188970
description: "Platforms have fueled some of the most successful business models of the past decade. However, building one for your enterprise isn't as simple as it looks - many platform initiatives are doomed from the start. This keynote from YOW! September looks behind the buzzword to identify what makes platforms work and how you can successfully build an in-house platform.\n\nGregor Hohpe is an Enterprise Strategist at AWS. Gregor advises CTOs and technology leaders in the transformation of both their organization and technology platform. Riding the Architect Elevator from the engine room to the penthouse, he assures that corporate strategy connects with the technical implementation and vice versa.\nGregor held positions as a Singapore Smart Nation Fellow and technical director in Google Cloud's Office of the CTO, where he helped customers maximize the value from a cloud-based IT model, and as Chief Architect at Allianz SE, where he oversaw the architecture of a global data center consolidation and deployed the first private cloud software delivery platform.\nGregor is known as co-author of the seminal book \"Enterprise Integration Patterns\", which is widely cited as the reference vocabulary for asynchronous messaging solutions. His book \"37 Things One Architect Knows About IT Transformation\" tells stories from the trenches of IT transformation while his articles have been featured in \"Best Software Writing\" by Joel Spolsky and \"97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know\". He is an active member of the IEEE Software advisory board.\n\nFor more information about Skills Matter, visit our website at skillsmatter.com"
