description: "Computers don't have feelings, but you can train them to understand the sentiment and what you might be feeling by reading text or seeing what you see. Every time a new technology becomes accessible to a wider audience new scenarios and possibilities emerge.\n\nIn this session, Microsoft engineers will walk you through code and examples of how you can easily utilise Microsoft cognitive services such as Computer Vision, Language Understanding and Speech.\nAfter this session, you will learn how to leverage AI and you take your application to the next level without being a data scientist or machine learning expert. It will help you to get a fresh perspective which might help to spark new ideas.\nThis session will be a combination of demo and live coding."
