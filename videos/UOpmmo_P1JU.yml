title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Continuous Integration has never been so easy'
recordingDate: 1523512529
description: "Do you want to run tests, check code coverage, check coding standards,\_and generate coverage reports every time someone in your team pushes code changes?\_In this session, we\_will show you\_a set of tools to implement Continuous Integration to your development workflow, and to make the business case for Continuous Integration (CI) to non-technical stakeholders.\n\nIn the past few years, we have participated in the implementation of Continuous Integration of every project that we have worked on. Once implemented, we found the metrics it generated added transparency and trust in the team’s work. However, it was always tedious to set up and customize for each team. Furthermore, it required constant monitoring, tuning, and maintenance.\n\nWith the appearance of Docker and SaaS products like CircleCI and\_Travis CI, implementing CI has become much easier and flexible to implement. We sought different, more efficient ways to set up and maintain a foundation that future teams could add quickly to their workflow and build upon. This foundation runs the following checks on a given pull request:\n\n\n\nRuns PHPUnit and Kernel tests.\nGenerates a code coverage report.\nChecks Drupal’s coding standards and best practices.\nUpdates the database, synchronizes configuration and runs Behat tests with a real web browser like Chrome.\n\n\nIn this session we will evaluate three CI architectures to accomplish the above:\n\n\n\nJenkins, using Docker to spin up and tear down environments in jobs.\nCircleCI, via a single-command installer.\nTravis, via a single-command installer.\n\n\nWe will also provide details on the cost savings we realized with a client by migrating build and test servers to a SaaS platform from a custom, internal implementation.\n\nAttendees should have some experience working with Drupal projects.\n\nHave a look at the following links for further details on what we will cover:\n\n\n\nContinuous Integration for Drupal 8 with CircleCI.\nOne-line installer for CircleCI and Travis.\nSession slides."
