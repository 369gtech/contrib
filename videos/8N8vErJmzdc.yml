Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nNHD - A Topology-Aware Scheduler for K8s for Low-Latency & HPC Applications - Cliff Burdick, ViaSat \n\nWith an increasing number of HPC, NFV, and other low-latency applications moving to containers, the ability to schedule these workloads efficiently is important for increasing user adoption. The default scheduler in Kubernetes does an excellent job at scheduling cloud-native workloads, but is lacking the ability to schedule low-latency workloads properly. NHD attempts to bridge this gap by introducing a custom scheduler for Kubernetes that’s aware of hardware topology, CPU characteristics, and the application’s threading model. In this talk, we’ll go over the ways NHD integrates with Kubernetes, how it’s used, and the features it offers. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UabY"
