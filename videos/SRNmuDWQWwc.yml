description: "Speaker: Sujin Lee\n\nhttp://str.sg/ndpsongs19\n\nStraits Times Graphics team published National Day Parade songs project to celebrate the 54th National Day Birthday at the end of June. Since 1984, 26 NDP (National Day Parade) songs were designed to help build Singaporeâ€™s national identity by covering various themes and music styles. In this project, three visual graphic types were used; bag-of-words table, radar chart, and scatter chart.\n\nFirst, we found how NDP song lyrics have changed over the years using basic NLP techniques. Second, we looked inside audio feature information of each song by using Spotify API and visualized to the radar chart in order to compare old and remix versions. Lastly, inspired by Russell's circumplex model of emotion, we designed interactive and dynamic user music emotion chart.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore how the music emotion chart\nwas built with Vue.js mainly. Also, we will get a glimpse of how to extract sounds and lyrics information to enhance the visual story.\n\n# Bio\n\nSujin is a web developer working on various types of interactive visual stories, data analysis & visualisations at the interactive graphics team, The Straits Times.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/leesujin/\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/264455252/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: Michael\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/tlCH/"
