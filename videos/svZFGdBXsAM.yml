description: "Presented by Guy Bedford at JSLA (js.la) April 25th, 2013\nGuy is the author of RequireCSS and ZestJS, which provides a way of writing widgets as AMD modules managing the templates, CSS and dynamic scripts as a single dependency for rendering both on the client and server.\n\nHe will go over some of the benefits of using AMD modules with RequireJS, including how it's not really that different from CommonJS. See how features such as plugins and dynamic loading work naturally in the browser and how these allow for the ZestJS widget approach.\n\nTwitter: @guybedford\nGithub: guybedford"
