description: "As Honza Kral puts it, \"Elasticsearch is a very buzz-word compliant piece of software.\" By this he means, it's open source, it can do REST, JSON, HTTP, it has real time, and even Lucene is somewhere in there. What does this all really mean? Well, simply, Elasticsearch is a distributed data store that's very good at searching and analyzing data.\n\nHonza, a Python programmer and Django core developer, visits SF Python, to show off what this powerful tool can do. He uses real data to demonstrate how Elasticsearch's real-time analytics and visualizations tools can help you make sense of your application.\n\nFollow along with Honza's slides: http://crcl.to/6tdvs\n\nMore free Python resources: http://crcl.to/w8k4o\nProfession Python training: http://crcl.to/96ttd\n\nFor more information on SF Python: http://sfpython.org"
