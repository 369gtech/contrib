description: "Self driving cars are becoming increasingly common. They're already available for the general public: Tesla's 'autopilot' will happily drive your car for you. But what does it take to build a self-driving car? What do you need to think through and which problems do you need to solve? This session will share my experiences in converting a small remote-controlled car into an autonomous driving vehicle. I'll talk about electronics, sensors and of course, the software that makes everything work.\n\nSee the related conference talk @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL0vg1WmI6I"
