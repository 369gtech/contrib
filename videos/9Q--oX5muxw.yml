title: 'Parsing Text with a Virtual Machine - Ghadi Shayban'
recordingDate: 1460857423
description: 'As the saying goes, all the good ideas in computer science came from the 1970s. We''ll explore a new library for parsing text that calls upon an old, unconventional approach: compiling parsers to custom bytecode and then running it through an interpreter.  Along the way, we''ll learn about how PEGs fit a sweet spot between regular expressions and heavier parsers, and how Clojure is an ideal language for writing simple compilers.'
