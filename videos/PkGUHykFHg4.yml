title: 'CSS as a Service: Maintaining Style'
language: English
recordingDate: 1534440967
description: "We often build multiple websites and applications that share the same styles across multiple code bases (style guides/pattern libraries). Maintaining these styles becomes quite a task, and causes increasing frustration overtime. Fortunately it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nWithin this talk we’ll cover a service-oriented architecture approach to writing HTML and CSS, including Sass, and keeping our code modular and performant. Geared towards designers and front-end developers, we’ll discuss at how to best structure and write front-end code for maintainability and reuse, as well as how to properly package these styles to be used within different development environments. Consistency shouldn’t take a back seat to maintainability, and this talk covers how to have the best of both worlds.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyOhio 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nShay Howe\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STYnug7xYfQ"
