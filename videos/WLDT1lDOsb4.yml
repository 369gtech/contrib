description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nYou are devoted to minimize coupling and duplication? You are taking care to maximize cohesion, flexibility, extensibility, encapsulation, testability, and even performance in order to achieve the high goals of (object-oriented) programming? Awesome! But wait: You still favor member functions? Seriously? You have been deceived! You have been praying at the altar of false promises! Shed the shackles of Java philosophy! Free your functions! \n\nIn this talk I will demonstrate why in C++ free functions should generally be preferred to member functions, and why free functions — not member functions! — provide you with all the aforementioned advantages you expect from object-oriented programming. Note, though, that this talk might fundamentally change your perception of C++ and object-oriented programming in general!\n— \nKlaus Iglberger: Siemens, Senior Software Engineer\n\nKlaus Iglberger has finished his PhD in computer science in 2010. Back then, he contributed to several massively parallel simulation frameworks and was active researcher in the high performance computing community. From 2011 to 2012, he was the managing director of the central institute for scientific computing in Erlangen. Currently he is on the payroll at Siemens in Nuremberg, Germany, as a senior software engineer. Additionally, he is the initiator and lead designer of the Blaze C++ math library (https://bitbucket.org/blaze-lib/blaze) and the organiser of the Munich C++ user group (https://www.meetup.com/preview/MUCplusplus).\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
