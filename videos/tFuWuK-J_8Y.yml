description: 'From Codemotion Milan 2015 - User experience is no longer just the remit of designers. Everything from server infrastructure, to API design, to button interaction can effect the experience of the things we design and build. When the whole team is influencing the UX, it''s a difficult job to keep everyone working to the same standard. So what do we do when our team dynamic is confusing our users experiences? Lily will be talking about the qualities we need as team members to make our our UX successful, and what can happen when we struggle to motivate the people we work with to work towards the same goals.'
