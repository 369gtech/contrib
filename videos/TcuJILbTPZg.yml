description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nThe Jupyter ecosystem already comes with popular libraries for creating interactive charts such as Bokeh and Plotly. But in some situations, we need access to a lower level API to draw custom shapes (triangles, circles, squares). The purpose of this presentation is to go through examples of custom JupyterLab extension using Jupyter Widgets and a JavaScript library called Pixi.js.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
