Functional languages usually occupy the higher level language space, further away from the bare metal.\nYet some of Rust's features seem very much suited to program in a functional style.\nPut your headlamps on, we have some exploring to do!\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/lisa-passing"
