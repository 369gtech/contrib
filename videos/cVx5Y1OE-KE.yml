description: 'Across the globe for millennia upon millennia, a cabal of social engineers have been working to manipulate realities, collective and singular.  They influence decision making processes in a matter of minutes and leave no evidence of their presence.  They’ve made camp in your computers, your cars, your places of worship, and your schools.  They may be doing it right now as you read this. They are everywhere.  They are musicians.'
