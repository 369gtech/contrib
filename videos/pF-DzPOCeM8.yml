description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nA historical text may now be unreadable, because its language is unknown, or its script forgotten (or both), or because it was deliberately enciphered. Deciphering needs two steps: Identify the language, then map the unknown script to a familiar one. I’ll present an algorithm to solve a cartoon version of this problem, where the language is known, and the cipher is alphabet rearrangement.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/solving-very-simple-substitution-ciphers-algorithmically-stephen-enrightward\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
