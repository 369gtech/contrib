description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2018\n\nhttp://cukenfest.cucumber.io/\n\nThe programmer holds the power in the team. The ux designer, the product owner, the manager, the tester, the agile coach and others can try their best to influence outcomes but it doesn’t matter if the programmer is not on board. Only the programmer decides which if-statements get written and how long it will take. Without the programmer, there is no software. Without the software, there is no company. \n\n\nBut as the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. One of those responsibilities is to acknowledge this power and use it for good. Good for the human beings working with you, good for the company, good for your own health and good for society."
