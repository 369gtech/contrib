description: 'Big, Impossible projects are exciting, transformative, and begin with an overwhelming number of unanswered questions. Developing against a moving target is never easy — you might find yourself doing things that go against best practices such as designing solutions without knowing all the parameters, or encountering dependencies you didn’t even think were possible. Big, Impossible Projects can start out looking small and simple, but like an iceberg, they have much more to them once you get close. In this talk for both new and seasoned leaders, you will learn to navigate the icebergs and bring your next Big, Impossible Project to a successful conclusion.'
