title: 'Get value out of your monad - Mark Seemann'
recordingDate: 1539267859
description: "This talk attempts to answer a pair of frequently asked questions, the first one of which is: how do I get the value out of my monad? It turns out that the answer to that question ultimately addresses another frequently asked question: how do I combine dependency injection with async and await in C# without leaky abstractions?\nDuring the talk, you’ll also get a quick and easy-to-understand explanation of monads. There will also be containers.\n\nAll code examples will be in C#.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
