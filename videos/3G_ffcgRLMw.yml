description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotswift.io on January 28th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nSoroush discusses abstraction — what it is, and what it isn’t. He steps through the process of taking code that went from good to bad, and find ways to make it good again. How do we build an abstraction from code that isn’t abstract? What qualities are we looking for in our abstractions?"
