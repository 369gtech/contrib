recordingDate: 1496854409
description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nWhy write spreadsheet software when you could be imbuing hamsters with art skills? Why design the next smart kitchen appliance when you could be teaching fish to use hand tools? We live in a world where we often take technology’s role for granted. We allow ubiquitous networked screens to fill and homogenize our consciousnesses. In this presentation, Neil will be talking about his how he’s been spending his time building complicated, useless machines and why you might want to as well.\n\nNeil Mendoza\nMaker of Stuff, neilmendoza.com\nhttps://twitter.com/neilmendoza\nhttp://instagram.com/neilmendoza\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSee Neil at CAMP Festival 2018 - https://goo.gl/sjpf67"
