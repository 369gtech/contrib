description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nThis talk highlights efforts by Kenny Kerr, Herb Sutter, Gabriel Dos Reis, and others to make Windows a great place for C++ developers, replacing proprietary extensions and tools with standard C++ code. The talk begins with a quick introduction on what C++/WinRT is, how it helps make it super simple to create projects targeting Windows that use just ordinary C++ code, how the project uses advanced C++17 and TS features today, the roadmap for the next few months, and then how we’re looking ahead at things like modules and metaclasses to dramatically improve the way we think of and use C++ on Windows.\n— \nScott Jones: Senior Software Engineer, Microsoft\n\nScott works on several diagnostics features of Microsoft Windows, including Windows Device Portal, WinRT diagnostic APIs, and the browser's F12 network tracing. A few months ago, Scott joined Kenny Kerr to develop and ship the C++/WinRT projection library.\n\n\nKenny Kerr: Microsoft\n\nKenny is an author, systems programmer, and the creator of C++/WinRT. He is also an engineer on the Windows team at Microsoft where he is changing the way developers approach OS and app development with beautiful high-performance libraries and tools.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
