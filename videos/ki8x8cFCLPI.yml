The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nTop 5 Challenges in Service Mesh Adoption at Enterprise - Examples from Sberbank Story - Vladimir Alekseev, IBM & Igor Gustomyasov, Sberbank \n\nService mesh is no doubt one of the most hot topics in the technology world. But now it is mostly used by technology companies or startups. Traditional large enterprises have raised their interest, but keep cautious in implementation. In 2019 Sberbank as largest bank in Central & Eastern Europe as one of the early adopters chose Istio and spent 1 year in the journey from first pilots to systems running in production. Joint speech from IBM and Sberbank representatives will cover history of their collaboration with key lessons learnt of transforming traditional architecture to modern service mesh pattern. Presentation will show examples how Sberbank non-functional requirements (mostly in security and availability areas) impacted to Istio implementation and common issues raised by corporate developers getting \"hands dirty\" with Istio. \n\nhttps://sched.co/abaK"
