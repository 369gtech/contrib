description: "\"Refactoring in Python\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - MongoDB]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Tin Marković\n\n[Replacement talk]\nThis talk was a replacement for Stanislav Geidl's talk: From legacy code to modern code\n\nHonest apologies to anyone whose expectations were subverted, but Stanislav fell sick and could not attend. Find the updated abstract below:\n\nThis talk will describe experiences and lessons learned from tackling extremely demanding code. How to bring order to mismanaged code and elevate the code base to a standard that's acceptable in today's tech environment.\n\nPython makes wonderful code accessible at our fingertips, but it also allows us to take a lot of liberty. When you start, code is beautiful and makes sense. With each step you walk on, you find more and more hacks showing up. Eventually, the brilliant codebase you've started with can not be seen under the mud.\n\nNot every code-base can be rewritten, not everything can be redone from scratch. Cool libraries often take a lot of liberty with code structure and make cross-integration difficult, if not impossible. Tests sound ideal, but in practice, they're just so hard to make right. Why is this, and how to change it?\n\nThe talk will tackle the problems in three parts: \n- The Easy Wins: What to do to instantly increase the code quality in your organisation. How? Why isn't it enough?\n- Patterns and Antipatterns: How to identify code that \"\"smells\"\", how to replace it? How to integrate into old code, better?\n- The Philosophy: What approach to set down for the future? Why to care? How to write replace-able code. How to prevent history from repeating.\n\nThe talk will close with audience discussion and experiences, questions and proposals - building a collection of some on-premise tips and tricks.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
