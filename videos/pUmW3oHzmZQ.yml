title: 'GeeCON 2018: Alexander Tarlinder - Using Developer Testing to Boost the Quality of Your Code'
recordingDate: 1532330827
description: '“Quality cannot be tested in. It has to be built in.” While very true, this phrase is also a true cliché in our industry. What does it actually mean, who is supposed to do what and how? Developer testing is the developers’ intentional and systematic employment of testing tools and techniques to achieve the highest possible quality of the software that they create and it provides the answers to the above questions. In this talk, I''ll give a short introduction to developer testing based on the nine core competencies, and I’ll explain how to use them to improve your development process as well as to identify your team’s next step. Obviously a team maintaining a legacy monolith and struggling with “quality issues” faces a different challenge than the team that starts out afresh doing TDD.'
