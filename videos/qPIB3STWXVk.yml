title: 'GopherCon 2020: Jaana Dogan - Debugging Code Generation in Go'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608668408
description: 'Have you ever tried to understand how the Go toolchain takes your source code and generates a binary? Have you ever wondered how you can inspect machine code generated from Go source code? Or, have you ever optimized some Go code to later realize Go compiler is already doing the same optimization automatically? If you are interested to learn about how Go generates machine code, this talk is for you. By learning more about debugging the code generation in Go, you can either learn more about the compiler or validate what goes into your binaries.'
