description: "Platform as a Product: How to Delight Your Developers and Deliver Value for Your Customers - Paula Kennedy, Pivotal\n\n“Success is not delivering a feature; success is learning how to solve the customer’s problem.” (Eric Ries, The Lean Startup). But when your “product” is your internal platform and your “customers” are application developers, how should you apply the principles of product management to solve your internal customers problems? \nIn this talk Paula will provide detailed, practical steps on how to form a successful platform team, how to apply the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop to your internal platform and how to engage your application developers and delight them. By creating and operating a platform that meets their needs, your developers can focus on what is most important for them; delivering their products, delighting their customers and driving business value.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRz3/platform-as-a-product-how-to-delight-your-developers-and-deliver-value-for-your-customers-paula-kennedy-pivotal"
