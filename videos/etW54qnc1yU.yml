description: "Today’s developer needs to rapidly build and deploy code in a consistent, predictable, and declarative manner. This session will illustrate how development teams can leverage open source foundations such as Kubernetes, Harbor, and Concourse to achieve these goals with their image management. This discussion will include a demo of a fully automated CI/CD pipeline solution that can be used to ensure CVE’s detected in your image build process can be dealt with before they actually run in your environment and show how to keep your image repositories up to date at scale.\n\nSpeakers:\nMerlin Glynn\nProduct Line Manager, vSphere Integrated Containers, VMware\n\nThomas Kraus\nSr. Architect VMware Cloud Native Apps BU, VMware\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
