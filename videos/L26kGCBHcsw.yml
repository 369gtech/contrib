description: "Akka is the leading actor model implementation for Java and Scala. The actor model is a single abstraction that allows you to build both concurrent and distributed, message-driven systems more easily. In this talks, we will introduce the latest feature of Akka, Akka Typed, a new fully typesafe API to the actor model to increase productivity and detect bugs at compile time instead of you in a production environment.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
