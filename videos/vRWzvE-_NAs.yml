description: "HighLoad++ 2017\n\nЗал «Москва», 7 ноября, 12:00\n\nТезисы:\nhttp://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/3059.html\n\nThe kernel provides an internal load balancer which has been used during decades and the performance is good enough for small and medium sized traffic loads, but also are well known the scalability problems and dependencies with other subsystems in order to be fully usable.\n\nAt ZEVENET, we've been working in the research and development of a high performance load balancing infrastructure at Linux Kernel side using the Netfilter subsystem via nftables user space tool.\n\nFinally, we're going to present the new ZEVENET layer 4 core based on this new infrastructure and how it works.\n\n\nНашли ошибку в видео?
