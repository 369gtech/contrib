title: 'How I Hacked A Security Camera'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628455336
description: "All I wanted was a camera to monitor my pumpkin patch for pests, what I found was a wireless security camera that spoke with an accent and asked to speak with my fax machine. Join me as I engage in a signals analysis of the Amiccom 1080p Outdoor Security Camera and hack the signal to reverse engineer the audio tones used to communicate and configure this inexpensive outdoor camera. This journey takes us through spectrum-analysis, APK decompiling, tone generation in Android and the use of Ghidra for when things REALLY get hairy.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
