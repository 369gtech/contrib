title: 'YOW! West 2014 - No App Is An Island - Stewart Gleadow'
recordingDate: 1422348422
description: "Almost all apps rely on APIs, no app is an island, entire of itself. We want to keep our apps slick and simple, pushing complex logic to the server, allowing iOS devs to focus on shiny new user experiences. All the hipster developers are using microservices and deploying to the cloud, but what does that mean for your front end apps and APIs? At realestate.com.au, we're building simpler apps backed by smarter microservices using REST, hypermedia and HATEOAS, not just object.to_json.\n\nThis session will demonstrate how to quickly build iOS apps to discover, consume and navigate these services using HAL JSON, and some nifty Objective C libraries for networking and functional-reactive goodness in a way 'future you' will be thankful for.\n\nFor more on YOW!
