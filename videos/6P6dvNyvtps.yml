language: English
recordingDate: 1507312690
description: "Chris Richardson, Software Craftsman, Eventuate, Inc\n\nThe services in a microservice architecture must be loosely coupled and so cannot share database tables. What’s more, two-phase commit (aka a distributed transaction) is not a viable option for modern applications. Consequently, a microservice-based application must use so-called sagas to maintain data consistency between services. In this presentation, you will learn how sagas work and how they differ from traditional ACID transactions. You will also learn how to design and implement sagas for your applications."
