description: "User growth is the #1 problem for our Lean Startup Circle community.  It's really hard to get new users.  An amazing new product can't help anyone until the people hear that it exists.  The media can expose a product to a new set of consumers, but founders don't always know how and when to get coverage.\n\nOlivia Vanni from BostInno Kaite Rosa and from VentureFizzwill share how they decide what to report on, who to write about, and when a startup is ready for media.\n\nPanelists will speak about:\n\n• How do you pick who you write about?\n• Where do the best stories come from?\n• How do you decide when a start-up is news-worthy?\n• Who do you think of when you think of as \"up and coming\" startups in Boston?\n• What do you think is different about Boston start-ups compared to start-ups in other cities?\n• What makes the most compelling stories?\n• What is the best way to get noticed?\n• Do you pay attention to Press releases? \n• What format should people use to contact you?"
