description: "I've heard about programming from my granny, very wise women - she wrote instructions for workers, workers implemented these instructions. 20 years passed, now I write instuctions for servers, and servers implement these instructions.\n\nGranny always taught me: you can find a special approach for each problem, and I'm trying to use suitable instruments for every my task. Granny told great stories, and I think I can tell one for Build Stuff."
