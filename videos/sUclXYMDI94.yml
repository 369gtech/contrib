You're not alone.\nImagine running hundreds of them in a few seconds, giving the same result every time. How do you think a feedback loop that fast would that affect your team's productivity?\nIn this talk you will see what this workflow looks like. You will learn about the underlying principles and techniques for millisecond full stack acceptance tests.\nThis is primarily a talk for programmers, as the solution to the problem requires refactoring of the system under test as well as tests. I will demonstrate that the basic assumption of the Test Pyramid model are wrong, and suggest a more useful taxonomy of tests, and how to partition [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/813\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOamst\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\n#Testing #AcceptanceTests #FullStackTests\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
