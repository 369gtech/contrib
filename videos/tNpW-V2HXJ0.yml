description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2018\nhttps://dddeurope.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nThe Systemics of the Liskov Substitution Principle\n\nThe Liskov Substitution Principle: the least known and most frequently violated of all S.O.L.I.D.!\n\nLet’s explore together what it is, why you should care, how to detect violations, how to stop violating, what is co-variance and contra-variance (What is the In/Out of C#, the Super/Extends of Java, the +/- of Scala).\n\nBut above all: Let’s see that the essence of Liskov is the essence of Object Orientation itself: Systemics\n\nLet’s learn to see our codebase as a System.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nEndless conversation — with friends & compilers — on art, crafts, dialectic, paradigm jump, serendipity."
