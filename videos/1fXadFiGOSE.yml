description: "Healthcare, a $3 trillion industry, is ripe for disruption through data science. However, there are many challenges in the journey to make healthcare a truly transparent, consumer-centric, data-driven industry. Sriram Vishwanath explains where data science can have a massive impact in healthcare and dispels myths where its apparent use contradicts realities within the healthcare ecosystem.\n\nSriram Vishwanath is the president of Accordion Health and a professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, as well as a serial entrepreneur. He has roughly 20 years of experience in the domains of informatics, statistics, and data science and has authored over 150 refereed papers on the subjects. Sriram holds a PhD from Stanford University and an MS from Caltech.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
