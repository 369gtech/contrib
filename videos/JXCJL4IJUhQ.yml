description: "Refactoring sometimes devolves into an appalling mess. You're chasing a broken test suite, and every change just makes it worse. At other times it's a slow, controlled process culminating in dreadful design. This talk presents an end-to-end refactoring that demonstrates simple strategies to avoid such misadventures.\n\n\n\nAbout:\nKatrina Owen, Senior Software Engineer - GitHub\n\nKatrina is an engineer at GitHub. She accidentally became a developer while pursuing a degree in molecular biology. When programming, her focus is on automation, workflow optimization, and refactoring. She works primarily in Go and Ruby, contributes to several open source projects, and is the creator of exercism.io, a platform for code practice and programming mentorship."
