description: "Towards High-Performance Application-Level Storage Management\n\nSimon Peter, Jialin Li, Doug Woos, Irene Zhang, Dan R. K. Ports, Thomas Anderson, Arvind Krishnamurthy, and Mark Zbikowski, University of Washington\n\nWe propose a radical re-architecture of the traditional operating system storage stack to move the kernel off the data path. Leveraging virtualized I/O hardware for disk and flash storage, most read and write I/O operations go directly to application code. The kernel dynamically allocates extents, manages the virtual to physical binding, and performs name translation. The benefit is to dramatically reduce the CPU overhead of storage operations while improving application flexibility.\n\nView the full HotStorage '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotstorage14/workshop-program"
