language: English
recordingDate: 1638215551
description: "To execute labs you will need access to an Oracle Cloud Account. If you donâ€™t already own one you can get an Oracle Cloud Free Tier Account clicking here: https://bit.ly/free_tier_25nov\n\nOn the following link you can find Lab Guide: https://bit.ly/labguide_datemesh_25nov\n\nThis Lab will walk you through the steps to set up a Data Mesh to organize your data flows between classic Monolith applications, typically using a relational database schema, and various other applications, for example microservices that run in a different location and store their data in different ways, for example as JSON document.\n\nWhat will we do in this lab?\n\nIn this lab we will walk you through the following steps : \n- Set up two Autonomous Databases and a database schema for each: one representing the monolith application, and one representing the Domain DWH exposing some data of the domain to external applications through ORDS (Oracle Rest Data Services)\n- Set up the GoldenGate Data Integration environment by creating an instance of the OCI GoldenGate cloud service\n- Configure the data flows in the GoldenGate environment: set up an Extractor and a Replicat.\n- Observe the resulting data flows in the various applications and data sources"
