description: "Speaker(s):\nJennifer Gove\n\nDescription:\nMany websites still provide a poor experience on mobile, and so we wanted to develop an in-depth understanding of what differentiates a great and an inferior mobile experience. Our work has resulted in the development of a set of user experience principles for mobile website design. The principles illustrate how to create experiences that support conversion on mobile, whether that be for a purchase, a quote or a lead. The principles have been developed out of a study that Google User Experience Research conducted in partnership with AnswerLab - a user research consultancy. We studied 100 sites with diversity across size and vertical, and held 119 in-person, one-hour usability sessions with Android and iOS smartphone users. We instructed participants to perform key conversion-focused tasks, such as purchasing an item, booking a reservation, or researching plans or prices.  This presentation will illustrate key principles for designing a better mobile web. \n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
