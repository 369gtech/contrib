language: English
recordingDate: 1342653358
description: "Our industry has shown that open source movements usher in tectonic shifts that enable new business and access models. These shifts fundamentally change the way technology is developed, consumed and the value it can bring. Today, mobility, social, big data along with cloud computing are representative of some of the biggest shifts offering great value, especially when leveraging open source movements, like OpenStack technology.\n\nIn this keynote, Brian Aker, HP Fellow, will share challenges and best practices from his work with OpenStack software, including how a rich set of APIs must be developed in order to drive broad platform adoption as well as the need for formal APIs. He'll also discuss why aligning roadmaps with the broader open source community are so critical and how enterprise customers, as fast followers, can extend resources for QA and performance improvements from this collaboration.\n\nBrian Aker\n\nHP\n\nBrian has spent his life working on the details of how to build and scale out systems. He is currently working on a new MicroKernel designed MySQL called Drizzle and is building the plumbing required for a new generation of large scale computer deployment. He also spends time working on Apache Modules, Memcached, and Gearman.\n\nIn the past, he has been involved with projects for the Army Engineer Corps, The VirtualHospital, Splunk, MySQL, Slashdot, and was a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems. He calls Seattle his home since that is where his dog Rosalynd is."
