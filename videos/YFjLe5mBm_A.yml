description: "About the talk:\nWhen you’re creating global products with hundreds of designers working in many of locations around the world, maintaining brand unity with a design language system is a Herculean challenge. Yet with today’s consumers, size is no excuse. All companies, from small start-ups to enormous global organizations, are expected to offer the same seamless and coherent brand experiences.\n\nBut consistency alone can produce consistently poor outcomes without flexibility. If the system is too strict, teams are constrained and the results are rigid and dull. Come learn how to remove the barriers to creativity and unlock innovation in your organization by inspiring unity, not uniformity, with your design language system.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nHayley Hughes – UX Manager, Polaris Design System at Shopify. She formerly pioneered the Design Language at IBM, and led the evolution of the Design System at Airbnb.\n\nHayley’s work has been featured in Women Who Design, Under Consideration, and “26 Innovations by 26 Women.” She is a certified IBM Enterprise Design Thinking Leader and contributed to the Adobe + Idean e-book, \"Hack the Design System.\"\n\nAbout the conference:\nDesign conference that’s not about buzzwords, but collaboration between designers. Our 5th User Experience design conference on March 2020 was themed around how UX, UI, content and graphic designers can work together better. \n\nWe've had insightful talks on day 1 and hands-on workshops on day 2 by speakers with experience working in Transport for London, OpenTable, The Paciello Group, Nike, Government Digital Service, Airbnb, Shopify, InVision, DuckDuckGo and others. From A/B Testing and Content Design to Design Language Systems and Ethical design.\n \nThe event was organised by The School of UX and kindly supported by SumUp and Sketch.
