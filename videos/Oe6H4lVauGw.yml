description: "http://strataconf.com/strataeu/public/schedule/detail/27039\nThere are a lot of dreams centred around the idea that opening up data will bring economic and social benefits: economic growth, more efficient public services, better democratic engagement and so on. Open data is a powerful tool, and can revolutionise how organisations achieve their goals, but we have learned that connecting the two can be difficult. Jeni Tennison, Technical Director of the newly formed Open Data Institute, will describe the ODI's twin aims of helping data owners achieve their organisational objectives through publishing open data, and helping those who reuse that data to add value responsibly and effectively, thereby turning open data dreams into reality.\n\nJeni Tennison\n\nOpen Data Institute\nJeni Tennison is the Technical Director of the Open Data Institute.
