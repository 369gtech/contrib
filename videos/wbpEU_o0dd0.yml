description: "by Jacek Sieka\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/nimbus.webm\n\n\nEarly 2018, Nimbus was born - an exciting experimental lightweight client and research project for Serenity - the next major upgrade to Ethereum - and resource-constrained devices, such as mobiles. \n\nIn this talk, we'll go over the anatomy of an Ethereum client - the cryptography, the peer-to-peer networking, the virtual machine, the latest research - as well as the language we're working in, Nim. Nimbus, a research project started by Status.im, is a client for the Ethereum blockchain. Its focus lies on Serenity, the next major update to the network, and resource-restricted devices, and is done in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation. \n\nHaving developed everything from scratch in a new language, we'd like to share our journey through the early stages of development, talk about current research in the space and future plans for the client. In the talk, we will cover topics such as: \n\n\nCryptography\nPeer-to-peer networking\nVirtual machines\nProof-of-stake implementation in Ethereum\nSharding and beacon chains\nNim, the programming language we're building the client in\n\n\n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:40:00+01"
