description: "Developers can learn more about the Google Maps API at http://goo.gl/58Hk5\nPresenters: Avnish Bhatnagar, Sean Maday \n\nGoogle Maps Engine (GME) Portable enables organizations to â??cutâ?? their 2D and 3D data from GME for use offline. This capability extends the power of Google Maps and Google Earth into austere environments where network access may be limited or unavailable. Portable comes with a full suite of APIs that allow developers to embed Googleâ??s familiar mapping interfaces into their own offline applications. Portable is currently in use on the International Space Station, it has been aloft in aircraft, underwater in submarines, and used almost everywhere in between. We are excited to get Portable out to a wider developer audience, so talented engineers can create new and exciting offline implementations.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
