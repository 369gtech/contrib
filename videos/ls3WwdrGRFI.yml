description: "For the last few years, I've been leading the effort on the Google Cloud Client Libraries for .NET. These are client libraries intended to make it as simple as possible for C# developers to use Google Cloud services. This ongoing journey has taught me many lessons about API design and versioning, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of code generation. This talk goes over some of those lessons. Even though the talk is grounded in my experience with the Google Cloud Client Libraries, many of the techniques are applicable to general library design.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
