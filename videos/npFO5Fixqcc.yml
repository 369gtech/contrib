Our mission is examining how we should change Kubernetes to make it easier to operate for its consumers. In this deep dive, we will examine how the Cluster API simplifies the cluster management experience for cluster operators by enabling consistent machine management across environments, and bringing declarative upgrades to Kubernetes clusters. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekGv"
