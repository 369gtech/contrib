description: "Privilege analysis captures privileges used by database users and applications at runtime. You then can revoke unused grants and other changes to better reflect the access a user requires. This simplifies the work required to implement least privilege practice.\n\nA recent change to the license terms makes privilege analysis available to ANY of our Enterprise Edition database customers (on-premises or in the cloud) at no additional cost.  Learn how privilege analysis works, the use cases for privilege analysis, and how you can use privilege analysis to shrink your attack surface and better manage user privileges in your database.\n\nTiming for the video:\n0:58 - Announcements\n6:15 - Overview of Privilege Analysis\n15:20 - Live demo of Privilege Analysis\n42:00 - Q&A\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
