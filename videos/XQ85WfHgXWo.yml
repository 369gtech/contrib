language: English
recordingDate: 1609873269
description: "Talks \nParamTools is a general purpose library for input processing and validation. It was created for the “taxing” task of processing the inputs of Tax-Calculator, a model that uses one of the most complicated specifications of all: the US tax code. This talk will demonstrate how ParamTools provides a friendly API and how it helps wrangle inputs into data that can be used by your model.\n\nSpeaker \nHank is an open-source software developer and consultant at Compute Tooling. He created ParamTools, a library for parameter processing and validation, and co-created Compute Studio, a platform for running and sharing models and data visualizations. He is on the leadership council of the Policy Simulation Library (PSL) and a contributor to models in PSL like Tax-Calculator. Prior to joining Compute Tooling, Hank worked at the Open Source Policy Center, where he developed open-source public policy models and tools.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
