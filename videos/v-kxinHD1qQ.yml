title: 'Ahmed Sidky, Using Keystone Habits to Transform Enterprises and Achieve Sustainable'
recordingDate: 1441032084
description: 'Transforming an organization to become agile requires more than just changing the development process; it requires a complete culture shift. Yet, the focus of most agile transformations is on changing the process aspect of work. Sustainable, effective agile transformation affects all elements of culture—leadership style, values, organizational structures, reward systems, processes, and work habits. Ahmed defines organizational agility as a culture that is based on the values and principles of Agile, supported by the organizational ecosystem and manifested through personal and organizational habits (how work really gets done in a company). Focusing on and adopting specific process patterns known as “keystone habits” has transformed entire organizations, setting off a chain of internal events and paving the way for the organization to form other habits and eventually transform completely. Reflecting on his experience in transforming Fortune 100 organizations, Ahmed Sidky shares his unique, and proven, approach to establish sustainable organizational agility.'
