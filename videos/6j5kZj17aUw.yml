description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nMeans of abstraction are the holy grail of programming languages. They allow developers to write programs by relying on other programs whose implementation details are unknown. But the more about these programs is unknown, the more difficult it is to manipulate and combine them in a correct (and useful) way.\nThis talk will explore the solutions brought by existential types and their encoding in Scala. You will learn what they can do and what they can not throughout concrete use cases, and how they compare to other alternatives for modularization (e.g. “basic” inheritance and typeclasses).\nNo theoretical background is required."
