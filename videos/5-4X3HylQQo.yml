Previously, users could run Spark applications on standalone, Yarn, and Mesos clusters. In the Spark 2.3.0 release, Kubernetes became a new scheduler backend for Spark. This new scheduler backend enables Spark applications to run natively on Kubernetes by leveraging the Kubernetes scheduler for scheduling and running Spark drivers and executors. In this talk, we will give a deep dive into the technical details of the Kubernetes scheduler backend and explore all the exciting new things that this native Kubernetes integration brings to Apache Spark. We will also go over the roadmap and features that the Kubernetes community has planned for the scheduler backend over the next several releases of Spark.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuJS"
