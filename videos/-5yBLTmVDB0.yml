language: English
recordingDate: 1639790840
description: 'WebAssembly; you''ve heard about it, but you''re not exactly sure what use it would be in your projects. In this talk, Connor breaks down what WebAssembly is, why you''d want to incorporate it into your Go programs, and how to go about doing it. He''ll take a look at different languages that compile to WebAssembly, their performance, how they interact with the WebAssembly sandbox and host system, and how to build a Go application that effectively takes advantage of what WebAssembly has to offer. Code samples will be made available on GitHub! (https://github.com/ConnorJHicks)'
