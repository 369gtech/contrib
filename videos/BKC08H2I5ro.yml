description: "Slides and more info: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2016/yan-cui\n\nThe emergence of Cloud platforms has fundamentally changed the IT landscape, to the extent that it is now unthinkable for a technology-focused startup not to operate on the cloud. However, attempting to ride on this ever-expanding platform ecosystem wave has created a new set of challenges.\n \nJoin Yan Cui in this talk as he draws on his extensive experience with AWS over the last 5 years to illustrate, with real-world use cases, how the backend team at Gamesys Social is using F# to build internal and external DSLs to successfully navigate AWS service complexity."
