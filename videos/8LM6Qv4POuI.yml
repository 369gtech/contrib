description: "Simon Ritter, Deputy CTO, Azul Systems\n\nThe significant change in JDK 9 was the Java Platform Module System (also known as Project Jigsaw). With the encapsulation of internal APIs such as sun.misc.Unsafe, migrating applications to JDK 9 (or JDK 10 or JDK 11) will potentially require more work than moving between releases used to. This session looks at the areas of JDK 9, 10, and 11 that may affect application migration. It covers all aspects: Java language syntax, class libraries, and JVM options (a significant number of which have changed in these releases). Starting with JDK 9, features that were previously deprecated are now actually being removed from the JDK. The presentation discusses these changes in terms of backward compatibility."
