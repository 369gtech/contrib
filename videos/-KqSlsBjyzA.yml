description: "Andrew Jeffree\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/241/\n\nAutomation is incredibly useful, but is it limiting the ability of our junior staff to actually learn?\r\n\r\nIn this current age of SaaS/IaaS, the effort required now to set up a blog or a website or do anything these days is minimal - with just the click of a button it's all up and working due to the wonderful power of automation.\r\n\r\nWhat if the button doesn't work? \r\n\r\nWhat if you need to go further, or do something more complex? \r\n\r\nPeople are relying on automation more and more. So how do we educate our staff to be able to deal with it whether that be maintaining, fixing or even replacing?\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
