recordingDate: 1636127517
description: "Ближайшая конференция: \nHolyJS 2021 Moscow — 2-5 ноября, онлайн.\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/3rF5KS7 \n\n. For close to 25 years now, JavaScript developers have suffered at the hands of time: the Date object. They have tried all sorts of solutions from using popular libraries like Moment.js to handling dates and times on the backend.\n\nLast year, Ujjwal told you all about Temporal, a work-in-progress JavaScript proposal/initiative that he has been working on that aims to fix the situation by adding a date-time API to JavaScript that is truly futuristic.\n\nNow it's time to show \"time\" who is boss. With the Temporal API stable at Stage 3 and the polyfill ready for production use, let the speaker show you how to harness the power of this delightful API to build powerful JavaScript applications that handle dates and times like we always wished we could. We shall also discuss the orthogonal features being worked on in the JavaScript Intl API and find out how these play along with each other and come together to form a comprehensive set of APIs that allow us to build state-of-the-art date and time components in our applications."
