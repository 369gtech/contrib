description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nBeyond Storage Management - Andrew Large & Yinan Li, Google \n\nKubernetes added alpha support for persistent volume snapshotting in 1.12 through the Container Storage Interface (CSI). While having some limitations, this feature is critical to stateful workloads and serves as one of the building blocks for developing advanced, enterprise-grade capabilities around data protection. This talk provides an overview of standard enterprise data protection policies and practices and discusses how those might map into Kubernetes. Weâ€™ll discuss the full scope of what data protection might look like in Kubernetes and considerations that go into building an enterprise-grade data protection solution, placing the volume snapshot work in a larger context, and propose some explicit potential future standards activities.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaWQ"
