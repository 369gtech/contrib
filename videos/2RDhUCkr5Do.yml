description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nToday, Kubernetes is the defacto standard if you want to run container workloads in a production environment, though that wasnâ€™t always the case. \n\nWe had have a fair amount of monolithic code for our products and to make sure we could build Central Repository in a way that would be easier to manage at the scale we needed to make changes. For us, that meant changes to the way we write code (more Go), how we build apps (using Docker and Kubernetes), and how we deploy (using Helm). We had to figure out a whole bunch of things as we looked at building proper microservices that we could deploy to Kubernetes. \n\nDuring the session, we will pay special attention to things like persistence, resource limits, affinity, and probes because containerizing an app is not simply putting your existing app into a docker container."
