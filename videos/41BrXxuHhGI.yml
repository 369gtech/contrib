description: "Is Bootstrapping BOSH Incredibly Simple Yet? - Dr. Nic, Stark & Wayne\n\nThis talk will introduce the BOSH team’s latest and greatest tool for bootstrapping BOSH to any target infrastructure - bosh-deployment - and will ask the perennially toughest question once more: is bootstrapping BOSH incredibly simple yet?\n\nAbout Dr. Nic\nDr Nic Williams is one of the foremost open source developers and evangelists in the Cloud Foundry and BOSH ecosystems. Dr Nic discovered Cloud Foundry and BOSH in April 2011 and has been contributing to it, extensions, BOSH releases, tutorials, and blog posts ever since.\n\nDr Nic is also the founder and CEO of Stark & Wayne - the premier consultancy for Cloud Foundry operations and development - with over 30 staff in USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia. We love that Cloud Foundry makes people happy."
