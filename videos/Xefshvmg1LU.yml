title: 'DEF CON China Party 2021 - Introduction to RFID Hacking - Deviant Ollam'
language: English
recordingDate: 1617868399
description: 'Hackers have seen Deviant discuss mechanical locks hundreds of times over the past decades.  But our world has been steadily seeing an increase in the use of electronic locks and RFID access control systems.  How many of you would like to understand these technologies better?  There are many tools available for experimenting with and hacking on RFID credentials, but there is also much confusion surrounding them.  Deviant is something of a novice himself, and he will openly admit that others on his team -- like Babak and Iceman -- know much more than he does.  But in this talk Deviant will speak to you -- noob to noob -- about where to get started with attacking and exploring RFID technologies.'
