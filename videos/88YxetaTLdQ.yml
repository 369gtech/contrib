description: "As a co-founder of one of the leading Cloud Native consultancies in Europe, I have been working for the last three with dozens of companies of different sizes and coming from variety of industries. During the years, I have seem many transitions going sideways and getting stuck after months or years of intense effort.\nIn this talk I will tell stories about such transitions and show the common reasons that lead to the failures. I will also suggest the ways to increase the chance of success by using the right models, tools and team structures.\nHint: don’t expect any type of silver bullet in this talk"
