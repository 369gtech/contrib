description: "Speaker: Praveen Patil (ExpEYES)\n\nTalk of 20 minutes\n\nThis presentation is about the Sensor Plug-ins developed for ExpEYES: Pocket Science Lab as a part of my GSoC-2015 project with FOSSASIA. We have added many new sensors plug-ins to measure a variety of parameters like temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, acceleration, tilt angle, magnetic field etc. With this development we at FOSSASIA are aiming to provide low-cost, effective and open source laboratory equipment to students all over the world. I will also be talking about the low-cost weather data-acquisition system developed and interfacing Gas sensors with ExpEYES. A Poster covering details of GSoC work will also be displayed at the venue. In the end I will add little about my experience of GSoC journey with my mentors Mario Behling, Hong Phuc Dang and Andre Rebentisch, with some critical piece of knowledge or a new lesson to learn everyday…..this may encourage and help future GsoC students.\n\nAbout Praveen Patil:\n\nA Physics Teacher and a free software enthusiast.
