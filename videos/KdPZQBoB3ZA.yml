title: 'CON2952   The Adventurous Developer’s Guide to JVM Languages'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449839114
description: "There are more than 50 actively worked JVM languages in existence today. Some have been ported to the JVM, whereas others were written specifically for the JVM. This hands-on session takes an introductory (but non-Hello, World) look at several JVM languages, including Java 8, Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, Ceylon, and Xtend. It covers ZeroTurnaround’s initial experiences, including what rocked and sucked in learning each one. You don’t need any prior knowledge of these languages to attend the session. You will learn whether they are for you and will hear about some real-life experiences of trying these languages for the first time.\n\nSpeaker:\nSimon Maple, Developer Advocate, ZeroTurnaround\nSimon is a Developer Advocate at ZeroTurnaround, a Java Champion since 2014, JavaOne Rockstar speaker in 2014, Virtual JUG founder and organiser, London Java Community co-leader and RebelLabs author. He is an experienced speaker, having presented at JavaOne, JavaZone, Jfokus, DevoxxUK, DevoxxFR, JavaZone, JMaghreb and many more including plenty of JUG sessions and tours. His passion is around user groups and communities. When not traveling, Simon enjoys spending quality time with his family, cooking and eating great food."
