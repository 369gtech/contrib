Team Managers decide on what to work on, and when. Product Managers decide on future vision, capabilities and deliveries.

Executives and Senior Leadership controls what business to enter or leave, where to invest.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the art and economics of Enterprise R&D decision making, from the perspective of a large global technology conglomerate. We will also present some theories and suggestions while sharing our own experience around how you can leverage cutting-edge technology to improve your decision making efficiency and effectiveness, at scale."
