description: "Highlights: TensorFlow, Parsey McParseface, AnyPixel, Google Creative Lab, Project Tango, Google VR.\n\nWe have our own #AskDevShow question this week: who is responsible for naming SyntaxNet’s Natural Language Understanding system, Parsey McParseface? Because they are amazing. The interactive display by the Google Creative Lab uses the newly open sourced library AnyPixel.js to light up over 6,000 interactive arcade buttons! Project Tango apps help place virtual objects in the physical world, and its latest tutorial features cats... lots of cats. In Daydream Labs, the Google VR team explores virtual reality’s possibilities. Plus, a new series from AdMob as well as optimized tools from AdWords for the mobile-first world.\n\nThe Developer Show is where you can stay up to date on all the latest Google Developer news, straight from the experts. \n\nHave a question?
