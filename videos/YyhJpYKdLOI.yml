title: 'Andreas Evers - Continuous Deployment to the Cloud using Spinnaker'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531817065
description: "In our quest to get to production faster, we've tackled culture, architecture and infrastructure: organizing ourselves in cross-functional DevOps teams, embracing microservice architectures, and deploying to the various clouds out there. Along the way we’ve learned some best practices about how to deploy software at velocity — things like automated releases, immutable infrastructure, gradual rollouts and fast rollbacks.\n\nBack in 2014, Netflix started building Spinnaker, an open-source multi-cloud continuous delivery platform that embodied these core principles of safe, frequent and reliable releases. In June Spinnaker 1.0 was released, with core contributions from Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Pivotal to name a few.\n\nBuilt on Spring Boot, its architecture is surprisingly familiar. During this session we'll give you a tour of how Spinnaker works, how we are using it at our clients, as well as what it could do for your continuous delivery pipeline."
