recordingDate: 1526482644
description: 'Henry Ford once said, “The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.” So how can we learn the most from system failures? This session will move beyond “blameless” post-mortems to show how we can use data to avoid and mitigate future failures. I''ll cover best practices for gathering both systems and people-related data, and how to use that data to formulate actionable response plans to avoid repeating failures.'
