description: "Google Tech Talks\nJuly 24, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis is the Google campus version of Stats 202 which is being taught at Stanford this summer. I will follow the material from the Stanford class very closely. That material can be found at www.stats202.com. The main topics are exploring and visualizing data, association analysis, classification, and clustering. The textbook is Introduction to Data Mining by Tan, Steinbach and Kumar. Googlers are welcome to attend any classes which they think might be of interest to them.  Credits: Speaker:David Mease"
