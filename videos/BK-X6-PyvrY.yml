title: 'JDBC Next: A New Asynchronous API for Connecting to a Database'

description: "Rajesh Tiwary\nPrincipal Member Technical Staff - JDBC\nOracle\n\nSaurabh Verma\nPrincipal Member of Technical Staff - JDBC\nOracle\n\nKuassi Mensah\nDirector of Product Management - JDBC\nOracle\n\nReactive Applications require non-blocking database access. The existing JDBC API leads to blocked threads, threads scheduling, and contention. For high throughput and large-scale deployment, the Java community needs a standard asynchronous API for database access where user threads never block. This session presents an advance look at a possible new Java standard for accessing SQL databases. This new API is completely non-blocking. It is not intended to be an extension to, or a replacement for, JDBC but, rather, an entirely separate API that provides completely non-blocking access to the same databases as JDBC. This session examines the API, its execution model, code samples, a demo of a prototype, and the next steps."
