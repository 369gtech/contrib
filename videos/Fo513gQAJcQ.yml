language: English
recordingDate: 1639580407
description: "This session will share our experiences in converting a small remote controlled car into an autonomous driving vehicle. We'll talk about electronics, sensors, AI, computer vision and of course, the software that ties everything together.\nWe'll introduce you into the world of self driving cars and compare our solution to the stuff that is done in the big leagues by the likes of Tesla's 'autopilot' and Waymo's self driving cars. We'll explain the challenges that have to be faced and the dilemma's that come with creating a car being driven by software in real world scenarios.\n\nPresented by Bert Jan Schrijver and Tim van Eijndhoven\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
