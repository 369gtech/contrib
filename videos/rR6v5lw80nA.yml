description: "For many of us who are developer turning data scientist, we are always concerned about how to build a model, train it, etc... And yes, we want the best accuracy (close to 99%).\n\nBut as every seasoned data scientist will always advise us, we need first and foremost to understand our data, ensure it’s clean and prepared before doing any training on it.\n\nDuring the conference, we will explore multiple problems occurring during data analysis or preparation and for each a technique to solve them (from a list of them). You will go away with a number of resources to explore at your own pace.\n\nWe will cover these categories of problems:\n\ndirty data\ndisparate datasets - needing normalisation\ntoo much information to process\nand others…\nWe will cover some of these techniques:\n\nanalysis - detecting misleading data, outliers, specific time series issues\ncleaning - deal with missing/ambiguous values, outliers, generating synthetic data, resampling\npreparation - using statistical and physics functions, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, resampling\nAnd using different kinds of plots relevant at different stages."
