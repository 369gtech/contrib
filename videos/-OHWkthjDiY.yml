description: 'Dragons have become a rare commodity these days. Unlike in the early days where "Hic sunt dracones" marked the spot on the map where to find them, these are not the best of times for explorers who are naturally drawn to the unknown: there seem to be no more white areas on our maps. Yet, there are still some mysterious creatures out there to be found, they just managed to hide better. This talk is not really about dragons but rather about the joy of finding: finding new kind of visuals, new uses for old algorithms or new ways to enjoy making things for the sake of making. And a few dragons.'
