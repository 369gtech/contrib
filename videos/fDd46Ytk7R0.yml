description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://bit.ly/2DddzYQ\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\nIn software, a code smell is not pleasant. Aside from obvious hygiene and social considerations, in much the same way a strong and unpleasant body odor may be the surface indicator of a deeper medical problem, a strong and unpleasant code odor may be the symptom of even relevant weaknesses in the code design.\nShould we be worried about code odor? A code smell is not the same as a bug. More simply, a code smell is a piece of code that we perceive as not right, but don’t fix right away. Code smells primarily affect the maintain ability of a software system, and any code is almost immediately in need of maintenance as soon as it’s written. Code smells have fancy names and apply to different coding scenarios. This session reviews different code smells and many other aspects of the code, such as factories, data grouping, null pointers, special types, you want to refactor for the sake of readability and easier maintenance."
