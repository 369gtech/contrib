recordingDate: 1541419413
description: "Life is hard. To adult is hard. Every day we are faced with decisions, consequences, questions, problems and whatever else life throws at us. At times it feels like an impossible mission.\nIt doesn’t have to be that way, and in this talk I will share 20 years of personal experience based on failures and success, easy and hard, betrayal and support. In short, my lifehacks I use to make my life more fun and more easier…erer. How do you know what to focus on, what to pursue, what to say “no” to? And how do you fit it all into an already packed life of family, friends, discovery and ambition?\n\nFrom managing 3 businesses, being an author and international speaker, organising conferences, giving as much back to the community as possible as well as being a father and partner, there are gold nuggets aplenty in this highly rated talk. Be inspired to think beyond yourself.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
