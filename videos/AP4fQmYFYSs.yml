description: "The title: Building serverless applications on the Apache OpenWhisk platform - Lucio Grenzi - Codemotion Milan 2017\n\nApache OpenWhisk provides a powerful and flexible environment for deploying cloud-native applications driven by data, message, and API call events. We will show how and why we integrated Apache OpenWhisk and GitHub to make deployment as easy and transparent as `git push`. We will also discuss the benefit of using an open source cloud platform and explain how serverless allows developers to focus on writing value-adding code."
