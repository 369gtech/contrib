description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nOver the last twenty years, there has been a paradigm shift in software development: from meticulously planned release cycles to an experimental way of working in which lead times are becoming shorter and shorter.\n\nHow can Java ever keep up with this trend when we have Docker containers that are several hundred megabytes in size, with warm-up times of ten minutes or longer? In this talk, I'll demonstrate how we can tweak GraalVM so that we can create super small, super fast Java containers! This will give us better possibilities for scaling up and down - which can be a game-changer, especially in a serverless environment. It will also provide the shortest possible lead times, as well as a much better use of cloud performance with the added bonus of lower costs."
