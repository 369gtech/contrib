language: English
recordingDate: 1463511212
description: "We work at the intersection of art and commerce.  In art and music — from the outset — the creator doesn’t know where he or she will end up. On the other hand, commercial clients expect predictable and quantifiable results, and aim to limit all creative, production and financial variables before a project begins.  Fear of the unknown can destroy projects and waste everyone’s time and money.  In this talk Wilson will discuss how to mediate art and commerce by embracing the unknown, and focusing on the process rather than the result.\n\nWilson Brown\nPartner & Creative Director, Antfood\nhttps://twitter.com/antfood\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/antfood\nhttps://vimeo.com/antfood\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
