description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nMonolithic approaches to software development have quite a bad reputation, and rightfully so. Modularization and micro services dictate the current landscape especially in the web development world.\nBut still there seems to be a new trend coming up contradicting this. The Monorepo. Although Monorepos are not in the least incompatible with modular software development practices. Quite the opposite.\nIn this talk we’re going to take a closer look at what are Monorepos and how they can be utilized managing modularized code bases efficiently.\nWe’re going to explore why popular open source projects like Babel, Angular or React are using Monorepos and how I was able to optimize the development process of one of my personal projects using the tool Lerna.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
