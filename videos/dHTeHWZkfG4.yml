description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: Influx Data - Building a GitOps Workflow \n\nSince the rise of Kubernetes, GitOps workflows have become the standard way for teams to manage the state of large systems. GitOps is a way to perform application management and delivery, which at its core leverages a version control system to maintain the desired state of the system. Being able to describe the desired state using human readable text files, and allowing automation to handle deployments and updates based on those files, means less opportunity for human error and faster deployments.  In this training I’m going to walk you through; -Setting up a GitHub repository to serve as a version control system -Create automation to enable your team to check out a repository from GitHub.  -Install and configure a local InfluxDB OSS instance to mimic production. -Make changes and push those changes to the repository.  -Deploy those changes automatically into the production account using GitHub Actions. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff0L"
