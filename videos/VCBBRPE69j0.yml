description: "Speaker: YAKOV FAIN SOLUTIONS ARCHITECT, FARATA SYSTEMS\nJHipster 4 is an open-source code generator that allows you to automate creation and configuration of a Web project that uses the Angular framework on the front and Spring Boot on the back. We'll start with a simple example where an Angular app consumes the REST service from Spring Boot. After that, we'll use JHipster to generate a complete Angular/Spring Boot project."
