description: "Root Cause, You're Probably Doing It Wrong\n\nTJ Gibson, PayPal\n\nIt's not very difficult to find a misbehaving application or a frozen computer; it's a lot of what SRE does either manually or using automated means. All too often, SRE is quick to call the bad software or hardware the root cause of a particular issue.\n\nThe problem is, this thinking doesn't really get to the heart of the problem. Since identifying the root cause of a problem is the primary starting point to identifying a solution to solve the problem, getting it wrong (even slightly) can lead to dire consequences and even bigger problems down the road. \n\nI want to challenge SRE to think differently and more critically about how they identify the root cause of the problems they encounter.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
