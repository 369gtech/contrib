description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016/torben-hoffmann\n\nScalability is a word often used to describe RiakKV & Erlang/Elixir. But is not the first concern for a start-up. Scalability is a rich man's problem.\n\nSure, you need a stack that can scale.. when you are ready!\n\nUntil that point you need something that is flexible and allows you to iterate over a lot of experiments in a short period of time.\n\nExperiments with software often involve errors. Erlang/Elixir has a unique approach to dealing with errors that lends itself well to do the experiments and at the same time keep a start-up rolling. We will look into how you should architect your software to leverage this, so you work with the BEAM and not against it.\n\nRiakKV is a scalable, reliable NoSQL database, which takes the Erlang philosophy regarding failures to heart: don't ignore failure, embrace failure!! \n\nBut wait a second... if scalability is a rich man's problem, what role does RiakKV play for a start-up?\n\nThis talk will go into how to approach this dilemma by attacking it with an architecture that has the flexibility that serves both the short and long term needs of a start-up."
