title: 'Clojure Web-Application 101 by Michael Vitz'
language: English
recordingDate: 1478765972
description: "Clojure is a JVM language which makes the impossible come true: a pragmatic and usable Lisp for humans. Besides an short introduction to the language this talk introduces how to develop Web-Applications in Clojure. If you aren't afraid of parenthesis you will quickly understand why a functional language like Clojure is a perfect choice for implementing Web-Applications and that it fits the stateless HTTP approach very nicely.\n\nMichael Vitz is a consultant for software architecture and engineering at innoQ. He has got many years of experience building and maintaining software for the JVM. Currently his main interests are DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Microservices, Cloud-Architectures and Clojure.\n\n[CJT-4943]"
