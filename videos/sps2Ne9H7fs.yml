title: 'Irina Shestak: Building Interactive npm Command Line Modules -- All The Things - JSConf US Last Call'

description: 'Here you are coding away, when you realize you''re in desperate need of a quick shell script to get your project cleaned up. You''re standing at a fork in the road: Bash or Node? You choose the road less travelled by (for some reason) -- Node. I congratulate you on this decision. You''ve written it, you may have published it, and it certainly works. But what now? Is this all a command line module Node is good for: a project clean up and some data manipulation? Let''s take it a step further. Let''s make a command line module that''s more than just your compiling script. I am, of course, talking about making it more interactive. In this talk I want to take you on an adventure that will require cunning, bravery, and maybe some magic. We will walk through obtaining and parsing data, using Node''s process functions, and finally improving the module''s user experience.'
