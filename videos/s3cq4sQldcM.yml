description: "As much as everyone loves having real-time applications, it is a pain to have them in high traffic websites. Scaling is a big issue which can be easily solved by using Azure's SignalR Service.\n\nHow can we add real-time functionality to cloud hosted web applications? How can we test and handle high traffic volume without disrupting real-time capabilities? What new and interesting problems can we solve with a bi-directional-web feature-set?\n\nOur speakers will explain, demonstrate and guide the audience through current ASP.NET Core SignalR technology and the possibilities that real-time features can give to modern web applications.\nThey will also show how to use Serverless technology in the Azure cloud with Azure App Services, Azure Storage and Azure Functions to use SignalR APIs to build your Real-time web application.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
