title: 'YOW! Data 2021 - Savin Goyal - Taming the Long Tail of Industrial ML Applications'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628827908
description: "Data Science usage at Netflix goes much beyond our eponymous recommendation systems. It touches almost all aspects of our business - from optimizing content delivery and informing buying decisions to fighting fraud. Our unique culture affords our data scientists extraordinary freedom of choice in ML tools and libraries, all of which results in an ever-expanding set of interesting problem statements and a diverse set of ML approaches to tackle them. Our data scientists, at the same time, are expected to build, deploy, and operate complex ML workloads autonomously without the need to be significantly experienced with systems or data engineering. In this talk, I will discuss some of the challenges involved in improving the development and deployment experience for ML workloads. I will focus on Metaflow, our ML framework, which offers useful abstractions for managing the modelâ€™s lifecycle end-to-end, and how a focus on human-centric design positively affects our data scientists' velocity.\n\nSavin is a machine learning engineer with Netflix, and he joins the show to talk about the machine learning challenges within Netflix, and his experience working on Metaflow.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
