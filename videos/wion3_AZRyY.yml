title: 'Bartosz Adamczewski. Probabilistic Data Structures'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619617827
description: "We generate more information in a day that weâ€™re able to process in a year. Gone are the days when all relevant data would nicely fit in memory and be instantly aggregatable and searchable. This is where probabilistic data structures can help since they try to minimize memory footprint and maximize performance.\n\nThis presentation will show you how probabilistic data structures can be better, faster, and more memory-optimized than their classical counterparts. We shall look at how to solve common business problems using these data structures.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/aSajyWYL2tKjfQ\n\nDotFest: https://2020.dotfest.ru/lecture/17"
