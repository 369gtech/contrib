title: 'Continuous Profiling in Production: What, Why and How by Richard Warburton'
recordingDate: 1581886383
description: "Everyone wants to understand what their application is really doing in production, but this information is normally invisible to developers. Profilers tell you what code your application is running but few developers profile and mostly on their development environments.\n\nThankfully production profiling is now a practical reality that can help you solve and avoid performance problems. Profiling in development can be problematic because it’s rare that you have a realistic workload or performance test for your system. Even if you’ve got accurate perf tests maintaining these and validating that they represent production systems is hugely time consuming and hard. Not only that but often the hardware and operating system that you run in production are different from your development environment.\n\nThis pragmatic talk will help you understand the ins and outs of profiling in a production system. You’ll learn about different techniques and approaches that help you understand what’s really happening with your system. This helps you to solve new performance problems, regressions and undertake capacity planning exercises.\n\nRichard Warburton\nOpsian\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
