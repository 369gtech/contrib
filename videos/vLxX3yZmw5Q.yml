description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotgo.eu on October 10th in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nPrototyping remains an underappreciated technique in software design. In this talk, Robert develops a functioning prototype for a specific Go language extension, multi-dimensional index expressions. He explains how implementing and playing with the prototype informs the existing design, which ultimately may lead to a better final design."
