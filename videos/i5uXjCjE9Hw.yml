title: 'Strategies for creating cultures of innovation in engineering teams | Panel discussion'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605715823
description: "With competition increasing at a more rapid rate than ever, companies need to innovate to remain viable. But innovation isn’t just a technical problem, it’s also a human one. And if a safe environment hasn’t been established, engineers are less likely to do the inherently risky work that innovation requires.\n\nIn this panel, we’ll take a look at the requirements of building a culture of innovation. We’ll consider the effects of exploration, research, and experimentation; how to ensure that all voices are listened to regardless of seniority or experience; and how to create spaces that allow failure without critique."
