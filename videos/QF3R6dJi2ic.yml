description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nLet's explore how we can improve mapping in DDD. Can we make space more meaningful in a typical Context Map? How can we visualize our intended changes? Is there a way to markup maps with forces on our model outside of code? And what details impact can we expect from things not part of our map?\n\nMapping is a perfect tool for facilitating communication and decision making. In this session Marijn will show examples from real life to inspire you to experiment with different mapping techniques yourself.\n\nIn a small backstreet of Tokyo lives a man named Aki, a 78 years old former chef. Aki spent most of his life trying to perfectly cook the rice he buys from his friend Mato. He's been at it for 56 years now, and still searches for ways to improve his cooking methods. There is probably not too much anybody else could tell Aki about cooking this specific type of rice. When it comes to his process, Aki's understanding is unrivaled.\n\nBe like Aki, be your domain.\n\nIf you don't want to spend the better part of 6 decades getting there, come and hear me share my experiences in the field of domain driven design and the lessons I've learned."
