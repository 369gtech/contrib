description: "Lessons Learned Using the Operator Pattern to Build a Kubernetes Platform\n\nPavlos Ratis, Red Hat\n\nIn Kubernetes, the Operator pattern helps capture good production practices and the expert knowledge of practitioners for managing a service or a set of services.\n\nAn Operator acts as an SRE for an application. Instead of manually following playbooks or scripts to deploy databases or mitigate issues in Kubernetes, SRE teams can use off-the-shelf Operators or develop their own to automate these processes and reduce toil work.\n\nIn this session, we will explore the Operator pattern with some examples of how we have used them at Red Hat to build OpenShift. We will discuss some lessons learned, common pitfalls running Operators, and when it makes sense to write one.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
