description: "Introducing Alterant: An Open Source Descriptive Configuration Modifier. It reads configuration files in yaml or json and modifies them based on your scripts. You can think of it as an elegant and understandable equivalent of XSLT but for JSON and YAML!\n\nWe use Alterant to make transparent and auditable changes to Kubernetes configuration files automatically."
