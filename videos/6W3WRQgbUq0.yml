title: 'CloudSphere: Jenkins Kubernetes Operator by Tomasz Sęk'
recordingDate: 1571336736
description: "Running Jenkins on Kubernetes cluster is not a trivial task.\nKubernetes platform was released ten years after the first version of Hudson project.\nIt means Jenkins couldn’t be designed to run on top of it.\nJenkins Operator tries to bridge that gap. It is an open source project that we contributed to jenkinsci organization a while ago  https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator ‑  \nThis presentation will explain how operator pattern helps to manage Jenkins in Kubernetes.\n\nWe will take a look at the operator pattern and its use cases.\nA closer look at the Jenkins Operator will show the operator pattern in practice.\n\nWe will go through day-to-day operations automation that the operator provides\nlike deployment, configuration and repair of a Jenkins instance.\n\nAfter this presentation you will know how a non-cloud native application can be run in an immutable, scalable and secure way."
