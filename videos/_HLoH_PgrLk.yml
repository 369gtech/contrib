recordingDate: 1321998426
description: "When designing schemas for HBase, be it from scratch or porting an existing application over from a relational database for example, there are a set of architectural constraints that a user should be aware of to avoid common pitfalls. This session discusses the basic underlying concepts of the storage layer in HBase and how an application should be combined with the appropriate schema to achieve the best possible performance.\n\nAbout Lars George:\n\nLars George has been involved with HBase since 2007, and became a full HBase committer in 2009. He has spoken at various Hadoop User Group meetings, as well as large conferences such as FOSDEM in Brussels. He also started the Munich OpenHUG meetings. He now works for Cloudera to support Hadoop and HBase in and around Europe through technical support, consulting work, and training."
