description: "Abstracting Heavy Lifting: How K8s Speeds Up Multi-Cloud Solution Delivery - Rob Zuber, CircleCI \n\nAt CircleCI, we build a complex, distributed system for CI/CD used by thousands of sophisticated teams. While we started as a single-cloud, SaaS product, we’ve grown to serve huge customers, across clouds and behind customers’ firewalls. With scale came issues in our ability to build, distribute, and manage our product.  CircleCI CTO Rob Zuber will discuss how we hit the limits of distribution via an unsophisticated orchestration engine, and how consolidating on K8s helps us control networking, security, and availability while minimizing one-off work. K8s also allows us to live a value: only building what is a core differentiator to our business.  Even if your team isn’t selling a distributed system, you can apply what we’ve learned. Abstracting your heavy lifting makes it possible to escape the whims of AWS, GCP, or Azure, reduce maintenance, and ultimately, helps drive velocity.\n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrRv"
