description: "Animation is a powerful design tool that we too often ignore. When used well motion can engage, communicate and improve interactions. That’s the kind of animation we want in our work: animation that has both purpose and style. Carefully crafting these moments makes our work more memorable and enjoyable to use. In this session we’ll discuss where animation can best inform UX and how to build more sophisticated animated interactions on the web.\n\nEVENT:\n\nIxDA Berlin 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nVal Head\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://vimeo.com/233851122"
