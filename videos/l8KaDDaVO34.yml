The highs and lows and importantly –with live experiences becoming more and more widespread– what are the tools and trends of the future?\n\nHaving worked in the world of motion graphics for over 25 years and the world of live experiences for over 15, Kate will deliver some insights into what it’s like to design, produce and deliver digital content for shows and events. Focusing on a range of projects from the audience pixels for the London 2012 Olympics, to the recent ‘gauze projections’ at the Festival of Remembrance for the Armistice Centenary.\n\nKate Dawkins\nFounder and Creative Director, Kate Dawkins Studio\nhttps://twitter.com/StudioDawkins\nhttps://instagram.com/katedawkinsstudio\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
