description: 'Discuss the what to do, what not to do, and the “we’re still not sure if this is a good idea” parts of using Rust in an existing code base that is both resource-constrained and littered with history. Specific topics will include building Rust projects inside the bitbake build system, as well as balancing different deployment methods against code size constraints.'
