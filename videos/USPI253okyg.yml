recordingDate: 1550226114
description: "Scott has been a Type 1 diabetic for over 20 years. When he first became diabetic he did what every engineer would do...he wrote an app to solve his problem. Fast forward to 2018 and Scott lives 24 hours a day connected to an open source artificial pancreas. After years of waiting, the diabetes community online creating solutions.\n\nScott will go through the history of diabetes online, the components (both hardware and software) needed for an artificial pancreas, and discuss the architectural design of two popular systems (LoopKit and OpenAPS). Plus, you'll see Scott *not die* live on stage as he's been \"looping\" for over a year!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
