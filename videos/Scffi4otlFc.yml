description: "► Check out https://gorails.com for Pro episodes and more!\n► SaaS business template for Ruby on Rails with built-in features like Payments, Teams, and much more: https://jumpstartrails.com\n► Ruby on Rails hosting with Hatchbox.io: https://hatchbox.io\n► Learn how to add Stripe Payments (with SCA support!) with Ruby on Rails: https://courses.gorails.com/payments-with-rails-master-class\n\nNoticed - https://github.com/excid3/noticed\n\nAdding notifications to Rails has been something I've dreaded for years. Building Jumpstart Pro, I wanted to add notifications, but if I was going to add them, I wanted to do it \"right\".\n\nNoticed is the gem I created to handle notifications for Rails apps. You can define all your notifications and organize the logic needed to deliver them in one place. They can be delivered to many different delivery methods, each running in their own background job. This allows you to handle failures gracefully without duplicates.\n\nI wanted this gem to be easy to customize, so we've tried to add all the features you'd want out of the box. Give it a try and let me know what you think!"
