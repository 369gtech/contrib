title: 'OML feature highlight: OML Services on Autonomous for Model Deployment'
language: English
recordingDate: 1615951398
description: "We learned about and saw a live demo of a new feature of Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database:  Oracle Machine Learning Services.\n\nOML Services extends OML functionality to support model deployment and model lifecycle management for both in-database OML models and third-party Open Neural Networks Exchange (ONNX) machine learning models via REST APIs.  \n\nThe REST API for Oracle Machine Learning Services provides REST API endpoints hosted on Oracle Autonomous Database. These endpoints enable the storage of machine learning models along with its metadata, and the creation of scoring endpoints for the model.  \n\nThese third-party classification or regression models can be built using tools that support the ONNX format, which includes packages like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, among several others.\n\nIn addition, OML Services supports proprietary cognitive text capabilities, with capabilities for topic discovery, keywords, summary, sentiment, and feature extraction. The initial languages supported include English, Spanish, and French (based on a Wikipedia knowledgebase using embeddings).\n\nOML Services cognitive image functionality, supported through the ONNX format third-party model deployment feature, supports scoring using images or tensors.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
