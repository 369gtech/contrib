description: 'When embracing microservice architectures and agile methodologies, we need to adapt our work habits in a modern and lightweight way. In this talk, we present the tools and practices that we use in our daily business to design, discuss, document and integrate REST APIs. In a quick journey, we show how this material supports us from inception up to a fully defined API. The demo is based on real APIs of current projects at the Swiss Post and relies on a swagger-based toolchain provided as open source by the Swiss Post. Keywords: contract-first, formal definition, documentation, code generation.'
