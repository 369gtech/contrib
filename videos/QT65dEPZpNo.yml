description: "LISA16 - TTL of a Penetration\n\nBranson Matheson, Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\nIn the world of information security, it's not a matter of how anymore...it’s a matter of when. With the advent of penetration tools such as Metaspolit, AutoPwn, etc.—plus the day-to-day use of insecure operating systems, applications, and Web sites—reactive systems have become more important than proactive systems. Discovery of penetration by out-of-band processes and being able to determine the when and how to then mitigate the particular attack has become a stronger requirement than active defense. I will discuss the basic precepts of this idea and expand with various types of tools that help resolve the issue. Attendees should be able to walk away from this discussion and apply the knowledge immediately within their environment.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
