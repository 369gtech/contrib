description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nAndrea Spina, Software Engineer, & Francesco Frontera, Software Developer at Radicalbit \n \nFlink-JPMML: An open source Flink library for Streaming Machine Learning Model Serving\n\nFlink-JPMML is a Flink based open source project aimed to fast, dynamic and distributed Machine Learning model serving. The library serves any model based on the Predictive Mark-up Model Language standard and it offers a predictive, extensible and handsomely ease-to-use operator, which allows the users to deploy multiple models for streaming predictions. Along the talk we will describe the main features of the project, we will focus the advantages and we will discuss what Flink-JPMML still needs, in order to set itself as the valuable solution to any model serving scenario. In conclusion, we will provide a live demo as demonstration of what has been presented.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-berlin-2017-andrea-spina-francesco-frontera-flinkjpmml-an-open-source-flink-library-for-streaming-machine-learning-model-serving\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
