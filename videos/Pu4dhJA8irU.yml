description: "PyData NYC/Miami/Philly joint virtual meetup - August 13, 2020\n\nGPUs are notoriously difficult, but they don’t have to be. We’re going to go over BlazingSQL (BSQL) & RAPIDS, a Pythonic ecosystem for accelerating and scaling data science workloads through the usage of GPUs.\nBlazingSQL & RAPIDS packages mirror many popular Python APIs, and provide a quick and convenient onramp to coding on GPUs in a matter of minutes. The ecosystem consists of a variety of packages that span a wide gamut of workloads including ETL (SQL, pandas), machine learning, deep learning, graph, visualization, and more, but accelerated on GPUs, and capable of scaling up to massive datasets.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll go over the overall ecosystem and its components before diving into live demos. We’ll provide attendees with access to a free GPU Python environment, so you can follow along from home as we run through a series of workflows, from querying raw data to visualizing it and running some machine learning algorithms. Most of these data sets will be in the millions of rows. The free environments won’t support this, but we’ll also demonstrate some TB-scale workloads and interactive SQL on a remote terabyte data set.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
