recordingDate: 1316661889
description: "There's never been a better time to reconsider transparency and talk about strategic leaking. In this talk, Michael Nelson—whose career has taken him from the White House to the boardrooms of the Fortune 500—looks at the naked corporation and what information can do when it flows intentionally between companies and their ecosystems.\n\nHis new report for the CSC Leading Edge Forum Research examines how radical transparency can be a powerful business tool, with companies sharing the previously unthinkable—salary, pricing, project roadmaps, and more.\n\nMichael Nelson\n\nLeading Edge Forum, CSC\n\nDr Michael Nelson is a Research Associate for the Leading Edge Forum.
