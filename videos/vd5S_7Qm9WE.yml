description: "Original title: “Everything as a stream!”: how we’re embracing functional reactive programming to build a large SPA\n\nThis talk will present why we chose functional reactive programming to solve most things in our SPA - state management, side-effects and reasoning about complex data flows. RxJS is an extremely flexible and powerful library that allows you to work with streams of data. It has given us the flexibility needed to decouple a monolith, spaghetti-code application mid-flight, but with great power comes responsibility - and a lot of pitfalls. We'll reflect on the challenges we're facing as we utilize RxJS’ implementation of Observables and the patterns that have emerged."
