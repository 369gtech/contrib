description: "Full Title: Top 10 Lessons learned in search projects the past 10 years\n\nMore: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/top-10-lessons-learned-search-projects-past-10-years\n\nOne of the things I like, working as a consultant, is working on different challenges, find parallels between the various solutions, and learn a lot along the way. I worked for customers among the most prominent e-commerce, travel, and food industries in The Netherlands. In this talk, I want to share the top 10 lessons learned from doing search projects at these customers for the past ten years. Without giving away spoilers, the lessons vary in areas like organizational structure, KPIs, technology, content, and user experience. After the talk, you have some ideas and inspirations for improvements to your search projects."
