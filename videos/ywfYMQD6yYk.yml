description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotai.io on May 31st in Paris. More talks on https://www.dotconferences.com/talks\n\nAurelien explains how you can combine Knowledge Graphs and Deep Learning to dramatically improve Search & Discovery systems. By using a combination of signals (audiovisual content, title & description and context), it is possible to find the main topics of a video. These topics can then be used to improve recommendations, search, structured browsing, ads, and much more."
