description: "Modern IoT solutions have to process telemetry data in real-time and provide actionable intelligence. Come join us as we walk through a complete IoT solution from start to finish.\n\nWe’ll start with exploring how telemetry is ingested into the cloud, followed by performing data analysis using a lambda based architecture. From there we’ll sprinkle in serverless compute, natural language processing, and bots just to round it out."
