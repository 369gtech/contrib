description: '005 A good idea when we want to style tags is to make them more unique so it''ll be easier to write a CSS selector to target them. When we write the CSS selector it''s easier to read if we use all lowercase and hyphen to separate words instead of spaces. In order to replicate the design to pixel perfect, we want to pay attention to the sizes an element has as well as distances in relation to the surroundings.'
