title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: CSS-in-JS: unexpected lessons for Drupal component design'
recordingDate: 1506528160
description: "Are you scared of your CSS? Did your site's CSS grow from a small bundle into a gigantic monster with flailing arms tattooed with \".view-id-articles .views-row .node-type-article\"? If you tried to refactor using component-based design, you likely couldn't discover which old rulesets could be safely deleted.\n\nBuilding proper CSS components in Drupal is hard. And Drupal 8 does not provide any good examples of how to build them.\n\nSurprisingly, CSS-in-JS projects offer many good lessons we can use in Drupal. While early CSS-in-JS projects used JavaScript objects to inject inline styles into HTML, the newest CSS-in-JS projects help solve thorny front-end problems, including:\n\nPreventing unused CSS\nCreating accurate component structure with no effort\nScoping styles to local HTML instead of globally\nPreventing styles bleeding to nested components\nDiscovering critical CSS\nSeparating concerns: splitting data preparation from markup/styles\nIn this session, we'll investigate examples of styled-components, a recent React-based project, and discuss how to get similar results using Twig in Drupal.\n\nAttendees will only need very basic JavaScript and Twig knowledge."
