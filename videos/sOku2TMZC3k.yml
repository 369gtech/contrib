description: "Lightning Talk: PID Autoscaling Strava's Linkerd Service Mesh Using Prometheus Data - J Evans, Strava \n\nStrava’s traffic fluctuates alongside our athletes’ weekly exercise habits. Our service infrastructure must dynamically scale to meet constantly changing demands efficiently and cost effectively. This is becoming increasingly important as we augment our ensemble of microservices to provide our community with a richer feature set. In this presentation, J Evans will describe how Strava leverages Linkerd, and its seamless integrations into open source monitoring tools, to maintain observability and enforce consistency throughout their service mesh. Specifically, he will demonstrate how Strava uses Prometheus to aggregate metrics at the control plane (Linkerd) and application layer to fine tune a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) auto scaling system capable of maintaining high resource utilization across the Strava platform. \n\nTo Learn More:  https://sched.co/GrVb"
