This is the talk for you!\n\nThis talk explains how to send patches to Kotlin (mainly Kotlin plugin) repository as an external contributor.\n\nThe expected audience should know the following:\n* Git/GitHub\n* Kotlin syntax\n\nThe expected outlines are the following:\n* Setup development environment\n* Communicating with other developers\n* Developing one of Kotlin plugin features\n* Implementing unit tests\n* Sending a pull request\n\nAfter this talk, you will be ready to send pull requests to one of the best computer languages in the world!\n\nI (shiraji @ GitHub) started my career as a Java developer in 2007. From 2015, I began to contribute to Android/iOS libraries and Intellij plugins. When I read PermissionsDispatcher, which is one of best Android runtime permission libraries, I met Kotlin. Sooner or later, I fell in love with Kotlin. Because I really love it, since July 2016, I have been contributing Kotlin."
