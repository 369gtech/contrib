title: 'YOW! 2015 - Matt Heath - Building Microservice Architectures in Go'
recordingDate: 1451554099
description: "Moving to a microservice architecture and embracing a cloud native approach is a complex challenge, which often requires re-evaluating our approach to technology. Having previously helped transition Hailo to a new microservice platform, built almost entirely in Go, Matt leverages modern technologies and a microservice based approach to build reliable platforms which can scale to millions of users. This talk will cover how to develop and migrate to a microservice based architecture using Go, common pitfalls to avoid, and lessons learnt when developing high volume, low latency, distributed applications.\n\nMatt Heath specialises in back-end architecture, distributed systems and cloud infrastructure having previously worked as the Technical Lead of Hailoâ€™s global platform. Using a number of languages including Go, and the latest distributed database and messaging technologies, Matt helps businesses develop platforms to scale their teams and technology.\n\nFor more on YOW!
