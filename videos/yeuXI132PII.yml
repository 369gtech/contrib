A common pattern is to feed a user event stream into a processing engine, show the result to the user, capture feedback from the user, push the feedback back into the event stream, and so on. The quality of the result shown to the user is often a function of the amount of data in the event stream, so the more your event stream scales, the better you can serve your users.\n\nMessaging systems have recently started to push into the field of long term data storage and event stores, where you cannot compromise on retention. If data is written to the system, it must stay there.Infinite retention can be challenging for a messaging system. As data grows for a single topic, you need to start storing different parts of the backlog on different sets of machines without losing consistency. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/channel/JUMjvCF2ucj"
