description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Chicago 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nHanna Prinz - Co-Author of \"Service Mesh\" & Consultant at INNOQ\nEberhard Wolff - Co-Author of \"Service Mesh\" & Fellow at INNOQ\n\nABSTRACT\nService meshes like Istio and Linkerd 2 solve many problems of current microservice applications. They add observability, routing, resilience, and security features as a dedicated infrastructure layer. Communication between applications can be monitored, configured and secured without adding or changing application code.\nSounds too good to be true? Indeed, a service mesh does not come without a price: mental complexity, increased resource consumption, and latency being the main challenges. We will talk about meaningful use cases for service meshes, drawbacks, and differences between the various implementations [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:25 What is a service mesh?
