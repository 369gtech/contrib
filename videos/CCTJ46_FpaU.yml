The Google Drive SDK allows applications to store and retrieve files from Google Drive, and also to deeply integrate an app into the Google Drive user interface. This webinar introduces development for Google Drive using the Google Drive SDK.  We will discuss OAuth 2.0, how files are organized in Google Drive, and how to perform the most basic read and write operations on files in Google Drive.'
