description: "There's lots of talks about how to write a single piece of software in node, but fewer about how to architect whole systems based on node. This talk is about Service Oriented Architecture, a design pattern that works really well for node. It covers what it is, and how to do it well, using npm's own architecture as a case study.\n\nhttp://forwardjs.com/\nhttps://newcircle.com/"
