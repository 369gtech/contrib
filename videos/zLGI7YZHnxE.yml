title: 'Roman Bugaev â€“ Design for failure'
recordingDate: 1468411283
description: 'Assume that your hardware will fail, disaster will strike your application, your system will be overloaded with more requests than expected, and outages will occur. By being a pessimist, you end up thinking about failure during design time, which results in a better system overall. Designing for failure does not mean that you cannot have a catastrophic failure. However, it does mean that failures no longer matter as much as they used to. Come and learn how to deal with failures like a pro!'
