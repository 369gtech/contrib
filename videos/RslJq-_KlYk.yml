description: "Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16n4YFCcP6Ko8eHCX4-fhZbKo8or_FeKkgzxjeQBfYlI/edit?usp=sharing\n\nRx is implementation of two paradigms: Reactive Programming and Functional Programming. It is not new but got popular after Angular implementation was based on it. JavaScript version is creation of Ben Lesh - Main Architect at Netflix now working with Angular Team.\n\nThinking reactively opens new world of possibilities. Makes us understand that we were a bit lied off by technology and bringing streams back home. I will show you concepts and ideas behind it and explain why it may make ours everyday code easier.\n\nWill it have own place at JavaScript scene and in yours lines of code?\n\n---\n\nConFrontJS 2018 - #Frontend #Conference in #Warsaw, Poland\nDate: 29 October 2018\nVenue: Campus Warsaw, Poland\n\n??
