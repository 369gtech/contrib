title: 'Fireside Chat #10: Difficult conversations'
language: English
recordingDate: 1629368419
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso, Mashooq Badar, and Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss how to deal with difficult conversations. There are multiple aspects that can make a conversation more or less difficult. Difficult conversations cannot always be avoided and there are many different skills involved in making them less difficult. In this episode, the conversation becomes a bit more difficult in the second half—pun intended—as they express different views on responsibilities and the attitude towards difficult conversations.  \n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
