title: 'Flexing your Biceps with Azure - William Liebenberg - NDC Syndey 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639559818
description: "No matter how hard we try, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) JSON templates arenâ€™t easy or fun to maintain for enterprise platforms and applications.\n\nNow we can flex our Infrastructure as Code (IaC) muscles using a new tool called Azure Bicep.\n\nAzure Bicep is a Domain Specific Language that puts the fun back into IaC development with a simpler syntax, better code reusability and modularity.\n\nIn this talk we are going start by exploring how Bicep works, how we use it, and compare it to other IaC options such as Terraform and Pulumi.\n\nWe will wrap up the talk with a live demo to deploy a full-stack application to Azure.\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/"
