description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCloud Native Security Lexicon - Ragashree M C, Nokia\n\nIdentity, credentials, and secrets, oh my! Making sense of all these security terms in a cloud native world can be confusing, especially with a vast array of tooling as expansive as the cloud native landscape. You may have found yourself talking past colleagues as certain security terms are overused, catch-all umbrellas, or even incorrectly presented. How do you know what secrets actually mean? What about secret store? This talk will help define commonly used terms in the cloud native security landscape and provide details on the usage and understanding of how they fit into software development and the corresponding operational environment"
