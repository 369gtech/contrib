recordingDate: 1322597704
description: "It is safe to say that the digital age has fundamentally changed all our lives. Certainly, it has given us the ability to share more information with more people (and more companies) than ever before. The explosion of personal information is fueling new data-driven business models, calling into question how we think about what's private and what's public. In this webcast, a leading group of privacy panelists explore how the line between private and public is blurring:\n\nThe evolution of the public (versus private) persona.\nThe upsides and downsides of living a more transparent life.\nWhat our expectation of privacy should be in the digital age and what responsibilities companies have to protect personal information.\n\nJoin the panelists as they consider the evolution from private to public: how are our worlds colliding in the digital age?"
