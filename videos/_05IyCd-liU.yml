description: "When it comes to distributing content globally every project is different and is facing various challenges. EF Education First is an international education company that specializes in language training. A majority of their offering is published on the website which consists of multiple thousand web pages. As a global language training institute you can imagine that the content needs to be translated as well. With translations in 52 languages the build times for such projects become a critical issue in the content delivery pipeline. We invited Education First to tell us how they solved this problem with help of Next.js, Vercel and Storyblok, a headless CMS. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) from Next.js cut the build time to generate an updated output from hours to a few minutes. In this talk, youâ€™ll learn how to enable ISR in a headless project setup and see the difference in build times first hand.\n\nArisa Fukuzaki\nDeveloper Relations Engineer at Storyblok"
