title: 'Taking the printf out of printf Debugging - Mats Cronqvist'

recordingDate: 1375690470
description: "Budapest Erlang Factory Lite 2013\nhttp://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/Budapest2013/talks\n\nDebugging a realtime system is hard, especially if the bugs only appear on a live system. Debuggers cannot be used, and printf debugging is often deemed too risky. The Erlang runtime offers a way to do on-the-fly instrumentation on the function level through the erlang:trace/3 function.\nThis talk will discuss the trace BIF and how to use it. It will also describe redbug, a user-friendly and safe interface to the trace BIF. War stories will in all likelihood be offered."
