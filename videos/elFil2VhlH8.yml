title: 'Why and How we fixed std::thread by std::jthread - Nicolai Josuttis [ C++ on Sea 2020 ]'
language: English
recordingDate: 1596049211
description: "With C++20 we will have a new basic thread class, std::jthread. It will fix some basic flaws of std::thread, because std::thread was not designed as an easy-to-use RAII type and lacks support for stopping a running thread.\n\nSounds easy: we only have to pass a parameter to signal cancellation and implement a destructor that performs this request before it joins. But regarding concurrency, nothing is easy in programming. The devil is in the details, especially in C++.\n\nSo this is not a talk about jthread. It is a talk about how implementing a pretty simple additional concurrent requirement became a tricky task with many traps. You don't want to do it yourself.\n\n-------\n\nNicolai Josuttis (www.josuttis.com) is well known in the C++ Community for speaking and writing with authority about C++ (being the author of \"The C++ Standard Library\", \"C++ Templates\" (coauthor), and \"C+++17 - The Complete Guide\") but is also an innovative presenter. He is an active member of C++ standardization committee for more than 20 years now.\n\n-------\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
