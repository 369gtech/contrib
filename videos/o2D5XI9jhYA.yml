description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nDeep Dive: Brigade - Matt Butcher & Kent Rancourt, Microsoft \n\nIn this session, we will explore the Brigade architecture, and how it is built to chain together containers and share data between them. We will deep dive on how external events are routed and transformed into jobs, and how Brigade uses JavaScript for more complex scripting and error handling, and differentiate itself to enable scenarios that are extremely difficult to achieve in a purely declarative framework. In the end, we will take a look at how to build custom event gateways, and have a look at the future roadmap. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uafl"
