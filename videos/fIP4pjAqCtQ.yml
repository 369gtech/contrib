description: "ES6 Modules are now supported in all major modern browsers. By using the platform and building native, well-supported, modular code, you can benefit from speedier engineering cycles—no compile steps required during development. In this video, Sam Thorogood details the architectural patterns that enable you to use ES6 Modules for your webapp or experience, regardless of framework—including shipping modern code to modern browsers (fast!) while still compiling down to an older baseline for the long tail.\n\nCheck out the rest of the Polymer Summit session videos here: https://goo.gl/KuiAXd\nSubscribe to the Google Chrome Developers channel: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
