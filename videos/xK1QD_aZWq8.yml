description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nBuild an Automatic Canary Release Pipeline in a Kubernetes-native Way - Ying Chun Guo, IBM \n\nTekton and Knative are two Kubernetes-native open source projects to extend Kubernetes capabilities. They have defined a series of powerful and flexible Kubernetes objects, in order to build CI/CD pipeline, to create event driven flows, and to manage serverless applications. This presentation will introduce and demonstrate how Tekton and Knative collaborate seamlessly to build an automatic canary release pipeline in a Kubernetes-native way.  In this session, you will learn how to monitor CI/CD events with Knative Eventing, how to extract information from events payloads and feed these information into a CI/CD pipeline with Tekton Trigger, how to define a k8s-style pipeline to build and deploy serverless applications with Tekton Pipeline, how to manage traffics with Knative Serving, and more importantly, how these components work together to build the automatic canary release pipeline.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeie"
