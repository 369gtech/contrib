description: "Catch has gained popularity over the last six years as a modern, C++-native, test framework. Simple to use, easy to get started with, yet still powerful.\nUntil recently, though, it has been constrained by pre-C++11 compatibility.\nCatch2 rebases on C++11 and takes advantage of this to simplify further, as well as offer new capabilities.\nThis talk takes a look at what's new in Catch and Catch2 and how to effectively test-drive modern C++ codebases.\n\nFamiliarity with the original Catch is not assumed, but we'll concentrate more on what's new and things that were not covered before, as videos of my previous Catch talks are available online (see http://levelofindirection.com/appearances)."
