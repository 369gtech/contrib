title: 'Agile Adria 2013 keynote / Gojko Adzic: Make Impacts Not Software'
recordingDate: 1371860141
description: 'Software is everywhere today, and countless software products and projects die a slow death without ever making any impact. Today''s planning and roadmap techniques expect the world to stand still while we deliver, and set products and projects up for failure from the very start. Even when they have good strategic plans, many organisations fail to communicate them and align everyone involved in delivery. The result is a tremendous amount of time and money wasted due to wrong assumptions, lack of focus, poor communication of objectives, lack of understanding and misalignment with overall goals. There has to be a better way to deliver! Gojko presents a possible solution, impact mapping, an innovative strategic planning method that can help you make an impact with software.'
