description: 'Payments projects run the gamut in terms of complexity, and if you’ve done one before, you know they can quickly get out of hand. Doing the right up-front research can be the difference between a reasonably smooth project and a total disaster zone. This will be a fun, practical talk about setting payments projects up for success from day one, covering everything from researching the legacy systems that have to be integrated with, to wrangling partner API’s, to building internal alliances with departments like accounting.'
