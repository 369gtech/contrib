title: 'Rolling-out like a Rock-Star by Nicola Corti'
recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "Rolling-out a feature is a fine art.\n\nUsers are becoming more and more demanding. A single crash could entice them away from your app (and land a shameful 1-star review).\n\nIn this context, the possibility of remote controlling your app is a key tool. First, it can protect you against crashes and incidents. Moreover, it can help you experiment on the user experience to fit your usersâ€™ tastes.\n\nAt Spotify, feature rollout and experimentation are at the foundation of our development. We deliver daily more than a thousand feature flags on a variety of different apps (Android, iOS, and more).\n\nTo achieve this, we built an in-house solution to support our experimentation needs. Throughout the years we collected a series of learnings, success stories and pitfalls. In this talk, I will share some of them. Afterwards, you will be able to set the stage for a flawless rollout.\n\nNicola Corti, Spotify\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
