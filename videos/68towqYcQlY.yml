recordingDate: 1574686802
description: "ASP.NET Core is the web side of .NET Core development. Under this umbrella are three major components - Razor Pages, MVC, Blazor, and API. All of these project types can co-exist in the same website without an issue, yet they all fill a different role. In this video, we are going to look at Razor pages, the quickest and easiest way to create a powerful server-side web application in C#. We will look at how to set a project up, how to capture and display data, and how to deploy it.\n\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=razor-pages\nMailing List: https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nApplication Lifecycle Design: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/application-lifecycle-design\nGetting Started with .NET Core: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/getting-started-with-net-core\nFoundation in C#: Data Access: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/foundation-in-c-data-access\nIntro to Azure DevOps: https://youtu.be/H-R2bCXfz8I\nLogging in .NET Core 3.0: https://youtu.be/oXNslgIXIbQ"
