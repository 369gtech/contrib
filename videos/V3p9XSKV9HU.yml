description: "Speaker: Kenneth Poon\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up on a talk Kenneth gave back in 2016 (XCUITest + Gherkins). With the basics of XCUITest out of the way, he will introduce the Cucumberish library that helps to improve your existing XCUITest suite.\r\nCucumberish segment will interest you if\r\n- you want to know how \"Given Then When\" Behavioural Driven Tests can help your iOS Tests\r\n- you are interested in executing \"Given Then When\" BDD Feature files in Xcode\r\n- you are not convinced with external cross platform testing tool like Appium and Calabash (because you want to write your tests using Swift)\r\n- you want to bring this learning back to work. Feel free to ask more questions during QnA\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-iOS-Dev-Scout-Meetup/events/248696709/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Vina and Kheng Meng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/gGmC/"
