description: "Gaining Insights of your Microservices with Elastic APM - Jenny Morris & Stephen Brown, Elastic\n\nIn this talk, we will introduce the first major open-source APM, Elastic APM, and discuss its capabilities of end-to-end monitoring: Real User Monitoring, Application-level monitoring, Cloud Foundry platform monitoring and other logging/metrics. An application composed of interconnected, autonomous microservices will be used to demonstrate latency tracking, root cause analysis and anomaly detection.\n\nWhile traditional APM tools let you monitor the application performance metrics of their microservices running in Cloud Foundry, Elastic APM allows you to cross reference and correlate the platform logs and metrics to get a holistic view of your systems or business. This consolidated view of your systems lets you spot, debug and fix issues quicker.\n\nAbout Stephen Brown\nStephen Brown is a Sr. Principal Solutions Architect at Elastic. He came up through the software engineering ranks and ended up as Vice President of Software Engineering at the data and analytics company CoreLogic where he built a core dev team as part of the Innovations Labs to deliver cloud native apps and services on top of Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Now at Elastic he gets to indulge in his some of his favorite pastimesâ€¦ brewing a tasty cup of espresso and ingesting, analyzing and visualizing interesting data sets.\n\nAbout Jenny Morris\nJenny Morris has years of Java and .NET experience across various industries. She is currently a Solution Architect at Elastic helping customers gain real-time, actionable insights from their data. Consequently, customers have become industry leaders on searching, logging, analyzing and performance monitoring their applications and data. Jenny has been involved with many speaking engagements including Meetup talks, non-profit organization classes, CF Summit 2018 keynote and breakout sessions and a GraphConnect 2018 breakout session. Topics vary from Spring/.NET subjects, to Cloud Foundry subjects, to Functions and Graph databases.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
