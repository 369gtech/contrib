description: "Be prepared to challenge your preexisting perspectives of technical leadership as we explore non-traditional approaches and techniques in these immersive, hands-on workshops and presentations.\n\nYou will be required to step outside your comfort zone as you share personal experiences and discuss challenging topics such as: giving feedback, working with different communication styles, facilitating effective (non-awkward) 1:1s, practicing authenticity, empowering developers to reach their full potential, and establishing powerful and bullet-proof morning routines to maximize your busy schedules.\n\nKate Wardin is a currently a Senior Engineering Manager at Target Corporation in Minneapolis, MN.  She leads a team of amazing engineers who build front end applications for Supply Chain HQ and Field users.  \n\nOutside of her day job, she enjoys organizing events that enable young women to develop a passion and build confidence for future careers in technology.  \n\nShe also enjoys disrupting the norms of traditional leadership by spending time researching, testing out, and advocating for various techniques to tenaciously put developers first."
