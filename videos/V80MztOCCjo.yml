title: 'Testing Java Microservices: From Development to Production by Abraham Marin-Perez  & Daniel Bryant'
language: English
recordingDate: 1557993463
description: "Testing microservices is challenging. Dividing a system into components (Ã  la microservices) naturally creates inter-component dependencies, and each service has its own performance and fault-tolerance characteristics that need to be validated during development, the QA process, and continually in production. Attend this session to learn about the theory, techniques, and practices needed to overcome this challenge.\n\nJoin us, and:\n\nGet an introduction to the challenges of testing distributed microservice systems\nLearn how to isolate tests within a complex microservice ecosystem\nHear about several tools for automating vulnerability and security scanning for code, dependencies, and deployment artifacts"
