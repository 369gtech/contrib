title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode IoT Village - Denise Bilic, Cecilia Pastorino - Vulnerabilities in Smart Sex Toys'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597623803
description: "Smart sex toys are a huge topic – and we’re not talking about their size! The Internet of Things (IoT) has triggered many personal items to become connected and smart, watches, toothbrushes, glasses and even toilets, to name just a few. The adult toy market has not been left behind with new models of toys that include the opportunity to connect them to the Internet and allow them to be remotely controlled.\nIoT devices and their vulnerabilities are frequently discussed in the media, and sex toys are not the exception. Many of them have holes in them. Keep focused, we mean holes and bugs in the software. This is despite the sensitivity of the extremely personal information they handle.\nWe analyzed the security of the Android applications that control the most frequently purchased models of connected sexual pleasure devices, to determine the extent to which the confidentiality of user data could be vulnerable. Our research revealed interesting security flaws derived from both the implementation of the application and the design of the device, affecting the storage and processing of information.\nIf you’re one of the many users who have a smart sex toy connected to the internet, or plan to buy one, you cannot miss this talk, it may have you shaking in your seat. Our presentation may make you reconsider connecting it ever again or not purchasing one at all."
