description: 'Streaming is all the rage in the data space, but can stream processing be used to build business systems? Do Streaming and Microservices actually have anything in common? These are the questions we’ll explore in this talk by looking at how real-world Streaming Microservices are actually built. We''ll explore how services collaborate using events instead of traditional REST calls. We''ll take this idea a step further using Kafka’s Streams API: embedding the ability to join and process data right inside our services. Finally we''ll build a fictitious system, from the ground up, using these tools and techniques, bridging the sync-async divide to form bounded contexts separated by an asynchronous, event-driven core.'
