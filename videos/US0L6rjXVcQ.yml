description: "\"Tools of the Trade: The Making of a Code Editor.\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - Singapore]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Nicholas Tollervey\n\nThis talk tells the story of Mu, a native code editor written in Python (https://codewith.mu/).\n\nOne Sunday afternoon I foolishly asked myself, \"\"How hard can it be to write a simple code editor?\"\" Several years later an international team of volunteers are still working on the project. We have had to address:\n\n\nCross platform GUI development.\nCross platform packaging solutions for Python.\nCreating an interactive visual debugger.\nIntegrating with iPython notebook.\nIntegrating with various IoT MicroPython devices.\nIntegrating with frameworks such as PyGame/PyGameZero and Flask.\nAutomating cross platform testing.\nResearching and testing UX with a challenging user base.\nAccessibility for all.\nInternationalisation.\nCreating an inclusive, welcoming and supportive community.\n\n\nThis talk will explain why Mu was created, how Mu was created and, most importantly, shares the decision making, technical research and implementation details of Mu in the hope others can learn from our mistakes, mis-steps and muck-ups.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
