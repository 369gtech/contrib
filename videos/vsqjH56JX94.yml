title: 'Oracle Machine Learning for Spark'
language: English
recordingDate: 1582321359
description: "We saw how Oracle Machine Learning for Spark offers interfaces to run Machine Learning algorithms on top of Data Lakes, using Spark to distribute computation across Nodes, and brings integration with the Big Data ecosystem that allows for manipulation tables in HIVE and Impala, as well as integration with HDFS and the Oracle Database, using the R language as front-end. \n\nIt makes the open source R scripting language and environment ready for the enterprise and big data. Designed for problems involving both large and small volumes of data, Oracle Machine Learning for Spark integrates R with Data Lakes, allowing users to execute R commands and scripts for data processing, statistical and machine learning analytics on HIVE, IMPALA, Spark DataFrame tables and views using R and Spark SQL syntax. Many familiar R functions are overloaded and translate R functions into SQL for in-Data Lake execution. \n\nOracle Machine Learning consists of complementary components supporting scalable machine learning algorithms for in-database and big data environments (including Cloud and on-premises), notebook technology, SQL, Python and R APIs, and Hadoop/Spark environments.\n\nThe Slides used in the presentation can be found in the Resources section below.\n\nVideo highlights: \n04:50  Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for Spark\n07:10 Oracle Machine Learning for Spark integration\n09:56 OML4Spark R language API\n11:40 OML4Spark performance benchmark\n13:55 OML4Spark benefits for Spark MLlib on users on R\n17:20  Demo - Manipulating HDFS data\n22:00 Demo - Manipulating HIVE, IMPALA and Spark DataFrames\n36:48 Demo - Using OML4Spark ML models to predict Bike Demand\n43:45 Demo - OML4Spark Cross-Validation and Classification Model Selection \n47:54 Demo - Benchmark of OML4Spark GLM Logistic on 100mi records\n49:26 - OML4Spark Roadmap\n51:09 - Q&A"
