To succeed in creating totally new services and rethinking old ones, we must first adopt fresh thinking about the design process, and how sensors and algorithms are driving significant changes in what is possible. At the same time, we mustn’t become enamored with technology, but must remember to keep the user at the center. We may be entering the Internet of Things, but the real breakthroughs come when we make it an Internet of Things and Humans.\n\nAbout Tim O'Reilly (O'Reilly Media):\nTim O’Reilly is the founder and CEO of O’Reilly Media.
