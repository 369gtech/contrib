description: "Join us for a hands-on webcast where Tynan Sylvester author of Designing Games will discuss design in the language of logic. Designers are humans, not computers. Our emotions can drive us to glory, but they can also lead us astray in a thousand ways. This talk covers a personal view on the interplay between the designers' feelings and the design process.\n\nAbout Tynan Sylvester\n\nTynan Sylvester has been designing games for 12 years. During that time he has worked on everything from independently produced games to the big-studio blockbuster BioShock Infinite.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
