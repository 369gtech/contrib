recordingDate: 1367441100
description: "Callback Hell is a very real place. At least, according to Michael Jackson, co-founder of HUM, it is. But stay calm! In this presentation, Michael and his co-presenter\nDomenic Denicola, Software Engineer at Lab49, will walk you through all the steps required to avoid this dark and mysterious place.\n\nInstead of simply throwing together a clunky example, and a solution to a very specific case, Michael and Domenic dive deeper into more conceptual problems. How did we get to \"callback hell\" and what can we do it avoid it next time? This helpful demonstration covers handy tips about Promises and strategies for building fully asynchronous APIs in JavaScript.\n\n**Follow along with Michael and Domenic's slides: http://mrkn.co/lb0t1"
