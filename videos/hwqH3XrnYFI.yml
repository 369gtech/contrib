description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nTHIS IS NOT ABOUT CODING ANYMORE\nMarcos Holgado, Senior Android Developer, DuckDuckGo\n\nWe live in a world dominated by computers and mobile phones. Everywhere you look there is a software system behind. We are the developers who build these systems and applications but, are we taking into account the consequences of what we build?\n\nIn this talk we will have a look at some of the problems our profession is facing and what we can do about them. We will cover topics such as privacy, ethics, accessibility, the environment and how can we improve the Android community. There is a long way ahead of us and we need you! Now is the time to make important decisions! The time for just coding is over!\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/droidcon-italy\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
