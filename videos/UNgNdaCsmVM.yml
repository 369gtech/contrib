description: "Dissecting a completely Functional -Reactive JavaScript app for the very first time. Today we have the ability to write fully Functional-Reactive code in JavaScript, using RxJS. However, in our day-to-day life we often use RxJS alongside other libraries and patterns that make our life easier, but also distance us from pure Functional-Reactive Programming (FRP). What would an app that has been written completely in RxJS, and in-line with the principles of FRP, look like?\n\nIn this talk we will examine such an app, and use it to understand what truly functional-reactive code in JavaScript looks like, and what are the principles that underlie it.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/NettaBondy/like-a-surgeon-dissecting-a-completely-functional-reactive-javascript-app-for-the-very-first-time-1\n\nYGLF 2019: Code Camp Blog, Netta Bondy:\nhttps://www.israel.yglfconf.com/post/meet-the-speaker-netta-bondy"
