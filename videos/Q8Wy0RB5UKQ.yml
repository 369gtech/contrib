title: 'Jim Crist: Introducting Dask-Gateway: Dask clusters as a service | PyData Austin 2019'

description: "\"Dask has become a standard tool for parallelizing computational Python work, scaling from laptops to distributed clusters. Its compatibility with a wide variety of computing environments has been a major strength, allowing users to easily deploy on everything from Kubernetes to traditional HPC systems. New backends can be added by implementing a standard cluster interface, which then plays well with the rest of the Dask ecosystem.\n\nWhile this design has served us well, there are a few pain points that have come up when using Dask at larger institutions. Some of these issues could be remedied by changes to the existing deployment design, but many of them required something new. We believe that something is Dask-Gateway.\"\n\nDask-Gateway provides a secure, multi-tenant server for managing Dask clusters. It allows users to launch and use Dask clusters in a shared, centrally managed environment, and supports a wide variety of backends (e.g. Kubernetes, Hadoop, HPC systems, etcâ€¦). In this talk we'll discuss the use and design of Dask-Gateway, as well as some of the issues we encountered while developing this tool.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
