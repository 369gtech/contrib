description: "Did you know that you can integrate voice search in your Android app by adding just a few lines? For example, users can now say to the Google app: “Ok Google, search Hawaiian pizza on Eat24”, “Ok Google, search for hotels in Maui on TripAdvisor” or “Ok Google, search for Hawaiian Music on TuneIn” thanks to Google Now Actions.  Google Now Actions allow you to take advantage of Google’s speech recognition technology to understand natural language, and turn it into Android intents delivered to your app. \n\nTry the codelab: http://g.co/dev/codelab-voicesearch and learn more at http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html#Search. \n\nIf you’d like to explore recent advances in speach recognition technology, also check out “Behind the Mic: The Science of Talking with Computers”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxxRAHVtafI."
