description: "Peer to peer chat without using a server? We can do this using Ethereum's whisper library. This is a chat protocol that lets nodes chat with each other directly, no need for a central server. It doesn't even use a centralized routing source to let nodes discover each other like BitTorrent does with trackers, instead it uses a distributed hash table as a tool for decentralized peer discovery. Yes its not completely real-time, but the trade-off allows for true private chat. I'm going to explain how it works and code the demo at the end. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Decentralized_Chat\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
