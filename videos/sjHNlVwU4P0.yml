description: "Gulliver’s Travels In Cloud Foundry [I] - Kevin Rutten, Stark & Wayne   \n\nCloud Foundry is full of Giants. Clouds of thousands of servers and millions of apps. Imagine you could type one command and get a tiny Cloud Foundry deployed on AWS with Pipelines, services like PostgreSQL and Redis, monitoring, and even automated backups. The CF-Tiny project looks at all the steps required to create and provision the many parts for a production quality Cloud Foundry.\n\nIn this presentation, Kevin will discuss the “CloudCow” project. CloudCow pulls together Terraform to stand up an AWS IaaS, scripts to generate and deploy all the pieces for a tiny Cloud Foundry with services, and provides a complete Concourse pipeline to allow you to experiment and upgrade your Cloud Foundry. When you can quickly build a production like Cloud Foundry as easily as you can boot a VirtualBox BOSH Lite, work with it, and tear it down or grow it into production. Run a smaller Cloud Foundry for a smaller team or smaller budget.   \n\nKevin Rutten\nStark & Wayne\nCloud Engineer\nCanada\nTwitter Tweet  Websitehttps://starkandwayne.com\nKevin Rutten is an Electrical Engineering Technologist and Cloud Engineer in Canada.
