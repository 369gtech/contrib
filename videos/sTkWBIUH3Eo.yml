language: Russian
recordingDate: 1519655439
description: "Hash functions are regarded as an advanced topic, and designing one from scratch takes a PhD in Computer Science. However, everyone is using hash functions in their daily work, whether they know it or not.\n\nIn this talk we will showcase how anyone can take advantage of the properties of hash functions, without knowing the mathematics or implementation details, to build exciting applications that only hash functions allow. We will cover how to build a deduplicating file uploader, document similarity search engine, and combat online voting fraud. All in pure JavaScript, with a sprinkle of WASM for blazing fast performance, and heaps of demos so everyone can follow along."
