description: "DOES18 Las Vegas — We believe in bottom up over top down. We believe every team must find their own way towards DevOps These beliefs are incorporated in our change approach at ABN AMRO. ABN AMRO is the second largest bank in the Netherlands with more than 500 Agile teams. We are going to show you how we started a DevOps movement from the bottom up and how we enabled DevOps across different units. We will share our best practices and even the pitfalls that we came across. DevOps is all about learning. Let us help you cross the DevOps chasm.\n\nCrossing the DevOps Chasm: From Taboo to Enterprise DevOps\n\nMascha Boender, DevOps Consultant, ABN AMRO\nStefan Groot, IT Strategy Consultant, ABN AMRO\n\nMascha Boender is a DevOps consultant at ABN AMRO Bank and was nominated for the Female Young Talent Award in 2018.
