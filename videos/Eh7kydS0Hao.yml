Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nRunning Apache Samza on Kubernetes - Weiqing Yang, LinkedIn Corporation \n\nApache Samza is a distributed stream processing framework that allows you to process and analyze your data in real-time. It has been widely used at Linkedin and other companies on a large scale. Recently, we added Kubernetes as the new scheduler backend for Samza to run in distributed mode. In this talk, we will deep dive into the technical details about how Samza runs natively on Kubernetes by leveraging the primitives provided by Kubernetes for scheduling, storages, etc. We will also compare running Samza on Kubernetes with other existing solutions such as YARN and standalone mode. Finally, we will share some practices about running Kubernetes as a container orchestration framework for other big data processing engines. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uacc"
