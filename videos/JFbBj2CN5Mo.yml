description: "Let's build a simple HTTP server with Ruby by Esther Olatunde\n\nMany developers at some point in their programming career get curious about how HTTP servers work and how to build one from scratch without any external libraries.​Well, recently, I got curious about “How do HTTP servers work”? “How are HTTP servers built?” and “Can I build an HTTP server and client with Ruby without using any gems?“ And you know what, the answers are, yes, yes and yes!​We’ll explore how to build a simple http server using the Socket class available in the Ruby’s standard library. In the process, we will also get a crash course on how HTTP works.\n\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019 #rubyconf"
