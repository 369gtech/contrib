description: "Last year, I spent time creating large scale tech demos for live events to show off the power of Google’s G Suite. Tech demos show the power of technologies but are often very literal. The strongest way to cement information in a person’s mind is to provide it in the form of a story. So the twist used in this project was to use the actual tools themselves as an art canvas, a way to tell a story, all in the browser.\n\nThe final installation was a series of full screen browsers, up to 13’ across, animating Google Docs and Google Sheets, using live ASCII and colored cells on each, respectively. Even the engineers who built these tools were amazed when they got to see the final animations.\n\nAnd now, I will tell you the story of how it all happened by walking you through a case study of how a project like this comes to life. We’ll go from brainstorming and prototyping through a-ha moments and installation. When attendees leave, they will have an understanding of a) what goes into a physical installation running a web app, b) pushing the technical limitations of a product, and c) techniques for looking at a system as a storytelling tool instead of a purely production one.\n\nNote: I am not a Google employee, and this is not a pitch for Google or their products.\n\nPresenter\n\nJohn Brown is a Technical Director at Instrument in Portland, OR. He leads a team of developers doing experiential work and websites by day, and takes apart electronics to learn how they work at night. Turning data into art and combining code with the physical world are his biggest tech passions."
