recordingDate: 1433664081
description: "In this talk, we will cover the frameworks that Protractor relies on, including the Jasmine framework, Selenium and WebDriverJS. We'll compare Protractor E2E testing with Java E2E testing and talk about the impact the asynchronous WebDriver API has on our test code. As well, we'll show some techniques we can use to capture DOM elements in Angular apps and explain the Protractor synchronization mechanism that helps us avoid unnecessary Wait and Sleep methods calls.\n\nTalk by: Daniela Green."
