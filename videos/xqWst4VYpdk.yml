It is also in active use by the debconf video team. \n\nThis talk will explain the background in which it was written, and will also give a somewhat detailed explanation of its inner workings. \n\nFor an explanation of the detailed UI design work we did to the review page over the last year, see the companion talk in the open source design devroom. \n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:30:00+01"
