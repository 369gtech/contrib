Spring Boot was and is a massively successful open source offering that focuses on productivity and microservices. But with all framework choices, we must decide using a proper analysis of the trade offs. This is the Java talk that no vendor or developer advocate is allowed to give. This is a talk about the current landscape for Cloud Native Java applications that are built for event-driven architectures. We’ll be looking into how Apache Kafka and CQRS come alive using a tool named Eventuate, with a dissection of the trade offs and implementation details for Spring Boot, Quarkus, and Micronaut."
