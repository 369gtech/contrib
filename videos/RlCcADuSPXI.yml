title: 'GeeCON Prague 2018: Oleh Dokuka - Refactor to Reactive with Spring 5 and Reactor 3'
recordingDate: 1541257470
description: 'Are you Spring 4 Framework user? Have you ever had troubles with Reactive System? Have you ever gotten rid your whole existed codebase to make the high-throughput system? Have you ever feel the pain during migration? If yes, I have a good news for us, with Spring 5 and Reactor, development of Reactive System is a dream. During the talk, we will go through the central concepts for refactoring of Blocking, Non-Reactive Application to Reactive. We will cover techniques which will help us in the optimization of the system. In turn, we will apply different patterns which will help us in achieving Reactive System step by step without rewriting the whole logic from scratch. The main motivation for that talk is sharing the central refactoring steps in order to move current Spring Boot 1.x and WebMVC based application to the new Spring Boot 2 and WebFlux based one. In turn, the example of the REST Chat Application shows that the Refactoring to Reactive does not mean only changes in the programming model from imperative to reactive and the introduction of some reactive programming libraries like RxJava or Reactor 3. In general, it means changes in the mindset, in the design and in the way the data goes through the system and emphasizing of that point is crucial for thous who decided to move their system to reactive.'
