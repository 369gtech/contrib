title: 'RxJava Applied: Concise Examples where It Shines (Igor Lozynskyi, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1468311448
description: "FRP & RxJava have already gained an important place in software development of all kinds, from mobile applications to high load servers. But it is just a beginning. The approach proposed by RxJava gives us such benefits as functional composition over observable streams, easy asynchronous programming, including error handling, an amazing toolbox of functions to build workflows.\n\nThis talk is all about short but expressive examples where RxJava gives more possibilities requiring less code."
