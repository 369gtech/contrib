description: "From #Vilnius to #Mallorca! BUILD STUFF is going to celebrate summer! An amazing weekend on APRIL 29-30, 2017 â€“ MALLORCA, SPAIN will take you out of the office into a seaside event full of professional lectures, technical sessions, beach games, umbrella drinks, and wonderful sunset. #buildstuffes #beachconference #sun #code www.buildstuff.es\n\nMathias Brandewinder has been developing software on .NET for about 10 years, and loving every minute of it, except maybe for a few release days. His language of choice was C#, until he discovered F# and fell in love with it. He enjoys arguing about code and how to make it better, and gets very excited when discussing TDD or F#. His other professional interests include forecasting models, machine learning and applying math to solve business problems. Mathias is a Microsoft F# MVP and the founder of Clear Lines Consulting. He is based in San Francisco, blogs at www.brandewinder.com"
