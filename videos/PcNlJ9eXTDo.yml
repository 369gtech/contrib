description: "http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu2012/public/schedule/detail/26567\n\nBetfair has completed a ground-up re-write of our Sports betting web platform. We focused on the fundamentals of resiliency and performance. We measured and improved and measured again and in the process, saw our page load times drop by a factor of 5; on average our full page load is under 3 seconds. We met our promise to our customers.\n\nBut some of our customers kept telling us our new site was slow. Many sophisticated customers have chosen to stay using our previous platform; there is a big opportunity cost while those customers have not chosen to experience the new products and features we've delivered on the new platform.\n\nAll our indicators say our new site is fast and our customers should be happy. We all know a faster site means more money, but we're not getting the benefits we expect.\n\nIn this talk, hear Tim Morrow tell the story of how making Betfair's site faster for most customers actually made it 3x slower for their biggest customers. Truly, you get what you measure.\n\nTim Morrow is Head of Site Technology at Betfair, responsible for the delivery of Betfair's next-generation web site platform, focusing on performance, availability and the capability to continuous deliver business value at a rapid pace.\n\nTim has over 11 years of experience leading teams to design and build websites and systems using Java and related technologies. Prior to joining Betfair, Tim worked as an Architect at Shopzilla delivering their consumer facing website platform. In addition, Tim has also worked at Qualcomm developing software to support the provisioning of mobile devices and delivery of applications to mobile devices in the Wireless Business Division. Tim also thrived in the entrepreneurial environment during years 2000-2004 of startup, Project.net . As a key contributor to the startup team, Tim designed and built hosted web applications for the fledgling company.\n\nBorn and raised in Northern Ireland, Tim obtained his BEng degree in Computer Science from Queens University in Belfast. Having spent 13 years in California, Tim recently moved his family to London for the opportunity at Betfair. In his free time, Tim can often be found reading, snowboarding or chasing after his two kids."
