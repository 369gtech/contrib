description: "Richard Jones\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/191/\nMinecraft is popular. It's also a closed-source game. That hasn't stopped a very healthy and enthusiastic community of game modification creators (modders) from building around it.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will discuss some of the issues that modding Minecraft raises; this will include a basic discussion of how it's done, how information is disseminated and lead into questions of how FOSS comes into the picture."
