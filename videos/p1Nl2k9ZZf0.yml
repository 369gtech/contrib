description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nBeing both a way of thinking and a set of priorities, DDD can sometimes be perceived as overly abstract and amorphous. But the aim of DDD is accelerating development for teams dealing with domain complexity.\n\nDDD is about shortening the time to value for customers, and doing this in a sustainable, repeatable manner. In this talk, you'll gain an understanding of what DDD looks like, why it matters, and what that might mean for you, your team, and your organization .\n\nPaul Rayner is a developer, instructor, coach and popular conference speaker. He co-founded DDD Denver and is founder and chairman of the Explore DDD Conference (exploreddd.com). His company Virtual Genius LLC, provides training and coaching in DDD and EventStorming for agile teams (virtualgenius.com). Paul is from Perth, Australia, but chooses to live, work and play with his wife and two children, in Denver, Colorado. He blogs at thepaulrayner.com and tweets with an Australian accent at @ThePaulRayner."
