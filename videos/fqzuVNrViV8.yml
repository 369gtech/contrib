description: "Being on the front lines of building and maintaining the modern Web is a tough vocation. It demands constantly ensuring your site is robust and reliable. We know our business grows when customers can quickly engage and transact. That's why focusing on monitoring and improving the performance of key business transactions is critical, especially in a hectic and fast-changing environment.\n\nScripting a synthetic measurement of multiple pages can help. But clean-room monitoring excludes all the variations in your users' experiences. And looking at real user data one page at a time won't tell the whole story either.\n\nLearn how to look beyond the lens of individual page performance, and through the footsteps of real users to measure performance for important journeys. Highlights of this live webcast include:\n\n    Understanding the variations in user behavior and site navigation\n    How dependencies between pages can impact user experience\n    Modeling and aggregating real user paths\n\nAbout David Azaria\n\nDavid heads web application development at Keynote Systems, Inc.
