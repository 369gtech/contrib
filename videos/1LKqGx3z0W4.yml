title: 'Eric Vicenti - Owning Transitions'
recordingDate: 1536932470
description: 'The "Transitioner" is the view in React Navigation responsible for animating between screens and supporting navigation gestures. We will discuss how views like "stack" work today, how they evolved, and how they fit into React Navigation and other navigation libraries. Historically, it has been quite difficult to create custom screen transitions and gestures. So the time has come to introduce a new Transitioner, and give you complete control over screen transitions in your React Native App.'
