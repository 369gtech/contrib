description: "Of the original XP practices, the one that seems the most difficult to get right is the on-site customer. In the original XP team, this was an actual end-user of the, internal, system that was being built. How did the Product Owner turn into a project manager working down a long, predefined backlog?\n\nThe Product Owner role quite often has devolved into a step in a waterfall process. A gateway, or proxy, sometimes a firewall, towards the rest of the organisation. But customer feedback is a fundamental basis of any Agile process.\n\nI will discuss how we can use clear goals, captured in actionable metrics to guide our teams in growing the software necessary to reach those goals.\n\nIâ€™ll show how to get development teams to demonstrate their progress based on business metrics, not just features completed. To strategically align development with the rest of the company. And how this allows you to really use the brightest minds in your organization for innovation."
