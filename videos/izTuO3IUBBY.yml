language: English
recordingDate: 1507530685
description: "Lucas Jellema, CTO, AMIS Services BV\n\nFast data arrives in real time and potentially high volume. Rapid processing, filtering, and aggregation are required to ensure timely reaction and actual information in user interfaces. meeting these requirements is a challenge, and making this happen in a scalable and reliable fashion is even more interesting. This session introduces Apache Kafka as the scalable event bus that takes care of the events as they flow in and Kafka Streams for streaming analytics. Both Java and Node applications are demonstrated that interact with Kafka and leverage server-sent events and WebSocket channels to update the web UI in real time. User activity performed by the attendees in the web UI is processed by the Kafka-powered back end and results in live updates on all clients."
