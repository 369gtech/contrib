description: "Speaker: Kohsuke Kawaguchi\r\n\r\nKohsuke Kawaguchi is a Java champion and well-know creator of Jenkins. He was the CTO of CloudBees for the past 9 years and has just started his new Venture called Launchable.\r\n\r\n== Open-source, past, present, and future\r\nIt's been two decades since the word \"open-source\" became a thing. Since then, it has played a crucial role for engineers in many ways; as building blocks, as the career builder, to name a few. I myself owe so many to open source -- the opportunity that brought me from Japan to the US, the world wide network of incredible engineers that I came to know, and the business I built with others around Jenkins, that is CloudBees.\r\n\r\nBut open-source has certainly evolved for those two decades, and that evolution continues. For the software industry and engineers to grow, we need economically viable, sustainable open-source. The role of that is even more crucial for the part of the world that tends to be disconnected from Euro-American software community.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Kohsuke uses his own experience living in the Silicon Valley for those two decades, to go over how tech companies and engineers have changed the way they interact with open-source, why it makes not just moral but business sense for companies to be involved in open-source, and why open-source will continue to shine in the eras of web services.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/270135540/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/C0mCA/"
