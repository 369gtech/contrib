recordingDate: 1533544919
description: "Born in a lab, matured in the enterprise, and now fully baked as an open-source, cross-platform, professionally-supported language: the F# journey has always been about reconciling the apparently irreconcilable. Javascript and .NET, Linux and Windows, Functional and Objects, Company and Openness, Android and iOS, Programming and Data, Server and Client - F# finds a way.\nCome along and take a journey with me through the modern programming landscape and the F# approach to language design, interoperability, tooling and community."
