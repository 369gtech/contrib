title: '"Dissecting Clojure Reducers" by Renzo Borgatti'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614359561
description: "Reducers are the key enabler for the implementation of highly-performant and maintainable parallel solutions in Clojure. After a bit of history and context about parallelization primitives, I'm going to live code Reducers from the ground-up, showing what functional abstractions are involved and why. We'll finally use our home grown reducing implementation to show performance improvements on some common sequential code.\n\nRenzo Borgatti\nBBC\n@reborg\n\nI started my career as a developer in 1999. I had the pleasure to work with many different languages like Java, Ruby, Objective-C and now deeply in love with Clojure. I'm always hacking on new exiting technologies and I love speaking at conferences and user groups. I currently work as a tech lead for BBC London on a new platform for real time analysis of user votes."
