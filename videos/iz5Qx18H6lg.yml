description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nC++ is a big language, and it gets bigger every year. Is C++ it too big? Do we just continue to make the language harder to learn? Or, perhaps, do these language additions actually make the language better and easier to use? We will take a pragmatic look at the changes brought to C++ over the years and what impact they have had on how we write code.\n— \nJason Turner\nDeveloper, Trainer, Speaker\nGreater Denver Area\n\nHost of C++Weekly https://www.youtube.com/c/JasonTurner-lefticus, Co-host of CppCast http://cppcast.com, Co-creator and maintainer of the embedded scripting language for C++, ChaiScript http://chaiscript.com, and author and curator of the forkable coding standards document http://cppbestpractices.com.\n\nI'm available for contracting and onsite training.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
