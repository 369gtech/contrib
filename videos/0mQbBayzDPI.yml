title: 'Compiler Livestream: Using Metaprogramming to scan for pointer math.'
recordingDate: 1579075573
description: 'Was in the middle of doing some random stuff, decided to scan the game for pointer math to see how it was used. A nice example of using the metaprogramming. The start of this video is pretty slow and mumbly. We start doing the actual metaprogramming work at 10:51.'
