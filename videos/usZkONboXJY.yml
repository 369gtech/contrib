title: 'Junior Grossi. CQRS and Event Sourcing: Software architecture in a higher level, for everyone!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620021877
description: "CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing are subjects that you might have heard around. It’s a new way of thinking in software development, aiming better performance and domain visibility. This talk’s goal is to give you a introductory overview about these topics, with some practical examples in PHP about how things work together. Private note: the goal of this talk is not to go deeper on those topics, but give a big picture about the subject. It’s a massive content, so it’s important to keep things clean and simple in order to encourage the crowd to go deeper later. Talk given in Darkmira Tour PHP, June 2019. \n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/LMOmt2ktK5TkjA\n\nPHPFest: https://2020.phpfest.ru/lecture/14"
