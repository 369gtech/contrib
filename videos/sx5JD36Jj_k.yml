description: "TestCon Vilnius 2016. Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt\n\nThere are various approaches to writing automated tests: unit tests, API calls, acceptance. QA teams are mostly doing acceptance one, rarely integration or API. Unit tests are usually counted as “development thing”. Using simple synthetic but the real example we’ll try to understand how each test automation approach looks like and what proc and cons are. There will be almost no theory, only practice ready to be applied to your project afterward. The code will be written in Ruby but Ruby knowledge is not really required to understand the presentation: only your desire, engineering attitude and a basic understanding of web technologies."
