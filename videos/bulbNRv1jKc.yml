description: "It’s difficult to get inspired sometimes. We often make the mistake of looking at our own industry for answers and ideas which leads to regurgitation and me-too-ness. For us to stay interested in our careers we need try new things and experiment, and the first step on our path to progress is inspiration.\n\nChris spends a lot of his walking life making SVG animations and interactive design components and in this talk he’ll chat about how and why they came about, the process, the challenges, the failures and successes and the rabbit holes he dives down to try and discover new techniques and approaches to creating interesting (and often weird) things.\n\nChris Gannon\nFounder, gannon.tv\nhttps://twitter.com/chrisgannon\nhttps://www.instagram.com/chrisgannon\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
