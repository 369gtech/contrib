title: 'Build an AI Startup with PyTorch'
language: English
recordingDate: 1554705716
description: "I've built an automated therapist app called MindRelaxr using PyTorch and a host of other tools (Dialogflow, Tensorflow Lite, Firebase, ONNX, Paypal, and Android Studio). I'm going to show you how I integrated these tools together to build a paid service that uses AI generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques to help people reduce their depression and anxiety. This app uses a sentiment analysis model trained in PyTorch as well as Google's cloud natural language processing service 'dialogflow' to provide low cost therapy.
