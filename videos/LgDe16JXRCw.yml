description: "http://velocityconf.com\nOnce you start monitoring real users you understand it's not just about your own performance. In fact one of the first things you discover is how blind you really are. You see degrading load times and don't know what caused them, so you have to come up with a good idea of how to get the information you really need. This is when you realise that you don't have to wait for the newest W3C specs to be available.\n\nKlaus Enzenhofer has several years of experience and expertise in the field of Web Performance Optimization and User Experience Management. He works as Technical Strategist in the Center of Excellence Team at Compuware APM. In this role he influences the development of the Compuware dynaTrace Application Performance Management Solution and the Web Performance Optimization Tool Compuware dynaTrace AJAX Edition. He mainly gathered his experience in web and performance by developing and running large-scale web portals at Tiscover GmbH"
