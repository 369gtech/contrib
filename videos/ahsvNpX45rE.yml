description: "Speaker: Kenny Bastani\n\nTitle: Building Cloud Native Applications with Cloud Foundry and Spring  \nAbstract:In this talk I will introduce you to a set of tools for building cloud-native JVM applications. We will take a look at some of the common patterns for microservice architectures and how to use Cloud Foundry to deploy multiple microservices to the cloud.  \n\nWe will also dive into a microservices example project of a cloud-native application built using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. Using this example project, I will show you how to use Cloud Foundry to spin up a microservice cluster using containers. We will then explore what a large multi-container cloud-native application looks like when using self-describing REST APIs that link multiple microservices together. \n\nBio: Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal and a passionate open source contributor. Kenny is the co-author of O'Reilly's Cloud Native Java, a book that introduces developers to the patterns and practices of building cloud-native JVM microservices.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.meetup.com/singasug/events/230141951/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/ITgD/"
