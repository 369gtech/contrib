description: "Speaker: Udara Alwis\n\nXamarin Forms allows us to share a single code base among all three platforms. But when it comes to managing Image Resources, Xamarin Forms doesn't provide a unified solution, whereas we have to manage Image Resource individually?for each platform natively considering the scalability and multi-resolution support.\n\nForms9Patch enhances Xamarin Forms to enable multi-resolution image management for iOS and Android. Simply put with Forms9Patch allows you to manage your Image Resources right from your PCL project, which also provides full support for multi-resolution resource handling and automatically takes care of it under the hood.\n\nEvent Page: http://www.meetup.com/SingaporeMobileDev/events/231439604/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/Q8wr/"
