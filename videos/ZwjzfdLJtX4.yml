description: "https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2019-164-reinventing-home-directories\n\n\n\nLet's bring the UNIX concept of Home Directories into the 21st century.\n\nThe concept of home directories on Linux/UNIX has little changed in the last  39 years. It's time to have a closer look, and bring them up to today's standards, regarding encryption, storage, authentication, user records, and more.\n\nIn this talk we'll talk about \"systemd-homed\", a new component for systemd, that reworks how we do home directories on Linux, adds strong encryption that makes sense, supports automatic enumeration and hot-plugged home directories and more.\n\nLennart Poettering\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/ASG2019/talk/VSQRXA/"
