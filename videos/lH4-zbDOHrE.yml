description: "Slides: http://mezzoblue.com/presentations/2013/mobilism/\n\nMobile design is necessarily about embracing constraints, but sometimes we go too far. We strip down our content to a bare minimum in pursuit of misguided ideals about mobile context. We provide 'useful' mobile UI components that immediately proceed to get in a user's way. We make improper assumptions about a user's environment. Let's place dozens of these mobile design anti-patterns under the microscope and talk about why they don't work, and what we should be doing instead.\n\nAbout Dave: https://twitter.com/mezzoblue\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl\n\nVideography generously sponsored by Mirabeau: https://www.mirabeau.nl"
