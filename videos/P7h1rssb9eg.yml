title: 'Service Workers: Transforming your App into a Progressive Web Application - Avindra Fernando'
recordingDate: 1558604349
description: "What if we could build a web application which auto-magically works across various devices and platforms? Thanks to Progressive Web Applications (PWAs), this dream has now come true. PWAs use modern web capabilities to provide a user experience similar to that of mobile applications.\n\nPWAs make use of Web App Manifest files and Service Workers, to make the magic happen. A Service Worker is a standalone JavaScript program that can handle background/network tasks for your web application. Service Workers enable us to have total control over the outgoing and incoming network requests as well as the browser cache. \n\nI have some great news for all of you. Many browsers and modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) have built-in support for Service Workers. In this talk, we will dive into exploring the transformation of a simple web application into a PWA using Service Workers.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
