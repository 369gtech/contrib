description: "Functional programming is all the rage now: promising concise, simple code with fewer bugs. Isomorphic web development, on the other hand, has a different set of promises: letting you share logic between client and server without duplication of code, ensurign that they will always stay in sync. \n\nScala.js is a new take on these ideas: rather than bringing your front-end code to the server, we bring your back-end code to the browser! In this talk, I'll demonstrate how to get started with Scala.js to build client-side web applications. \n\nWe'll see how Scala.js gives you functional programming and isomorphic web development almost for free, and brings with it additional bonuses like tooling and safety far beyond anything available in Javascript land.\n\nhttp://forwardjs.com/\nhttps://newcircle.com/"
