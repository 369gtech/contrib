description: "Docker enables microservice architectures and is the leader in containerization technology. On one hand, working with Docker greatly simplifies development and DevOps workflows. On the other hand, to achieve distribution and scale we need to take advantage of orchestration platforms - which are many.\n\nThis session will take you on a tour from the fundamentals of Docker, to the important concepts that support enterprise deployments including service distribution and scheduling, resource constraints, server density, scale, self-healing, diagnostics and management. While illustrating these features, you'll get a high level tour of several Docker platforms including Docker Swarm, Docker Data Center, Azure Container Service, Mesophere DC/OS, Kubernetes and Amazon EC2 Container Services (ECS)."
