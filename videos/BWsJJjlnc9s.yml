recordingDate: 1530100355
description: "GraphQL is not the new kid on the block anymore but many developers haven't tried it yet – including yours truly, half a year ago. Now I use it daily, and I never want to go back. Let me explain to you what GraphQL is and why you too should care if you work with APIs. In this two-part presentation we'll first dive into the basics, so you get a bit of a foundation. In the second part, I'll do some live coding to demonstrate how easy it is to get started with a GraphQL backend based on Prisma.io.\n\nEelke Boezeman has been making websites since 1997 and now works for Purple Scout as a web app developer and architect. He loves to teach, and he loves pizza, so all the more reason to have him over at Foo Café!\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing and learning.\n\nBorn out of the desire to create a year round conference like atmosphere, Foo Café is THE place for planned and spontaneous meetings of all sizes and interests within the IT arena.\nEnjoy a coffee or a cold beer, along with light pub fare, and engage with other like minded individuals interested in sharing their knowledge and learning from one another.
