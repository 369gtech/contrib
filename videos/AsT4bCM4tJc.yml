description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcporto.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\nWe often find ourselves in situations where we have to knowledge share and mentor others, but we often don't take the time to learn _how_ to be better mentors.\n\nSo are we doing it right?\n\nThrough my work as Mentor Director for Coding and Cocktails, I've been able to compile effective methods through research and experience that will help all developers be better mentors, whether within an established mentor/mentee relationship or quick day-to-day teaching opportunities.\n\nBy fostering collaboration, removing roadblocks, practicing self-care, developing empathy for mentees, and constantly iterating based on actionable feedback, we can all be a part of creating richer tech communities that thrive on constant improvement and collective growth."
