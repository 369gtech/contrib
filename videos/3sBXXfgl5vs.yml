title: 'Query Pulsar Streams using Apache Flink - Sijie Guo'
recordingDate: 1571143737
description: "Both Apache Pulsar and Apache Flink share a similar view on how the data and the computation level of an application can be “streaming-first” with batch as a special case streaming. With Apache Pulsar’s Segmented-Stream storage and Apache Flink’s steps to unify batch and stream processing workloads under one framework, there are numerous ways of integrating the two technologies to provide elastic data processing at massive scale, and build a real streaming warehouse.\n\nIn this talk, Sijie Guo from the Apache Pulsar community will share the latest integrations between Apache Pulsar and Apache Flink. He will explain how Apache Flink can integrate and leverage Pulsar’s built-in efficient schemas to allow users of Flink SQL query Pulsar streams in realtime."
