description: "# Building next generation web apps with Blazor\n\nChris Sainty - Flagship Group\n\nThe widespread adoption of WebAssembly, by all major browsers, has opened the world of front-end development to languages other than JavaScript. The platform leading the charge is Blazor - a new client-side UI framework from the Microsoft ASP.NET team. Blazor allows developers to write client-side applications using C# which runs inside the browser without needing plugins or transpilation - how cool is that!\nIn this code-focused session, we’ll explore the Blazor platform. We’ll start by looking at fundamentals such as how to structure Blazor applications for flexibility. The component model, looking at life cycle methods and inter-component communication, as well as forms and validation. We’ll then explore some more advanced topics such as authentication, authorisation and JavaScript interop.\n\nThis session is great for developers both new to Blazor or who have prior experience and want to deepen their knowledge.\n\n## About Blazor\n\nBlazor is an open source and cross-platform web UI framework for building single-page apps using .NET and C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor is based on a powerful and flexible component model for building rich interactive web UI. You implement Blazor UI components using a combination of .NET code and Razor syntax: an elegant melding of HTML and C#. Blazor components can seamlessly handle UI events, bind to user input, and efficiently render UI updates.\n\n## About nor(DEV):con\n\nThe eastern region's biggest tech conference runs annually in February with a fantastic line-up of speakers and workshops.
