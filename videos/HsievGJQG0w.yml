recordingDate: 1540249664
description: "MS17-010 is the most important patch in the history of operating systems, fixing remote code execution vulnerabilities in the world of modern Windows. The ETERNAL exploits, written by the Equation Group and dumped by the Shadow Brokers, have been used in the most damaging cyber attacks in computing history: WannaCry, NotPetya, Olympic Destroyer, and many others. \n\nYet, how these complicated exploits work has not been made clear to most. This is due to the ETERNAL exploits taking advantage of undocumented features of the Windows kernel and the esoteric SMBv1 protocol. \n\nThis talk will condense years of research into Windows internals and the SMBv1 protocol driver. Descriptions of full reverse engineering of internal structures and all historical background info needed to understand how the exploit chains for ETERNALBLUE, ETERNALCHAMPION, ETERNALROMANCE, and ETERNALSYNERGY work will be provided. \n\nThis talk will also describe how the MS17-010 patch fixed the vulnerabilities, and identify additional vulnerabilities that were patched around the same time."
