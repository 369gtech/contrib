It provides a drag and drop interface along with copy & paste and integrations with services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Instagram, and more. You can upload files from any of those locations and Uppy will retrieve and upload the file for you wherever it needs to go.\n\nIntegrating Uppy with ActiveStorage can be a bit of a pain however. You actually need a plugin to make it work with ActiveStorage's direct upload URL so it knows where to send the files."
