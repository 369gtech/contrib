description: "Wiebe-Marten Wijnja - Maintainer of 20+ Elixir libraries, Elixir Forum moderator\n\nAn adventure in distributed programming\n\nTalk in three words: Adventure in Distributed Programming\n\nAbstract\nAt Planga, Marten and his coworkers are building a seamless chat service that runs on Elixir. To keep this system scalable and fault-tolerant, they make a lot of use of Elixirâ€™s supervision and distribution features.\n\nIn this talk, Marten will explain the basics of distributed programming and share their experiences in scaling from one server to multiple servers (in potentially remote locations) and in what ways Elixir/OTP helped them and might help you, as well as the challenges encountered along the way.\n\nObjectives\nTeach people the basics of moving from a single system to a distributed one.\n\nAudience\nBeginners and intermediate Elixir developers that are interested in (and/or would like to start writing) distributed applications.\n\nThe speaker \nWiebe-Marten loves creating things that just keep working. A computing scientist in body and mind. Wiebe-Marten has 12+ years of practical web-development experience. In 2012, he started to specialise in working with decentralised, distributed and fault-tolerant systems. Initially working with Blockchain-based systems from 2012 onwards, the BitTorrent protocol, and other systems that allow for decentralised data sharing. He is an enthusiastic open sourcerer, a long-time developer using the Elixir programming language (maintainer of more than 20 libraries on Hex.PM), and a moderator on the Elixir Forum. In his spare time, Wiebe-Marten loves making music (piano, marimba), running, dancing and experiencing new things.\nGithub: Qqwy\nTwitter: @WiebeMarten\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: www.elixirconf.eu\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/elixirconfeu\nMail: info at elixirconfeu\nPhilipp Schmieder - Founder Pentacent\nFrom Zero to Elixir Deployment"
