Practical side of presentation demonstrates how tester can perform his/her daily duties using modern programming language Ruby as a foundation for making testing easier and more fun, automating testing chores where it's possible, creating some shortcuts in long and tedious processes.\r\nThe presentation contains examples on testing automation, performance and load testing, gathering useful information from log files, working with database and some other things.
