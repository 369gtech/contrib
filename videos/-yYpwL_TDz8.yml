description: "by Dario Di Nucci\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2213/ml_on_code_mining_source_code.webm\n\n\nCode is an incredible source of information.\nIndeed, mining software repositories can tell us whether code is natural, how to use a new framework, or how to identify similar changes. \n\nIn this talk, I will present state-of-the-art and limitations on the usage of graph-based algorithms to mine software repository. \n\nIn particular, I will cover how program analysis, pattern mining and pattern matching can help developers to identify: \n\n\nconventions and idioms, using syntactic information commonly represented as Abstract Syntax Trees;\nframework usages, relying on semantic information such as control and data dependencies represented as Program Dependency Graphs;\nsimilar modifications in multiple different locations, computed using change loggers or change distillers.\n\n\n\nLast I will present INTiMALS, an ongoing industry-university collaboration to develop a language-parametric framework for mining this information in legacy systems. \n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 13:50:00+01"
