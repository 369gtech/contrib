language: English
recordingDate: 1574294675
description: "Corporate colors and logos characteristic of a brand are easily and freely accessed on the network. As consumers we have been advised to distrust an email with these identities.\n\nInstead, the voice gives us confidence. When we need help, the voice is there. It is the first thing we hear when we call, it tells us how wonderful and beneficial it is to be associated with that brand. A voice that will never harm us, until now.\n\nIdentity spoofing is one of the most used social engineering formats to initiate major attacks. But what if cyber-criminals could go further? What would happen if someone could not only impersonate, but actually use the identity of an institution to make an attack on a national level? Is it possible to do this with a minimal investment or without capital? The answer is yes.\n\nDaniel Isler: @Fr1endlyRATs\nDaniel Isler is Security Consultant, Bachelor in Arts of Representation, Actor and Scenic Communicator and Voice Over Artist.
