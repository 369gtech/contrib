description: "PyData London Meetup #57\nTuesday, June 4, 2019\n\nI am developing a python module to calculate the depth of the competent material below train tracks to accommodate high Rayleigh wave velocities. This module is using site investigation data and through a series of processes calculates the optimum thickness of the competent strata below the track of the train. This enables the contractor to have an early estimate of the imported material needed or inform the operating authority on the optimum speed of the train using a maintenance cost- profit analysis.\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
