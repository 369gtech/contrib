title: 'Deploying Stateful FaaS on Streaming Dataflows - Adil Akhter & Marios Fragkoulis'
recordingDate: 1571155284
description: "In the serverless model, users upload application code to a cloud platform and the cloud provider undertakes the deployment, execution, and scaling of the application, relieving users from all operational aspects. Although very popular, current serverless offerings offer poor support for the management of local application state, the main reason being that managing state and keeping it consistent at large scale is very challenging. As a result, the serverless model is inadequate for executing stateful, latency-sensitive applications.\n\nIn this talk, we present a research project at TU Delft which focuses on a high-level programming model for developing stateful functions and deploying them in the cloud. Our programming model allows functions to retain state as well as call other functions. In order to deploy stateful functions in a cloud infrastructure, we translate functions and their data exchange into a stateful dataflow graph. With this talk we aim at demonstrating that using a modified version of an open-source dataflow engine, such as Apache Flink as a runtime for stateful functions. Finally we will demonstrate that we can deploy scalable stateful services in the cloud with surprisingly low latency and high throughput."
