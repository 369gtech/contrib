description: "How do we use Software Modernisation to stop the rot, improve agility and start innovating? For investment banks, there are key challenges that must be overcome to facilitate change. \n\nIn this video, Codurance’s Mash Badar and Redis Labs’ Luis Herrera discuss a key architectural pattern for reducing complexity in the finance sector. They show how companies can simplify their distributed monoliths and align business and technology through reducing time to market, utilise data to gain competitive advantage, and reducing costs.\n\nThey also demonstrate how key features of Redis can be applied to this type of architecture to reduce application complexity.\n\nThis webinar is aimed at business or IT leaders exploring solutions on how to evolve complex technical systems to ensure long-term sustainability and better data-driven decision making. You will find this session particularly useful if you have to help interoperate several applications in a seamless way across levels of maturity, technological stacks and constraints.\nAlthough this webinar focuses on a financial context, similar strategies can be applied across industries including retail and pharmaceuticals.\n\nLearn how Codurance’s Software Modernisation services can improve your business here.
