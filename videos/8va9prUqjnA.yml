title: 'Emil Sj√∂lander - React Native, The Native Bits'
recordingDate: 1536920816
description: "React Native, The Native Bits\nReact Native is much more than javascript. Every React Native app runs at least 4 different languages for the purpose of sharing code, implementing efficient subsystems, and interacting with the host system. We will look at how these systems work together and among other things learn how a javascript style object in your component gets translated into efficient C code in Yoga, the underlying layout engine.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
