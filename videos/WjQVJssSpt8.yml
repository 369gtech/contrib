title: 'Modern TypeScript is amazing! - Jake Ginnivan'
recordingDate: 1528732486
description: "You think you know TypeScript? Unless you have been looking at it recently you likely have missed some of the amazing features shipped between TypeScript 2.0 and 2.6. Some of these language features exist in very few other languages and open up so many doors.\n\nIn this talk Jake will introduce you to TypeScript and run through a number of the latest language features including spread/rest operators which many Babel users love, Mapped Types, Generics and cover practical examples where he has been using these features to improve the code he is writing day to day and move runtime errors to compilation errors."
