description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nAs a Head of Software Dev, part of my job is to review salaries every now and then. Except I don't think I'm the right guy to do it. You may be fair in a group of 7 devs you work with, but this doesn't scale. When you have ~40 people, it's pure science fiction. So I've created a simple process of peer-to-peer review, that allows me to get salaries more or less fair, bring people some feedback, while not trying to play a semi-omnipotent judge, and which doesn't take forever. This is a case study / tutorial, of how to optimize salaries for fairness, while being constrained by corporate rules, law, and lack of time."
