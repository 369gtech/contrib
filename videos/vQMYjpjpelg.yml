title: Peer to Peer Salary Review in a Corpo: Case Study
language: English
recordingDate: 1482426387
description: As a Head of Software Dev, part of my job is to review salaries every now and then. Except I don't think I'm the right guy to do it. You may be fair in a group of 7 devs you work with, but this doesn't scale. When you have ~40 people, it's pure science fiction. So I've created a simple process of peer-to-peer review, that allows me to get salaries more or less fair, bring people some feedback, while not trying to play a semi-omnipotent judge, and which doesn't take forever. This is a case study / tutorial, of how to optimize salaries for fairness, while being constrained by corporate rules, law, and lack of time.
