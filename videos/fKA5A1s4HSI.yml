description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/cloud-platform-adoption-lessons-learned\n\nThe Gap is rapidly adopting Cloud Foundry. As part of that adoption, our developers are adapting to a new set of patterns, tools and processes. This talk focuses on what patterns worked for us in considering integration, messaging, data, scaling, and other concerns. We’ll share what we've learned, how we’re rapidly delivering new capabilities with Cloud Foundry and where we’re headed next.\n\nSpeaker: Philip Architecture; Director IT, Gap"
