description: "Building an Open Framework for Cloud Based IoT Solutions - Steffen Evers, Bosch Software Innovations GmbH\n\nIt is expected that in the next years billions of devices will be connected to the internet of things (IoT). Many of them will interact with cloud-based solutions to provide additional services on the devices or in the web. To bring IoT to the next level technologies for supporting cross-domain/cross-vendor solutions are needed. Cloud Foundry is a great technological base for building IoT solutions. However, on top of it, software is needed for the connectivity challenges, support of domain-specific protocols, large scale messaging and device management and integration with existing infrastructure. Eclipse IoT aims to address these needs and provide an IoT framework that makes IoT development fast and simple. Bosch SI is active in CFF and Eclipse to bring both worlds together to develop with many other companies a suitable base for the IoT solutions of tomorrow. Come and join us!\n\nAbout Steffen Evers\nSteffen Evers is responsible for all matters relating to open source software such as strategy, community, and software management infrastructure at Bosch Software Innovations GmbH since 2012. The topic has been his professional focus since 2000 when he started researching on open source development and continued by helping companies to use the open source approach to reach their business goals."
