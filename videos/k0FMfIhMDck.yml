description: "The Stream API is set to become as important in the future as the Collections API is today. But to make good use of it, we have to understand the basis of its design in the idea of  parallel-ready code,  how that idea leads to the new idioms of the Stream API, and how Collectors square the circle that combines parallel execution with mutable data structures. This presentation ends with a practical payoffâ€”it takes some typical collection processing problems and shows systematically how to choose the best stream processing solution for each.\n\n\nAuthor:\n Maurice Naftalin\nMaurice Naftalin is principal developer at Morningside Light Ltd.
