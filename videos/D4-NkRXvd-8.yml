description: "Most people who’ve rattled around in startups have heard of the Pirate Funnel for measuring your success at growing your customer base. And if you haven’t, don’t worry—it’s super easy to learn, just yell AARRR! (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue!) This simple acronym has powered many powerful platforms and is also a cornerstone in customer success investments. (Referral!)\n\nThis talk will take you on a journey through how I evolved this framework to something new, which I’ve given the acronym CHARM, because acronyms are a critical component of success. CHARM helped me measure and understand user and maintainer growth of an open source project I was responsible for, Chef’s Habitat. I’ll share how I think you can use this framework to improve how you explain and prioritize investing in your own projects.\n\nTasha Drew, Director of Product Incubation at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/charming-pirates"
