description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nC++20 adds the \"spaceship operator\" ＜=＞ for three-way comparison, fundamentally changing the way we implement comparison. But there are a lot more changes: Comparison categories will give more structure, and the new operator rewriting rules will massively reduce boilerplate. And like most C++ features, there are a couple of caveats we need to be aware of.\n\nThis talk will cover all the changes and give guidelines on how to use them. It will be very practical, answering questions like: How do I write a comparison operator for my classes? How do I write it for a generic container? How should I implement algorithms to leverage the three-way comparison? How do I handle all the types written without ＜=＞?\n\nWhether you are writing concrete applications or generic library code, you will have the necessary knowledge to apply the new features. And even if you cannot use C++20 in the foreseeable future, you will have a deeper understanding on proper comparison design.\n— \nJonathan Müller\nStudent, RWTH Aachen University\nJonathan is a Computer Science graduate currently studying Physics. In his spare time he works on various C++ open source libraries for memory allocation, cache-friendly containers or parsing. He also blogs about C++ and library development at foonathan.net.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
