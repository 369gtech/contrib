description: "Do you feel cryptographic libraries are just thrown over the fence for us developers and security professionals to understand and pray its used securely? Java Cryptography Architecture is one such famously used the library, laden by ambiguous documentation, over-abundance of algorithmic and key material choices, insecure defaults, and poor architectural choices. All these collectively make it highly probable to make an unfortunate choice and lands us with a flawed cryptographic system.\nIn this session, learn how to securely use each of the Java Cryptography Architecture’s primitives (Random Number Generators, Encryption/Decryption algorithms, HMACs, digital signatures etc.) using real-world code examples to highlight areas that require careful attention and difficult choices. Examine both good and flawed implementations, and learn how to spot mistakes. Then learn how to future-proof the crypto in your applications.  \n\n\nSpeaker\n\nMansi Sheth\nPrincipal Security Reseacher, CA Veracode\nMansi Sheth is a Principal Security Researcher at CA Veracode Inc.
