title: 'Evolutionary history of the RabbitMQ .NET Client towards concurrency - Daniel Marbach'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624007874
description: "The RabbitMQ .NET Client with more than 31 million downloads and has a long and evolutionary history. In this talk, I dive into the inception of the first ideas on gradually moving the client from its synchronous resource-hogging-nature to a more modern, asynchronous, and joyful client truly embracing concurrency. Youâ€™ll learn about:\n\n- The RabbitMQ .NET Client whereabouts\n- The inception of an asynchronous code path into a purely synchronous code base\n- The improvements of the message consumption loop through several iterations up to using channels\n- The impact of async and concurrency on the client"
