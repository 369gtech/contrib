language: English
recordingDate: 1557216882
description: 'Running Twitter services on Graal has been very successful and saved Twitter a lot of money on datacenter cost. But we would like to run more efficient to reduce cost even more. I mean, who doesnâ€™t? In order to do this we are using our Machine Learning framework called Autotune to tune Graal inlining parameters. This talk will show how much performance improvement we got by autotuning Graal.'
