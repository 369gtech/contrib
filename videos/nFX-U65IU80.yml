language: English
recordingDate: 1520752526
description: "We often think of performance testing as one of those things we just have to do at the end of a project, often using heavyweight tool sets in dedicated environments.\nIn this talk, James offers an alternative. What decisions would we make differently if we had the ability to rapidly perform experiments using lightweight performance tests? The tools and techniques we now have available makes a new type of architectural decision making possible; from Software Defined Networking, IaaS and Continuous Delivery to Real Options and Architecture Decision Records.James will cover pre-requisites that allow us to make small bets on performance and explore the strange world of evolutionary design that this technique makes possible.\n\nJames is a developer at ThoughtWorks. As a member of the ThoughtWorks Technical Advisory Board, the group that creates the Technology Radar, he contributes to industry adoption of open source and other tools, techniques, platforms and languages. For the last few years he has been working as a coding architect on projects built using microservices; exploring new patterns and ways of working as he goes. James has spoken at many international conferences. His previous topics range from domain driven design, SOA and the future of the web to agile adoption patterns and lean thinking. Heâ€™s also heavily involved in the fledgling microservice community. He rather likes the fact that he got to describe his take on things jointly with Martin Fowler in a paper that is influencing how people see the future of software architecture.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
