description: "Avery Pennarun\n\nMany projects have poorly defined (and often overridden) priorities, hopelessly optimistic schedules, and overflowing bug trackers that are occasionally purged out of frustration in a mysterious process called \"bug bankruptcy.\" But a few projects seem to get everything right. What's the difference? Avery collected the best advice from the best-running teams at Google, then tried to break down why that advice worksâ€”using math, psychology, an ad-hoc engineer simulator (SimSWE), and pages torn out of Agile Project Management textbooks.\n\nWe'll answer questions like:\nWhy are my estimates always too optimistic, no matter how pessimistic I make them?\nHow many engineers have to come to the project planning meetings?\nWhy do people work on tasks that aren't on the schedule?\nWhat do I do when new bugs are filed faster than I can fix them?\nShould I make one release with two features or two releases with one new feature each?\nIf my bug tracker is already a hopeless mess, how can I clean it up without going crazy or declaring bankruptcy?\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
