description: "Python is a popular language and we all know why, however itâ€™s hard to ignore the hype around new programming languages like Scala, Rust and Go. In this talk, the speaker shares her experiences, compares two languages and answers the questions: why try Go? How easy or frustrating is it? And will you end up preferring it over Python?\n\nEVENT: Kiwi PyCon 2016\n\nSPEAKER: Dana Garifullina\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was uploaded on the ew Zealand Python User Group YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVxosSFzq5s"
