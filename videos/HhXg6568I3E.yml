description: "I've laid out the blueprint for a brain computer interface called \"The Link\". This is a device that uses DNA for processing and storage, temporal interference to alter brain states, and infrared spectroscopy to read brain states. Its powered using your body heat, noninvasive, and waterproof. This device is just a thought experiment, but real companies are working on this technology today. What does this kind of technology entail for privacy? Will there be an intelligence disparity? What role does AI play in all of this? What does it even mean to be human? I tackle these hard questions and give a technical overview of this device in this video. Enjoy!\n\nPlease Subscribe! And Like. And comment. Thats what keeps me going.\n\nWant more education?
