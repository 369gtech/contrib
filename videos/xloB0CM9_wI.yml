The questions to be discussed include the following: What are the differences between the technologies? Is JavaFX better than the old Java-based technologies? HTML5 or JavaFX: which one to use?

How do I migrate?\n\n\nAuthors:\nAndres Almiray\nAndres is a Java/Groovy developer and a Java Champion with more than 12 years of experience in software design and development.
