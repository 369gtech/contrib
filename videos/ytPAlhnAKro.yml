description: "Static typing is experiencing a renaissance. Modern languages use type inference that lets you just write your expressions and have the compiler infer their types.\n\nBut how does this work? I'll show you the fundamentals and theory by implementing a fully functional type checker/type inferencer.\n\nThis talk will attempt to disenchant type systems/checker as something magic and show how they are normal (fun) programs.\n\nTo do so it will present the Hindley-Milner-Damas type system which forms the basis for languages like OCaml, Haskell, PureScript, or Elm (and lots more).\n\nWe'll implement Algorithm W, a type inference algorithm, for it in about a 100 lines of Haskell. Participants will leave with an understanding of typing judgements and terminology like substitution, instantiation, and unification."
