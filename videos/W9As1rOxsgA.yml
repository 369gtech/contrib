recordingDate: 1478711961
description: "A guest appearance at Wix by Assaf and Doron.\nSun Microsystems coined the phrase “The Network is the Computer” in the 1990s but only today, the explosive demand for realtime software and always-on experiences is forcing the network to get really smarter.  Developers are turning to serverless platforms to build and scale realtime apps. In order to truly meet the needs of realtime, always-on apps, we need to leverage the power of a smarter network, and developers need to adopt new software design patterns that replace traditional three-tier architecture.  This presentation will explore:\n1. Categories of realtime software and always-on use cases that can use microservices to scale\n2. What does a smarter, microservices-powered network look like?\n3. The software design patterns and security considerations that will emerge to leverage smart networks"
