description: "From the 2014 Velocity Conference in New York City, Camille Fournier's keynote address, \"Cloning Yourself Isn't an Option: Becoming a Multiplier, Because You Don't Horizontally Scale\".\n\nWe’re all drawn to the fable of the 10X engineer, but engineers most commonly increase their effectiveness 10X by amplifying the effectiveness of those around them. In this talk we’ll explore ways to make your value multiplicative, no cloning required.\n\nAbout Camille Fournier (Rent the Runway):\nCurrently the Head of Engineering at Rent the Runway. Previously a Vice President at Goldman Sachs. Apache ZooKeeper committer and PMC member, Dropwizard framework PMC member.\n\nWatch more from the 2014 Velocity New York Conference: http://goo.gl/kmrqJF\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\n\nDon't miss an upload!
