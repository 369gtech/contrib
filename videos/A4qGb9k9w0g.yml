Not all that much fun! And that’s coming from somebody who maintains a test runner in their spare time.\nOnce you have some tests though, you can have confidence. And once you have confidence, you can make changes. And changes are what’s needed to build awesome products.\nSo let’s not talk about API details, let’s talk about getting testing done. About being better engineers. About building awesome products.\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nSauce Labs → https://saucelabs.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nNeuralegion → https://www.neuralegion.com/\n\nSilver Sponsor\nTestim → https://www.testim.io/\n\nProduction Partner\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/"
