description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nThis talk presents a framework DataDeps.jl, and its accompanying tool DataDepsGenerators.jl, for working with datasets in a more automatic and replicable fashion. DataDeps.jl provides a system for the automatic download and unpacking of datasets. DataDepsGenerators.jl automatically generates the code required by DataDeps to download data from several public repositories.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
