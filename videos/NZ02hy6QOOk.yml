description: "Containerizing Local Development... Is It Worth it?\r by Tony Drake\n\nContainers are the current hotness for deployment. But, how about development? They can provide a good way to manage local dependencies even if you're just writing a gem instead of an app. While writing and running code directly on your laptop has its own obstacles, using containers for development is not a silver bullet and brings along its own set of headaches. Which cases do containers make sense and how would they be configured? Containers may not be for you, but we'll go through some example setups. It'll be up to you whether or not you want to change your local setup after this talk.\n\n\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
