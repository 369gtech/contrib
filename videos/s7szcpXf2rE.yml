description: "Mike Lockwood, Erik Gilling, Jeff Brown\r\n\r\nYou have always been able to connect an Android device to your computer, but until now there was no way for Android applications to interact with other hardware via USB. In this talk we cover new support in Android 3.1 for USB input devices, as well as new APIs for applications to communicate with peripherals via USB. The APIs support both Android powered devices that act as a conventional USB host, and non-host Android devices that communicates with a new class of USB hosts known as \"Android USB Accessories\". Cool hardware is involved."
