description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nElixir + Nerves + keys = Elixir keyboard! \nby\nAndré Albuquerque\n\nABSTRACT\nBuilding embedded software used to be hard: you had to think about firmware updates, how to configure the low-level network stack, be mindful about the edge cases that will render your device inoperable, just to name a few. In this talk we'll understand how Nerves simplifies all this, letting us use Elixir to build embedded software. And to illustrate how awesome it is to use Elixir in this context, we'll create a keyboard controller from scratch with Nerves and a Raspberry Pi Zero.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - André Albuquerque\nAndré Albuquerque is a senior software engineer at Hopin and one of the authors of the Mastering Elixir book. At Hopin he uses Elixir, Ruby and Python to develop and scale the current microservice architecture. He has a master's degree in distributed systems and software engineering, and, during his seven years working in the banking industry, he obtained a master's degree in economics. In his spare time he likes to build his own keyboards and work on the Interceptor Elixir library.\n\n---\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: https://www.elixirconf.eu/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU"
