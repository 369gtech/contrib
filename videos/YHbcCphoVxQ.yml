description: "It is time to talk about ‘agile Leadership’.\nReflecting on 7 years of experience in the Israeli army I’ll be sharing stories and insights about how the army REALLY operates.\nThe army is not as ‘Command & Control’ as people commonly expects – it is much more empowering and agile than you’d think.\nAt the army, I’ve learnt the true meaning of cross functional teams, the importance of reflection, feedback, creative problem solving, trust, teamwork, conflict resolution, resilience & responding to change.\nThis talk will be intertwined with army (and civilian) war stories & tips for leaders in an agile world. This talk aims to inspire a new wave of Agile Leaders, through sharing examples of effective leadership, it draws on real, lived experiences and concepts (directly from the ‘horse mouth’) as well as useful takeaways that attendees can take back and apply to their work.\n\nVisionary and goal oriented leader. IT Executive with demonstrated experience in planning, developing, and implementing cutting edge Information Solutions.\n\nVered’s strengths are: leadership & influencing skills, strategic planning and creative problem-solving.  \n\nWith a vast military background and experience (7 years – rank Major) Vered is a true feminist experienced in pushing through in male dominated industries like the Army and the Technology space.\n\nLeading high preforming, innovative culture through excel leadership skills. Experienced in software application development, product and portfolio management of cross functional teams.\n\n20+ years of IT experience including 14+ years of Solutions & Systems Design, Development, Implementation and Support.\n\nFor more on YOW!
