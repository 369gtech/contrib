description: "Miriam Busch, CTO, Karlmax Berlin\n\nSHOULD WE FLUTTER?\nCross-Plattform Development, Talk, Beginner\n\nYou probably heard of Flutter, \"yet another crossplattform system\". It claims to provide a fast and fun way to create high quality apps. Should you or your Android team consider giving it a try?\n\nLet me spoil the answer: It depends.\n\nI will walk you through some questions and considerations, introducing Flutter concepts as we go. You'll hear from our experience building a first client's app with Flutter. Hopefully, in the end, you'll have your answer whether Flutter is an option for your team and project.\n\nThe talk is a high-level opininated overview, suitable for Android developers as well as people in non-developer roles. If you're already a well-educated Flutter lover or hater, you're welcome for the discussion, too."
