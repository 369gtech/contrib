Companies make a common mistake to think that they can implement microservices without upskilling efficiently their developers and getting them on an appropriate learning curve. Another mistake is that the IT department is often working on their own when the involvement of other departments is a key to success in this migration. Additionally, IT usually lacks clear roadmaps and a real incremental and iterative approach. Most of the time, companies develop a Hype Driven Development syndrome with often only superficial knowledge and without having defined the right segregation of concerns in an environment ( monitoring, service discovering, circuit breaker, containers, etc. ). They give in to mature in-vogue architectures without solid prerequisites leading them early on to a complex architecture system (agnosticity, etc.) and decisions over the architecture set without a clear definition of boundaries and real needs (where, when, how toâ€™s). We will see how my customers managed to get out of their migration nightmare successfully by changing their approach.\n\nMike Francois\nAPI Architect, Java craftman specialized on Java SE/EE (Jakarta EE) technologies and API / SOA Management with Governance.
