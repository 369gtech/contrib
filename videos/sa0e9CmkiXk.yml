description: "Maintaining different software environments to run multiple web projects is a time-consuming task. Have you ever returned to an old project, only to find that you have to reinstall older versions of software before even starting any work? This problem is compounded by developer environments across the team varying in hardware, OS versions, and development software.\n\nDocker is a virtualisation-like technology which enables you to run software in a fixed environment but without the speed problems normally associated with a virtual machine.\n\nThis enables us to specify versions of project dependencies, server software, tooling and operating systems, storing these alongside the project. Any developer can now run any project in the company very easily, reducing setup time, and freeing you up from troubleshooting system configurations.\n\nThis talk describes how we have introduced docker and docker-compose at Incuna to package python and front-end projects, saving hours of developer time and stress.\n\n\nAbout Graham Gilchrist\n\nI’m the lead front-end developer at Incuna Ltd, a digital agency based in Oxford specialising in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nAs lead developer, I’m responsible for setting technical direction, software architecture decisions and code standards for the front-end team, but I love getting my hands dirty at the business end of coding, and I’m currently working with technologies like AngularJS, BackboneJS, Sass and Grunt to name only a few.\n\nI also really enjoy mentoring junior developers. My philosophy is that the more you share your knowledge, the more you can delegate and improve the productivity of the whole team."
