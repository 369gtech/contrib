She originally started as a programmer but got interested in machine learning early on and did a mathematics PhD at the University of Cambridge, developing new machine learning methods to analyze complex biomedical datasets.\n\nAfter that she worked on data analysis in cancer research and now sheâ€™s joining the Alan Turing Institute as a data scientist.\n\nHow to look like a statistician: a developer's guide to probabilistic programming\nMachine learning is sneaking into everything, even into functional programming languages! Probabilistic programming integrates standard programming with probabilistic machine learning - and allows people to write probabilistic models without having to care about how they are evaluated and all the mathematical details underneath. In the talk, I'll show you what is probabilistic programming about and how it works - and why you don't need a PhD in statistics to write a Bayesian machine learning model.\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/evelina-gabasova"
