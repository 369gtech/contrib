description: "What makes women want to choose a technologist role as their career choice? We’ll talk to three IT leaders and active VMware Tanzu Vanguards as they share their experiences, challenges, accomplishments, and advice on how to make it as a woman in the IT industry. \nSome core questions we’ll explore:\n- What specifically drew you to this field? \n- How do you [or would you] encourage young women to pursue this field? \n- Who were [or are] your role models? What did they do specifically to encourage you to go down the IT path?\n- How does gender adversity play in DevOps?\n- How have your unique skills and passion helped drive change in the organization?\n- How has your diversity of being a woman helped you in your IT role? Do you think it gives you a different perspective? \n- How have the outside groups [e.g., Vanguards and/or other organizations] helped you to succeed?\n\nKerry Schaffer, Senior IT Director at OneMagnify; \nYvonne Brye-Vela, Manager at VMware; \nShuchi Mittal, Director Formation Labs at Fiserv; \nMiranda LeBlanc, Solutions Engineer at Liberty Mutual Insurance; \nMadison Schlegel, Customer Advocacy Program Manager at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/girls-can-do-it"
