description: "CF Application Runtime on CF Container Runtime (Kubernetes) - Thinh Nguyen, EMC\n\n Due to CF Application Runtime(CFAR) and CF Container Runtime (CFCR) benefits, we use them for automating applications deployments in the cloud. However, as CFAR usually underutilizes its cloud infrastructure due to its large resource consumption, we experimentally put its components on top of CFCR. As a result, we got a utilized and scalable combination that brings the best of both platforms for cloud application deployments. \n\nAbout Thinh Nguyen\nSoftware Engineer 2 at Dell EMC under Technology Research and Innovation Group.
