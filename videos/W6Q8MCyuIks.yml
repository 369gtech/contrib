We will explore the costs and timelines involved in producing your designs in small and large quantities, and compare the benefits of working with vendors versus managing the process in-house.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/D0D4VE\nWatch more Android talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/c0LWYl\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/Q1bFGY\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/pmO4Dr\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\n#io17 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2017 #AndroidThings"
