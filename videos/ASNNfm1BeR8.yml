description: '10 years after the publication of "The Laws of Simplicity", what can we still learn as game designers from John Maeda''s seminal work? By drawing on our current experience with our first non-narrative project (local multiplayer "SIHEYU4N") and on examples of independent games that best embody Maeda''s rules, we''ll be looking into the relationship between simplicity and complexity and how video games can creatively tackle such a fascinating issue.'
