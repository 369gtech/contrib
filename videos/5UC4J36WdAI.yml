description: "Chris Antenesse, Sr. Software Engineer - Infrastructure at Socotra - ChefConf 2017\n\nTokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets are vital to applications and infrastructure functioning properly. In the modern world of rapid, continuous delivery, we want to maintain agility and keep our secrets safe. While speed and safety feel mutually exclusive, modern tools with appropriate practices enable both at the same time. This talk will discuss patterns and show practical methods for keeping secrets safe from developer environments to production where tight access controls and continuous delivery are priorities."
