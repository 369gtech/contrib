description: "For application developers, reduced development time and development effort plays a large part in increasing productivity. Spring Boot aims at increasing developer productivity by providing a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for all Spring development. In addition to that, once the application is up and running, the development experience of growing and maintaining the application is equally important. Things such as IDE support, faster tests, and helpful debugging tools all contribute towards increased productivity for an application developer. \n\nIn this talk, we'll start with how to get up and running quickly with a Spring Boot application using Spring Boot features such as dependency management and starters. We'll then look at how you can enhance your application development process with tools that Spring Boot provides, such as devtools, autocompletion for configuration files, test slices, debugging options, and more.\n\n\nSpeaker: Madhura Bhave; Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/how-to-get-productive-with-spring-boot/SpringCentral/how-to-get-productive-with-spring-boot"
