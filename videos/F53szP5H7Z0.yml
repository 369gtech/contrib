title: 'Dissecting HelloWorld: Kotlin & Java by Simon Schell'

description: "We know HelloWorld: same ol', same ol'. But most of the time, we don't look close enough. Bytecode is a great tool for helping us understand the inner workings of our JVM languages. Even this simple application already includes a lot of internal functionalities.\n\nThis session will dissect every detail, every nook-and-craney of the generated class files.\n\nTo make things a little bit more interesting for those already familiar with Java Bytecode, we will do the same for HelloWorld in Kotlin and compare them with each other.\n\nIf you have always wanted to take a look at the inner workings of both languages, but didn't know where to start, this is the session for you!\n\nSimon Schell:\nSoftware Engineer and internal Developer Advocate at Provinzial Rheinland in Germany. I love to tinker with and break down every piece of code i can find. Currently i'm focussing on Kotlin and Java, especially the transition between or combination of both. I'm also vividly in love with Asciidoc, which i use to write pretty much every content for my company."
