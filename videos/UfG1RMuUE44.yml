description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nJanuary 21, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Linda Nathan.\r\n\r\nBoston Arts Academy comprises an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse student body, yet 95 percent of its graduates are accepted to college. This remarkable success rate, says Principal Linda Nathan, is in large part due to asking the right questions and being open to seeking answers collaboratively with faculty, parents, and the students themselves.\r\n \r\nIn her new book, The Hardest Questions Aren't on the Test: Lessons from an Innovative Urban School, Nathan gives insights into the process of grappling with these questions, attempting to implement solutions, and evaluating the outcomes. Stories that are inspirational as well as heartbreaking reveal the missteps and failures—as well as the successes. Nathan doesnt claim to have all the answers, but seeks to share the philosophies and practices that have worked for the BAA. Principals, educators, and parents will find many new ideas to bring to their own schools.\r\n\r\nChapters focus on questions all schools can consider, such as:\r\n·       How and why does a school develop a shared vision of what it stands for?\r\n·       What makes a great teacher, and how can a principal help good teachers improve?\r\n·       Why must schools talk openly about race and achievement, and what happens when they do?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Hardest-Questions-Arent-Test-Innovative/dp/0807032743/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1263322944&sr=8-1\r\n\r\nSpeaker Info:  Linda Nathan\r\n\r\nLinda was instrumental in starting Boston's first performing-arts middle school, and was a driving force behind the creation of Fenway High School, recognized nationally for its innovative educational strategies and school-to-work programs.
