description: "Jurgen Appelo offers concrete games, tools, and practices so you can introduce better management, with fewer managers.\n\nJurgen calls himself a creative networker. But sometimes he's a writer, speaker, trainer, entrepreneur, illustrator, manager, blogger, reader, dreamer, leader, freethinker, or… Dutch guy.\n\nSince 2008 Jurgen writes a popular blog at www.noop.nl, covering the creative economy, agile management, and personal development. He is the author of the book Management 3.0, which describes the role of the manager in agile organizations. And he wrote the little book How to Change the World, which describes a supermodel for change management.\n\nJurgen is CEO of the business network Happy Melly, and co-founder of the Agile Lean Europe network and the Stoos Network. He is also a speaker who is regularly invited to talk at business seminars and conferences around the world.\n\nManagement 3.0 WORKOUT\n\nManagement 3.0 Workout is about concrete management advice. Practical things that people can do next Monday morning, in order to grow an organization that is fit and healthy. And not only managers, but everyone who is concerned about the organization. Because, management is too important to leave to the managers. The whole organization should participate in the workout.\n\nHow can we measure team performance?\nHow can we decide on salaries and bonuses?\nHow can we define career paths?\nHow can we replace performance appraisals?\nHow can we motivate our workers?\n\nManagers are expected to be “servant leaders” and “systems thinkers”. With Management 3.0 Workout you will learn how you can have better management with fewer managers."
