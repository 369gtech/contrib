description: "Google Tech Talk\nMay 29, 2015\n(\"show more\" for more information)\nPresented by Oliver Charles\n\nhttps://wiki.haskell.org/ZuriHac2015#Oliver_Charles\n\nABSTRACT\n\nFor many people, Haskell is not their first programming language - a lot of us learnt to program in other languages like Python or Java, and would like to be able to use Haskell to solve practical problems. However, what seem to be simple web applications in other languages can be daunting to even begin using Haskell. In this talk, we'll look at how to build a small web application to allow ZuriHac participants to share what they have been working on. We'll use the Spock web framework along with postgresql-simple to build a basic CRUD application, and see how we can start prototyping a simple web application within minutes.\n\nSlides for this talk are available here:\nhttps://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/blob/master/meetups/20150529-ZuriHac2015_Oliver_Charles-Web_Programming/talk.pdf"
