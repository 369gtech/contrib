description: "Building Better Worlds: Developing a Procedural City Tool for Alien: Covenant\n\nhttp://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nWhen MPC was asked to create a massive CG city for the film Alien: Covenant, they looked to leverage procedural generation as a means for iterating on the overall shape and structure of the city, in place of a prohibitively large team of environment artists. After evaluating all the practical third party options, it was ultimately decided that the best option was to build a custom tool to procedurally assist artists' city-building skills. This allowed for rapid iteration on the overall look of the city by striking a balance between manual and procedural techniques. \n\nThe core algorithms were written in C++ for speed. The user interface was written in Python to accommodate quick feature changes, and a dash of Fabric Engine's KL helped with model import and rendering. This multi-language approach allowed the consistent application of the \"best tool for the job\" rule, which is a common pattern at MPC, allowing flexible teams with experts in a variety of skillsets. \n\nThis talk will detail the history and development of MPC's city building tool, \"Machi\". Alan Bucior, Lead Developer of Machi, reviews the algorithms for city layout and building placement, discusses how to implement algorithms in an artist-driven manner, and shares various insights gleaned through the development process and discussion with stakeholders.\n— \nAlan Bucior: Lead Software Developer, MPC Film\n\nAlan Bucior is a lead software developer at MPC, with over 20 years of experience developing software in the entertainment industry.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
