description: "Dylan wrote his first web page in 1992 and never looked back. He's the systems architect at Spotlight, the UK's leading casting service for professional actors, where he works on distributed systems, hypermedia APIs and, and the challenges involved in introducing scalable architecture in a company where legacy systems generate most of the revenue.\n\nDylan is a Microsoft MVP and a regular speaker at conferences and user groups, where he's spoken about topics including continuous delivery, Conway's Law, the history of the web, federated authentication and hypermedia APIs. When he's not wrangling code, he plays guitar and writes songs about code."
