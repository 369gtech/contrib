title: 'Csaba Hoch -  The quest for the best IDE - Code BEAM STO'
language: English
recordingDate: 1542809799
description: "There are quite a few IDEs that provide a certain amount of support for Erlang programming. These include text editors such as Vim and Emacs, and proper IDEs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code. Most people pick an IDE and stick to it, maybe switch once after looking enviously to a fellow programmer's toolset.\n\nIn this talk, we will expore the world of IDEs from the perspective of an Erlang developer. What are the features that we can expect from an IDE? How different are the feature sets provided by different IDEs? How easy is it to extend these IDEs with custom features? What can the Erlang plugins of the IDEs learn from each other?\n\nMore details on website: https://codesync.global/speaker/csaba-hoch/"
