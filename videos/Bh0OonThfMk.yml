description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Hadi Tok, Citizenme.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=175635\n\nfindViewById() has been something Android developers tried to avoid to reduce boilerplate and we has different ways to access the views from the code side. I will give a brief introduction to how views are created from the xml, how findViewById() works and I will talk about the alternatives like ViewBindings, DataBindings, Kotlin Synthetics and how they work. I will also talk about Compose which is the future of the android UI."
