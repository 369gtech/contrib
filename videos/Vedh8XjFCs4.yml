recordingDate: 1523543200
description: "A community conversation is a space for community initiatives to discuss what they're working on with the community.\_\n\nAs part of ongoing efforts to improve Drupal's community governance, the Drupal Community Working Group (CWG) was tasked by the Drupal Association and Dries Buytaert with defining next steps in the process. The CWG solicited volunteers from the Drupal community interested in governance, creating a group of community members to strategize how to involve as many people as possible. This new group then decided to hold public meetings to get feedback on next steps from the community.\n\nThe group facilitated a series of public, online meetings in an effort to solicit feedback from a broad range of community members. In this session, members of that group will report on the results of those meetings, as well as the community discussions and governance survey that led to them.\n\nThis conversation is a space to provide a retrospective of the entire process and facilitate a discussion on how to get more people involved in community governance.\n\nFor more information, see these previous blog posts:\nhttps://www.drupal.org/association/blog/evolving-community-governance-survey-results-and-a-call-to-action\nhttps://www.drupal.org/community/blog/community-governance-meeting-takeaways"
