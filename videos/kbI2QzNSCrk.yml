description: "Remember isometric games, like SimCity 2000 and Q*bert? Real life sadly doesn’t look like Q*bert, and it’s mostly because parallel lines converge! Why does this happen? We’ll use simple geometric rules to explain how cameras turn light, a five-dimensional (!) spatial variable, into a pattern of pixels. With computers, we can algorithmically alter that pattern, and synthesize impossible perspectives from real data. (Including some inspired by your retro-gaming faves!) Finally, we’ll discuss how image formation models might change the way we think about the world around us!\n\nEVENT:\n\n!!Con 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nLogan Williams\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2HAYaPdhWI"
