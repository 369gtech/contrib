description: "Manually creating and managing a handful of containers in a production environment is one thing. But at some point, organizations and teams cross a threshold. That specific point will differ by organization, but after this point, the idea of manually patching, testing, and deploying a fleet of containers will become too much. \n\nTanzu Build Service make the process of creating OCI-compliant images easier for development teams. And by giving operations teams a centralized control plane for updating and patching applications, it automates the process of patching and updating containers as well. This keeps your environment more secure, while also increasing the effectiveness of development teams.\n\nFor more information on Tanzu Build Service, check out the Getting Started blog post: https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/practitioners/getting-started-with-vmware-tanzu-build-service-1-0\n\nOr go straight to the official documentation website: https://docs.pivotal.io/build-service/installing.html"
