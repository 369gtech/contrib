description: "André Almeida\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/99/\n\nfutex2 is a work in progress system call to replace the current futex implementation. This new interface will have features to allow better resources utilization from the system, like NUMA-awareness, and different futexes' sizes. This talk will provide an overview of the interface, along with the current state of the development and some initial results that we got by modifying Proton/Wine to use it.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSat Jan 23 10:45:00 2021 at Tux Theatre"
