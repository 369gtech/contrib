description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Chaos Engineering Day 2021. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nChristina Yakomin - Senior Technical Lead for SRE at Vanguard\n\nABSTRACT\nWeather alert!!\nVanguard's Chaos and Resilience Engineering team has implemented a home-grown Chaos Engineering platform, \"The Climate of Chaos\", featuring self-service experiments with meteorology-themed names like Cyclone, Tornado, and Blizzard.\nIn this session, we'll break down the fundamentals of chaos engineering, the value of the practice, and why we decided to build our own platform from scratch, rather than leveraging a vendor product or an open source library. We'll also get into the details of our architecture, our client engagement model, our risk management strategy, and our integrated observability and reporting tooling. By running targeted experiments with our custom tool suite, we have ensured that our systems are ready to weather any storm, no matter how much chaos is in the forecast [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:50 What is Chaos Engineering?\n03:23 Why is Chaos Engineering valuable?\n04:59 Build vs buy\n06:53 The climate of chaos\n08:24 Our guiding principles\n08:43 Serverless architecture\n11:28 Easy adoption\n13:28 Defined guardrails\n15:42 Integrated reporting\n17:22 What's next for our team?\n21:00 Outro\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.us/chaos-day-2021/sessions/1722/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-chaos-signs-signs-everywhere-a-sign-what-five-man-electrical-band-and-todd-conklin-taught-me-about-chaos-engineering\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nShortridge & Rinehart • Security Chaos Engineering • https://www.verica.io/sce-book\nNora Jones & Casey Rosenthal • Chaos Engineering • https://www.verica.io/book\nNora Jones & Casey Rosenthal • Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/3hUmuAH\nMikolaj Pawlikowski • Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/2SQ5Olf\nRuss Miles • Learning Chaos Engineering • https://amzn.to/3hCiUe8\nMurphy, Beyer, Jones & Petoff • Site Reliability Engineering • https://amzn.to/2Vg6Mbr\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ChaosEngineering #SRE #DNS #GameDay #Production #SSH #Container #Security #SecurityChaosEngineering #Resilience #Serverless #AWS #AWSDynamoDB #AWSCloudWatch #AWSECSFargate #AWSLambda\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
