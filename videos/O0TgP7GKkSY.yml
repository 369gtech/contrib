description: "Have you ever wondered if the foundations of FP could be redesigned from the ground up? In this talk we'll use a logical framework called \"sequent calculus\" to define an alternative system to the lambda calculus and see the benefits this will bring us, demystifying continuations in the process.\n\nSequent calculus is a logical formalism invented in 1930s with the aim of analyzing the construction of mathematical proofs. It turns out that applying it to programming gives us a certain \"assembly language for FP\" that reveals various symmetries of computation: producing/consuming, values/contexts, strictness/laziness and so forth. This computational version of sequent calculus is known under several names in academia, one of them being \"system L\". In the talk a functional dependently typed language Idris will be used to implement a toy version of system L and prove some of its properties.\n\nSlides: \nhttps://slides.com/clayrat/seqcalc-fby/\nhttps://github.com/clayrat/sequent-calc-talk/"
