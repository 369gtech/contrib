description: "Speaker: Chen Huijing and Yeo Kheng Meng\r\n\r\nI am super excited to collaborate with my fellow retro-computing enthusiast, co-organiser of Hackware, and total not-web developer, Kheng Meng on this CSS challenge.\r\n\r\nBasically, he will run a working copy of Windows 3.1 with IE3 installed, and I will load a site I built on it to see if it displays properly. Challenge is I will NOT test on the machine beforehand. This will either be spectacular or a spectacular failure, we see how.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/SingaporeCSS/events/259235992/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Vina Rianti\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/ozqr/"
