title: 'In-Database Container for Hadoop: When MapReduce Meets RDBMS'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784709
description: "Apart from Twitter, LinkedIn, Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, Amazon, and so on, the source of big data is predominantly transactional data in RDBMSs. For analyzing RDBMS data with MapReduce, you either ship the data to an external MapReduce cluster (data shipping) or bring MapReduce to the RDBMS (function shipping). This session describes a database-resident Hadoop container for running Hadoop mappers and reducers directly against RDBMS tables. In addition, the integration of Hadoop job steps in SQL queries makes it easier for non-Java developers to reuse them transparently. The session also discusses big data requirements beyond the MapReduce phase, including the warehousing phase, and quality of service (QoS) requirements (security, manageability, integration).\n\n\nAuthors:\nKuassi Mensah\nundefined\nView more trainings by Kuassi Mensah at https://www.parleys.com/author/kuassi-mensah-1\n\nGarret Swart\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Garret Swart at https://www.parleys.com/author/garret-swart\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
