title: 'DevTools and Headless Chrome - The Automation Power-Couple - Yonatan Mevorach | Render Conf 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1523529600
description: "In this talk we'll see what problems we can fix (or better yet, avoid) by combining two things developers love: Chrome DevTools and automating repetitive tasks.\n\nTo do this we'll use a new capability introduced in Chrome 59: running Chrome in \"Headless Mode\". Firstly we'll show the powers of each of these tools separately. We'll use DevTools to debug other platforms like node.js, and we'll use Chrome in Headless Mode to run tests, take screenshots, and to scrape sites for data.\n\nThen we'll explore how by combining the two you can perform any DevTools action from code. Using this approach you can have DevTools work for you around-the-clock and monitor everything about your app (amount of unused CSS\\JS, memory footprint, etc.). After attending this talk prepare to never say \"Sorry I can't automate this\" ever again."
