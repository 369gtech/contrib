description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSave Your Services from Sneaky Snoops With SPIFFE? - Daniel Feldman, Scytale \n\nLurking inside almost every cloud native project is a hidden threat: hardcoded credentials for services like external APIs and databases. While these credentials can be set to long random strings and encrypted, they still can be stolen by an intruder or accidentally misused by insiders. In this talk, we’ll demonstrate how to use CNCF’s SPIFFE and SPIRE Projects to securely authenticate to workloads such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and AWS from inside your services, all without any hardcoded credentials -- eliminating an entire class of security vulnerabilities while decreasing your work as a DevSecOps team.\n\nhttps://sched.co/aDcB"
