description: "Tensor networks have been used in Physics to find efficient expressions of many-body quantum systems, describing systems from materials to holographic spacetime. As it happens, one can also use tensor networks in machine learning. Exploring the equivalence between these two affords us intuition on inductive bias, which is the set of assumptions that determine our choice of machine learning model.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
