description: "Speaker: Ankita Shukla (IIT Roorkee)\n\nTalk of 20 minutes\n\nI developed an extension - Collaborative Spelling Dictionary, during my intern with the Wikimedia Foundation under the Outreach program of Gnome. After my intern, I created issues in the same extension for newbies to fix and guided them constantly giving them an easy and smooth entry into the open source community. I also mentored the extension's issues in Google Code In this year and had several students submitting their patches for the same, successfully closing number of the open issues. I'll use the opportunity to explain and demonstrate this extension to the FOSSASIA attendees and talk about the step by step process involved in building an extension. This would particularly be useful for anyone aiming to work on and develop extensions to be used for any wiki-project (which are already quite popular these days). Moreover, the extension still has scope for further development. In order to be able to contribute to the extension, it is important to understand how the extension works currently, so I would like to explain about this project and its code architecture and also discuss the possible features and their implementations during my talk. I also plan on giving a demo of my work on my laptop (if time allows) so that the audience gets a better idea about the project.\n\nAbout Ankita Shukla:\n\nAnkita is a Computer Science senior at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. She has been a contributor to FOSS for almost 3 years now. In 2014, she interned with Wikimedia under Gnome’s Outreach Program for Women (now Outreachy) on a project entitled “Collaborative Spelling Dictionary”. Ankita mentored for Mediawiki projects this year at Google Code In 2015 and Gnome Outreachy. She’s also guiding two high-school mentees under the #include fellowship program this year.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.fossasia.org/schedule/#BD-02\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCby/"
