description: "As part of his work, Chris and his team at Google are responsible for managing libraries for 150 APIs across 7 languages. This results in a crushing amount of toil, making it hard at times to both make forward progress and maintain what has been created.\n\nWhen you own over 70 node repositories you have to get creative. So the team decided to make an army of sorts. An army of screaming, free roaming robots.\n\n\nBots can have a freeing effect on your engineering team. Come to hear how embracing automation has let a team of engineers do what they do best and let the toil fall to the machines.\n\n\nEVENT:\nNodeJS Interactive 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nChristopher Wilcox, Google\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish the conference talk videos.\n\n\nCREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0Kyebda6kY"
