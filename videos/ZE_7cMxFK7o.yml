description: "Autoplay & the Queuing APIs for Google Cast applications enable seamless playback of multiple media items. The Media Player Library implements queue management for media items that enables users of your app to add/delete/move and view the history of items theyâ€™ve played.\n\nThe Autoplay feature provides a way to pre-buffer media items that are about to play so that seamless playback between media clips is enabled. Learn how Autoplay and the Queuing APIs work, then explore more using the Google Developers website documentation.\n\nImplementing Autoplay and Queuing in Google Cast enabled applications is a great way to enhance the user experience and increase user retention.\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/cast/docs/player\nhttps://developers.google.com/cast/docs/autoplay\n\n#GoogleCast\n\n100 Days of Google Dev / 100 developer videos over 100 days / #GoogleDev100\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
