description: "RubyConf 2018 - Branch in Time by Tekin Suleyman\n\nIn one timeline, a quick path to clarity. In the other, a long and painful journey trying to understand the obscure intent of a line of code. The only difference between the two realities? The revision history...\n\nThis is a story about writing maintainable software. But rather than the code itself, weâ€™ll see how a well-crafted revision history is as important to maintainability as choosing the right abstraction. We'll explore the differences between a useful history and an unhelpful one. And you'll learn about the practices, tools and techniques that help make the difference."
