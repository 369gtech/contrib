description: 'After almost a year of working from home with all team mates, except one, 6 to 9 time zones away it''s time to reflect. In a normal work day there is no face-to-face time. With some team mates there is not even any overlapping office hours. How do work around that? What works? what doesn''t? This talk will summarize my personal experience of the problems and joys of working from home with team mates far away. I will share what I have learned and tell a few anecdotes. I don''t claim to have all the answers, but you considering working remotely I just might be able to give you a sneak peek at what''s in store.'
