description: "Speaker: Julien Dubois\nSlides:http://www.slideshare.net/julien.dubois/jhipster-for-spring-boot-webinar\nJHipster focuses on generating a high quality application with a Java back-end using an extensive set of Spring technologies; Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring MVC (providing a framework for websockets, REST and MVC), etc. an Angular.js front-end and a suite of pre-configured development tools like Yeoman, Maven, Gradle, Grunt, Gulp.js and Bower. JHipster creates a fully configured Spring Boot application with a set of pre-defined screens for user management, monitoring, and logging. The generated Spring Boot application is specifically tailored to make working with Angular.js a smoother experience. Join Julien for a quick-live coding session to build a simple application, and deploy it to Cloud Foundry."
