description: "Spring I/O 2016 - 19 -20 May Barcelona\n\nIn this talk i'm gonna explain how you can create your own Spring Boot Starter and how a custom starter can help you to create shared modules for your application, being it \"standard\" web applications or micro services without having the Spring context scan all jars in the classpath.\n\nYou'll learn to facilitate various conditions how to decide whether you're starter kicks in or not.\n\nAs Spring Boot is all about banners we'll try to provide a custom Thymeleaf element that generates your banner inside a HTML page.\n\nPutting that to real world usage, I'll present a custom starter that helps my company to manage our JavaScript libraries in our products."
