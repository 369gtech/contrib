description: "James Forman, Callum Dickinson\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/106/\n\nHot Potato is a message broker for monitoring systems. It sits in between monitoring systems and messaging providers to ensure consistent relaying of messages to on-call staff.\r\n\r\nHot Potato was designed and developed in New Zealand to survive the harshest worst-case scenarios a selection of difficult sysadmins could come up with. The project has proven itself to be easy to maintain, scale and unobtrusive so your on-call staff can get back to sleep easier.\r\n\r\nUsing Hot Potato won't require you to change your processes, ticketing system, rotations, providers or upset your on-call people. This talk will cover what Hot Potato is, where it fits, how it works, how we got here and what we have been doing to make our on-call staff happier.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Hot Potato project is to give on-call people control and freedom while giving your notifications every chance of arriving when you need them, through any provider or connection you might have.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
