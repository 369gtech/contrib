description: "Kotlin is that dark horse of JVM languages. It has gained prominence in the recent times for various good reasons. But, what does Kotlin really mean to Java programmers? In this presentation we will explore the language, learn about its key strengths and capabilities, take a peek under the hood to what itâ€™s capabilities mean on the Java eco system, and how and where we can benefit from it.\n\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with sustainable agile practices on their software projects.\n\nVenkat is a (co)author of multiple technical books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer.
