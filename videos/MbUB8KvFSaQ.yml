title: 'YOW! 2019 - Dwight Sullivan - Game Developer or Game Designer?'
recordingDate: 1581883202
description: "In the last 30 years I have been a software engineer, a game developer, and a game designer. My YOW talk will be about the difference of those three titles. When my current boss asked me what I wanted my new title to be I choose Senior Game Developer. To me a game developer is something in between someone that implements rules and a game designer.\n\nIn the 1980s I taught myself to write software and make games on my Commodore 64. After College, in 1989, I landed a job developing the software for pinball machines, writing code in 6809 assembler. I am still doing that today except its in C++. Developing games is a blast but its been a journey of challenges and solutions. My YOW talks will also be about the challenges of creating something fun, on time and on budget, of course.\n\nIn the 1980s I taught myself to write software and make games on my Commodore 64.
