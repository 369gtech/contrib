description: "Intro: Kubernetes (Release) SIG - Tim Pepper, VMware & Claire Laurence, Pivotal \n\nSIG Release and the Release Team are looking for volunteers! This session will feature past and current release team members describing what the Release Team does: We will discuss how Kubernetes project volunteers manage the quarterly release cadence of the project, give an overview of the release process, release team roles, and how these support the SIG Release goal of producing high quality Kubernetes releases on a reliable schedule. We will highlight the opportunities for both new and experienced community members (like you, including especially folks in Europe!) to get involved, across a broad range of specialties and technical work. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPhy"
