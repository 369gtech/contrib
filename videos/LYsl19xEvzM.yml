title: 'Patterns: The New Defacto Scrum Standard - James Coplien'
recordingDate: 1379507035
description: "Scrum emerged partly from pattern foundations, as acknowledged both by the father of Scrum, Jeff Sutherland, and by the grandfather of Scrum, Ikujiru Nonaka-sensei. \n\nPatterns are the new defacto Scrum standard. In recent years, international Scrum Leadership has been meeting about once a year to write a rationalized foundation for Scrum using Organizational Patterns\nas a public resource. This is the most inclusive forum for segments of the Scrum community meet and find common ground in the deep groundings of Scrum, and it is converging on a socially agreed definition while the certifying bodies have take less compelling paths. Jeff Sutherland's Scrum training now revolves around the application of seven Scrum patterns.\n\nUsing the same approach used to derive the original organizational patterns back when it all started, teams can assess themselves and their Scrum practice. Patterns provide concrete foundations that the team together can improvise and use to improve themselves and to strive for that state of hyperproductivity that modern Scrum teams are realizing and enjoying. They're a shortcut for tapping into years of insight from the top Scrum experts world-wide.\n\nJames \"Cope\" Coplien is the father of Organizational Patterns, is one of the\nfounders of the Software Pattern discipline, a pioneer in practical object-oriented design in the early 1990s and is a widely consulted authority, author, and trainer in the areas of software design and organizational improvements. As one of the founders and proponents of Agile software development, one of Cope's passions is to work with the inventors of Scrum to facilitate its evolution as formalized in the Scrum Guide. He also is actively leading the work in Agile Architecture in conjunction the Scrum community. Most recently he has been working with Trygve Reenskaug to take the DCI architecture forward.\n\nBorn out of the desire to create a year round conference like atmosphere, Foo Café is THE place for planned and spontaneous meetings of all sizes and interests within the IT arena.\nEnjoy a coffee or a cold beer, along with light pub fare, and engage with other like minded individuals interested in sharing their knowledge and learning from one another. Foo Café is sourced by individuals, small, medium and goliath-sized enterprises, as well as entrepreneurs. Awaiting you, after stepping over the Foo Café threshold, is a space that is recruitment and product placement safe!\n\nWe look forward to igniting inspiration and creativity year round to patrons of Foo Café."
