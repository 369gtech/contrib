description: "The open source project openHAB makes it possible to realize home automation use cases beyond the ordinary in no time. But because it is a pure software project that requires technical skills for being set up, its target audience consists mainly of tech-savvy people and early adopters. The derived Eclipse SmartHome project leads the way from the niche to the mass market by fostering industry adoption as it provides a flexible framework with many options for building smart home solutions. You will learn in this session about the challenges of transforming an open source project into a commercially friendly framework and why Java is a good choice for it. And you will, of course, see a smart home live demo that goes way beyond the normal use cases.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJochen Hiller\nJochen Hiller is working for Connected Home department of Deutsche Telekom.
