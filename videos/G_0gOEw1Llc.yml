We are excited to offer reactive programming full web tier support with WebFlux, WebFlux.fn and client side HTTP, alongside the traditional blocking Spring MVC model. \n\nThe release of Spring Boot 2.0 debuts major new additional capabilities like micrometer.io. It completely overhauls security, actuators, and the gradle plugin, as well as updating many naming conventions and data formats. \n\nThere is a lot to learn, so reserve your seat with Phil Webb and the Spring Boot team as they help you navigate the new bits. Build something meaningful with Spring Boot 2.0!"
