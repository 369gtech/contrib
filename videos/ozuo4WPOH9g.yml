description: "Aperture: A Non-Cooperative, Client-Side Load Balancing Algorithm\n\nRuben Oanta and Bryce Anderson, Twitter\n\nTwitter's RPC framework, Finagle, employs non-cooperative, client-side load balancing. That is, clients make load balancing decisions independently. Although this architecture continues to serve Twitter well, it also comes with some unique trade-offs and challenges. In particular, it scales poorly as service clusters grow to thousands of instances. In this talk, we will dive deeper into the problem space and how we addressed it via an algorithm we call \"Aperture.\"\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
