recordingDate: 1497042707
description: "Tim Smith, Community Engineer at Chef - ChefConf 2017\n\nAutomated infrastructure allows us to move fast, but moving fast is scary without proper testing. Where to start though? The state of the art in Chef cookbook testing has changed rapidly in the last few years with the introduction of new and improved tools and much of what you'll find in Web searches is often outdated. In this presentation I'll give an overview of the available tools for testing and techniques to avoid busy work in your testing. We'll cover cookbook linting, unit testing, and integration testing using Cookstyle, ChefSpec, and Test Kitchen / InSpec. We'll also cover wiring up your testing in Travis CI to perform full integration tests on every PR."
