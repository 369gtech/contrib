description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nOpenTelemetry Agent and Collector: Telemetry Built-in Into All Software - Steve Flanders, Splunk & Trask Stalnaker, Microsoft \n\nEffective observability requires high-quality telemetry. OpenTelemetry enables it by making telemetry a built-in feature of all software. Learn how easy it is to enable telemetry data collection for any app and enable observability scenarios by configuring OpenTelemetry collector. Help us build the future where all software exposes its telemetry in a unified way. Where app owners concentrate on building great software while getting insights into application behavior and reliability effortlessly. And see how the road to this future looks like. This talk will feature a demo of automatic java application instrumentation and collector configuration to upload high-quality telemetry to the backend of your choice.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZevT"
