title: 'Machine Learning with F#, Redux - Mathias Brandewinder'
recordingDate: 1506326717
description: "Machine learning and data science are currently red-hot topics. Yet, while practitioners typically use a wide range of tools and languages, .NET is conspicuously absent from the conversation. Does this mean it isn't suitable, and that we should all move to Python?\n\nIn this talk, I'll argue that the .NET ecosystem has a compelling language for machine learning and data science, namely F#. I will give a general tour of what machine learning is about, and illustrate along the way how F# fits the domain beautifully, showcasing some recent developments in the ecosystem."
