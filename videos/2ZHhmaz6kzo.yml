title: 'XState: Making Application Logic Visually Collaborative'
recordingDate: 1637309888
description: "# Join us as we chat XState, State Machines & modelling logic\n\nLogic is much more than just code. It is the user flows, the diagrams, the user stories, and the business logic that are shared with developers, designers, project managers, and other stakeholders. In this talk, we'll explore tools and techniques for unlocking application logic and making it accessible to everyone, in a highly collaborative, visual way.\n\nWith software modeling concepts and techniques like state machines, statecharts, and the actor model, even the most complex logic can be visualized, understood, simulated, and even automatically tested by the entire team, preventing bugs and drastically reducing the cost of development.\n\n## About David\n\nDavid is a software engineer who loves playing piano and is passionate about animations, state machines, cutting-edge user interfaces, and open-source. Previously at Microsoft, he is now the founder of Stately, a startup focused on building the best visual software modeling tools and services.\n\n## Agenda\n\n19:15: ~~Doors~~ Zoom Call Open\n19:30: nor(DEV): Introduction - Begin streaming to YouTube.\n19:35: Speaker Slot\n20:20: Q&A\n20:30 Close...
