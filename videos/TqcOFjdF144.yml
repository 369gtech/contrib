description: "Intro: Knative Productivity BoF - Srinivas V. Hegde & Adriano Cunha, Google \n\nKnative is Kubernetes based platform to build, deploy and manage modern serverless workloads, it extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware components that are essential to build modern, source-centric, and container-based applications that can run anywhere. The project has 8 repositories on GIT and has hundreds of contributors actively working on its repos on daily basis, which makes productivity super critical so that every contributorâ€™s time is well spent and quality of code is ensured. This talk gives an overview of how contributor productivity is achieved for Knative from 4 dimensions: test health, release health, metrics, and performance. We will go over test infrastructures in place to show how it makes writing and running tests is an easy and pleasant experience for contributors. We will explain how release is done in automated and predictable fashion, and what thoughts have gone into release design so that it also benefits other Knative personas. We will go over a set of metrics defined for Knative project health, show how we measure and track metrics at ongoing basis to drive up project health overall. We will also look at performance and explain what type of infrastructure has been built to support perf/scale/load testing. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/Grbz"
