description: "by Andrew Martin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.114/containers_istio_security.webm\n\n\nKubernetes provides multiple layers of network security including the control plane, etcd, the CNI network, network policies, and - with Istio on top - the requests between applications themselves. In this talk we explore the underlying technologies on which these layers are built using approachable examples and demonstrations. Attendees can expect to gain an understanding of these implementations and the principles behind encryption, identity, and trust in Kubernetes. \n\n\nWhat are TLS, X.509, and mutual authentication?\nWhy cloud native communication should be encrypted by default\nKubernetes component intercommunication\nCNI and network policy for applications\nBootstrapping identity with SPIFFE\nMutual TLS, route rules, and destination policies in Istio\n\n\n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 13:40:00+01"
