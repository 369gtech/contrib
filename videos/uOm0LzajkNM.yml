recordingDate: 1528731764
description: "Making a website can be a complicated process involving months of time and conflicting opinions from dozens of stakeholders. But it doesn't have to be!\n\nWith Vue, Pug and Sass as his languages, and working from a toolkit of reusable code to get running, Lemon (the creator of damn.dog and idiots.win) is going to spend this session building a website from scratch, using suggestions from the audience. In an hour's time we're going to build something. What exactly we end up is unknown, but the path getting there should prove interesting!"
