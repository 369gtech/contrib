description: "Firmata is a binary protocol that extends the MIDI protocol. It is used by many languages to talk to microcontrollers from any host machine (https://github.com/firmata/protocol). This talk will go over the details of implementing the protocol in Elixir and have some live demos of communicating from a Nerves based host machine to an Arduino Uno.\n\nDetails will include:\n\n    implementing I2C sensors,\n    ultra-sonic distance sensors\n    analog sensors.\n\nChristopher is one of the maintainers of the Elixir Firmata library (https://github.com/entone/firmata) and a Core member of the Nerves development team (http://nerves-project.org/)."
