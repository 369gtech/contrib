description: 'Project Reactor is a very powerful tool in the developers'' hands. But, the more powerful tools you use, the stronger safety rules are. Do you know all of them? In this talk, we will learn about advanced Project Reactor debugging & testing techniques, which are helpful for anyone who works with Project Reactor. Because like the cockroaches can survive even the radiation, bugs can escape the most well-thought-out code. Never heard about BlockHound? Or you know about Backpressure, but not sure if it is handled correctly in your​ code? Maybe you want to prepare you reactive code upfront to help your future self when something goes wrong in prod? Or perhaps just watch how Reactor team members work with Reactor code and learn some neat tricks? Then this talk is for you!'
