description: "Most organizations with legacy applications are undertaking business transformation journeys to modernize their workloads, become more agile, and reduce costs. However, the reality is that a majority of these efforts are time-consuming, complex, unsuccessful, or a combination thereof. This session investigates why many transformations fail and follows up with an in-depth walkthrough of a proven formula for successful business transformations. By understanding the 4 x 3 approach, and adhering to the guiding principles that I share in this session, you will leave with actionable tools to not only transform your organization successfully, but better yet, ensure that it is sustainable and part of your organizational culture.\n\nGautham Pallapa, Global CTO at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/successful-and-sustainable-business-transformation-the-4-x-3-approach"
