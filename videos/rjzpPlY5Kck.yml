description: "We (developers) are in the front line when it comes to software security. Security has many facets but from a practical perspective it is about learning from the past, keeping up with the present, predicting and changing the future, and automating the boring and repetitive parts.\n\nThis talk will explore \n- Core security principles we all should be aware of.\n- Security in the node ecosystem & node core.\n- Musings on how to apply the above to open source and enterprise security."
