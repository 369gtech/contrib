description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nJune 24, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nEclipse Day at the Googleplex\r\nHow Mylyn Changes the Way I Develop\r\nby Bjorn Freeman-Benson, Eclipse Foundation\r\n\r\nMylyn is an Eclipse project that gives tasks first-class status in the developer workspace. In this presentation Bjorn will show how task focused programming simplifies his (developer) life. Mylyn makes it easier for him to maintain focus while switching between tasks and to collaborate on tasks with geographically and time-zone disparate developers. Fair warning though: once you've started using Mylyn, you never want to return to the old ways.\r\n\r\nAbout Bjorn Freeman-Benson:\r\nBjorn is the Director for Committer Community at the Eclipse Foundation, a position that is tailor-made for someone with his keen interest and experience in building high-quality software with geographically distributed teams. He has dabbled in applications and user interfaces, but returns, like the swallows to San Juan Capistrano, to his three foci: hardware, software and process (embedded devices, programming languages and software engineering). Bjorn has worked for OTI, Amazon.com, Rational and Gemstone, along with a career as a university professor. He has an M.Sc. and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington, and is happy to talk at length about his passion for orienteering and/or his love of flying."
