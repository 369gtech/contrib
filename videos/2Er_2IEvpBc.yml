title: 'Justin Anderson Unifying Web, iOS, and Android at Mobile Era'
recordingDate: 1574413593
description: "My team maintains video data libraries that we use to instrument video playback in the major Twitter clients (iOS, Android, and Web). Those libraries are written natively, but follow the same logic and design patterns across all three. We're interested in trying to figure out the feasibility of doing a \"write once, run everywhere\" solution where we implement the logic once and then either transpile or run in an interpreter that library on each client. We looked into using JavaScript, Kotlin, C++, and Rust, each one has their advantages and disadvantages. In my talk, I will run through the advantages and disadvantages of each of these languages. Being at the scale Twitter has its own unique challenges, such as sensitivity to app startup time, size, and responsiveness, that we needed to factor into our decisions of language. This is a project we havenâ€™t started working on yet, but we are playing on starting it between now and the conference.\n\nAbout the speaker\nJustin does mainly iOS at Twitter.
