description: "Join us and Take a FREE Webinar on Android : http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course\n\nThis android tutorial talks about Content Provider in detail:\n\nContent Provider : \n-------------------------\n\nThe need for Content Providers arises because the database created in one application is not visible to a second application.\n\nIt is simple to create and store database in different applications using SQLite, however the problem is this, a database in Android is private to the application that creates it. There is no common storage area in Android that every application can access. Therefore, for different applications to use a database, Android system needs an interface that allows such inter-application and inter-process data exchange. This is where content provider comes to play.\n\nContent providers are very important in terms of Android applications, providing content to applications. They encapsulate data and provide it to applications through the single ContentResolver interface. If you want to share data between multiple applications then a content provider will be needed..\n\ne.g. Uploading a photo in Facebook Application\n\nContent providers support the following basic operations:\n\n1)   Querying: Queries the Content Provider for all the objects, based on the specified URI.\n2)   Delete: Deletes the specified objects from the database of a Content Provider.\n3)   Update: Makes updates to the objects in the database.\n4)   Insert: Inserts new object to the database.\n\nRead More about Content Providers at : http://www.edureka.co/blog/beginner-android-tutorials-content-provider/\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \nhttp://www.edureka.co\n\nUse the link to watch all videos of this session :\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOHiWL2R-gYcF8oA4yPJKTNb"
