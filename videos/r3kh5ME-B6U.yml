description: "One Marketplace to Rule Them All - Matt McNeeney & Laurel Gray, Pivotal\n\nUntil now, every Cloud Foundry environment has its own dedicated marketplace where developers can easily consume the backing services their workloads need. But for those in the community using Cloud Foundry at scale, managing many marketplaces poses a number of critical problems. Throw into the mix a handful of Kubernetes clusters with workloads that need backing services, and both developers and operators fall into a world of pain.\n\nBut what if developers could access the services they need from an independent marketplace, which they could integrate with any of their workloads, running on any platform? What if operators could manage and monitor these services in just one place? What if alongside databases and common backing services, developers could also get access to the tools they need to do their job, like Kubernetes clusters and spaces in Cloud Foundry?\n\nCome and learn how the open source Independent Services Marketplace team are building the future by inverting the relationship between platforms and backing services, and how this can drastically improve the lives of developers and operators running cloud-native platforms at scale.\n\nOne marketplace to rule them all,\none marketplace to find them,\none marketplace to bring them all,\nand in the cloud bind them.\n\nAbout Laurel Gray\nLaurel is Project Lead for the Cloud Foundry Services API team where she is responsible for the services user experience. She likes solving problems with and without software.\n\nAbout Matt McNeeney\nMatt is a Product Manager at Pivotal, where he works with a number of teams building marketplaces of services for Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. Matt is also a Co-Chair for the Open Service Broker API, a project by Pivotal, IBM, Red Hat and others that allows developers to deliver services to applications running on cloud-native platforms. Over the past year, Matt has presented talks on services and service brokers at various conferences including CF Summit, VMworld and SpringOne Platform.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
