recordingDate: 1317942084
description: "The 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering\r\nMountain View, California, USA\r\nSeptember 19-22, 2011\r\n\r\nA Framework with Tools for Designing Web-based Geographic Applications\r\nThe Nhan Luong, SÃ©bastien Laborie, Thierry Nodenot\r\n\r\nPresented by The Nhan Luong.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nMany Web-based geographic applications have been developed in various domains, such as tourism, education, surveillance and military. However, developing such applications is a cumbersome task because it necessitates several types of components (e.g., maps, contents, indexation services, databases) that have to be assembled together. Hence, developers have to deal with different technologies and application behavior models. In order to create Web-based geographic applications and overcome design problems, we propose a framework composed of three complementary tasks: identifying some desired data, building the graphical layout organization and defining potential user interactions. According to this framework, we have specified a unified model and we have encoded it using Semantic Web technologies, such as RDF. Through a prototype named WINDMash, we have implemented some tools that instantiate our model and automatically generate concrete Internet geographic applications that can be executed into Web browsers."
