title: 'O''Reilly Webcasts: Using DTrace on Your Application Code'
recordingDate: 1378402215
description: "In this hands-on webcast we'll talk about applying the open source dynamic tracing (DTrace) facility available in Solaris (and friends), Mac OS X, and FreeBSD to python. We will learn about what DTrace is, how it works and a little bit about its powerful scripting language \"d\". We will also talk about DTrace support in Python itself. Then we will demonstrate using DTrace on a running python application to profile performance and application behavior.\n\nAbout Mark Allen\n\nMark Allen has over 10 years of experience as a software developer, system administrator and security architect.
