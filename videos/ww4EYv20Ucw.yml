title: 'Xarray - more than Pandas in multiple dimensions - Ond≈ôej Grover [PyData Prague #8 2020]'

description: "The presentation is available here: https://github.com/smartass101/xarray-pydata-prague-2020\n\nThe Xarray library has in recent years become one of the de-facto standards for working with multi-dimensional datasets in Python. While calling it \"a generalization of Pandas into multiple dimensions\" gives a reasonable first impression, there is much more to it than that. For instance, the transparent and well structured API offers a concise handle on the depths of NumPy and Dask broadcasting magic. The API and helper functions also enable the construction of convenient and versatile wrappers of e.g. Scipy routines which then become applicable in any domain where data can be represented by Xarray containers. The talk will showcase the basic Pandas-like usage as well as some of the aforementioned advanced features.\n\nwww.pydata.cz\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
