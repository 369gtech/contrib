description: "We don't need no stinking architects! Martin Fowler famously declared that architects and software architecture as a practice was dead, and those of us who work as architects have been justifying our existence ever since.\n\nIn this talk, I hope to bust some myths and answer some questions\n\nWhat is software architecture? How is it changed in an agile software development environment? Do we do it at all in agile, or is that just the anti-pattern of Big Design Up Front.\n\nWhat is the role of architecture in agile software development methodologies like XP and Crystal? Who fulfills that role?\n\nIf we want to practice agile architecture, as opposed to other forms of architecture what is required for that to happen?\n\nFinally, how should someone who is an architect spend their time in order to help a team succeed."
