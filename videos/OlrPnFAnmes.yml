description: "Speaker: Hon Cheng\_and Junjie \n\nHon Cheng\_and Junjie won the very 1st Apple Design Awards (ADA) for Singapore and Southeast Asia for their app Elk.\_ Hon Cheng makes things happen, and makes them really fast, and he obsesses himself with animation. He made some of the most popular apps in Singapore—SG Buses and SG NextBus. Junjie pays attention to how things work, how fast and how easy a user can do something. His own app and foray into app development—Due—was featured on Daring Fireball. ​\n\nAfter many sessions of badminton and bubble tea, they founded Clean Shaven Apps in June 2012. Together, they have launched six apps. Their most recent app, Elk, won an Apple Design Award in 2017.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-iOS-Dev-Scout-Meetup/events/240928762/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/8l6U/"
