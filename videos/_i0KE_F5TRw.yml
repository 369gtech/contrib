description: "It's all about abstraction and separation of concerns.\n\nRead and write text is not about communication since the text is just a poor representation of the intentions behind the writer.\n\n- Is code just a poor representation of the solutions for our problems?\n- Is it the best representation to maintain?\n- Is it accessible?\n\nOnly 0,02% of computer users know how to read and write code, being most of the users merely victims and not part of the change.\n\nYou can't control the code, you can't control the world.\n\nThe computer was created, to be the machine that the user would be able to control its behaviour. But here we are 2021 and it looks like that the computer as it was imagined just exists for 0,02% of its users.\n\nNo-Code with No-Hype - is an honest approach to how I believe the no-code phenomenon will change our industry technically, our market drastically and our society positively in the next years.\n\nAt Data² we are working hard to create as we call The Next Generation No-Code Platform, that will fight against our current scalability framework which is: \"Be a user - Be used\".\n\nWe could be wiring the world's neurons and together we would become more conscious, everyone's frequency just one pulse.\n\nWe are not going to have less change.\nWe are not going to change slowly.\nWe are not going to be less conscious.\n\nWe gonna break the walls - Everyone could also be a provider, everyone could also be playing actively, creating relevant messages, products and services for a world where truth is measured, helping everyone to adapt and thrive in order to assist the future. Rising for something new aligned with the world we want to live in.\n\nDisrupting the software providing development for the rest of us...\n________\nRewatch more recordings from our past conferences at our video portal ➡️ https://frontenddeveloperlove.com/video \n________\nOur upcoming conferences:\n➡️ https://vuejs.amsterdam/\n➡️ https://reactlive.nl/\n________\nPowered by https://passionatepeople.io\n\n#unittests #webaudio #unittesting #hiphop #frontendlove or #vuejsamsterdam #javascript #reactacademy #react #microinteractions #designsystems #javascript #artificialintelligence #amsterdam #speaker #conference #frontendlove #frontenddeveloperlove #javascriptconference #frontendconference #vue #angular #react #cfp #theateramsterdam #meetup #conferences #events"
