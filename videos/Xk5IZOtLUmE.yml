description: "The Rust compiler provides a number of conveniences that make life easier for its users. It is good to know what these are, to avoid being mystified by what's going on under the hood... the less magical thinking we have of the world, the better.\n\nExample of these conveniences:\n\n    lifetime elisions\n    type inference\n    syntactic sugar\n    implicit dereferencing\n    type coercions\n    hidden code (e.g. the prelude)\n\nWith the help of examples, this talk is going to compare code with and without these conveniences.\n\n---\n\nAn electronic technician by training, I switched careers for I found software development more interesting and accessible (more cheap to practice, and more free learning resources). I've been in Python ecosystem for a number of years and have now switched to Rust for some reason. I've done quiet a bit of doc work for both ecosystems, and some code contributions. I would like to be a solid developer some day."
