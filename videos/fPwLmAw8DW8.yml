title: '"The Death of Silos" with José Huerta (Thursday''s Matter)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635952296
description: "We have all been victims of poor collaboration: Departments that don’t talk to each other. People in the team that don’t share information. The business vs tech dichotomy.\n\nHow is it that if everyone wants what is best for the organisation, we don’t seem to agree on how to collaborate effectively to achieve it?\n\nIf you are also puzzled by these questions, don’t fret. For something so relevant and present in everyday life, we tend to know very little about it.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore some of the causes of this phenomena, what we can do about it and lessons learned from implementing some of these recommendations."
