language: English
recordingDate: 1542695935
description: 'Geographic editing and analysis applications are increasingly being built as web apps, rather than desktop software. The h3-js library brings H3â€™s hexagon grid to the browser, supporting a variety of interactive use cases and geographic displays. During this Uber Open Summit 2018 workshop,  engineer Nick Rabinowitz walks through a set of examples demonstrating how to use H3 for different kinds of geographic interfaces and applications.'
