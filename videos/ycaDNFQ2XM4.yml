description: "With Lanaâ€™s unique client history, including Lady Antebellum, Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears audio has played a huge part in her website work.  In her presentation, she will not only cover some of those projects, but the impact that audio and video had on them. With the new technology from Dolby, Dolby Digital Plus, she will also be talking about what you can do to make the web just a little bit (or a lot) better with audio and HTML5.\n\nFITC produces events for digital creators in Toronto, Amsterdam, NYC and beyond\nSave 10% off any of our events with discount code 'youtube'\n\nCheck out our events at http://fitc.ca\nor follow us at https://twitter.com/fitc"
