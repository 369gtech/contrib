recordingDate: 1581886544
description: "Containers - the anwer to everything? In fact the drive to containers has made being a developer much harder. In this session learn more about the directions that cloud architectures are taking us and see how the vision has out paced reality. More tools then ever, more complexity, more Ops than Dev? There are efforts to help across the board and this talk will help you understand what's happening and what to watch. Whether you're a seasoned kubernetes warrior or just getting started with Docker swarm its good to keep an eye on the horizon. Containers - you ain't seen nuffing yet.\n\nSteve Poole\nIBM\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
