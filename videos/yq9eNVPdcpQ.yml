description: "Deploying and Operating Cloud Native .NET apps - Jenny McLaughlin & Cornelius Mendoza, Pivotal\n\nAs .NET developers and Windows operators, we want to let cloud services do more for us so we can focus on delivering business values. In other words, we want to innovate faster without sacrificing our weekends.\n\nContainerization has been a myth for those in the Windows world. What does it mean and how can we best leverage it to our advantage? In this talk, we will discuss how Windows containers are implemented in Cloud Foundry so .NET developers can have the same CF Haiku experience as Java developers: \"Here is my source code, run it in the cloud for me, I do not care how.\" What about Day 2 operations? We will also examine how the platform takes care of the Day 2 concerns. In addition, we will explore Docker containers and provide insights on pros and cons and best use cases.\n\nAbout Jenny McLaughlin\n​​​​Jenny McLaughlin has years of Java and .NET experience across various industries. She is currently a Platform Architect at Pivotal helping customers move toward a better way of building and operating their applications.
