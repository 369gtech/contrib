title: 'The Value of Values with Rich Hickey'
language: English
recordingDate: 1349713769
description: "In this keynote speech from JaxConf 2012, Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure and founder of Datomic gives an awesome analysis of the changing way we think about values (not the philosphoical kind) in light of the increasing complexity of information technology and the advent of Big Data. The broad subject of the talk makes it worth watching for almost anyone in the programming world, and was one of the highlights of the JaxConf lineup.\n\nIf you like the talk, check out Hickey's other appearance at JaxConf2012 here: http://marakana.com/s/rich_hickey_on_deconstructing_the_database,1261/index.html"
