description: "Title: Dart: Google's plan to make it easier for you to build web apps\n\nBob Nystrom, engineer on the Dart project, presents an encore session of his OSCON 2012 talk about the Dart project.\n\nAbstract:\n\nWhen we announced Dart, it kicked up a bit of a dust storm. In this talk, I discuss the challenges that Google and others face when building web apps today. I introduce Dart and show how its features were designed specifically to address some of those challenges.\n\nYou'll see how Dart protects you from many of the dark corners and sharp edges of JavaScript and the DOM. When your programs grow and evolve over time, you'll see how Dart can help keep your app nimble and maintainable. Thanks to Dart's Dart to JavaScript compiler, you'll see how you get all of that while still being able to run on any browser that supports modern JS and without the bad karma of fracturing the web."
