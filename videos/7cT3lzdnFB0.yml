description: "As software developers, it has been historically hard to get into hardware and electronics. However, that trend has been rapidly changing with the introduction of Arduino, Raspberry Pi and other similar hardware platforms that took a lot of complexities and mystery out of electronics.\n\nIn this talk, I will give a brief overview of what options software developers have today for exploring the world of hardware devices. I will show examples of how easy it is to build your own prototypes, what kind of tools you can use, and what roadblocks you can expect. In addition, I will speak about my experience building robots and internet of things devices using Arduino, Bluetooth LE and iBeacons.\n\nThis won’t be your usual “let’s blink this LED” Arduino talk. I am going to get into intermediate to advanced subjects such as Bluetooth LE integration, interfacing with your own memory modules, importance of enclosure design and how to turn your prototype into an actual product."
