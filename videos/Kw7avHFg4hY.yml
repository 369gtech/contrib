description: "Continous Localization in Web\nSpeaker : Maxence Lefebvre\n\nInternatiolazi, wait, Internationani, wait, i18n.\n\nWho here never lost an entire day making sure our JSON lang files are well synced with the codebase ?\n\nOr had to format/parse between excel files on the translator side and JSON files on our sides ?\n\nThis talk would like to present how to step up our i18n game, starting from a simple JSON files based solution to one based on Continous Localization, where merging translations becomes a non event.\n\nYou will be able to follow each step we took, their benefits and shortcomings, but also be aware of a few alternative solutions we considered and that might do the job for you.\n\nIntegration samples are written in React over react-i18n, but we believe the takeaways to be framework-agnostic."
