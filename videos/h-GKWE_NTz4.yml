description: "EdgeBalance: Model-Based Load Balancing for Network Edge Data Planes\n\nWei Zhang, The George Washington University; Abhigyan Sharma, AT&T Labs Research; Timothy Wood, The George Washington University\n\nEdge data centers are an appealing place for telecommunication providers to offer in-network processing such as VPN services, security monitoring, and 5G. Placing these network services closer to users can reduce latency and core network bandwidth, but the deployment of network functions at the edge poses several important challenges. Edge data centers have limited resource capacity, yet network functions are re-source intensive with strict performance requirements. Replicating services at the edge is needed to meet demand, but balancing the load across multiple servers can be challenging due to diverse service costs, server and flow heterogeneity, and dynamic workload conditions. In this paper, we design and implement a model-based load balancer EdgeBalance for edge network data planes. EdgeBalance predicts the CPU demand of incoming traffic and adaptively distributes flows to servers to keep them evenly balanced. We overcome several challenges specific to network processing at the edge to improve throughput and latency over static load balancing and monitoring-based approaches.\n\nView the full HotEdge '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotedge20/workshop-program"
