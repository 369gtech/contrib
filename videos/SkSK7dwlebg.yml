description: 'Presented by Kristina Chodorow. This talk is a combination of whitepaper and Magic School Bus tour of how MongoDB scales across multiple machines. For applications that outgrow the resources of a single database server, MongoDB can convert to a sharded cluster, automatically managing failover and balancing of nodes, with few or no changes to the original application code. This talk discusses how MongoDB does this and a bit about MongoDB''s sharding architecture. We describe how a shard cluster works and some nifty tricks it does behind the scenes. We also give some advice on how this affects applications using sharding.'
