description: "Many practical problems are solved by choosing an appropriate technique and constructing concrete formulations of abstract algorithms. Graph theory algorithms are one of the most important ones when talking about software engineering. Real-life problems, networks, programs, and so much more can be represented as graphs.\n\nThis will be a lightweight look at the most useful graph theory algorithms and most common or unexpected software engineering problems that it helps to solve, training you to apply them in your own work."
