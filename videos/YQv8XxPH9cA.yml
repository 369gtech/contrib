Nevertheless, the mechanics of leading the product are often misunderstood. Is the product manager the boss of the team or the boss of the product? Divided between product vision and implementation, between keeping the team strong and motivated and putting the right arguments on the table for management, what does a good product manager do to tackle all these aspects of the job and lead the product towards success? \n\nThis is a story about leadership without having an official leader title. It's a story about vision, innovation, management, and value. It's about challenges and hard conversations with upper management, because none of the above come without it. And it's about victories and lessons learned in many years of product management.\n\nSpeakers: Alexandra Lung, Senior Product Manager, Pivotal Labs; Fanny Verney, Product Owner, Orange France\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/leading-product-the-sparks-the-challenges-and-the-victories"
