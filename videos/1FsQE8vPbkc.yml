description: "by Niels Leenheer\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.1302/javascript_microcontrollers.webm\n\nBuilding an IoT device feels out of reach to a lot of web developers. Most of us didnâ€™t study electrical engineering, and never learned to solder. And programming a microcontroller is on a completely different level than building a website.\nBut that is just not true anymore. Nowadays microcontrollers have become powerful enough to run JavaScript. And that opens up IoT to all of us. With just 20 lines of code we can build a connected lightbulb, and within seconds we can wirelessly deploy it. Write a couple of lines more, and you can even remotely control a car. And that is precisely what we are going to do.\n\n\n(This replaces 'Let's Get Func-y' by Jemima Abu)\n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 11:30:00"
