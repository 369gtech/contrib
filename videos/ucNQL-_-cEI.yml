description: "by Henning Westerholt\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/kamailio.webm\n\n\nKamailio is an widely used carrier-grade open source SIP server that focus on flexibility, security and performance. It offers extensive core functionality and provides over 200 extension modules. Therefore it can be challenging as developer to decide which of the available APIs to use for your development. This is especially true if you want to integrate your extension later into the project upstream source code repository. \n\nThis talk will start with a quick overview of the new functionality in the current major release 5.2. It will then highlight important changes in the last year for developers which are using Kamailio or developing extensions for it. Several code examples describes how to achieve a good security and performance. The talk will also provide guidelines about the development process, contributions acceptance and community interactions. \n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:50:00+01"
