description: "Marge: A bot for better Git'ing\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Smarkets]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Mika Boström, Alexander Schmolck\n\nOver the past decade, development workflows across industries have converged towards Continuous Integration (CI) with pull requests (PR). Automated testing and artifact generation is useful, but the logic is often flawed: test are run against the source branch, and side effects from successful merges are not accounted for. Marge-bot improves this workflow by allowing to test the PR against the target branch while providing a host of other conveniences.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
