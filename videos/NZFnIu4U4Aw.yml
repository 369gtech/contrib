recordingDate: 1580216404
description: "On October 24, 2019, the WiSDOM (Women in Statistics, Data, Optimization, and Machine Learning) Employee Resource Group hosted the second annual Moving The World With Data meetup, welcoming hundreds of members of the Bay Area tech community to learn about some of our toughest, most interesting data science problems.\n\nIn this presentation, Ashley Edwards, a research scientist with Uber AI Labs, shares original work from the machine learning discipline of reinforcement learning. Using examples from the game Coin Run and other simple tasks, she demonstrates how an agent can be made to learn latent policies through observation. She also posed a question: in the future, can we expect robots to learn to act like humans by watching us move?\_\n\nLearn more about the meetup: https://eng.uber.com/moving-the-world-with-data"
