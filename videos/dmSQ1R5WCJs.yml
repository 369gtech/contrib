description: "Hyperprobe: Towards Virtual Machine Extrospection\n\nJidong Xiao, College of William and Mary; Lei Lu, VMware Inc.; Hai Huang, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center; Haining Wang, University of Delaware\n\nIn a virtualized environment, it is not difficult to retrieve guest OS information from its hypervisor. However, it is very challenging to retrieve information in the reverse direction, i.e., retrieve the hypervisor information from within a guest OS, which remains an open problem and has not yet been comprehensively studied before. In this paper, we take the initiative and study this reverse information retrieval problem. In particular, we investigate how to determine the host OS kernel version from within a guest OS.We observe that modern commodity hypervisors introduce new features and bug fixes in almost every new release. Thus, by carefully analyzing the seven-year evolution of Linux KVM development (including 3485 patches), we can identify 19 features and 20 bugs in the hypervisor detectable from within a guest OS. Building on our detection of these features and bugs, we present a novel framework called Hyperprobe that for the first time enables users in a guest OS to automatically detect the underlying host OS kernel version in a few minutes. We implement a prototype of Hyperprobe and evaluate its effectiveness in five real world clouds, including Google Compute Engine (a.k.a. Google Cloud), HP Helion Public Cloud, ElasticHosts, Joyent Cloud, and CloudSigma, as well as in a controlled testbed environment, all yielding promising results.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
