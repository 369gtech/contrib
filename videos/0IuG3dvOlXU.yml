title: 'How Cheap Learning (not deep learning) Finds Faults in Distributed Systems by Ted Dunning'
recordingDate: 1550058157
description: "Distributed systems are hard to troubleshoot. The reasons are simple. They are complex and, well, distributed. With containers and Kubernetes and IoT, services spread across hardware for redundancy, but that hardware is also shared with other services. Machine learning can make things worse because of often donÂ’t exactly know what a system should be doing.\n\nThere are some very simple techniques, however, that can help localize faults in complex systems. Simple enough to run on tiny hardware, but efficient enough to run at scale, these techniques belong in your toolbox. I will explain how they work and how they are applied in systems you probably already use."
