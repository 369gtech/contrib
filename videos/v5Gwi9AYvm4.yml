description: "Video with transcript included: http://bit.ly/37sXxG0\n\nAdrian Cockcroft explores how to apply some industry standard techniques (including Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) to cloud native microservices architectures. He looks at how chaos engineering techniques are driving the industry from annual datacenter disaster recovery testing of monolithic applications to continuous resilience assurance for cloud native microservices.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon San Francisco 2019: http://bit.ly/38sivWf\n\nThe next QCon is QCon London 2020 – March 2-4, 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq\n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQ’s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#SoftwareArchitecture #Microservices #Resilience"
