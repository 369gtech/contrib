description: "Adam Warski\nSoftwareMill\n\nI am one of the co-founders of SoftwareMill, where I code mainly using Scala and other interesting technologies. I am involved in open-source projects, such as Hibernate Envers, ElasticMQ, Veripacks and MacWire. I have been a speaker at major conferences, such as JavaOne, Devoxx, JavaZone or JFokus.\nApart from writing closed- and open-source software, in my free time I try to read the Internet on various programming-related subjects, any ideas or insights end up on my blog: http://www.warski.org/blog\n\nImplementing the Reactive Manifesto with Akka\n\nIt’s certainly fashionable to “be reactive”, but what does it mean? How does reactive look in practice? Akka contains a number of more or less experimental modules, with which we can create a [Responsive, Resilient, Elastic, Message driven]-application. We will see how various Akka features help in implementing the above traits. The presentation will contain a short introduction to the reactive ideology, and then we will try to write a reactive application using Akka Cluster, Akka Streams and Akka Persistence."
