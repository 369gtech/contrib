recordingDate: 1541257470
description: 'We automated our deployment pipelines. We do blue/green and canary deployments. Now we need the next step to reach another level of software releases. Now we want to test our business hypothesis. Three different approaches outstand in this area: smart routers, feature toggles, and service meshes. We''ll have it covered. Come to this session to see lots of demos and deployments with smart routers and feature toggles to check how effective A/B testing can be achieved. You may be thinking about A/B, but after this session we''ll get you from A to Z.'
