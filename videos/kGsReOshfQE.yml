description: "BOSH Links: Bringing Foundations Closer - Gaurab Dey & Bozhidar Lenchov, Pivotal\n\nBringing up foundations using BOSH is getting easier, which is allowing you to create more and more foundations. But allowing these foundations to talk to each other if they are not under the same BOSH director is really difficult.\n\nDon't worry, Links API is here to help you out! It will allow you as an operator to create links without the need for a separate consumer deployment on the same director. Now your deployments can talk to each other even if they are not under the same director!\n\nOne application of this will allow service brokers to talk to different directors and create custom links on-the-fly (corresponding to new service instances). These services can then be used by external consumers not managed through a BOSH deployment.\n\nFurthermore, improvements to links allow operators to define them right in the manifest (outside of the release spec), saving time, complexity and effort. The links concept is also expanding to include consumption of generated variables through links, as well as allowing variables to consume links. To learn more or if you have questions, come check out our talk!\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyU/bosh-links-bringing-foundations-closer-gaurab-dey-bozhidar-lenchov-pivotal"
