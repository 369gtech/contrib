description: "The need to integrate existing batch and stream processing microservices in business relevant scenarios put pressure on companies' IT department, to enable these new use cases while still respecting security, auditability and repeatability constraints; and avoiding risks incurred when giving access to company data and tools to a wider set of stakeholders.\n\nIn this talk, we'll present Invivoo's solution to this problem called XComponent Koordinator. It consists of a central point of access to enterprise's data and computation resources. Where available resources are referred on a catalog, and business people can create new semi-automated integration scenarios.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
