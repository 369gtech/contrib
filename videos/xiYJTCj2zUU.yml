title: 'AI made easy with Flink + AIFlow - Jiangie (Becket) Quin'
recordingDate: 1588067188
description: 'There have been a lot of projects helping the users build their AI platforms, such as mlflow, tfx, metaflow, sagemaker and so on. Most of these projects focuses on the scenario of offline training with online inference. And some of them are only available or work well on specific engines and platforms. In this talk we will introduce a new project called aiflow, which addresses both online and offline training processes while being agnostic to engines and platforms, so users can easily compose an AI workflow in a highly hybrid environment. Flink, as a unified engine, on the other hand, is one of few engines that can fulfill all the semantics defined in aiflow. We will demonstrate how users can use aiflow to compose a production level AI workflow with Flink underneath.'
