title: 'How to be an Architect in an Agile World - lecture by Felix Muller  - Code Europe Autumn 2017'
recordingDate: 1524050013
description: 'The role of software architects changed significantly over the last years. The agile transformation in IT companies demands a different skill set from architects. In the past it was about package structures of monoliths and class diagrams. Today you have to deal with team structures, agile methodologies and developer enablement to be successful as an architect. You have to take the architect elevator. In this talk I speak about my experiences as an architect made in three different sized agile companies, one of them Zalando.'
