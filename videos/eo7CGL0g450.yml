title: 'Lambda Jam 2015 - Juan Facorro  - Manipulating and Verifying Functional Source Code'
recordingDate: 1445130335
description: "Apart from the original purpose a program’s source code is written for, it also provides a lot of metadata connected to its structure and intention. Information is power, and being able to manipulate and query this metadata unleashes the power hidden in our code. This enables us to learn more about it and, in the process, find some of the errors of our ways.\n\nThis talk will guide you through the process of building a source code linter and a style enforcer for various functional languages like Clojure, Erlang and Scala. It will describe the challenges in processing source code, including the methods used to detect and enforce rules on it. It will also explore the limitations of these methods and why some rules require a more formal analysis based on their nature. Finally, it will delve into the trade-offs involved in avoiding false-positives while being able to detect cases that blatantly break the rules we are trying to enforce.\n\nAfter working as a C# programmer for many years, submerged in the OOP world, Juan finally explored LISP, then discovered Clojure and he fell in love with it almost immediately.\n\nWhile looking for a job where he could learn and practice his functional programming skills, he reached Inaka where he now works as an Erlang developer building highly reliable, performant backend servers.\n\nJuan contributes to the Open Source community through a number of (mostly Erlang or Elixir) projects and is found usually singing out loud without realising.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
