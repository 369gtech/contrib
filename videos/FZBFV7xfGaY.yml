description: "Generative modeling technology is changing the face of the Internet as you read this. It's now possible to design automated systems that can write novels, act as talking heads in videos, and compose music. We are in an absolute renaissance for creativity, the tools are your disposal to tell stories and create new realities have never been so powerful. In this episode, I'll explain how generative modeling works by demoing 3 examples that you can try yourself in your web browser. We'll generate music, faces, and 3D objects, all without having to install any dependencies locally! Newcomers, rejoice. I'll explain how it works at a mathematical level (my favorite), enjoy! \n\nDemo 1 (Generating Music): \nhttps://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/magenta/piano_transformer/piano_transformer.ipynb\n\nDemo 2 (Generating Faces):\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/tf_hub_generative_image_module.ipynb\n\nDemo 3 (Generating 3D Objects):\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/lucid/blob/master/notebooks/differentiable-parameterizations/style_transfer_3d.ipynb\n\nAutoencoders explained:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1AllrJ-_30\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks explained:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz6dNf7X7SA\n\nSequence Models explained:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElmBrKyMXxs\n\nGenerative Modeling explained:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhCM3qoRZHE\n\nAre you a total beginner to machine learning?
