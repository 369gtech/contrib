recordingDate: 1395019899
description: "A quick introduction to the concept of dependency injection for developers who are wondering what it's about and why they might use it.  A simple contrived example is included and can be found here: https://github.com/dpdonahue/What-Is-Dependency-Injection-\n\nSorry about the noise when the code executes, the fans on the laptop where I recorded this got a little loud for a moment."
