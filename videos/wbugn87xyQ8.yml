description: "Note: Version with better audio at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT0zgcNczFY\r\n\r\nSVG is coming of age. One of the biggest impediments to SVG though has been lack of support in Internet Explorer. At this keynote, part of SVG Open 2009, you will learn about SVG Web, a new open source JavaScript project that allows Internet Explorer to render both static and dynamic SVG with a simple drop-in library! See demos of SVG Web and hear from the creators of the project. In addition, find out how Google and others are using SVG, including in Google Docs, the Google Visualization API, and more. You will walk away from this keynote excited and ready to immediately use SVG across all major browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, the iPhone, and more).\r\nNote: This is a re-uploaded version with better audio."
