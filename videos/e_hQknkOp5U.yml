description: "We all test… looking for something, reproducing bugs or right before we submit feature \nfor qa… We also do TDD or want to do it aaand... there is even, what I call cognitive testing - \nyou sit there for a minute and write down or just think of collection of behaviors you \nimplemented and you make sure that there is a good chance what you did will pass \nacceptance criteria.\n\nI’d actually say that we want to see it fail - we want to make it fail before anyone else does \nand fix it so it never fails again.\n\nKey of the talk would be introducing audience to full testing stack, it’s usages and benefits \nand after that talking about monitoring the application and using different tools to achieve \ncertain effects."
