description: 'Are you interested in IoT devices but you''re unsure how or where to start when coding them? With IoT devices now forming a fundamental part of this world and fueling the move forward in the technology evolution Liam will break down how he became an IoT hobbyist using the language he is most fond of, Go. However, this is not the regular form of Go we are all used to, but rather an abstracted version called TinyGo. By using this, we can break down barriers and begin to unlock the potential of embedded systems and web assembly, join Liam and he''ll show you how!'
