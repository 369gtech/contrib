description: "Transclusions and folksonomies in a content-addressed and block-chained world.\nWeb 3.0 decentralised apps and services are igniting the third revolution of the web. Will we be able to avoid the mistakes of the previous Web revolutions and finally make the internet what visionaries like Vannevar Bush and Theodor Nelson envisioned in the late thirties and sixties of past century? In this talk, we will go through the benefits of content-addressed URLs and talk about what missing to build the web as a permanent and censorship-resistant net of knowledge with the help of transclusions and folksonomies."
