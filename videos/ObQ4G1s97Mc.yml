description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nCome with us as we take a legacy MFC financial modelling application that is largely function in design and transform it to something new. We will take a portion of this large financial simulation application and change its single threaded ways into parallel processing stochastic model. Transforming single class’s with a hodge-podge of functions into an object oriented parallel design using c++ amp and implementing Stochastic modelling methodology. Aside from focusing on the key portions of converting functional single threaded code to a parallel design we will also touch on some of the details of financial modeling for interest rate risk.\n— \nI started writing software before I finished grade school and have spent my life in technology since then. I currently write primarily Windows based financial applications in C++. My passion is in producing not only quality code, but software that works for businesses. As much as I love trying to find the most elegant solution to a problem, I realize the client needs the solution that keeps them in business just as much. I enjoy trying to find the best of both.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
