title: 'YOW! West 2014 - Visual Management: Leading with What You Can See - Craig Smith'
recordingDate: 1422351115
description: "Using task boards or story walls is a key Agile practice, but are you making the most of it? Visual Management is more than just putting cards on a wall, it is a growing style of management that focuses on managing work only by what you can see rather than reports or paper being shuffled around. Visual Management allows you to understand the constraints in the system, mitigate risks before they become issues, report on progress from the micro to the macro. Visual Management can also be used to demonstrate to customers and clients where the work they care about is at. This presentation is all about taking the management of your work to the next stage of transparency. Discover:\n\nHow to identify when your story wall isn't telling you everything and how to adjust it\nWhat the three different types of story walls are and which one is more suitable to certain circumstances\nDifferent ways to visualise your product backlogWhy queue columns and limiting work in progress is so important regardless of whether you are using Scrum or Kanban\nHow symbols and tokens can be used to give more information\nWhat else can you use other than story walls to visualise information\nHow to ingrain Visual Management into both the team and management structures of your organisation\nVisualising Your Quality, Testing and Team\nWhat is systemic flow mapping and why is it important"
