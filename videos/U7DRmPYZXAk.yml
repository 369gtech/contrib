description: 'As far as project management goes, most of us tend to use the common Agile methodologies. But as our project scales up, our code becomes less maintainable and far less flexible for changes - until we get to a point where Agile just isn''t working anymore. In this talk, we’ll address this painful issue and discuss how to help our code retain its agility, not using Agile. We’ll see how proper architecture can help us and what methods are available to us.'
