description: "Slides: https://tlakomy.github.io/sleeping-better-at-night/\n\nWhy are we afraid to deploy our app on Friday evening? Well, mostly because no one wants to debug production issues on Saturday and we really want to go home.\nAnswering the (seemingly) basic question of \"does our code actually work?\" is surprisingly difficult at times.\nIn this talk I'd like to cover different approaches we, JavaScript developers, can embed into our toolkit to make our lives easier and our users happier (hint: unit tests are not enough).\n\n---\n\nConFrontJS 2019 - #Frontend #Conference in #Warsaw, Poland\nDate: 7 December 2019\nVenue: Engineering Design Center (EDC)\n\n▶︎ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/2339951839653302/\n▶︎ Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/WarsawJS/events/264057980/\n▶︎ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/confrontjs.event/\n▶︎ Twitter: https://twitter.com/confrontjs\n▶︎ Homepage: https://confrontjs.com/"
