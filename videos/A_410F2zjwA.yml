description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: AWS & Weaveworks - Enable Hybrid Cloud Kubernetes with GitOps, EKS, and EKS-D \nSpeakers: Paul Curtis\n\nOne of the biggest advantages Kubernetes has to offer is that it is agnostic to infrastructure and capable of managing diverse workloads running on different compute resources. This allows organizations to take advantage of scalable and cost-efficient cloud resources as well as harness a secure and fully controlled on-premise environment.  \n\nStreamlined processes and automation are key for application and operation teams when managing clusters across environments while maintaining security and policy checks.\n\nIn this demo you will learn how to:\n· Use GitOps model-driven automation to increase reliability and stability across EKS (cloud) and EKS-D (on premise)\n· Simplify multi-cluster management with GitOps\n· Enable developers to push code to production minutes from Git\n· Improve utilization and capacity management through hybrid Kubernetes platforms\n\nTech utilized: Kubernetes, EKS, EKS-D, Git, LinkerD, GitOps, Weave Kubernetes Platform"
