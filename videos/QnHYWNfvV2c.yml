description: "We're over a decade into the era of the IoT and it still hasn't really arrived. Data privacy, data ownership, network coverage & access, technical fragmentation, vendor longevity and hardware costs are still big obstacles to large deployments. People have great ideas for making the world a better place with more connected devices; they just still can't turn their ideas into reality.\n\nWe're sick of waiting and we've decided to take a radical new approach: build all the components for a decentralized, cooperative internet of things network and give it to the world as open hardware and software; no royalties, no patent licenses, no strings attached. To make this work, we've designed a new network infrastructure centered around low-cost software defined radio gateways that use a blockchain with a novel radio-based proof-of-work replacement to create and a maintain a world-wide IoT network. Crucial to making this work is a way to allow gateways and end devices owned by anyone to work together without any pre-established trust. This is where blockchain technology comes in. Helium is building a blockchain from scratch in Erlang to help build the future of IoT and we want to show it to the world.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/andrew-thompson54/"
