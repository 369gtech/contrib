description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLeveraging WebAssembly to Write Kubernetes Admission Policies - Rafael Fernández López, SUSE\n\nWebAssembly is an emerging technology that allows the creation of portable units of code that can be executed in a safe way, regardless of the architecture and operating system underneath. Many programming languages already support WebAssembly as a compilation target, and more are joining the ranks. This session will show how Kubewarden allows policy authors to write Kubernetes admission policies using the languages and tools of their choice. Policy authors can tap into existing tools, libraries, frameworks and best practices. This not only lowers the barrier to create policies, but also to review and maintain them. Policies are distributed via regular container registries, can be easily downloaded and tested outside of Kubernetes. This makes it easy to combine Kubewarden into DevOps processes. Finally, Kubernetes administrators can benefit from Kubewarden's integrations with consolidated Cloud Native projects to cover aspects such as distribution, testing and observability."
