title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode - Biohacking Village - Vulnerability Disclosure Panel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1596874514
description: 'Humans write code, humans make mistakes, and hackers are here to help. While this has been true since the beginning of the Internet, 2020 still see''s laws like the DMCA and CFAA create a chilling effect on establishing a healthy "Internet immune system" between builders and breakers. In safety critical technology domains like Medical and Medical Devices, this has become especially obvious, and particularly urgent to solve. This mini-panel will run through the past, current, and future state of vulnerability disclosure in the medical sector; provide examples of where it has been needed, gone well, and where it has failed; and ends with an introduction to the The disclose.io Project and some practical steps that anyone in the audience can take to improve the ubiquity of healthy hacker/vendor relationships.'
