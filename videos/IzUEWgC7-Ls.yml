description: "Beyond Twitter, Facebook, and similar networks, without question, data, code, and algorithms are forming systems of power in our society. Mark Hansen explains why it is crucial that journalists—explainers of last resort—be able to interrogate these systems, holding power to account.\n\nHansen would like to thank Gabriel Dance, Nick Confessore, and Rich Harris from the New York Times. He would also like to thank Mike Young and Suman Deb Roy and the students in his computational classes.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
