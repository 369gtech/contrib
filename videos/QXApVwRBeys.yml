The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nDid Kubernetes Make My p95s Worse? - Jian Cheung & Stephen Chan, Airbnb \n\nWhen Airbnb first evaluated Kubernetes, they explicitly tested for performance and saw no significant differences. Then in 2019, as Airbnb’s migration of services from EC2/Chef to Kubernetes went into full swing, performance problems started cropping up. Service owners noticed significant latency increases which threatened to halt the overall move to Kubernetes. This talk will share Airbnb’s journey on performance gains and losses in its mass migration to Kubernetes. It will dive into the investigations Airbnb has done, from hardware differences, to cluster settings, to container configurations, to service language problems, and more. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaXm"
