description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nSpeaker: Colin Harrington, OCI Web\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/booting-iot-with-grails\nIn a world of the cloud, virtualization, containerization, microservices and nanoservices we talk about scaling up, scaling out, and decoupling our systems, but typically miss scaling down to an embedded platform.\n\nAt the same time that we have moved away from heavy monolithic web containers, we've seen a rise of powerful low cost embedded Linux devices such as the RaspberryPi.\n\nWe'll explore what it means to use a framework such as Grails as a power player on embedded Linux devices for IoT & home automation applications."
