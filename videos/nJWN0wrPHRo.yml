recordingDate: 1514912409
description: "Rocket is a web framework for Rust that delivers simplicity, reliability, and performance -- a rare combination. Rocket's ability to deliver in all three areas is largely enabled by Rust's code generation facilities. Based on developer input, Rocket generates code that eliminates boilerplate and leads to more robust, secure, and predictable web applications.\n\nThis talk dissects Rocket and its code generation by describing how Rocket is built. Special attention is placed on elucidating Rocket's use of present and future code generation facilities in Rust.\n\nEVENT:\n\nRustConf 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSergio Benitez\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published on the Rust YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_FUZ34ahBE"
