title: 'Batch/Stream Ask-Me-Anything - A. Krettek & T. Rohrmann & K. Young'
recordingDate: 1571152500
description: "Processing batch and streaming data with a single, unified engine have been the goal of the Apache Flink community for several years.\nOver the last months, the community has made good progress towards realizing this vision.\nWhile most changes currently affect the internals of the system and are not visible to the users, the last step of the plan is to replace the DataSet API by an extension of the DataStream API that works on bounded streams.\n\nFlink committers who are involved in the design and implementation of this effort will gather for this Ask-me-Anything session and answer all the questions that you might have about unified batch/stream processing with Flink."
