description: "Out of many strong JVM based languages Clojure and Java make a great couple. Coming to Clojure from Spring several years ago I really wished, back then, someone could explain functional programming and Clojure ecosystem to me from the Spring/Java point of view.\n\nIn this talk I’ll try to bridge that gap by talking about practical “How would you do X in Clojure” examples including state management, AOP, talking to SQL/NoSQL databases, Consul based app configuration, messaging, portable communication between languages, async primitives, and more “Spring familiar” topics."
