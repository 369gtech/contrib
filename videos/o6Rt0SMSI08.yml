This is a 4 Week Instructor led Online Course, 25 hours of assignment and 20 hours of project work.\n\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n\n3. At the end of the training you will be working on a real time project for which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Course\n \nEdureka’s Microservices Architecture training introduces you to the concept of Microservices that are small, lightweight, process-driven components. So, Microservices are the next important thing in designing scalable, easy-to-maintain applications. This not only makes application development easier but also offers great flexibility and lets you utilize various resources optimally. If you want to build an enterprise-ready implementation of the Microservices architecture, then this course is the first step for you!\n \nIn this Microservices Architecture training, we will start by giving you a deep understanding of the core Microservices concepts and principle with insight in how they have evolved. We will walk you through the complete life cycle - from design to development to testing; including cross-layer concepts such as how to secure Microservices.\n\nAfter completing, Edureka's Microservice training, you will be able to:\n• Understand and differentiate between various Microservices Architectural styles\n• Apply Microservices Architecture principles\n• Know how to make the appropriate Microservice Architecture decision\n• Develop and test a Microservice\n• Know what technologies can be used to enable Microservices with an example\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWho should go for this course?\n\nThis course is designed for professionals aspiring to become: - \n• Application Architects\n• Software Architects\n• Application Developers\n• Developer working on Web, Cloud, Mobile, and other social technologies\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy learn Microservices?\n\nMicroservices Architecture, or simply Microservices, is a unique method of developing software systems as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services in which each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal.  Thanks to its scalability, this architectural method is considered ideal when you have to enable support for a range of platforms and devices—spanning across the web, mobile, Internet of Things, and so on. Because of its flexibility, you can also use this method when you’re not sure what kind of devices you’ll need to support in an increasingly Cloud-based future.\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1844 230 6361 (Toll Free) or India: +91 98702 76458\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka"
