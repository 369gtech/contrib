language: English
recordingDate: 1607623554
description: "Declarative programming is here!\n\nWe have React in web, React Native and Flutter in cross-platform mobile technologies and finally native UI has hope.\n\nJetpack Compose is a new UI framework for native development for Android created by Google in open source. The goal of Compose is to let developers make quality applications allowing them to think about features and essence of application, not how to update the state of the screen from A1 to A2.\n\nIn this talk, Matvei will tell what is declarative programming, how it benefits, how declarative frameworks works, and what principles developers use to create Jetpack Compose. This talk will be interesting to all Android developers that feel pain during creation, update and support of UI for your applications."
