description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2017\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nThe Language of Actors\nIs the Actor Model just a new \"shiny object\" for developers to chase after, a fad soon to be abandoned? Actually the Actor Model is almost as old as the formal definition of object-oriented programming, and addresses the long-term direction of computing and software development. This talk explains why actors are so vital to the future of software development, and why actors are so exceptionally well suited for use with Domain-Driven Design. Find out how actors speak the Ubiquitous Language of your core business domain and help you reactively scale your systems to today's and tomorrow's concurrency demands.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\nVaughn is a veteran software craftsman, with more than 30 years of experience in software design, development, and architecture. He is a thought leader in simplifying software design and implementation using innovative methods. Vaughn is the author of the books \"Implementing Domain-Driven Design\" and \"Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model\", both published by Addison-Wesley. He has been applying the tenets of Domain-Driven Design since his Smalltalk domain modeling days in the early 1990s. Vaughn speaks and presents at conferences internationally, he consults, and has taught his IDDD Workshop around the globe to hundreds of developers. He is also the founder of ForComprehension.com, an online training website."
