description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nMulti-Tenancy in Kubernetes: How We Avoided Clusters Sprawl With Capsule - Dario Tranchitella, CLASTIX & Maksim Fedotov, Wargaming.net\n\nKubernetes is great when you have to deal with it as is and plays well with isolating workloads and limiting resources due to its primitives as ResourceQuota, LimitRange, NetworkPolicy, Namespace, and so on. But is it enough? Can you create a real isolated multi-tenant environment in it? With our experience with many production environments, we discovered it's not entirely. That is the reason why Capsule, an open-source Kubernetes Operator for multi-tenancy was born. Expanding the authentication Kubernetes capabilities, Capsule provides a viable and robust solution to avoid the hyped cluster sprawl while maintaining a native Kubernetes UX. And, last but not least, allowing a BYOD to push compute, storage, and network isolation and avoiding the noisy neighbors' effect. After a brief overview of the project by Dario Tranchitella (maintainer), Max Fedotov will explain how Capsule enhanced the operations and supercharged the provisioning mechanism for their k8s cluster at Wargaming.net"
