description: "Filmed at http://ng-poland.pl 2018 on NOVEMBER 15 in Warsaw. \n\nAdd Native Mobile to Your Angular Projects: The Migration Story\n\nThe Angular and NativeScript teams teamed up to create a new way to share your code between web and mobile apps with Angular and NativeScript. It allows you to easily share the business logic of your app, while providing you an intuitive way to separate the code that is different between the platforms.\nThe ability to share code between your Angular web app and Native mobile apps has never been easier (or more important). Who has the time to invest resources into separate apps for web, native iOS, and native Android?\nIn this talk you will learn how to take an existing Angular Web project and add NativeScript to it, by converting it to a code-sharing project. Then we will go through a few steps of converting individual components and modules into a code-sharing structure.\n\nSebastian Witalec - Technical Evangelist at Progress\n\nSebastian is a Technical Evangelist for Telerik with over 8 years of experience in software engineering and architecture. Sebastian has passion for all types of technologies. However in the last few years his focus shifted towards cross platform Mobile development where he gained experience with Apache Cordova and NativeScript (a member of the team). He is always happy to learn about the new stuff and to pass the knowledge as far as his voice (or the wire) can take him. Sebastian is based in London, UK actively working with various Dev communities in the area. When not acting techie he is a massive football fan/player (probably bigger at heart than skills). \n\nhttps://github.com/sebawita\nhttps://twitter.com/sebawita"
