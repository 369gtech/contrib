recordingDate: 1594839575
description: "It’s the golden era for computer vision, AI, and machine learning – now is a great time to extract value from videos to impact science, society, and business! Microsoft Rocket‘s (https://aka.ms/iotshow/rocket) goal is to democratize video analytics: build a system for real-time, low-cost, and private analysis of live videos. In this show, we will show how Microsoft’s Live Video Analytics on IoT Edge platform and Microsoft Rocket’s containers can be used in tandem for building highly efficient and accurate, real-world live video analytics applications, such as object detection & counting (e.g., cars driving through an intersection), and alerting on objects of interest (e.g., when a customer enters a store).\nLearn more about Microsoft Rocket integration with Live Video Analytics at https://aka.ms/iotshow/rocket"
