description: "From Strata + Hadoop World New York 2015: Every company is looking for new ways to become more data-driven, yet the traditional BI and analytics tools of the last decade have made it difficult for users to work directly with their data. But with the latest innovations in big data discovery platforms, a new role has emerged: the citizen data scientist. Gartner predicts that this role will grow five times faster than its highly trained counterparts.\n\nIn this keynote, Ben will share Platfora’s research behind the importance of this emerging role and will dive deeper into the needs of the citizen data scientist so that companies can become truly data-driven.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Platfora.\n\nAbout Ben Werther (Platfora):\nBen Werther is the Founder and Executive Chairman of Platfora. Ben launched Platfora, and was the founding CEO for four years, with the goal of transforming how ‘citizen data scientists’ in every company make sense and drive action through direct and effortless use of big data. Before founding Platfora, Ben was vice president of products for DataStax, where he shaped the company’s enterprise and Hadoop strategy, and was also head of products at Greenplum through its acquisition by EMC. Ben has a B.S. in Computer Science from Monash University (Australia) and an M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop NYC 2015: https://goo.gl/UunGPH\nVisit our curated data topic page: http://oreilly.com/go/data\nVisit the Strata + Hadoop World website: http://strataconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
