description: "The reactive revolution continues. For as much as we've been talking about reactive programming in Spring for the last few years the journey has only just begun. \n\nJoin me, Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman), and we'll take our reactive applications further, looking at how to build microservices for cloud platforms like PAS (Cloud Foundry) and PKS (Kubernetes). Some of the things we may cover include: - reactive NoSQL data access and SQL data access, HTTP services, service orchestration and reliability patterns, RSocket, and more. \n\nAbout: Josh Long, Developer Advocate, Pivotal\n\nJosh (@starbuxman) is the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal. Josh is a Java Champion, author of 5 books (including O'Reilly's upcoming Cloud Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry) and 3 best-selling video trainings (including Building Microservices with Spring Boot Livelessons with Spring Boot co-founder Phil Webb), and an open-source contributor (Spring Boot, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud, Activiti and Vaadin)"
