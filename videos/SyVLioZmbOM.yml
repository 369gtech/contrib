description: 'In the past year, we changed Java in three ways that we never have before: We modularized the platform, we removed some components, and we accelerated the pace of new releases. These changes aim to keep Java vibrant in an ever-changing world of competing platforms and new styles of application deployment, whether to the cloud or to app stores. They are disruptive, but they?re not as scary as you may think, and many developers have already adjusted to them.'
