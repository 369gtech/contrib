recordingDate: 1570521604
description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/stephenhay/mobilism2011\n\nIt's the layout behind the layout: in this session Stephen will dissect the media query. After a brief review of query syntax, we'll touch on logical expressions, and you'll learn which media features are relevant to mobile design and how and when these can best be used. Stephen will explore the visual and layout viewports and the viewport meta element, and how these relate to media queries. We'll discuss the pros and cons of using media queries in CSS versus within media attributes in HTML, and handle examples of each. Stephen will share his thoughts on how to use this information to develop a meta-layout strategy depending on your site's needs.\n\nAbout Stephen: http://www.the-haystack.com\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
