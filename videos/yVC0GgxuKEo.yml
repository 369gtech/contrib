title: 'DataSphere: Reproducible Machine Learning by Matthew Opala'
recordingDate: 1571326062
description: 'Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific methods. Especially in production Machine Learning itâ€™s crucial to ensure that hidden source of randomness is not a real reason for a model performance improvement. In my talk I will elaborate on importance of reproducibility and show how we build reproducible machine learning pipelines at Netguru.'
