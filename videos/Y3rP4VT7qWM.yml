description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA.\nSpeaker: Oliver Gierke\nSpring MVC forms a solid foundation to implement REST based web-services in Java. However, in real-world projects developers still face challenges when it comes to advanced questions of REST. How to really leverage hypermedia? How to model more complex business functionality with REST. The talk introduces the Spring RESTBucks sample implementation of a hypermedia-driven REST web service and explains how it is using hypermedia elements to implement business processes and how Spring technologies (Spring Data REST, Spring Data JPA and Spring HATEOAS) help developers building the system.\nLearn more about REST on http://www.spring.io\nat\nhttp://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/ (spring MVC's REST controller)\nhttp://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas/ (Hypermedia Support)"
