description: "From Velocity Amsterdam 2015: The Physical Web is an approach to unleash the core superpower of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to any smart device – a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car – and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away.\n\nWhy is this important?\nThe number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn’t realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn’t about replacing native apps: it’s about enabling interaction when native apps just aren’t practical.\n\nWhy is this open source?\nThe Physical Web must be an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible.\n\nHow does this change things?\nOnce any smart device can have a web address, the entire overhead of an app seems a bit backward. The Physical Web approach unlocks tiny use cases that would never be practical:\n- A cat collar would let you call to find the owner\n- A bus tells you its next stop\n- Parking meters can pay in the cloud using the phone’s internet connection\n- Any store, no matter how small, can offer an online experience when you walk in\n- A ZipCar broadcasts a signup page, allowing you to immediately drive away\n- Industrial equipment can offer diagnostics\n\nEach of these examples, taken by itself, is modestly useful. Taken as a whole, however, they imply a vast “long tail” where anything can offer information and utility.\n\nSo many people ask what is the ‘killer app’ for the Physical Web. That’s a bit like asking what is the killer app for the web itself. When any place and object can offer a web page for help, information, configuration, or use, we’ll unlock millions of things, rather than a single killer product.\n\nTo learn more, visit the project on GitHub.\n\nAbout Scott Jensen (Google):\nScott Jenson worked on the Newton at Apple, multiple phone UIs at Symbian, the mobile Maps app at Google, and was a creative director at frog design. He has been writing/speaking about smart devices for many years.\n\nWatch more from Velocity Amsterdam 2015: https://goo.gl/RjGAuw\nVisit the Velocity website: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
