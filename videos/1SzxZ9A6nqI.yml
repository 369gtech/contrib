Out of surprise, I had a WoW factor when I attended first session of my MSBI course with Edureka. Presentation - Check, Faculty - Check, Voice Clarity - Check, Course Content - Check, Course Schedule and Breaks - Check, Revisting Past Modules - Awesome with a big check. I like the way classes were organised and faculty was far above beyond expectations. I will recommend Edureka to everyone and will personally revisit them for my future learnings.\""
