description: "\"For the last 5 years of the mobile revolution, we've been developing against the same old set of conventions and event models designed for the mouse era. In this talk I'll cover what we've learned in designing the Surface from a usability perspective and then introduce Pointer Events, a evolution of Mouse Events that makes much richer web applications possible.\"\n\nTim is an Engineer in Residence with the Microsoft Accelerators in Seattle, Tel Aviv, and Bangalore, where he helps startups use open platforms on the Windows Azure cloud platform. Previously, he was part of Nest Labs, an 'internet of things' startup focused on building an energy efficient home.  Before coding, he aspires to brew a perfectly brewed cup of coffee.\n\nJSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Hotel H2O and Manila Ocean Park, Philippines - 28 + 29 November 2013.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.asia/blog/2013/11/15/jsconfasia-2013-tim-park-pointing-forward\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/TimPark4/jsconf-eu-tim-park-pointing-forward-to-pointer-events\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
