title: 'Webinar: Declarative Host Upgrades From Within Kubernetes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1586896329
description: "As Kubernetes takes over the world, we need a way to manage the hosts on which the clusters are running, but everyone wants to move away from actually logging directly into the hosts or even using tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef. What if you could control the host configuration from within Kubernetes?\n\nIn this webinar, we’ll introduce you to the System Upgrade Controller, a new, open source project from Rancher Labs that runs in any Kubernetes cluster and uses declarative syntax to manage host-level software upgrades. You’ll learn how to deploy it into your clusters, how to create a plan that performs an upgrade, and how to configure upgrades to roll out across the cluster with zero downtime.\n\nYou’ll undoubtedly learn some other things too, but if we led with “idempotent mutations” would you still click the Register button?\n\n\nPresenters:\n\nAdrian Goins, Director of Community and Evangelism @Rancher Labs\nDax McDonald, Software Engineer @Rancher Labs\nJacob Blain Christen, Principal Software Engineer @Rancher Labs"
