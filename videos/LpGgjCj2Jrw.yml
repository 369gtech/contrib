description: "Developing a Westy Tracking platform on Cloud Foundry - Rob Brinkman, JDriven\n\nExperiencing Europe while traveling with our Volkswagen Camper (Westy) is one of the items on top of my bucket list. It would be great to offer friends and family the possibility to track our adventure in real-time and build up a history of the route we took and the places we visited. For that purpose I develop a real-time tracking platform using Vert.x, Redis and AngularJS and I equipped the Westy with an online GPS Tracker and deployed it to CloudFloundry. The realized platform uses Vert.x to handle events published by the tracker(s), stores the history in Redis and visualizes the real-time location and history an a map using AngularJS. This session will give insight in the modern (reactive) architecture style of the application and a hands on introduction to Vert.x., Redis and AngularJS deployed on Cloud Foundry.\n\nAbout Rob Brinkman\nRob is a founding member of JDriven and within JDriven primarily responsible for the development of his colleagues and the organization. Based on his passion for technology and extensive experience as a developer and architect he takes every opportunity to dive into the code."
