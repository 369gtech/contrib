description: "This presentation was recorded at a GOTO Night 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nPramod Sadalage - Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks\n\nABSTRACT\nThe world of data is changing and becoming yet more important as data has became a significant competitive advantage. We are collecting increasing amounts of data, but wanting to process it in decreasing time. This demands new techniques in data storage, enabling the raise of NoSQL technologies. In this talk Pramod will talk about NoSQL in two phases.\n\nIn the first phase, the talk will focus on core concepts needed to understand NoSQL databases, NoSQL data models, in particular the role of aggregates and the consequences of schema-less models, options for distribution and the consequences of maintaining consistency.\n\nIn the second phase the talk will focus on implementation details and look at some representative databases so you can get a feel for how real NoSQL databases work using Riak, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4J and also look at how to implement evolutionary design with schema migration -- an essential requirement even with schema-less databases.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
