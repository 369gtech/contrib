title: 'Building Real time Data in Web Applications with Graal js by Christian Wirth and Dan McGhan'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510225554
description: "Real-time data is an increasingly popular topic these days. The basic idea is simple: when data in the database changes, any clients viewing the data should see the changes immediately: in real-time. Gmail and Twitter are great examples of applications that make use of real-time data. Users donâ€™t need to refresh the page to see new emails or tweets. Instead, new data is pushed to the clients when it becomes available.\n\nIn this session, attendees will learn about some of the tools that make real-time applications easier than ever before, including Graal.js (a drop-in replacement for Node.js that runs on the JVM) and Socket.IO. Of course, the data must be pushed from somewhere, so we will also explore the way that databases participate in this process.\n\n# Dan McGhan\nDan McGhan is an Oracle Developer Advocate with a focus on JavaScript and HTML5. He started his programming career as a back-end Oracle Database developer specializing in SQL and PL/SQL. Before long, he began working with front-end technologies to create web applications where he quickly developed a passion for JavaScript. These days he enjoys sharing his passion for JavaScript, Node.js, and Oracle Database via his blog at https://jsao.io.\n\n# Christian Wirth\nChristian Wirth is a Software Development Manager at Oracle Labs, based in Linz, Austria. He is responsible for the Graal/Truffle based JavaScript implementation called Graal.JS. Christian received a PhD in Computer Science from Johannes Kepler University, Austria. He joined Oracle Labs in 2013."
