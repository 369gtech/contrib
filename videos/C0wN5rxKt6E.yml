description: "You've been working in an organisation that has seen the light of automated testing. You work in a cross-functional team bringing ops, dev, product, user research, content, testing and many other concerns together in harmony. You have iterated through a model greenfield project, have good test coverage and have obeyed the mantra of the testing pyramid. Just a few months down the line why is it so hard to change things? Why are people questioning the value of your tests? Confidence is dropping.\n\nDuring this talk, we will cover an overview of different levels/types of testing but specifically looking at the value they provide to developers and others maintaining software. We will use this information to challenge some conventional thinking and re-balance how confidence in our software is gained without harming its ongoing maintenance.\n\nThis talk is suitable for people with exposure to automated testing methods who want to understand a balanced view of creating a sustainable test strategy through to production and beyond.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
