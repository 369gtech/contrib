description: "Using object relational mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate is commonplace in many Java applications. The productivity offered by ORMs, especially for complex data-models, is persuasive. However, while it is relatively easy to get started, ORMs like Hibernate bring a lot of ‘accidental complexity’ to the table.\nIn this session we will specifically look at how performance can suffer when using Hibernate in common scenarios, and what to do about it. This session is aimed at people who already know Hibernate, but who want to explore the hidden costs of abstraction and want to write better performing Hibernate code!"
