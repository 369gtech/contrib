description: "Rich UIs, schemaless datastores, microservices communicating with each other - the need for powerful and easy-to-use data validation services has never been bigger: guard your services endpoints, your datastore accesses against garbage is important in an analytics shifting universe.\n\nThe Bean Validation standard is here to help, providing Java developers with a rich validation API based on annotations. Bean Validation 2.0 (JSR 380) takes validation to the next level by leveraging Java 8 features such as lambdas, additional annotation locations and repeatable annotations. This opens up exciting opportunities for Bean Validation. There will also be support for Optional, the java.time API and more. Join us and see what's planned for Bean Validation 2.0 and what's already done. Like its predecessors, JSR 380 is developed fully in the open: come exchange, propose and participate!\n\nEmmanuel Bernard is data platform architect for the JBoss portfolio at Red Hat getting his open source hands in Hibernate, Infinispan, Debezium and more.\n\nHe had founded and lead Hibernate Search, Validator and OGM and participated to the Bean Validation spec (as lead) and the JPA one (as expert).\n\nNowadays his focus revolves around NoSQL, analytics and streams of data.\n\nHe is the founder and co-host of two podcasts: JBoss Community Asylum (English) and Les Cast Codeurs Podcast (French)."
