As Node.js architectures get more and more complex, visualization of your microservice-based architecture is crucial. However, the visualization of microservices is incredibly complex given the scale and the transactions across them. You not only need to visualize your Node.js applications but also analyze the health, flow, and performance of applications to have a complete observability solution. In this talk, we'll go over the challenges of scaling your Node.js applications and tools (such as distributed tracing) available to you to scale with confidence.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nAWS Amplify → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nRetool → https://retool.com/\nEpsagon → https://epsagon.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nG2i → https://www.g2i.co/ \n\nSilver Sponsors\nAppSignal → https://appsignal.com/\nSailscasts → https://sailscasts.com/\n\nDiversity Sponsor\nPrisma → https://www.prisma.io/"
