recordingDate: 1409230249
description: "At the Erlang Factory SF BAY AREA 2014, I gave a quick lightning talk introducing opencouch a document oriented database compatible with Apache CouchDB that you can embed in your Erlang Application. The main goal of opencouch is to propose a viable alternative to mnesia while adding some key features of Apache CouchDB like the master-master replication or new features like the horizontal scalability and multiple storage backends. The feedback was really encouraging and I decided to go further. Opencouch now named \"dcouch\" is one of the core component of the refuge project.\n\nThis talk will present the first release of dcouch, how we built it and its key features. This talk will also show how we are using it in the refuge project as a key component of the platform that we are building.\nTalk objectives\n\nPresent the design choices made in dcouch, what are the challenges in building a database in Erlang, how the replication between Erlang applications is handled in a decentralised manner and how you can query the data.\nTarget audience\n\nAnyone interested in databases and decentralised platforms."
