description: "Functional programming has become a hot topic in the JS community, leaving many JavaScripters wondering: What's all the hype about? What do functional programs look like, and why might I prefer them to imperative/object-oriented code? How do I get started writing code in a functional style?\n\nIf you've been asking yourself these questions, you'll enjoy this gentle, practical intro to functional programming. We'll explore the advantages and basic principles of the paradigm, in which holy, pure functions deliver us from the evils of mutable state. We'll see how rejecting side-effects and mutability in our code can avoid a lot of common JS headaches. And we'll learn how to use core JS features as well as some popular FP libraries like Mori and Ramda to start writing our own functional programs."
