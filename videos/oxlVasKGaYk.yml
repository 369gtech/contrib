description: 'A typical tool chain of a Java developer consists of an IDE such as NetBeans, Eclipse, or IntelliJ. These IDEs help you easily write and debug the Java application. They also provide features such as syntax highlighting and code completion, which make you more effective. All three IDEs provide support for building, pulling, and pushing Docker images and running containers. This enables you to run your application or database server as a Docker container from within the IDE itself. This live coding session shows the current state of Docker support in the three IDEs.'
