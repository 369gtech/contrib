description: 'Although Java 9 is now publicly released in practice people still work on Java 8 or are not even migrated to Java 8 yet. Java 8 brought us some ''life changing'' new code constructions. Now it is time to look back and evaluate what java 8 brought us in practice. With great syntax possibilities you can still write utterly ugly code.What is a good way to use Java 8 syntax? How functional is Java 8 really and is Optional the life saver some people promised it to be?'
