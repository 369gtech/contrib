description: "Speaker: Nicolas Frankel\n\nNicolas works as a Developer Advocate for Hazelcast. He has 15+ years experience consulting for many different customers, in a wide range of contexts and has written several books (including \"Integration Testing from the trenches\"). He usually works on Java/Java EE and Spring technologies, but with focused interests like Rich Internet Applications, Testing, CI/CD and DevOps. Currently working for Hazelcast, Nicolas also doubles as a trainer and triples as a book author.\n\n== Integration Testing from the Trenches\nYears after Kent Beck provided JUnit, unit testing is part of most developer teams tooling. However, thereâ€™s a trend that tends to threaten unit testing, claiming only integration testing can truly detect defects in software.\n\nIn this talk, we will first define what unit testing and integration testing are, and their respective pros, cons, and uses. Then, we will have a look at the unique challenges posed by integration testing. Finally, tools and techniques will be presented to somewhat remedy to that so that integration testing becomes a true asset in each software developer bag of tricks.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/274070761/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael Cheng"
