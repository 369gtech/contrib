description: "Serverless computing, microservice orchestration, and application integration provide the opportunity to create working application prototypes in a fraction of the time it would normally take. In this session, we will take a brand-new idea from inception to fully working prototype in under an hour, using Azure Logic Apps, Functions, and API Management. Skyler will provide real-world examples of how he has used rapid development tools to create apps that have won $25,000 at hackathons, appeared in featured articles in TechCrunch, and more.\r\n\r\nThrough this process, you will learn how to integrate best-in-class services such as Twilio and Stripe into your applications, use Excel Online as a database, and leverage Microsoft Teams as a real-time notification service for your applications."
