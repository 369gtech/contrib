title: 'Focus on the User: Making the World a Better Place -  Jeremy Clark'
recordingDate: 1492683621
description: "Our job as developers is to make the world a better place, whether it's connecting people, providing entertainment, or making someone's job easier.\nWe have to know who we're building software for: our users. Understanding my users has been a key to every successful project I've worked on. I'll share some of my successes and some of my failures, and show how that's led to the approach to software that I take today. Together, we can provide our users with just what they need to make their world a bit better."
