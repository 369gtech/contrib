Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nSIG Service Catalog Deep-Dive - Jonathan Berkhahn, IBM & Mateusz Szostok, SAP \n\nJoin us for a deep dive into how Kubernetes Service Catalog works behind the scenes. Starting with a quick overview of the architecture of Service Catalog, we'll also cover the operation of the Open Service Broker API that underpins Service Catalog. We'll cover some of the challenges we faced while bridging the different processing models between Kubernetes and the Open Service Broker API, and we will then look at more advanced scenarios and new features from the perspective of cluster operators, application developers and helm chart authors. Youâ€™ll come away with a solid understanding of how Service Catalog works and recommended workflows and practices for using it. Finally, if you're interested in contributing or using Service Catalog, come meet the maintainers and learn how! \n\nhttps://sched.co/UagL"
