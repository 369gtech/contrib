description: "As developers, we sometimes need to improve the performance our code. Or worse: the code in third party libraries. This talk gives a little bit of background information on why code can be slow, what free and commercial tools we have at hand to measure it, and how different measuring techniques differ.\nWe then apply what we learned by troubleshooting a real performance issue in a real application. The second part of the talk covers the problems associated to high memory allocation and memory leaks, which, unlike unicorns do exist in Java, and will also present a real world application exhibiting these problems, which we will fix.\n\nAfter attending the talk, you will be able to resolve time and memory problems in your applications more easily."
