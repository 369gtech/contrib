title: 'Awesome Monitoring Infrastructure Using the Elastic Stack'
recordingDate: 1548381833
description: "Mark Walkom, Karen Carcamo\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/161/\n\nIoT is great, until something breaks or you want to see how things perform at scale! To handle the volumes of data that any IoT project can generate, many developers default to Open Source tool chains to capture and analyse logs and metrics, and then pinpoint errors, faults or inefficiencies in their systems.\r\n\r\nOne of the most widely used Open Source tools for this is the Elastic Stack:\r\n\r\n * Beats as a lightweight agent/forwarder of data.\r\n * Logstash for further parsing and enrichment.\r\n * Elasticsearch doing the hard work of storing and analysis.\r\n * Kibana for powerful visualisations.\r\n\r\nThis workshop gives you an overview of the four technologies, how they work together and how, from microservice logs to IoT metrics to containerised apps, it has you covered.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the workshop, you'll walk away with a set of connected Docker containers capturing logs and metrics from your laptop, a head start on dashboards for analysis, and ideas to deploy for your next project.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
