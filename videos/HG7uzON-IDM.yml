description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nBetter Histograms for Prometheus - Björn Rabenstein, Grafana Labs \n\nRobust histogram functionality was added to Prometheus long ago, to be precise in version 0.11.0. The histogram representation as we know it from Prometheus andnow also OpenMetrics is a simple yet powerful and enables many important use cases. However, it is also infuriatingly limited, mostly because of its high per-bucket cost. Björn “Beorn” Rabenstein released the above mentioned Prometheus version in February 2015 and has been dreaming about better histograms ever since. In this talk, he will explain why it is so hard for Prometheus to adopt established techniques known from various academic publications and even practical applications in other metrics-processing systems. To add a silver lining, he will share his latest findings from reignited efforts to finally break through the barriers and bring efficient high-resolution histograms to Prometheus.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZekL"
