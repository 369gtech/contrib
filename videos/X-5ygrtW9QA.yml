description: "Software enthusiast since I wrote my first line back in the 8th grade, I've been paid for developing software, providing consultations, and leading teams and projects since year 2000. I am a certified software architect and analyst, having worked on projects ranging from embedded microsystems and kernel drivers to large enterprise solutions, and having a strong belief that right team spirit is the crucial factor for success. For the last 3 years I'm in the best team in our country - Visma Lietuva, UAB.\n\nAgile in the trenches... like, the real trenches.\n\nAgile principle of \"trusting work to the self-organizing, self-managing teams\" is radically different to the military doctrine of \"strict top-down hierarchy, command & control\". Yet almost a 100 years ago this idea was tried out on many battlefields and the consequences are still felt today."
