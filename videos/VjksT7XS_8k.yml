Next to that, Single Sign-On should be part of each APEX architecture and this webinar will go through three well-documented implementation options: OAuth2, Kerberos and SAML2.\n\n\nA recording provided by the awesome APEX community, that built a virtual 24 hour conference called APEX@Home held on April 16th 2019.\n\nWith 24 world renowned speakers and nearly 5000 virtual attendees, this event was a huge success.
