description: "Yu gratefully acknowledges the work of Eduardo Madrid in this Cppcon 2016 presentation, Achieving performance in financial data processing through compile time introspection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6fo90R8q5U\n\nhttp://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nWe will discuss what reflection is and how it can be implemented in Modern C++. The techniques used will include a mix of C++11/14 features (void_t, tuple, index_sequence, variadic templates, auto functions, decltype(auto), constexpr, type_traits, etc), classic C++ features, and macros.\n\nWe’ll use a couple of example libraries to show the essence and power of compile-time reflection and show how to simplify and improve their implementation with C++17 features such as inline variables, constexpr if, structure binding, fold expressions, and string_view. \n\nThe first example is a library that can serialize a struct into any of a variety of data formats, such as JSON, XML, MessagePack, or a custom format. \n\nWe’ll then apply the same techniques to implement an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library to serialize structs into the tables of any of a variety of databases, such as SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, etc.\n\nWe’ll discuss some of the challenges and limitations of these techniques and what features could be added to C++ to improve support for compile-time reflection.\n— \nYu Qi: purecpp.org, Technical Director\n\nYu is a C++ programmer with 10 years experience who lives in Zhuhai, Guangdong province, China. He loves modern C++ and has founded an open source community ( http://www.purecpp.org/ ) to promote C++11/14 in China. His focus is distributed systems and he is the author of rest_rpc, an RPC library implemented in C++14. Yu's github is https://github.com/qicosmos . Yu wrote a Chinese language book about C++11 in 2015: http://item.jd.com/11701870.html The title translates as \"C++11 In Depth.\"\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
