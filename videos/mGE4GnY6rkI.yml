title: 'Evolutionary Serverless Architectures with Safe Deployments - Danilo Poccia'
language: English
recordingDate: 1542184006
description: "The term \"architecture\" applied to software can bring the idea of static, difficult to change, solutions. Unfortunately, that is often the result of a software implementation.\n\nAn evolutionary architecture designs for incremental change in an architecture as a first principle, looking at software development over time as an optimization task, using a \"fitness function\" to estimate the efficiency of a software release.\n\nIn this session, weâ€™ll show how to automate a CI/CD pipeline to compute a fitness function during deployment, using a pre-traffic hook Lambda function dynamically analyzing the configuration of the resources implemented via AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) templates.\n\nFull Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp4wchugWzHunbhpQtRRE1XQtliXIkuYU\nWebsite: https://milan.serverlessdays.io\nServerlessDays Map: https://serverlessdays.io/map"
