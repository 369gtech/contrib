title: 'Types war: Weak vs Strong (Victor Polischuk, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1468313870
description: "It is well known that languages with weak typing are weaker than strong-typed ones. People fight on the matter so often and so passionately like the zealots of the past. I would like to open the wound again and bring a bit of clarity why and, more importantly, how we have to fight those battles from now on.\n\nLet’s compare what we have in Java with other languages and feel the difference. Pragmatic one. I will show a bit of pain which, nowadays, a compiler takes away from a developer so the latter can “safely” code. Also I will try to answer the questions “which one is better” and “where are we going”.\n\nIt is always fun to see how little you know and how much is behind the curtains."
