description: "The Art of Documentation for Open Source Projects - Ben Hall, Katacoda \n\nWhile many Open Source projects have amazing code-bases, the documentation is letting them down and as a result they are losing influence and opportunities for adoption and feedback.   In this talk, Ben uses his expertise of building an Interactive Learning Platform to highlight The Art of Documentation. The aim of the talk is to help open source contributors understand how small changes to their documentation approach can have an enormous impact on how users get started.  Ben will discuss: - How to create engaging documentation  - Defining technical details in an accessible way - Building documentation that encourages users to get started - How to manage documentation and keeping it up-to-date and relevant  In the end, attendees will have an understanding of how to build beautiful, useful documentation. This will be backed by examples from some of the best open source projects. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrTi"
