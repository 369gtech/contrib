description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/1vLuN\n\nIn this part of my code refactoring tutorial I will cover how to turn an implied tree structure into a composite pattern.\n\nWhat do you do when you want to model a tree structure? You can either list the info as primitives and then search through them for what you want or you can create objects that represent each level of the tree with the composite pattern."
