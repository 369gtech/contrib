title: 'Pavel Veller - From conversational interfaces to serverless natural language APIs'
recordingDate: 1557967635
description: 'Some proponents of chatbots believe that, once we conquer natural language understanding, software systems will start communicating like humans. They say that agents will speak with other agents to get things done, with no API and no data contracts required. That remains to be seen. In the meantime, I would like to take you on a journey of building an app that was designed to use natural language as its only interface and API â€¦ well, sort of. Was it easy to build? Easy to integrate with? Did it help making the app multimodal and run on the web, over chat, and Alexa? In this talk I will share lessons learned from my experiment designing and building a natural language first system that runs serverless end to end.  - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf3'
