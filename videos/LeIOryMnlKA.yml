description: "Keynote: Mendix Roundtable: Cloud Foundry and Low-Code: The Whole is Greater than the Sum of its Parts    \n\nAlthough Cloud Foundry has greatly simplified application deployment and management, developing cloud-native apps is still challenging and time-consuming. But what if you applied the same principles of abstraction and automation that have streamlined deploying applications to building them? \n\nEnter low-code platforms, which Forrester defines as \"platforms that enable rapid application delivery with a minimum of hand-coding, and quick setup and deployment.” With the market surging to an expected $15 billion by 2020, low-code platforms are being adopted by enterprise IT organizations looking to speed innovation and business transformation. \n\nIn this panel, several leading organizations will share how they’re leveraging low-code platforms on Cloud Foundry to deliver web and mobile applications at unprecedented speed and scale. See how low-code enables a much broader range of users to build enterprise-grade applications, helping IT to close the capacity gap while maintaining control. In addition, discover how the combination of low-code and Cloud Foundry speeds each stage of the app lifecycle (ideate, develop, test, deploy and operate) to enable continuous innovation).\n\nMichael Vizard\nIT Business Edge\nIT Business Edge\nMichael Vizard is a seasoned IT journalist, with nearly 30 years of experience writing and editing about enterprise IT issues.
