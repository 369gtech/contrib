description: "ASP.NET Core 1.0 is the ground-up rewrite of ASP.NET, MVC and Web API, bringing a new paradigm in building web applications and APIs in .NET. With this rewrite brought new techniques in building SOLID applications, and updated some existing patterns and tools.\nIn this session, we'll take a lap around some of the major extension points of ASP.NET Core 1.0, walking through how these features can help us build cleaner, more maintainable systems. We'll cover web APIs, traditional MVC applications, controllers, views, filters, dependency injection, tag helpers and more. With a SOLID foundation, our ASP.NET Core applications will be dead simple to build and maintain."
