language: English
recordingDate: 1639413706
description: "This is a new EBC-ish talk from Coté on how to overcome four common barriers to getting better at software in large organizations: can’t change fast enough, bad tools and long wait times, no one trusts change so doesn’t, legacy systems.\n\nIt gives a brief overview of what the VMware Tanzu portfolio is all about, what the point of getting better at software is, and then covers four common barriers to change for large organizations and how they overcome them. All with a little help from Tanzu, of course."
