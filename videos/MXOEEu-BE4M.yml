description: 'When I started at Joymode almost a year and a half ago, I was brought on as their first strictly front-end developer tasked with updating their front-end stack. Within a year, we went form a slow CoffeeScript/jQuery app on Rails, to a modern decoupled Vue app on the JAMstack. My talk goes into the motivations for migrating, my push for using Vue when the team had already convinced themselves prior to using React, and the strategies to progressively move over a large legacy codebase to a modern framework while still running a business. Finally, I can reflect on what went well and what didn''t.'
