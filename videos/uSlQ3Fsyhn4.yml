language: English
recordingDate: 1507160860
description: "Roberto Mercado Mariscal, Oracle\n\nWhat would a map with all 30+ million streets of the US look like? What would displaying all 600 million taxi pickup and drop-off locations in New York City on a single map tell us about the most-popular destinations? In this session, you will learn how to lift and shift vast amounts of raw data (such as street segment data or tweets) from Oracle Storage Cloud Service to Oracle Database Cloud Service and how to set up Java microservices on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to query and render the geospatial data onto a single, shared digital map—through a coordinated divide-and-conquer approach."
