description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nCloud Event Horizon - Ian Coffey, VMware \n\nCloudevents offers a useful specification which can help facilitate new patterns and innovation in several areas of tech. In this session, we will use a hands-on machine learning example to explore how Cloudevents and evented systems can work together. First we will perform an experiment by combining CloudEvents with BentoML and Tektoncd to explore the cross-section of events, machine learning models and CI/CD pipelines. Then, we will use the Kubeflow KFServing project to deploy our models inference service into a canary setup.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zep2"
