description: "Arcades were once an exciting meeting place for the public to see the latest innovations in game interaction. Detailed graphics, holograms, delightful combination of physical hydraulics and digital effects and surround sound. Sometimes the arcade machines were so advanced you were simply happy watching other people play them. You were left with a very real sense that their creators were constantly pushing the limits of their medium.\nIn many ways modern interactive installations capture the same magic and energy that went into the innovative arcade machines of the early 90s. Without knowing it, we’ve been working our way toward the same goals and outcomes of these old arcades. So what’s stopping us from just making one?  Zander will talk through his process as his team gets closer to their goal of reinventing the arcade using projections, bears, motors and other fun stuff.\n\nZander Brimijoin\nCreative Director and Co Founder, Red Paper Heart\nhttps://twitter.com/RedPaperHearts\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
