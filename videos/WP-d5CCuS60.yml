title: 'Minko Gechev – Faster Angular applications'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1519651678
description: "High performance applications always bring better user engagement and experience. We often implicitly judge the quality of given application by it’s initial load time and responsiveness.\n\nIn the world of the single-page applications, we usually have to transfer huge amount of resources over the wire which dramatically impacts the initial load time. On top of that, performing change detection over the entire component tree, corresponding to a complex UI, often causes frame drops because of heavy computations happening in the main thread.\n\nIn the first part, we’ll discuss different techniques which can improve the runtime performance of our application in order to help us achieve rendering with 60fps! In the second part of this talk we’ll explain essential practices that can help us reduce the initial load time of our Angular applications."
