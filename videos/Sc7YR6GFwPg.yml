recordingDate: 1579521306
description: "During the speech we will explain what NoOps model means for us in Finastra and how we are adopting such model.\nIn more details, we are going to show how our company's production and operations requirements look like, and what are the tasks that we automated for such requirements.\nOur ultimate goal is to get from commit to production in less than 24 hours.\n\nAlso, during the presentation we'll discuss platform services' CI/CD pipeline as code, quality gates enforcement, and will demo how it works with Azure DevOps.\nYet another subject of the presentation will be our pipeline's integration with company's release and change management system, which allows to audit any change made to production.\nAnd finally we'll explain how we configure monitoring to send feedback to release pipeline and allows quick reactions like rollbacks or declining promotion to next stage in case of any issues.\n\nKey takeaways:\n•    why you want to have everything as code\n•    why you want to automate everything \n•    what you should take into account to have resilient deployment of your services to production stage\n\nThe speech took on 8th May 2019 on DataTech Stage during Infoshare 2019."
