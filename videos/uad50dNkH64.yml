title: 'microXchg 2018 - Cloud-native Microservices - Timo Derstappen'
language: English
recordingDate: 1523086539
description: 'Microservice Architectures are around since a while now. There have already been a few generations of tooling and patterns that helped to run and manage them. Timo will show us how a current cloud-native stack looks like and which tools should be on your radar. The talk will cover both operational and architectural topics. As the name cloud-native suggests most of the projects explained in the talk are either already hosted within the cloud-native computing foundation (CNCF) or within the incubation process. Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, Opentracing and GRPC are just a few examples.'
