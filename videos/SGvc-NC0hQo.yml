For a free trial of basic C programming tutorial, sign up here: http://www.edureka.co/c-programming-datastructure-course\n\nThe first step to learning C programming is to understand the basics of computer. This video, therefore, deals with an introduction to computers, i.e. what is a computer, including textbook definitions and a simple explanation of how it actually functions. A brief introduction of the components of a computer is given: CPU, RAM, input devices (mouse, keyboard etc.) and output devices (monitor etc.). The interaction between the components/parts of computer  is also discussed here.\n\nEven though this might seem like a very basic exercise, understanding the fundamentals of computers and how computers work is one of the most essential steps before you start writing computer programs. C is a very important computer language, and this video is a part of Edureka's online learning material to understand the computer basics before learning basics of C programming."
