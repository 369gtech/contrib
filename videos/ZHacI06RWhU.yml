description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nERLANG DISTRIBUTION: GOING BEYOND THE FULLY CONNECTED MESH\nby Peer Stritzinger & Adam Lindberg\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nErlang \nDistribution \nUDP\n\nTALK LEVEL: Advanced\n\nABSTRACT\nIn our search to improve Erlang distribution as cluster sizes grow and topologies become more dynamic, we have tried many things: prototyping solutions to ahead-of-line blocking using fragmented packages, using UDP for distribution, and experimenting with Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) for real-time Erlang in industrial settings.\n\nWe will talk about our experiences so far and build upon the work of the OTP team by experimenting with a generic behaviour to make custom Erlang distribution implementations easier.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/peer-stritzinger/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - PEER STRITZINGER\nReal Bare Metal Erlang\n\nPeer ported Erlang to Hard-Realtime Operating system RTEMS (www.grisp.org). He developed the Hydraprog automotive control unit flashing device, which has been used successfully all over the world for over a decade. Since 2007 the firmware of the device is written mainly in Erlang - including protocol stacks for all existing automotive protocols. Peer is currently developing an industrial transport system controller with Erlang in a small embedded system.\n\nPeer's previous experience ranges from low level device drivers to functional languages in industrial and automotive applications, he initially mastered in Physics at the Technical University Munich. He has been working self-employed as a developer since 1987 and also consulted in applied cryptography and protocol design and implementation.\n\nHe is currently living and working in the idyllic countryside west of Munich, Bavaria.\n\nMore on Peer Stritzinger: https://codesync.global/speaker/peer-stritzinger/\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ADAM LINDBERG\nUse one on CMS\n\nSenior software development professional. Experience with distributed architecture, cloud infrastructure, live operations and embedded systems. Focus on dynamic languages, test driven development and agile methods. Author of Meck, an open source mocking framework for Erlang.\n\nMore on Adam Lindberg: https://codesync.global/speaker/adam-lindberg/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
