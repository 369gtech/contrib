title: 'The Diabolical Developer''s Guide to Surviving Java 9 and 10, with Martijn Verburg'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526552492
description: 'Java 10 has come hot on the heels of Java 9 which means double the upgrade fun! Java 9 came with a new modularity system (Jigsaw) which has strict restrictions on the runtime and compile time access for of internal libraries (such as sun.misc.Unsafe), a new REPL (JShell), a change of the default garbage collector to G1, and much more! All of this means that Java 9/10 is the most breaking release since Java 5 introduced generics. In this session, the Diabolical Developer presents a pragmatic guide to migrating your apps to Java 9/10 and how to avoid the common pitfalls. He covers how to still gain access to those restricted internal libraries, how to deal with the performance impact of moving to G1, how to split your app to use both the classpath approach and the new modularization approach, and more. Leave this session with the confidence to move to Java 9/10!'
