title: 'Thomas Dinsmore: The Path to Open Data Science / The Path to AI-Enabled Organization'
recordingDate: 1543622063
description: "Thereâ€™s a lot of talk about machine learning and AI. Every day, it seems, there is a new story about some remarkable thing powered my machine learning, such as diagnosing cancer, finding oil and gas, writing music, or detecting plant diseases. According to the Harvard Business Review, machine learning is already changing business, improving the quality of work, and making prediction cheaper.\n\nOpen data science is the critical capability that makes it possible for organizations to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence at scale. Working data scientists prefer to use open source software, such as Python, R, and Apache Spark, for many reasons. These include comprehensive functionality, flexibility, extensibility, transparency, and innovation.\n\nHowever, many organizations have a large footprint of legacy analytics software. Executives in these organizations struggle to manage the growing cost of this software and to encourage users to adopt open source tooling.\n\nMigration to open data science is challenging for several reasons. Existing users of legacy software often have strong personal preferences and resist switching. Programs written with legacy software must be rebuilt in new tools. Data may be siloed within the legacy platform. Complicating matters, commercial software vendors use community-building techniques to cultivate loyalty among end users.\n\nNevertheless, we see organizations successfully transition to a culture of open data science. This makes it possible for us to identify a series of transitional steps for organizations. These include understanding user needs; aligning software to needs; eliminating data silos; code migration; and training users on new tools.\n\nWe close the presentation with a discussion of keys to success in building an open data science culture. They include such things as executive leadership, cost transparency, and clear metrics of user adoption and success with open data science tools.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/crunch\n\nCrunch Conference\nhttps://crunchconf.com/"
