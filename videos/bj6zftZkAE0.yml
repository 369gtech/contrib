description: 'Microservice based architectures are the de-facto standard for newly written software. At Picnic, we developed a large number of services ranging from frontend shopping services to backend supply chain services. All services are tightly integrated, scalable, and highly adaptable. However, this leads also to less clean APIs, unwanted dependencies, extra development time, and instability. In this talk we explain how we deviated from a dogmatic approach to microservices towards mesoservices with less service granularity for faster development and shorter time-to-market.'
