description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nDistributed systems, if done right, allow for high available highly scalable systems. There is a lot said and done about consistency in a distributed system and this talk focuses on building a system that favors high availability over consistency. To build highly available systems you have to sacrifice consistency when partitioning occurs. A Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a datatype that allows nodes in a distributed system to replicate data to each other without conflicts. Akka has a module to use make use CRDT's to distribute data over your cluster. This module is called Distributed Data.\n\nThis talk will give an introduction to Distributed systems, data replication and how CRDT's work. This will serve as a basis to explain Akka Distributed Data. At the end a short demo will show it working."
