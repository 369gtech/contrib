title: 'Configuring Clusters: Optimizing PKS for Your Use Case'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538586011
description: "Pivotal Container Service (PKS) allows operators and application developers an easy, automated way to manage and use Kubernetes while maintaining flexibility. Operators are able to define cluster plans, which ensures a consistent `pks create-cluster` for application developers. Since these plans are shared, it is of vital importance for their configuration to be optimized for stability, performance, reliability, and resilience. In this talk, Angela and Nikita will highlight how operators can configure PKS to best fit their use case. We will highlight several new features in the latest PKS release, including multi-master, disaster recovery for the control plane, and workers spanning multiple AZs. Operators will learn how to best take advantage of these new features, as well as hear what's on the road map for improving configurability and stability in future releases!\n\nSpeakers:\nAngela Chin\nSenior Software Engineer, Pivotal\n\nNikita Rathi\nNikita Rathi\nSoftware Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
