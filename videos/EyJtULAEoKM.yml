description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nA very popular feature of the WhatsApp Messenger smartphone application is the ability to send images, videos, and audio notes to the smartphones of friends, family members, and groups. As one of our 2012 server projects, we replaced our original multimedia system with an Erlang-based system.  In this talk we will describe the architecture of the new system, some of the obstacles we encountered, and the scalability, functionality, and operability improvements that were achieved."
