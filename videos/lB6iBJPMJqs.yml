description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: No More Moats: Protecting Your Cloud Native Infrastructure with Zero Trust - Daniel Feldman, HPE \n\nThe greatest barrier to cloud native adoption is security. Microservices, Kubernetes, and cloud computing itself all increase the attack surface of your infrastructure and decrease the administrative controls available to security teams. You can overcome this barrier by designing your architecture around Zero Trust. Zero Trust may sound like a buzzword, but it’s a powerful idea -- instead of creating security perimeters around your services, enable each service to individually authenticate and authorize incoming requests.  In this talk we’ll show you how you can secure your cloud native infrastructure with Zero Trust by building a solid foundation with SPIFFE and SPIRE, and then adding OPA, Envoy, and other open source security tools to protect against specific attacks. We’ll show sample architectures from Fortune 500 organizations and examine how they got there. \n\nhttps://sched.co/f6jb"
