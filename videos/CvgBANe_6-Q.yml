recordingDate: 1470547729
description: "For some teams, having a Business Analyst would be a luxury. For others, they are no longer necessary. Whatever your situation, analysis and critical thinking is still essential in software development. Even if you don’t have a Business Analyst!\n\nDuring this talk, you will learn how to become a Business Analyst while still being a developer, tester, or product manager. I will introduce some of the secrets that great Business Analysts use to get people collaborating, discussing the problem, and agreeing on a solution. Learn how to run a design studio, 3 amigos session, or a story kickoff. Don’t just be a zombie reading your next ticket. Let’s think about the problem and how we’ll solve it together!\n\nRyan is passionate about agile and challenging the norm. With over 6 years of agile experience, Ryan has worked with numerous agile teams as a business analyst and iteration manager.\n\nRyan works for the team at Elabor8 as a Lead Consultant. He is currently consulting at Monash University on one of their first agile transformation programs. He is sharing his passion for analysis techniques and mindset and looks to instill this ethos with all of his teams. Prior to Monash, Ryan has worked on agile and digital projects at the REA Group, SEEK, the Suncorp Group, and UniSuper.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
