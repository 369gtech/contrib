description: "Throwing Out the Checklist\n\nDan Crowley, Quizlet\n \nEffective privacy design is a crucial component of technology products and has been a global focus area for regulators and companies alike for decades. Despite this, many classic \"\"privacy-by-design\"\" processes ultimately fail. Why is that? This session focuses on the gaps in most PbD processes, notably how classic PbD systems exhibit inflexibility, are under-resourced, and conflict with predominant engineering cultures. It also discusses what companies, but especially smaller companies, and their privacy champions can do to achieve better privacy outcomes. By shifting from programs designed around process-oriented mandates to programs that emphasize building a “privacy-by-ethos” culture, companies can set themselves (and their users) up for success when it comes to privacy best practices.\n\nView the full PEPR '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr20/conference-program"
