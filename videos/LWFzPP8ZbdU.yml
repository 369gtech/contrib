recordingDate: 1607361870
description: "In this 2017 GDC talk, SMU Guildhall's  Squirrel Eiserloh discuss RNGs vs. noise functions, and shows how the latter can replace the former in your math library and provide many other benefits (unordered access, better reseeding, record/playback, network loss tolerance, lock-free parallelization, etc.) while being smaller, faster, and easier to use.\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
