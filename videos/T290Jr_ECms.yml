title: 'Stuart J Mackintosh - Improving the perception of Perl and Raku - Marketing'
language: English
recordingDate: 1593202289
description: "Both Perl and Raku have great strengths and we have more to do so that this can be shared with others outside our community.\n\nDuring the preparations for FOSDEM, we created banners and messaging to support the great work done before. These were very well received at FOSDEM and we had a great deal of positive feedback however they were created in a hurry and a more strategic process is required.\n\nBy having messages and brand assets to hand, it will become easier to put together high quality and professional material to present around Perl and Raku.\n\nPeople looking to learn a language or go back to something they have used before will be more comfortable if they feel that the brand is strong and matches that of other languages and technologies. It is important for organisations setting out on a project to select appropriate technology and for sponsors to have comfort that Perl is still relevant. Perl and Raku are not suitable for every situation so getting this right will help show where they could be the best solution and equally when they are not.\n\nThis is a TPF supported activity, please come along and share your thoughts and ideas - and you donâ€™t need to know marketing to add value. Here are some of the ways you can provide input:\ntell us what you like about other digital tech brands\nwhat has worked for Perl in the past, what has not\nhave you created content, flyers and other material - come and share it\nwhat are the strengths and weaknesses of both Perl and Raku compared to other competitive languages\nwhy did you choose Perl / Raku?\nI hope that we can maintain the conversation after the event and work together to sustain the ongoing activities."
