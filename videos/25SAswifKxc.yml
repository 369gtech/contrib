title: 'Hot and spicy Java with Lombok. Live! (Vladimir Tsukur, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1468313215
description: 'Lombok is a small, but very useful library that helps to remove smelly Java boilerplate. Are you tired of writing getters and setters, builders or even constructors? Want to generate toString() / equals() / hashCode() or immutable class very fast? Lombok spices up these and many other experiences by allowing you to achieve small goals declaratively and effectively. We’ll be coding live in this session, learn Lombok features, limitations and things to be aware of. Come over, sit on tight and enjoy the ride!'
