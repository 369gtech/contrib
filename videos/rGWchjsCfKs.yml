description: "Michael Porter said: “Organisations have two choices. You are either the cheapest or you are different.”\n\nIf we accept that only one organisation can be the cheapest, then everyone else has to be different.\n\nYes?\n\nBut surely there is nothing ‘different’ about accountants? Is there really an opportunity in this historically staid, and stereotypically dull, industry for firms to be unusual; to take a different approach?\n\nFarnell Clarke is a firm of chartered accountants and business advisors that delivers its difference through the use of technology.\n\nIn this sponsors presentation Will Farnell, the founder and managing director of Farnell Clarke, will discuss the evolution of technology in the accountancy profession and explore how technology providers are the single most important element of change in this, and almost every other, marketplace."
