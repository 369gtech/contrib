description: "Quantum technologies are often only over-hyped showed as threat for cybersecurity ‚Ä¶ But they also offer some opportunities to enhance the cybersecurity landscape . As an example, you may know that a quantum computer will be able to break RSA keys but Quantum communication technologies can also provide a new way to exchange securely a cipher key. More, with Quantum networking technologies, communication eavesdropping are , by design, detectable and thus this could lead to some good opportunities to use them to enhance cybersecurity. Some even begins to build a Quantum internet ! We may also solve main security issues face by cloud computation (privacy, confidentiality etc) via the use of ‚ÄúBlind quantum computation‚Äù in the cloud.\n\nHowever few people understand & explain how such machines & technologies work. Even fewer people trying to build one. I‚Äôm one of this crazy people.\n\nIn this talk, we aim to explain how this new type of much powerful digital processing works and how we build our own Quantum computer ‚Ä¶without a Phd in quantum physic. We will describe our plan to build the Quantum computer‚Äôs hardware with hacker‚Äôs style. Through our own experiments, we will discuss our failures, our success, our progress around this challenging goal !\n\nCome to see Live demonstration of part of the hardware we build at the moment. We use the ‚ÄúTrapped ion technology‚Äù. We trap atoms to make powerful calculation & computing task! Be prepared to unlock your quantum brain as this new domain is really different for classical computation üòâ but it can enhance the Cybersecurity world\n\n=== \n\nEngineer in electronics and computer science, Yann Allain is an Entrepreneur, so called ‚Äúcybersecurity expert‚Äù but who knows that he does not know everything. He is interested in the model ‚ÄúDo It Yourself‚Äù. he has founded Opale Security in 2008, and created one of the world‚Äôs leading IoT vulnerability research team before being acquired by a larger group in 2016. He has been working in the security industry for 25 years. His past activities were related to software security and hardware security . He was the leader of the Hardsploit Project. Yann speaks as a lecturer and trainer all over the world (Blackhat USA, Blackhat Europe, Hack In the box Amsterdam, TedX, Hack In Paris & more ‚Ä¶). At night, he hacked into old computers and work on subjects normally ‚Äúreserved‚Äù for academics ‚Ä¶ like quantum computing or Bio Hacking and many other things ‚Ä¶ Yann has a new project: He build his own Quantum computers based on Trapped Ions technology at NextGenQ (his new company)."
