description: "Java 8 provides us with new APIs to support a functional programming style.

In this talk I will show you some additional libraries for Java 8 (and beyond) which give you this little extras here and there. I will cover a wide variety of use cases like filter/map/reduce, stream API add-ons, lambdas with unit testing, SQL query support.\n\nThis will cover among others: Vavr, JUnit 5, jOOL, RxJava, Vert.x, Jinq"
