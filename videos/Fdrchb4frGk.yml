description: "Kristina Bennett, Google\n\nAlmost every service has critical data somewhere, whether it's large-scale blob storage or minimalistic index tables or just the service's own production configuration. The data's sizes and shapes and storage technologies vary widely; and yet, the possibilities for data loss remain, and the same obstacles to recovery consistently appear. This talk reviews the practices that can prepare a service for practical data recoveries, highlights some of the hidden dangers waiting to ambush a recovery attempt, and examines some of the risk/cost tradeoffs that inevitably dominate data integrity coverage, based on the lessons of five years of data integrity tooling and consulting across Google.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
