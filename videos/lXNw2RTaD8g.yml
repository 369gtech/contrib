description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n\nServerless WebSockets at Scale | Simon Tabor - Head of Core Services at DAZN\n\nABSTRACT\nBuilding high-scale WebSocket services is notoriously difficult. At DAZN, we wanted to do exactly that, but can serverless technologies make it easier? We’ll follow the journey of building and testing a WebSocket service, capable of handling millions of concurrent connections, on AWS.\nThis talk will give an overview of the options available on AWS and deep-dive into the solution and architecture we designed. We’ll show our load tests and some interesting learnings and limitations that we discovered along the way.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshIO\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
