It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.\n\nWith React Native, you don't build a \"mobile web app\", an \"HTML5 app\", or a \"hybrid app\". You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.\n\nApollo provides a universal GraphQL API on top of your existing services, so you can build new application features fast without waiting on backend changes.\n\nBuild and update application features without writing new endpoints. Just write a GraphQL query and Apollo gets the data for you.\n\nBest of all, Apollo integrates with the technology you're already using, so you can add it a little bit at a time. It also works with the whole specification and all community GraphQL tools."
