description: "Rafael Garcia-Dias\n\nThis talk presents a project that uses an API of the Brazilian government to retrieve data from congresspeople and expose how they are spending people's money. I use Pandas to manipulate the data and, Lektor and Chart.JS to create a website that makes this data accessible and comprehensible.\n\nThis talk presents the basic concepts of data treatment and manipulation. It presents a quick introduction to Lektor, a framework to build static websites in pure Python (and, a little bit of markdown and HTML). I also make a brief presentation of the project Serenata de Amor, which I use to retrieve the data of Brazilian congresspeople. I talk about Pandas_profiling, Pandas, and chart.js, giving very simple examples of how they can be used to produce nice data visualization.\n\nThis talk is especially interesting for those that want to build a simple static website and donâ€™t want to deal with javascript frameworks like Hugo. It is also interesting for people that are interested in data science and anybody that is thinking about how to use their skills to impact politics."
