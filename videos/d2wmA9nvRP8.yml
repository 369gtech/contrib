It provides functions like: service discovery, traffic routing/shifting, security, observability etc. Multi-tenant is very common in kubernetes clusters. So how to better utilize service mesh capabilities while providing enterprise multi-tenant support in kubernetes clusters? In this talk we will walk you through below items and show you some tradeoffs for different service mesh options. 1. What challenges does multi-tenant bring to Service Mesh? 2. What service mesh options are applicable for multi-tenant support? 3. What does single mesh and multi mesh mean for multi-tenant and what are their Cons & Pros? 4. Performance comparison for different service mesh topology on multi-tenant clusters."
