description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLiving on the Edge: Using IoT Devices on Kubernetes WebAssembly Applications - Kate Goldenring, Microsoft; Rodrigo Farias Rodrigues Lemos, Federal University of Pernambuco\n\nWebAssembly, Kubernetes, IoT, the “Edge”, and Rust. What happens when all of these are brought together? On the Edge, the smaller and more secure the application the better. Many of these optimizations come out of the box with WebAssembly. Akri is an open source project that discovers IoT devices – like sensors or cameras -- and represents them as requestable resources for Kubernetes clusters on the Edge. As compute resources for nodes on the edge are limited, Akri investigated converting its components to WebAssembly, reducing its footprint and opening a pathway for WebAssembly applications to leverage Akri to use IoT devices. Rodrigo and Kate will discuss the motivation behind the work, the collaboration with and use of Krustlet (a Rust kubelet that enables running WebAssembly applications on Kubernetes), limitations due to early WASI proposals and experiments, and a roadmap for what is to come. It will include a demo of Akri discovering demo devices and a Web Assembly Kubernetes application requesting and using them . This talk will show how the integration of Akri and Krustlet makes using IoT devices easy and simple on the Wasm environment."
