title: 'Performance and Testing of an Open Source Erlang TCP/IP Stack - Thomas Arts - EUC17'
language: English
recordingDate: 1501245420
description: "Erlang fits very well for protocol implementation, even protocols like TCP/IP.\n\nRecently, the Erlang TCP/IP implementation from research at the university of A Coruna (UDC) became open source.\n\nThe TCP/IP protocol is not an easy protocol to implement and replacing the well known TCP/IP stacks with a new open source implementation is a risk for Otolonetworks. To mitigate that risk, the stack was extensively tested with QuickCheck. The concurrency errors initially found have been fixed and we trust this stack to be conform the protocol specifications.\nThe second obvious concern may be its performance. Otolonetworks validated the performance by comparing it with the kernel stack as well as running on OSv. In this talk we report on our findings."
