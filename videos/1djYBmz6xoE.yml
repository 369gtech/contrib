description: "Far from being the latest 'tech trend', serverless applications help your organization scale quickly and efficiently. They take the hassle out of provisioning infrastructure, configuring web servers, debugging configuration, and managing security settings, allowing your team to focus on coding and testing.

When missing state management abilities, building up complex flows in your data processing will prove to be quite daunting, and often, will require you to provide custom mechanisms for enabling you to communicate between your functions. Join this session to learn how to build serverless applications that scale seamlessly and automatically and leverage the Power Platform to create reliable and low-code applications.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n25 Day of Serverless: https://25daysofserverless.com/\nPower Serverless: https://aka.ms/POWERfulDevs-IntroAzureFunctions"
