title: 'Modularization - How hard can it be? by Elin Nilsson'
recordingDate: 1552924165
description: "Modularizing codebases and splitting up monoliths are all the hype these days. It can be as simple as moving a few files, and maybe creating a new build config or two along the way, or it can be much more gruelling.\n\nAt Spotify, modularizing our Android codebase has meant clearing out years and years of tech debt, re-writing APIs, rethinking the architecture and structure of the application and features that goes into it, wrestling with build tools, and then some.\n\nThis talk will walk you through the Spotify modularization journey: why we got started, how we went about it, what we've learned through the process, and also why you should be thinking about modularizing your code, if you haven't already started.\n\nElin Nilsson\nSpotify"
