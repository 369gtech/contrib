description: "SCFS: A Shared Cloud-backed File System\n\nAlysson Bessani, Ricardo Mendes, Tiago Oliveira, and Nuno Neves, Faculdade de Ciências and LaSIGE; Miguel Correia, INESC-ID and Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon; Marcelo Pasin, Université de Neuchâtel; Paulo Verissimo, Faculdade de Ciências and LaSIGE\n\nDespite of their rising popularity, current cloud storage services and cloud-backed storage systems still have some limitations related to reliability, durability assurances and inefficient file sharing. We present SCFS, a cloud-backed file system that addresses these issues and provides strong consistency and near-POSIX semantics on top of eventually-consistent cloud storage services. SCFS provides a pluggable backplane that allows it to work with various storage clouds or a cloud-of-clouds (for added dependability). It also exploits some design opportunities inherent in the current cloud services through a set of novel ideas for cloud-backed file systems: always write and avoid reading, modular coordination, private name spaces and consistency anchors.\n\nView the full USENIX ATC '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc14/technical-sessions"
