recordingDate: 1355792691
description: "http://amzn.to/O6w3Io\nFT has named Bill Janeway's new book \"Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy\" one of 5 \"economics books of the year\": http://on.ft.com/UhAP7w\n\nFrom Tim O'Reilly: My friend and mentor Bill Janeway has just published a fascinating book entitled Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy. Marc Andreesen described the book as \"essential to anyone who wants to understand technology and how its creation will be financed for decades to come.\"\nTo celebrate the publication of his book, I'm holding a book party.  There will be lunch and networking, followed by a brief talk from Bill, followed by a Q&A with me.  The first fifty people to RSVP will receive a free copy of Bill's book.\n \nThis is a fascinating book, combining a history of Bill's career as a venture capitalist, deep insights into the role of government in financing innovation, and a provocative view of the difference between \"the market\" of companies providing real goods and services and financial capital markets.\n \nWhen Bill led a session at our Science Foo Camp this past summer, one participant said \"I could have listened to him all day.\"  I guarantee that you'll be fascinated and will come away with new insights that will help you be a better entrepreneur or investor."
