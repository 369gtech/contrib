description: "InVision started as a small startup several years ago with tens of engineers, small teams working independently as velocity was paramount. But as InVision grew to hundreds of engineers, all fully remote, we realized that this independence was actually slowing us down - teams resolving the same problems, inconsistent metrics, etc.\n\nWe created the architecture group which was aimed at being a guiding committee for the engineering org to help set standards and best practices, be forward looking for the company, and identifying architecture inefficiencies that spans multiple squads/zones/product areas and drive improvements to it. To simply state it, our mission was to drive architecture alignment across a fully distributed workforce.\n\nThis talk will cover the various aspects of setting up the architecture group - from the membership model, and how to measure the success of such a group and prevent it from becoming an ivory tower. It will cover some of the strategies employed by the architecture group like working groups, architecture reviews and architecture projects and also the engagement model with the rest of the company.\n\nThis talk will provide details of the group's workings, challenges faced and concrete takeaways so it can help you think about how to address growing pains in your engineering organization.\n\nAbout Iccha Sethi\nIccha has been in the tech industry for several years and has worked on several challenges ranging from large scale open source projects to microservices and event driven architecture. While working on a team, she is always looking for ways to be a better team and grow as a team. In her free time, which is increasingly less as a new mom, she enjoys reading science fiction/fantasy and cooking new recipes.\n\nAbout Jony Jeyaratnam\nGraduated from University of Waterloo with Software Engineering degree and spend almost 10years at Amazon both as an engineer and manager in 3 different countries (US, Canada and UK) working and building teams in fulfilment logistics and advertising. Lately running multiple engineering teams at InVision on a mission to build the Operating System of Digital Design. Aside from work, I am an avid traveller having visiting over 40 countries foodie and enjoy being out in the nature. Also a proud father of a 9 month old rugrat."
