description: "am, in a nutshell, a big geek, who takes great pride and joy in making other geeks into bigger and better (and hopefully more highly rewarded) geeks. Recently, I have stepped into the management role, looking for ways to leverage my skills as a \"force multiplier\" across the entire team, so as to better the team (and the organization) as a whole.\n\nI have spent the last fifteen years diving into the technology industry, starting from my first forays into C++ with the help of Bjarne Stroustrup's \"The C++ Programming Language\", into Windows (both 16- and 32-bit), then Java, .NET, and now pretty much anything that seems interesting, including languages (both programming and domain-specific), virtual machines (most notably the JVM and CLR, but also the various Smalltalk VMs like Strongtalk or Squeak, and Parrot), large-scale enterprise systems, and agile development practices. I have worked on projects that were intended for public-facing customer bases in the millions, and on projects that ran headlessly on server machines in the basement.\n\nI currently consult to a variety of companies, including Microsoft, IBM and Sun, I teach .NET through Pluralsight and other topics independently, and I spend my time researching new technologies and applying them to customers' problems. I can be found at a variety of conferences, including the No Fluff Just Stuff Software Symposia (http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com), via my blog at http://blogs.tedneward.com, or as the interviewer for the \"On Software\" series of videocasts released by Pearson on iTunes. Or, do what we all do anyway, and just Google my name--you'll find me."
