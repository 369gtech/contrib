description: "More and more projects switch from Maven to Gradle. Facing deadlines and little time to investigate, many follow this trend without understanding what exactly is going on inside Gradle's internals.\n\nI'll try to shed some light on this matter - aiming for not another tutorial like presentation but rather focus on the Gradle itself. Show - that proper tool understanding can help to avoid many mistakes and that there are almost no limits in Gradle universe."
