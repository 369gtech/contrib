description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\n\nDuring CppCon 2019 Mateusz provided an overview of current solutions on the market as well as challenges of implementing a modern C++ physical units library. This year's talk will focus on 'mp-units', the library that was developed by Mateusz and contributors, and which is proposed for C++ standardization. During the tutorial, we will get familiar with the building blocks of the library's framework and its most important concepts. Numerous code examples will present how to use and solve real-life problems with the library. The audience will learn how easy it is to extend it with new units, dimensions, or even whole new systems of quantities. Last but not least Mateusz will provide a fair comparison of how well this library performs in comparison to other products on the market.\n\n---\nA software architect, principal engineer, and security champion with more than 15 years of experience in designing, writing, and maintaining C++ code for fun and living. A trainer with 10 years of C++ teaching experience, consultant, conference speaker, and evangelist. His main areas of interest and expertise are Modern C++, code performance, low latency, safety, and maintainability.\n\nMateusz worked at Intel for 13 years, and now he is a Principal Software Engineer and the head of the C++ Competency Center at EPAM Systems. He is also a founder of Train IT that provides dedicated C++ trainings and consultant services to corporations around the world.\n\nMateusz is a contributor and an active voting member of the ISO C++ Committee (WG21) where, together with the best C++ experts in the world, he shapes the future of the C++ language. He is also a co-chair of WG21 Study Group 14 (SG14) responsible for driving performance and low latency subjects in the Committee. Recently also joined MISRA to help make self-driving cars safer.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
