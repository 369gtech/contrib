description: "Learn this new JavaScript framework that has the goodness of both ReactJS and Vue.js\n\nSvelte compiles your code to tiny, framework-less vanilla JS so that your app starts fast and stays fast. No more complex state management libraries, Svelte brings reactivity to JavaScript itself.\nDevelopers learn how to write UIs and basic CRUD in Svelte, and will see that the approach of Svelte is different compared to React and VueJS. Svelte is a compiler and does not use virtual DOM.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
