description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nPRETTY STATE MACHINE\nby Jeff Smith\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\ngen_statem\nOTP\nState\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this talk, I hope to pull back the curtain on `gen_statem` and provide a useful reference for how and when to use it and why the apparent complexity might be worth it.  What are its strengths and weaknesses?  Is there anything `gen_statem` can do that `GenServer` canâ€™t?  In this talk, I plan to explore these questions while providing some guidance and clarity on this mysterious behaviour available since the release of OTP 19.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/jeff-smith/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JEFF SMITH\nConcurrency junky and BEAM scientist\n\nJeff is a concurrency and hardware junky from OKC. He arrived at the gates of Erlang as a refugee after spending many years in denial of the realities of concurrency in OOP languages. He began experimenting with Erlang in 2010 and started writing Elixir professionally in 2013. He enjoys collecting STEM-related hobbies and travelling with his wife Laura.\n\nMore on Jeff Smith: https://codesync.global/speaker/jeff-smith/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
