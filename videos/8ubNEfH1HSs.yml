description: ".NET Summit 2020 Online Edition https://dotnetsummit.by - the 4th community driven .NET conference dedicated to practical experience of solving business challenges with .NET and technical challenges in .NET application.\n\nAlexandr Kugushev, GameDev as a hobby [RU]\n\nMany developers began to study programming for the sake of creating games. Only life makes its own adjustments and it is already difficult to exchange a stable schedule with Enterprise salary for the romance of the extreme in gamedev. \nAnd there is not so much free time to have enough to develop at least a small game. And these evenings, after all, could have been spent on studying another framework and getting a decent increase in salary. \nTime passes, and the light of a dream smolders ever weaker in the heart. And in this talk, we will try to rekindle it again! Let's consider how to engage in gamedev with pleasure and benefit, how not to be disappointed. And, of course, we'll touch on the technical aspects of the Unity development process. \n\nGeneral Partner - ISsoft - https://issoft.by"
