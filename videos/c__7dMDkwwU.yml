description: "There is a question you have answered several times a day,at least since your teens.\n\nIt’s the question you hear from everyone you meet, from all of nature.\n\nIt’s the question you ask yourself when you look in the mirror, or look down from a tall building.\n\nIt’s the question you’ll ask yourself in the moment before you die.\n\nYour answer to this single question, so common you’ve probably never even noticed it, shapes everything about you, and determines your success.\n\nIt is the most important minute of your life, and it is the doorway to your future.\n\nBefore he was known as the Mayor of Appsterdam, legendary product engineer and world’s toughest programmer Mike Lee (@bmf) worked on apps for Alaska Airlines, Delicious Monster, Tapulous, United Lemur, Apple, and Nextive, producing such hits as Delicious Library, Tap Tap Revenge, Obama ‘08, and Apple’s Mobile Store. After he established Amsterdam as the world capital of app development, Mike moved on to start the New Lemurs, an Appsterdam startup building educational games, with the coolest URL of all time: http://le.mu.rs. (Followed closely by the URL for his blog, http://mur.mu.rs) Mike’s love of lemurs is well known. He has the world’s largest collection of plush prosimians, and once bought over 100 plush lemurs in a $12,000 fundraiser for the Madagascar Fauna Group. His life’s goal is to save Madagascar. When he’s not working to change the world, he spends quiet time at home in the 17th century canal house in Amsterdam where he lives with his partner Judy and their cats, Wiebel and Wobbel. Mike enjoys racing cars, flying airplanes, and playing guitar, but he’s also content sitting beside the canal, sharing a single-cask whisky with friends. Software Passion: Looking at the world around me, finding experiences that can be improved, and improving them. Making the world a little better for everyone.
