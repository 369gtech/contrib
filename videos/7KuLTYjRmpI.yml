description: "Monolith to Microservices - Challenges and Lessons\n\nA microservices based architecture, while making many things better, brings its own set of challenges. In this talk, I will focus on the challenges we have faced and lessons learned at Expedia on 4 key topics. They are Scaling & Performance, Stability & Reliability, Monitoring & Performance, and Organisation.\nIn this talk, I discuss challenges faced at Expedia and lessons that we have learned through the process. The main themes covered are around org structure and design, stability & reliability, monitoring & observability, scaling & performance of microservices. I will help answer questions like\nWhat should you think about, with respect to the org design before you break a piece of functionality from the monolith into its own service?\nWhy is a deployment pipeline a must have for any and every service?\nWhat tasks should be automated?\nIs there such a thing as too much automation?\nWhat types of testing are needed in a microservices architecture?\nWhat about monitoring and scaling? Why is this harder with a microservices architecture when compared with a monolithic architecture?\nI recently presented this talk at YOW! Nights in Sydney and Brisbane.\n\nChaitanya is a technology leader with a passion for empowering teams to build customer-centric products. He has built and scaled teams with microservices as the basis, to bring increased resilience and enhanced scalability to the platform and the team. This has enabled deep domain ownership, reduced time to market, and above all, teams with a strong culture of autonomy, mastery and purpose.\n\nChaitanya has worked across several problem domains and in various roles at successful startups like BigCommerce and Hey You. At Hey You, he built the engineering team that helped launch the new brand and scaled the platform. He pioneered a planning process across all functions of the business that provided great agility and unification of purpose. Engineering @ Expedia is all about scale and here he is on the journey from Monolith to microservices as Director of Engineering with the Flights Team.\n\nFor more on YOW!
