title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2011: Daniel Truemper - Advanced routing patterns in  ZeroMQ'
recordingDate: 1545060761
description: "This talk will dig into the messaging patterns of ZeroMQ, a \"socket\nlibrary, that acts as concurrency framework\". We will start by using ZeroMQ messages for creating a Least Recently used router. Using a ZeroMQ device we will then create a N-M router that serves as proxy between many masters and many slaves. Finally the Mongrel2 messaging architecture will show how to emulate an asynchronous request/response pattern.\n\nhttp://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/advanced-routing-patterns-zeromq\n\nDescription of Daniel Truemper:\nhttp://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/daniel-tr√ºmper"
