Few-shot generative learning is something i'm particularly interested in, and in this video I'll go over what their progress has looked like in this field over the past 2 years. We'll go over a web demo of audio generation, try and understand how DeepMind's WaveNet (similar) works, and then look at some Tensorflow code to get a deeper understanding of how this model plays out programmatically. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Neural_Network_Voices\n\nPlease Subscribe!
