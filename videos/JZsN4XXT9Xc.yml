description: "Presented by Scott Motte at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday March 28th 2014 - Scott Motte of SendGrid talks on deprecating the password. Learn about an alternative authentication system - called handshake.js - that is passwordless and uses email only. Make users lives easier and more secure not having to remember a password. See a live demo of it in action and how easy it is to add to your next app using only JavaScript.\n\n* twitter.com/scottmotte\n* github.com/scottmotte"
