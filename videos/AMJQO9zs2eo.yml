language: English
recordingDate: 1538632083
description: "Spring has been the leader as a microservices framework for Java with Spring Boot, Spring and Spring Cloud. Istio has emerged as a polyglot alternative to Spring Cloud as an open platform to connect, manage and secure microservices. Let's explore how Istio compares to Spring Cloud and what each platform provides in addition to the other. We will also explore the use cases that are best suited to use Spring Cloud or Istio, or perhaps a combination of both.\n\nSpeakers:\nShubha Anjur Tupil\nProduct Manager, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018\nSpencer Gibb\nCofounder and Co-lead, Spring Cloud, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
