title: 'Building Tokenization Solutions for the Enterprise with Low-Code Tools on OCI'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639506775
description: "Validating the integrity of transactions and shipments across supply chains in manufacturing ecosystems with blockchain technologies does not meet industry expectations. Tokenization is a key requirement in certified manufacturing of products, which remains unexplored with Hyperledger. Hyperledger member, Oracle, developed an approach, implementing fungible and non-fungible tokens on Fabric based on IWA’s Token Taxonomy Framework (TTF) model of token types and behaviors.\n\nIn this webinar, Oracle demos Fungible Token (FT) chaincode development with Oracle Blockchain App Builder. You will learn how App Builder accelerates the use of FTs and NFTs in a broad range of use cases including product manufacturing. We’ll also discuss our plans to make use of tokens easy and quick on Hyperledger Fabric.\n\n#Blockchain #NFTs"
