description: "RubyConfBY 2019 - https://rubyconference.by\n\nVideo Partner â€“ iTechArt  https://www.itechart.by \n\nAbout the talk: \nRuby is optimised for happiness, we tell ourselves when we write beautiful code. We've written our acceptance and unit tests. What else is there to do? Nah, we don't need to worry about performance. \n\nSometimes, though, things turn sour when your beautiful code meets reality and the data processing consumes all of the server's resources. There are no magic bullets that can instantly detect performance and scaling issues in our code, but there are techniques that can help. \n\nIn this talk, you'll learn all about the benefits of writing performance assertions in a test suite. You'll see how a seemingly reasonable algorithm in fact exhibits abysmal performance and doesn't scale. We'll explore two different types of performance assertions that can be used to establish the performance characteristics of our example. Once we've done that, from then on, only hard cold measurements will guide us in refactoring the code to be more performant. \n\nYou will leave equipped with the techniques to help you learn how fast your code really is. Let's put a stop to slow code and remove all of those pesky performance bugs!"
