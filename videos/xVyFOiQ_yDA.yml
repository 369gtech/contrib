description: "We hear from Simon Brown at SC London 2019. The inspiration for his talk, \"The Lost Art of Software Design,\" was a culmination of everything that's happened to him over the last ten years.  He's been working with organisations globally and teaching them about software design. Although what he's been teaching over the past ten years hasn't changed all that much Simon points out some of the chaotic effects happening in organisations due to implementing extremely agile practices. \n\nFor more information on SC London or to find out how you can participate, please visit https://sc-london.com/.\n\nRelated Content:\nThe Lost Art of Software Design https://youtu.be/qO73yObPYac"
