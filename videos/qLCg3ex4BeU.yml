description: "What makes a race GREAT?\n\nWe're sure you know the feeling, sometimes a race is so exciting that you can't look away for one second, while other times the result is clear from the beginning.\n\nWhat is that \"magic\" factor that makes a race exciting? Is it the amount of overtaking? Is it the battle for the number 1 position? Is it the weather conditions? Or are we missing some invisible factor that we can't quite understand yet?\n\nThe answer to the question lies hidden away in data. 70 Years of racing data to be precise!\n\nIn this 2 hour workshop, you will have the opportunity to experiment with data using a combination of techniques to look for the answer.\n\nYou will extract key pieces of information that define the essence of each race and visualize races and seasons using advanced techniques to determine how interesting each race is.\n\nYou will learn the basics of ANALYTICS and MACHINE LEARNING and become familiar with the entire process, from data preparation and visualization, to model building, prediction and evaluation. You'll experience first-hand what challenges data scientists!\n\nSo come join us in this fun workshop and solve the challenge!\n\nLive Lab: https://bit.ly/livelab-RedBull2"
