description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nOctober 30, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Rob Pike\r\n\r\nWhat is Go?\r\n\r\nGo is a new experimental systems programming language intended to make software development fast.  Our goal is that a major Google binary should be buildable in a few seconds on a single machine. The language is concurrent, garbage-collected, and requires explicit declaration of dependencies. Simple syntax and a clean type system support a number of programming styles.\r\n\r\nFor more on Go including FAQs, source code, libraries, and tutorials, please see:\r\nhttp://golang.org"
