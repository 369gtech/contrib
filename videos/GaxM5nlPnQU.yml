Maybe you regularly go for a run or visit a gym? Practice yoga? Play squash? The thing is, it does not matter as much as you might think it does. Even if you exercise in leisure time on a regular basis, you spend most of your workday on your buttocks and that, as it turns out, is very unhealthy.\n\nThere is now 3 decades worth of research linking sedentary lifestyle to myriad health problems. What is even worse, you can not completely mitigate the risks by just exercising because prolonged sitting still wreaks havoc in your body. The solution to this problem is quite simple and yet very difficult to implement due to a combination of factors like our cultural upbringing, psychosocial barriers as well as all the technological advancements of the last century.\n\nIn this talk I will show you the first step to getting out of your chair, but you are the one that has to take it.\n\nMarek St√≥j \nFrom ImmSoft\nMarek is an experienced software developer. During his professional career spanning more than 10 years, he worked with technologies like .NET, C#, Android, Java, Big Data or Scala. Marek is simply a computer geek, specifically fascinated by the ever-growing influence of theoretical foundations of computer science on the IT industry.\n\nToday it is not his career that is important though, because Marek also realized recently, that a passion can easily turn into an obsession which blinds us from the truth - that there is more to life than coding. And this idea, he believes, is worth spreading among fellow IT geeks."
