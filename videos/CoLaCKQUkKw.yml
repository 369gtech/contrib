OpenTelemetry provides libraries and agents that capture metrics and distributed traces from your applications and send them to backends like Prometheus, Zipkin, and Jaeger. The project is backed by a large community of end-user developers and the majority of cloud and APM vendors. We’re always interested in welcoming more people to the project! In this session we will cover: - What’s included in the v1 release, the project’s overall status and production readiness - Community structure, including governance, SIGs, and how to get involved - Recent integrations with various frameworks, clients, and Kubernetes itself! - Related projects like W3C TraceContext - What we’re working on next, including more languages, more integrations, and logs \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uake"
