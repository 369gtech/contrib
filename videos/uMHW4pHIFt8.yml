recordingDate: 1536932533
description: 'Most user interfaces in mobile applications are visually attractive. And itâ€™s always a huge pleasure for developers to work together with talented designers. However an excellent UI requires even more - the art of telling a story. My presentation is about enhancing the UI and UX by taking advantage of animation capabilities in React Native. During the talk, you will learn in practice when and how animations should be used and how to create an alluring story for the application.'
