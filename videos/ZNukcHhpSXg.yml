description: "SVG is a strong part of the future of the web-based imagery. Because it is written in math not rigid pixels, it reduces our large Front-End testing matrix and allows for interesting solutions to common web problems. \n\nWhen we animate SVG, we can guide our viewers with informative UX patterns, as well as create engaging and interactive experiences. The GreenSock Animation API is a highly performant, feature-rich library with which we can create performant, complex, and responsive animations. \n\nIn this session, we will cover: \n\n-Responsive Animations\n-Motion Along a Path \n-SVG Attribute Morphing \n-Advanced API Features\n\nhttp://forwardjs.com/\nhttps://newcircle.com/"
