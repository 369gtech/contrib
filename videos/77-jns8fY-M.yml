title: 'Using DevOps to Build Your Learning Organization - Columbia Sportswear'
recordingDate: 1510689731
description: "Using DevOps to Build Your Learning Organization\n\nScott Nasello, Sr. Manager, Platforms & Systems Engineering, Columbia Sportswear\n\nDevOps transformations are typically more successful when the organization has a learning culture, psychological safety, and a track record of transformation.\n\nThis talk will focus on how Columbia Sportswear built a learning culture during their transformation journey. 2+ years ago Columbia Infrastructure Engineering had zero artifacts in version control and had very limited automation. \n\nFast forward to 2017 and we have 200+ ChatOps scripts, 1500+ servers managed within our CHEF environment, and are pivoting to a Cloud First orientation.\n\nThe target audience would be change agents at mid-size enterprises that are ready to start their DevOps journey but choose not to start with an executive initiated effort.\n\nAlthough this experience report comes from a Microsoft-centric enterprise, many of the tactics, tools, and processes are inspired from the open source tradition.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
