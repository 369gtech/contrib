title: 'Mamas Don''t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Rock Star Developers'
recordingDate: 1484706534
description: "Rikki Endsley\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/181/\nAre you sick of seeing job listings calling for \"rock star developers\"? What does that even mean? Developers who get the glory, while the band, agent, road crew, and sound engineers do the work? Instead of being a one-hit wonder who crashes and burns by 27, look to Willie Nelson for inspiration. Willie's 60+ years in the music business offer plenty of lessons developers can apply to their own careers. Attend this fun talk to see how collaborating with a diverse mix of peo ple, learning new skills, choosing the best tool for the job (and then improving on it), contributing to a range of communities, and not being afraid to fail have benefited Willie's career. The talk will be fun, but the lessons are practical for developers--and people who work with them--of all experience levels."
