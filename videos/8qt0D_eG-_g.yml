title: 'Matthias Koch. Implementing and Debugging Custom MSBuild Tasks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619617803
description: "MSBuild is part of every .NET developer’s life in working with projects and solutions. It’s the system that ultimately invokes tools like the C# compiler or NuGet. Sometimes it makes sense to integrate additional tools into the MSBuild execution pipeline, also known as custom MSBuild tasks. However, implementing a custom task can be very daunting. Even advanced users are often running into issues when packaging, wiring or debugging their task in the full MSBuild infrastructure. In this session, we’ll walk through my personal setup for implementing custom tasks and look at a few tricks and tools that can greatly simplify our efforts.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/48Uwf-oLUvfMvQ\n\nDotFest: https://2020.dotfest.ru/lecture/8"
