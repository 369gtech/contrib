Simply replicating those patterns when splitting up a system into a distributed one usually introduces a lot of complexity and drawbacks that often totally subvert the desired effects of a split up of the system in the first place.\n\nThe talk takes a look at a concrete sample of monolithic module interactions and identifies the problems that arise if that approach is transferred as-is into a distributed system. We then discuss an alternative variant of the monolithic implementation and how that approach improves the system's modularity for the monolith and how it minimizes the cost and problems when splitting up the monolith or even starting with a system of systems in the first place.\n\nOliver Gierke \nFrom Pivotal Software, Inc.\nOliver Gierke is the lead of the Spring Data project at Pivotal, Java Champion and member of the JPA 2.1 expert group. He has been into developing enterprise applications and open source projects for over 12 years now. His working focus is centered around software architecture, DDD, REST, and persistence technologies. He is regularly speaking at German and international conferences and the author of technology articles as well as the first book on Spring Data."
