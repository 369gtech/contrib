title: '#ChefConf 2014: Seth Vargo, "Spice Up Your Recipes With Chef Sugar"--SFW'
recordingDate: 1400781918
description: "Chef Sugar is an extension of the Chef Client that provides helpful DSL-methods and encapsulates logic that makes recipe-writing a truly delightful experience! Don't believe me, here's what Doug Ireton had to say:\n\nChef Sugar? More like crème brûlée. Beautiful Ruby code and exceedingly useful!\n\nQuickly transform those ugly nested case statements into beautifully crafted Ruby code. Demystify common tasks like checking if a tool is installed at a particular version or calculating the best IP address for a cloud-based instance. Avoid Ruby hashes and use a pure DSL in your attribute definitions. It's all possible with Chef Sugar.\n\nNot only will you get to see all of the amazing functionality Chef Sugar has to offer, but I'll also demonstrate how Chef Sugar works. Join me on an adventure as we graze the foundations of Chef's internals, put usage before implementation, and learn some magical Ruby tricks along the way."
