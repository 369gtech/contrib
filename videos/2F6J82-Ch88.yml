recordingDate: 1486917731
description: 'When you work in a small collocated team many engineering practices and approaches are relatively easy to use and adapt. In large project with many teams working on the same product this task is not so simple. I want to share experience report in implementing Code Review practice in big product development team (more than 150 people, 10+ feature teams). In this talk we will review what approaches works in such setup and what don’t work, what tools and additional practices are needed to support Code Review and make it more effective, what difficulties and blockers will you probably see in the real life cases, what useful metrics could be produced by this practice.'
