title: '#FOSSBack: Amanda Casari & Julia Ferraioli Preventing Random Acts of Metrics'
recordingDate: 1614615065
description: "We know that open source is greater than the source code, that people of all skills contribute to the larger ecosystem that is open source software and the communities we grow to invest in people. How do we see this world, quantitatively and qualitatively? Which metrics should we be using and which should we definitely not rely on? We'll review what we have learned in Google's Open Source Programs Office about open source data, metrics, and tracking change in open source ecosystems.\n\n\n###########\n\nFollow us on Social Media and join the Community!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fossbckstg\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8653059/​\n\nFOSS Backstage is an event by Plain Schwarz – https://plainschwarz.com"
