description: "The PyData UK meetup series is a collaboration between several PyData chapters in the UK.\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS and thus abides by the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct https://pydata.org/code-of-conduct.html. Please take a moment to familiarise yourself with its contents.\n\nThis meetup is hosted by PyData Cambridge.\n\n00:00:00 Intro\n0:16:35 Ryan Callihan\n0:33:35 Matt Wright\n0:54:44 Nikoleta E. Glynatsi\n1:21:25 Nick Radcliffe\n1:37:07 Luciano Resende \n2:04:36 Q&A\n\nRyan Callihan - Why does my NLP model (which got 96.72% accuracy during validation) suck in production?\n\nNothing is more frustrating than creating a nice, tidy model for some NLP purpose to only have it fail or go horribly wrong during production. NLP is a weird branch of data science because dealing with natural language is a wibbly wobbly thing. We will be going over a few pitfalls one may experience when working with NLP and how they will effect your pipeline downstream.\n\nRyan is the Lead Data Scientist and Computational Linguist at Relative Insight and Organiser of PyData Lancaster.\n\nMatt Wright - When Product Management meets Machine Learning.\n\nA practical walk through of a recent NLP project which combines techniques from product management, user interface design and machine learning to build a product that predicts EUIPO case decisions and explains the results.\n\nThe talk will cover how to set up time boxed experiments to build machine learning models, what design principles you can use to explain model output and when not to use machine learning! It also contains a live demo and a Q&A session.\n\nBio: Matt Wright is a CTO, founder of an NLP Startup (Stitched.io), former Techstars mentor, board member of NLP business ProWritingAid and builds product focussed technology teams for startups and scaleups.\n\nNikoleta E. Glynatsi - A bibliometric study of a research field\n\nData mining techniques can be used to collect articles’ metadata. I have written a library called Arcas that allows a user to collect data from five different prominent sources. This talk briefly covers an overview of the data collection, and mainly focuses on the insights that can be gained on a scientific field from analysing such data. More specifically I will demonstrate how natural language processing can be used to identify the topic structure of a subject area, and how data analysis techniques can be used to understand the behaviour of authors in game theoretic fields.\n\nNick Radcliffe - gentest: Automatic Test Generation for Arbitrary (1) Programs with TDDA\n\nReasonable people think automated testing is useful. Despite this, most of us succumb to the temptation to omit or skimp on testing at least some of the time. Could useful, elegant, extensible tests be generated automatically? gentest is embryonic functionality in the Python tdda library (available from PyPI [pip] and from Github) that can be used to generate tests automatically for arbitrary command-line programs or scripts — Python programs, shell scripts, C, Node, Swift, Java — gentest doesn’t care. The tests will be in Python, but the code can be anything. This talk will motivate and introduce gentest and show it in action.\n\nLuciano Resende - Introducing Elyra - Extending JupyterLab for AI\n\nIn this session, Luciano will be walking you through a real use case pipeline that uses Elyra features to help analyze COVID-19 related datasets. He will introduce Elyra, a project built to extend JupyterLab with AI-centric capabilities. He'll showcase the extensions that allow you to build Notebook Pipelines and execute these in a Kubeflow environment, execute notebooks as batch jobs, the ability to create, edit and execute Python scripts directly from JupyterLab,\n\nLuciano Resende is an STSM and Open Source Data Science/AI Platform Architect at IBM CODAIT (formerly Spark Technology Center). He has been contributing to open source at The ASF for over 10 years, he is a member of ASF and is currently contributing to various big data related Apache projects around the Apache Spark ecosystem. Currently, Luciano is contributing to Jupyter Ecosystem projects building scalable, secure and flexible Enterprise Data Science platforms.\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
