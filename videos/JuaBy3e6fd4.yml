recordingDate: 1368928574
description: "Amy Unruh, Kim Cameron \n\nHighly scalable and rapid data collection and analysis is a key need for many mobile and gaming apps, as well as for sensor networks and the \"\"Internet of Things.\"\"  We'll show how the Data Sensing Lab incorporates a key Google Cloud Platform pattern: a high-throughput pipeline for data collection, processing, and analysis. We use the Cloud Endpoints API to collect constantly streaming data; process large amounts of data with high throughput using App Engine, Cloud Storage, and data transformation on Compute Engine; and query many GBs of collected data in just a few seconds using BigQuery.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
