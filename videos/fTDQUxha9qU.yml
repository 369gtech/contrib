language: English
recordingDate: 1628827893
description: "Let's face it, in most companies, the amount of good data available to perform machine learning is very small. Most data are small data. So how can we do good machine learning on small data?\n\nXuanyi is Just Another Human Bean. He is the primary author of Gorgonia, a suite of libraries for doing deep learning library in the Go programming language (which he's proud to note, predated the public release version of TensorFlow).\nBy day he works as the chief data scientist of a local startup. By night he chases the weirder ideas that he believes will help him create SkyNet. That leaves him somewhat a Jack of All Trades and Master of None. \n\nFor more information on YOW!
