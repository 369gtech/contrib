language: English
recordingDate: 1491377395
description: "Webpack is perceived as a complicated tool, because it is really advanced. Its configuration file is the cause of much confusion and possibly frustration. In this talk Norbert will improve your understanding of what Webpack does, and how it does it. He will talk about the philosophy, concepts, dependencies, resolvers, loaders, modules, compilation, plugins, code-splitting and how to upgrade to Webpack 2.\n\nNorbert is a full-stack JavaScript developer working on modernizing existing codebases and greenfield projects. He uses tools like React, Webpack, CSS-in-JS and Redux to improve the user and developer experience.\n\nLink to the meetup event https://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/events/238135437/"
