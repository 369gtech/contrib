The general explanation for them is usually along the lines of \"\"\"\"they're like interfaces for OOP\"\"\"\". While that's somewhat accurate, it's also misleading and introduces a lot of confusion on how and when to use the existing behaviours and when it's reasonable to define your own ones. \n\nIn this talk, Brujo will explain what behaviours are, how they should be used, and how to create and expose new ones if you ever need to.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/brujo-benavides/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BRUJO BENAVIDES\nErlang Battleground author, software engineer at AdRoll, SpawnFest organiser\n\nErlang Developer, Blogger & Trainer.\n\nWorking at AdRoll through BairesDev.\n\nCommunity manager and organizer of SpawnFest, BeamBA, and SAtG.\n\nMore on Brujo Benavides: https://codesync.global/speaker/brujo-benavides/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
