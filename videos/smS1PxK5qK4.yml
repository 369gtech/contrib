title: 'Zachary Zlotnik - The Mental Impact of Tech Interviews (Abstractions II Raw Cuts)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1575916176
description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\n\nLengthy technical interview processes frustrate tech workers and can impact one’s mental health. From high-pressure whiteboard coding that feels more like a Broadway audition, to reciting encyclopedic knowledge found in computer science textbooks, it is no secret that technical interviews are broken. While these practices are well-known and have significant debate surrounding their accuracy and efficacy, the hidden and deleterious effects they have on tech workers have gone unrecognized.\n\nUnnecessarily difficult technical interviews can create imposter syndrome which can cause new mental health issues, exacerbate existing ones. Long-term, this can affect productivity, morale, retention and drive people to abandon their tech careers or even halt tech careers before they’ve begun. With sites like OSMI Forums, Burnout.io and many others, tech workers are increasingly speaking out about mental health issues. While companies seek to uncover the source of these issues, they often ignore a very basic component; the technical interview.\n\nAs evidenced by the existence of They Whiteboarded Me (they.whiteboarded.me) and Hiring Without Whiteboards (github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards) there is substantial frustration around these interviewing techniques. This talk aims to unpack and discuss the intersection between mental health, job hunting and technical interviews. Interviewers and hiring managers will learn how their actions affect candidates before, during and after an interview. In addition, candidates will be empowered to say no and learn how to drive change from within. Together, lets refactor tech hiring!\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#The%20Mental%20Impact%20of%20Tech%20Interviews-Zachary%20Zlotnik"
