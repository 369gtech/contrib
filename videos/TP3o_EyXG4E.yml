Atmo is enabling developers to build their applications with the popular patterns of serverless computing, while harnessing the power and security of WebAssembly. Connor will show how WebAssembly makes it easier to deploy an application to the cloud by demonstrating Atmo's unique development patterns, easy to use APIs, and straightforward deployments. Connor will also be providing extensive example code and a deep dive into what makes WebAssembly the next iteration of cloud software development."
