title: 'YOW! CTO 2019 - Simon Brown - Architecture Challenges Faced by Agile Organisations'
recordingDate: 1582488005
description: "Despite architecture not being a trendy discussion topic, I’ve run hundreds of software architecture workshops over the past decade, for startups through to multinationals, across a wide variety of vertical sectors. In this talk I’ll share my insights about the recurring challenges that organisations face. First and foremost are development teams skipping up front design and documentation in their desire to be agile? both of which can ultimately slow teams down. Then there are questions about whether architects and central architecture groups are still relevant, and how to give teams autonomy to change any line of code within the organisation without sacrificing architectural integrity.\n\nSimon is an independent consultant specialising in software architecture, and the author of “Software Architecture for Developers” - a developer-friendly guide to software architecture, technical leadership and the balance with agility. He is also the creator of the C4 model for visualising software architecture and the founder of Structurizr, a collection of tooling to help software teams visualise, document and explore their software architecture. Simon is a regular speaker at international software development conferences, and teaches software architecture to organisations worldwide.\n\nFor more on YOW!
