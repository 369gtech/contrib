description: 'MySQL Cluster is the project many talk about but few have in-depth knowledge of. It is a project that, contrary to general opinion, does not fit every bill and too much FUD is being spread about it by ppl using it wrong or for wrong purpose. Contrary to general purpose RDBMS like MySQL Server or PostgreSQL or Oracle DB or ... MySQL Cluster is a real time database server, distributed, highly available without SPOF; but with it''s greatness it brings some limits too. This session will cover some major differences between MySQL Cluster and general purpose RDBMS''s (namely MySQL Enterprise Server), the pro''s and con''s of MySQL Cluster with some real life examples where MySQL Cluster is properly and improperly used. MySQL Cluster do nicely work together with MySQL Server but MySQL Cluster is more similar to NoSQL storage systems then to RDBMS''s and is often used in that manner. To enable this there is more then one way to communicate with it. This session will cover most important interfaces to MySQL Cluster, their pro''s and con''s. Finally, MySQL Cluster is speed champion. There are few systems that can compare with it.. I''ll show you, during this session, how to breach that 200 million requests per second barrier.'
