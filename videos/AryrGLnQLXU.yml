description: "The Flink community has been working on unified SQL support for batch and streaming data for many years.\nIn the last two releases (Flink 1.8 and Flink 1.9) many features added and improved and a few things changed.\nThe most significant effort was certainly the donation and integration of Blink's query processor that became available for preview in Flink 1.9.\nThe new processor provides better SQL coverage (full TPC-H in Flink 1.9 and full TPC-DS planned for 1.10) and significant performance improvements for queries on batch data.\nMoreover, the community reworked the type system to be compliant with the SQL standard, added support for SQL DDL statements, and improved the interfaces to connect to external catalogs.\nIntegration with the Apache Hive ecosystem (also available as a preview in Flink 1.9) marks another significant step for Flink SQL.\nSome of these efforts are still ongoing and there are many more SQL-related work items on Flink's roadmap.\n\nFor this Ask-me-Anything session, many Flink committers who are working on Flink SQL will come together to answer all your questions around current and future SQL support in Flink."
