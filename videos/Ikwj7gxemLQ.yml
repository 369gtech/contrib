title: 'Transactional actors with Eclipse Vert.x by Mark Little & Michael Musgrove'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495024135
description: "Eclipse Vert.x is the leading JVM-based stack for developing asynchronous, event-driven applications. Traditional ACID transactions, especially distributed transactions, are typically difficult to use in such an environment due to their blocking nature. However, the transactional actor model, which pre-dates Java, has been successful in a number of areas over the years. In this presentation we will look at how we have been integrating this model using Narayana transactions, Software Transactional Memory and Vert.x. We will walk through an example and show how Vert.x developers can now utilise volatile, persistent and nested transactions in their applications, as well as what this might mean for enterprise deployments.\n\nMark Little leads the technical direction, research, and development for Red Hat JBoss Middleware. Prior to taking over this role in 2008, Mark served as the SOA technical development manager and director of standards. Additionally, Mark was a chief architect, and co-founder at Arjuna Technologies, a spin-off from HP, where he was Distinguished Engineer. He has worked in the area of reliable distributed systems since the mid-80s with a PhD in fault-tolerant distributed systems, replication, and transactions. Mark is also a professor at Newcastle University and Lyon University.\n\nMichael Musgrove is a developer with 20+ years experience building distributed systems using CORBA, JEE and OSI. He currently works in the transactions team at Red Hat, Inc implementing Java and C++ solutions for the middleware market.\n\nPrior to his role at Red Hat Michael was involved with a variety of technologies including software and hardware fault tolerance, management of distributed systems and systems management products for servers."
