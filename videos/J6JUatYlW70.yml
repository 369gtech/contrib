description: "Making Infrastructure More Friendly for Beginners\n\nShubheksha Jalan and Leslie Carr\n\nInfrastructure and related domains aren't very friendly to beginners and people early in their tech career. There is a lack of resources and information about how to transition to these domains or how to get a job with little to no prior experience. We were all once in that position and this conversation between Shubheksha and Leslie will share what Shubheksha has learned and what we can do as a community to make it better for those coming after us. We strongly believe that we should be leaving doors we're lucky enough to pass through wide open for those coming after us.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
