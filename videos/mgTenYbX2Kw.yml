language: English
recordingDate: 1516132804
description: "At Slack, we use one JavaScript codebase to build a multi-threaded desktop application, routinely interacting with native code. Managing large JavaScript codebases is challenging - we need a guarantee that the individual pieces fit together. In the desktop world, a small mistake is likely to result in a crash. To that end, we adopted TypeScript and quickly learned to stop worrying and love the compiler. See an introduction and a detailed account of porting a large code base, learn why exactly TypeScript is so popular, what the downsides are, and how you would slowly adopt it in your development.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeSummit 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nFelix Rieseberg\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNodeSummit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNodeSummit web-site: http://www.nodesummit.com/\n\n2018 NodeSummit event: http://www.nodesummit.com/registration/"
