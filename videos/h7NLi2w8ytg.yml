title: 'TypeScript for Java Developers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433259408
description: "Is your JavaScript growing out of control? Would you like to add some class to your client-side development? With TypeScript, you can. TypeScript is an optionally typed superset of JavaScript. It adds classes, interfaces, and other object-oriented constructs familiar to Java developers. In the end, it all compiles down to regular JavaScript for consumption by any JS runtime, be it a browser or, for example, Nashorn. This session introduces TypeScript from the perspective of Java developers who also write JavaScript on the client side. Using live coding, the presenters build up a single-page web application that talks to a Java back end. Youâ€™ll see that it's more modular, less error-prone, and more fun to code in TypeScript.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSander Mak\nSander crafts scalable software at Luminis Technologies.
