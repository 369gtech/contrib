description: "Unlike C and other low-level programming languages, Javascript takes away the pain of memory management and garbage collection from the programmer. However, this doesn't mean that developers shouldn't be aware of the memory management and garbage collection implementation details of the Javascript programming language. Indeed, knowledge of both of those things can go a long way towards improving the performance of code.\n\nThis talk will take beginners through an exploration of Javascript's garbage collector and memory allocation implementations and their implications on how performant code should be written. Attendees will leave this talk having gained insights into the under-the-hood operations of Javascript and how they can leverage them to produce performant code.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/safia-abdalla.html"
