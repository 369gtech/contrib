title: 'Observability: it''s not just an ops thing - Charity Majors'

description: "Instrumentation and monitoring often get lumped under the \"ops\" umbrella, but it's just as critical for every decent software engineer. You can't hope to understand what's going on in even a moderately complex system, unless you've been building for observability all along. Easy to say, harder to do.\n\nLet's talk about how this plays out in the real world -- how to focus your limited engineering time on high-impact instrumentation, where to start, how your needs may change as the project matures or the contributor list grows; how and where to use traces, events and metrics. We'll talk about some of the differences between monolith vs microservices, databases, and mobile/web instrumentation ... and how to avoid the kind of solution fragmentation that creates silos between teams."
