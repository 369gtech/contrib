title: 'Increasing Developer Productivity With a Draw Pad'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636740097
description: 'Communicating clearly is made especially hard in an age of remote forced work. I''ve personally noticed that the lack of a whiteboard was the main burden. I, therefore, invested in a modest drawing tablet and I was surprised at how many pain points it took away. In this session, I''d like to talk about all the little ways it has helped me during my day-to-day. Both as a Research Advocate at Rasa, but also as an open-source maintainer.'
