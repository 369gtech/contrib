description: "Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Online in mixed development environments.\nChris Pont\n(@chrispont)\n\nApplication and infrastructure are never as architecturally pure or simple as we would like. You can’t always rely on working in your language of choice. With this in mind we’re going to take a look at how TFS can help you with this whether you work with Java, .net or something else. \n\nWe’ll cover a number of topics including: \n\n• source control\n\n• build\n\n• testing\n\n• deployment\n\nThis talk will be aimed at developers though it shouldn’t matter what technology is being used.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/178508812/"
