description: "Hassan Chafi, Director, Research & Advanced Development, Oracle\n\nZeppelin, Jupyter, Databricks: notebooks are everywhere. This session presents the Oracle Labs Data Studio, a JVM-based notebook interface for data analysts built on Apache Zeppelin and Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (Oracle JET). It shows use cases that focus on graph visualization and how to visually apply graph algorithms with interpreters such as Apache Spark, databases, and the graph analytic framework PGX. Using notebooks, you can combine different languages such as Groovy, Scala, Python, and the new property graph query language PGQL together with powerful JavaScript-based visualization techniques. The interactive graph visualization supports highlighting, expansion, filter application, and much more. Everything is preconfigured and executable directly from the browser."
