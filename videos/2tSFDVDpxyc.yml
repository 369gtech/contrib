recordingDate: 1612093609
description: "Tejun Heo\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/102/\n\nThe idea behind resource control is to distribute resources between workloads so that machines can be shared among different tasks without them interfering with each other - be that service and management tasks on a server, or a web browser and a build job on a laptop. While developing and deploying resource control strategies at facebook to improve reliability and utilization, we've encountered many surprises and had to relearn what we thought we already knew.\r\n\r\nResource Control Demo (https://github.com/facebookexperimental/resctl-demo) is an interactive tool which documents various aspects of cgroup2 resource control using live resource contention scenarios. This presentation gives a tour of various cgroup2 resource control mechanisms and strategies using resctl-demo.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSat Jan 23 14:25:00 2021 at Tux Theatre"
