Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. NUKE is a build automation system with C# DSL. It allows to automate processes like compiling solutions, packing artifacts or deploying applications. In contrast to existing tools, NUKE integrates as a simple C# project and therefore provides all the IDE features we love, like debugging, auto-completion, navigation and refactorings. Due to the reduced complexity, there is less knowledge required to be able to manage a build, which helps with the overall acceptance in a team. By utilizing a revolutionary code-generation/metadata approach, NUKE also provides a clean and consistent API across all third-party command-line tools."
