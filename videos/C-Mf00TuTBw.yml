description: "Scaling Yourself for Managing Distributed Teams Delivering Reliable Services\n\nPaul Greig, Atlassian\n\nDistributed teams are an attractive proposition for your customers, your services, your team and you. They provide extended coverage hours, co-location with development teams, increased talent pools and a never-ending sense of fragility.\n\nI've been working and leading distributed teams in a variety of industries, most recently within SRE at Atlassian. Join me whilst I reflect on the collaboration techniques to keep distributed teams connected globally while delivering world-class distributed systems to millions of customers across the world. I'll share my insights and reflections on the successes and failures I've experienced throughout joining, leading & building SRE teams.\n\nFrom this talk I aim for a new or existing team lead of a distributed SRE team to hear my personal reflections and experience with tools and techniques to aid their teams and ultimately assist their services and customers to unleash their full potential.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
