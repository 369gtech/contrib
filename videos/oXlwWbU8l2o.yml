description: "Learn everything you need to know about OpenCV in this full course for beginners.\n\nWe'll start all the way from the very basics (reading images and video, image transformations, drawing on images) to the more advanced concepts (color spaces, edge detection, and thresholding). Towards the end, we'll be building a Deep Computer Vision model to detect between the characters in \"The Simpsons\". \n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Code ‚≠êÔ∏è\nüîóGithub link: https://github.com/jasmcaus/opencv-course\nüîóCaer: https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer\n\n‚úèÔ∏è Course from Jason Dsouza.
