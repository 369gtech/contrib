description: "I’ve spent the last 6 years writing a song and posting it on YouTube every single day. That’s 2300+ days straight. I’ve had lots of viral successes, like the time Steve Jobs used one of my videos to open a keynote. I’ve had lots low moments, too. Through it all, I’ve just kept writing and sharing, writing and sharing.\n\nViral success is great – but it’s the small one-to-one connections that are the most meaningful. These connections can’t be quantified because they are all unique. It’s the often overlooked story of being a creator on the internet.\n\nJonathan Mann\nSongwriter, Jonathanmann.net\nhttps://twitter.com/songadaymann\nhttps://instagram.com/jonathanmann/\nhttps://vimeo.com/jonathanmann\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Jonathanmann\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/therockcookiebottom\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
