description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nPod Security as an Afterthought - Alban Crequy, Kinvolk \n\nKubernetes has several security mechanisms that can be used to secure your applications: you can write security as code with network policies, PSP, seccomp, etc. Ideally, the specs of network policies and PSP should be written at the same time as your applications are developed. Oftentimes this is not the case and security remains an afterthought. It follows that the developers implementing the security might not have an enough good view of the architecture to know which network policies and other PSP to write.  This is not an ideal situation, of course. But as a developer who’s joining a project to implement the security, you don’t have a time machine to change that.  This talk will present some open source tools that can help: kube-psp-advisor, Inspektor Gadget, oci-seccomp-bpf-hook. The tools observe your deployments in different ways and help you to write the security specs. \n\nhttps://sched.co/aO3T"
