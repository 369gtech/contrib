description: "This session shows you how Slick, the Scala database library, can bring your data seamlessly into your Scala application and compile Scala collection operations to database code for execution on the database server. An overview of the API and a live coding demo (highlighting the latest features such as distributed queries, macro-based type providers, and the use of non-SQL data stores) provide an introduction for new users, and an overview of Slick’s architecture and the query compiler shows you what’s happening under the hood.\n\n\nAuthors:\nStefan Zeiger\nStefan Zeiger is the tech lead for Slick. He joined Typesafe in 2011 after developing ScalaQuery, the predecessor to Slick, in order to work on the new project full-time. He has been a user of Java and the JVM platform professionally since 1996, working on a diverse range of projects from web servers to GUI frameworks and programming language design, and moving on from Java to Scala since 2008. \nView more trainings by Stefan Zeiger at https://www.parleys.com/author/stefan-zeiger\n\nJan Christopher Vogt\nSoftware Engineer at x.ai.
