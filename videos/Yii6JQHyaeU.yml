title: '#HITBCyberWeek #CommSec D1 - Hacking The 0day Marketplace'
language: English
recordingDate: 1607849654
description: "The 0day vulnerability market developed over the years in a way that is unsafe, chaotic and rather inefficient. Today bad business practices, lack of professionalism and low levels of trust are still spread in this market and can seriously hamper the ability of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to acquire and maintain strategic cyber capabilities in order to fight organized crime, terrorism and hostile geopolitical actors.\n\n\n\nHaving a deep understanding of these issues and of their solutions, Crowdfense is “hacking the 0day market” in order to improve it for all the parties involved (researchers, brokers, integrators and end-users), by introducing new quality standards and best practices related to products, services and to the sustainability of the underlying business processes.\n\n\n=== \n\n\nAndrea Zapparoli Manzoni manages Crowdfense Limited, which he designed in 2017 with a multidisciplinary team of ethical hackers, lawyers and vulnerability researchers.\n\n\nThe company’s main goal is to develop and apply new standards and processes to the vulnerability trading industry, which has become too strategic and complex to be managed with the old “crafts of the trade” methods. After more than two decades working in, studying in and consulting in the industry, Manzoni realized that there had to be a smarter and safer way to buy and sell active cyber-defense capabilities and decided to launch the Crowdfense Vulnerability Research Hub.\n\n\nSince 2012, he has served as a board member of Clusit (Italian ICT Security Association). In 2011, he started an in-depth analysis of the most severe national and international cyber-attacks (researching and classifying more than 7,700 attacks over 84 months). This work is published in Clusit’s yearly “Report on ICT Security.” To his great surprise, over the last seven years, this research has become a reference for private and public organizations in Italy and abroad."
