description: "Martin Barry, Fastly\n\nOver the years the prevalence of distributed systems has grown, driven by everything from database replicas through load-balanced resource pools to geographically redundant services.\n\nCloud computing has also changed the way we think about, and implement, distributed systems. Whether the components are at the level of infrastructure (VMs), services (datastores) or even single bits of software (\"serverless\") we need to consider the benefits and tradeoffs our solution embodies.\n\nThe next step in this evolution is \"edge computing,\" where cloud services are offered as close to the client as is reasonable. This brings obvious benefits in reducing latency but also exacerbates most of the usual distributed systems problems to extreme levels.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
