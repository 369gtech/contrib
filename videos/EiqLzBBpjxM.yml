description: "At Cucumber, we want to encourage more people to contribute to open source.\n\n\nWe run this ensemble as a way to mentor people who are new to open source to make their first pull request. Watch to get some tips yourself. If you'd like to join a future session, come to the #new-contributors channel in our Community Slack (https://cucumber.io/community#slack) and say hi!"
