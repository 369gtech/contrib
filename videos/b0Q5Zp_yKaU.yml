description: "Chrome version 60 ships with an exciting new DevTools feature called Audits 2.0. This panel replaces the previous Audits panel with a new set of tests powered by Lighthouse. Lighthouse is a tool which checks for various performance and best practice metrics, including accessibility. Under the hood, these accessibility tests are powered by aXe, the open source accessibility engine from the folks at Deque.\n\nToday on A11ycasts I'll show you how to get started with Audits 2.0 by checking a sample site for some common accessibility issues.\n\nIt's important to note that a tool like the new Audits panel can only really check for a subset of accessibility issues (basically anything that can be automated). There are still a number of areas that this tool can't test, so make sure you're manually checking your site as well. Here's a helpful guide if you're not quite sure how to manually check for accessibility issues: https://goo.gl/2xUPh2\n\nCommand palette in DevTools: You can open this with cmd-shift-P or ctrl-shift-P on Windows.\n\nNew Audits panel, powered by Lighthouse: https://goo.gl/Nsp7wB\n\nAutomated testing with aXe: https://goo.gl/QmBy9d\n\nNote at around 3:23 I show a feature where you can click on a node in the Audits panel and inspect it in the Elements panel. This feature is still a little buggy.
