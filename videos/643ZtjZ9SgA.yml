description: "Deep Dive: You Can Run THAT on Cloud Foundry? - Richard Seroter, Pivotal\n\nDo you think Cloud Foundry is just for cloud-native apps? It's an honest mistake to make. Cloud Foundry actually runs all sorts of workloads, many of which might surprise you. In this talk, join Richard as he walks through a handful of different types of applications—batch jobs, streaming pipelines, .NET apps, TCP routable apps, and more—and deploys each to Cloud Foundry. At the end of the talk, you'll walk away with a checklist of workloads that are suitable for a Cloud Foundry environment.\n\nAbout Richard Seroter\nRichard Seroter is the VP of Product Marketing at Pivotal, with a master’s degree in Engineering from the University of Colorado. He’s also an 11-time Microsoft MVP for cloud, Pluralsight trainer, lead InfoQ.com editor for cloud computing, frequent public speaker, and author of multiple books on application integration strategies. Richard maintains a regularly updated blog on topics of architecture and solution design and can be found on Twitter as @rseroter.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
