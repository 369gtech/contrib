recordingDate: 1552415334
description: "Distributed tracing is a challenge that is both technical and organizational. During a February 2019 Distributed Tracing NYC Meetup, Dropbox engineer Ross Delinger explores how his company is solving these challenges and covers how his team's tracing infrastructure has evolved incrementally to keep pace with the migrations and architecture changes required by Dropboxâ€™s move to a service-oriented architecture.\n\nRoss is an SRE at Dropbox and leads the Reliability-Frameworks team, which is building a distributed tracing solution. Prior to that Ross worked on a variety of observability and service infrastructure tooling on the Traffic team at Dropbox."
