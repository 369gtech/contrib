description: "Writing JavaScript used to mean a tangled mess of hacks to avoid global variables, jQuery, and oh so many callbacks. ES2015 and beyond have changed all that.\n\nWe'll migrate a jQuery based website to a more modern foundation, and we'll do it without using any of those JavaScript Frameworks that keep popping up! You'll learn how modern browser JavaScript engines provide a great place to write more readable and maintainable code, and you'll see that you often don't need polyfills or transpilers to use these features!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
