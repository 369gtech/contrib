description: "This session introduces the JVM offered by SAP. This virtual machine was designed and developed with supportability, broad platform support, and reliability as the main paradigms. It is more than just another JVM, because it is enhanced by many extra features. Learn about enhancements for developers, such as debugging on demand, and for admins, such as extended tracing. The session also demonstrates supportability tools such as a complete profiling solution.\n\n\nAuthor:\nVolker Simonis\nVolker Simonis works for SAP in the SAP JVM Technology group.
