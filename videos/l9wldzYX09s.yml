title: 'Building a Feature Factory'
language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1626996665
description: 'Deliver more, high-quality features that customers love faster.” Is the mantra of the Remo engineering team. But how do we do that without breaking everything? I’ll take you through my journey from working on the assembly line at a car factory, to NFL.com, to pushing multiple releases a day while thousands of people are attending live events. It turns out we already have the time to do proactive work as engineers, without hiring more people or working overtime.'
