As one of the largest woman-owned businesses in Silicon Valley, her experience working with global companies and thought leaders has influenced the perception of some of the world's most valuable brands and many of humanity's common causes: Apple, Cisco, Food Network, Facebook, GE, Google, Al Gore, HP, Nokia, TED, Twitter, and World Bank.\r\n\r\nFascinated by presentations as the most powerful persuasive medium, she determined to crack the code on why some presentations are riveting and others are unbearable, in Fall 2010 she released Resonate-Present Visual Stories that Transform Audiences which identifies hidden story structures inherent in great communication. In 2008 she authored the award-winning book slide:ology-The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations where over 20 years of experience was distilled into visual communication best practices."
