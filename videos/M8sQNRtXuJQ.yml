title: '"Library Map: how generous is your open data?" - Hugh Rundle (LCA 2021 Online)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1612050291
description: "Hugh Rundle\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/105/\n\nIn 2020 I started building an interactive map of Australian public library services, rules, and collections. This involved using open data from multiple sources (states, territories, and library associations) provided in multiple formats. My experience sparked some questions both for people using open data and for those publishing and managing it. Who is open data for? How generously do public data stewards manage this data commons? Does there have to be a tension between maintenance and generous provision? And what can open data maintainers do to make it more accessible and useable by ordinary humans? We'll explore these questions as well as a quick rundown of how to make your own interactive maps using public geodata. Check out the map at https://librarymap.hugh.run\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
