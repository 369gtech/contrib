description: "Alex Buckley, Editor, JLS/JVMS, Oracle\n\nA modular development style benefits every Java developer, whether the application is one JAR or one hundred JARs. This session introduces Java Platform, Standard Editionâ€™s Java Platform Module System feature, which has been used to structure the JDK as reliable, reusable modules. It explains how you can create modules to enforce the structure inherent in your application and outlines some best practices for migrating to modules and creating your own Java runtime. It will also prepare you for some of the pitfalls of modular development, such as relying on APIs that are being removed from the JDK and using outdated tools and libraries that hack into JDK internals."
