description: "Since the mid 90s, developers have struggled to build web applications that can be executed both on the client and the server. And still today, even with Node.js and virtual DOM libraries like React, this can be quite challenging.\n\nIn this talk, we'll look at common obstacles and problems that developers face when building this type of web application, including typical performance and security issues. You'll leave the presentation knowing how to build a fast and secure web application that can be rendered on the client and the server.\n\nEVENT:\n\nJSCamp Barcelona 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJohannes Ewald\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r69Z3r4z-Hw"
