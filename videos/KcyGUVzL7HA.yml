description: "\"Speaker: Zac Hatfield-Dodds\n\nIf we knew all of the bugs we needed to write tests for, wouldn't we just... not write the bugs?  So how can testing find bugs that nobody would think of?\n\nThe answer is to have a computer *write your tests for you!*  You declare what kind of input should work - from 'an integer' to 'matching this regex' to 'this Django model' and write a test which should always pass... then Hypothesis searches for the smallest inputs that cause an error.\n\nIf youâ€™ve ever written tests that didn't find all your bugs, this talk is for you.  We'll cover the theory of property-based testing, a worked example, and then jump into a whirlwind tour of the library: how to use, define, compose, and infer strategies for input; properties and testing tactics for your code; and how to debug your tests if everything seems to go wrong.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you'll be ready to find real bugs with Hypothesis in anything from web apps to big data pipelines to CPython itself.  Be the change you want to see in your codebase - or contribute to Hypothesis itself and help drag the world kicking and screaming into a new and terrifying age of high quality software!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
