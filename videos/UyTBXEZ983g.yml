description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nKotlin enables you to write Android, iOS and web applications 100% natively. When you add good architecture, you can achieve enormous code reusage. In this lecture, I show how you can do it yourself. I present possibilities of this approach, how to apply clean architecture there and how to unit test it all.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nMarcin Moskala is an experienced Android developer who is always looking for ways to improve. He has been passionate about Kotlin since its early beta release. He is an author of the book Android Development with Kotlin. He writes articles and speaks at programming conferences.
