description: "Hosted By: Roger Magoulas\n\nToday, collecting and storing personal health-related data is relatively easy with sensors like Fitbit and smartphone apps like Apple's Healthkit. However, doing something useful with that data — enhancing doctor-patient decision making or advancing medical research discoveries — is far more difficult. O'Reilly Media recently completed a project with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Health eHeart project at the University of California San Francisco Medical School designed to uncover ways to accelerate the pace and efficacy of online, crowd-sourced clinical studies.\n\nJoin Ian Eslick, Tuhin Sinha, Roger Magoulas and Rob Rustad (moderated by Roger) will share their experience of putting personal health data to work within a regulated hospital IT environment.\n\nThis webcast will provide insights for developers and technology providers on current state of the health data ecosystem as well as concrete case studies on data flow/analytic challenges faced by hospital IT and clinical researchers.\n\nAbout Ian Eslick, PhD - Chief Executive Officer at Vital Labs, Inc\n\nI love to work on solutions to big problems involving complex, real-world systems. I'm equally comfortable developing new business models, inventing algorithms, writing functional \"big-data\" cloud services, doing direct sales, hacking on mobile apps, or managing and growing an organization.\n\nMy current project is Vital Labs, a San Francisco based startup building a novel healthcare delivery platform that serves patients and clinical care professionals. This company emerged in part from my mid-career PhD on crowdsourcing healthcare at the MIT Media Laboratory. I also run an experimental technology incubator called Vital Reactor. Between projects I like to advise other startups, explore new domains, and occasionally do a little angel investing.\n\nI'm a serious road-cycling enthusiast (you can find me on Strava.com), a fan of the Quantified Self and self-tracking, and I periodically release open source software (like the new Clojurescript dependency tracking framework Derive and front-end database Nativestore)\n\nTwitter: @ieslick\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianeslick\nAbout Tuhin Sinha - President, Co-Founder at Vital Labs\n\nHealthcare technology innovator, working in the bay area.\n\nHistory of medical imaging analysis and algorithmic development. Dissertation work in image-guided neurosurgery and brain deformation mapping. Recipient of an NIH K99/R00 award for post-doctoral work used to concurrently investigate in vivo MRI and proteomic imaging.\n\nRecent experience in providing strategic and business development support to UCSF for healthcare technology partnerships and research activities. Also experienced in developing operational systems in clinical and research environments at top-tier academic medical centers.\n\nSpecialties: research, healthcare, devices, technology, partnerships, technology, mobile applications, mHealth, eHealth\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuhinksinha\n\nAbout Roger Magoulas - Research Director, O'Reilly Media, Inc.\n\nRoger Magoulas is the research director at O'Reilly Media and chair of Strata + Hadoop World conferences. Roger and his team build the analysis infrastructure, and provide analytic services and insights on technology adoption trends to business decision-makers at O'Reilly and beyond. We find what excites key innovators and use those insights to gather and analyze faint signals from various sources to make sense of what others may adopt and why.​\n\nTwitter: @rogerm\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmagoulas\n\nAbout Rob Rustad - Principal, Open Health Cloud\n\nExperienced technology marketing and product development executive focused on finding better ways to put health data work for patients and research. Technical Marketing Director for the Read to Me Project (readtomeproject.org) - please consider donating to help better prepare pre-K kids for successful school experiences.\n\nTwitter: @healthydata\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robrustad\n\nAbout the Health Data Exploration Project — Calit2 and UCSD\n\nThe  (HDE) project, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, is housed at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology at the University of California, San Diego & UC Irvine (calit2.net). The HDE project is creating a Network of innovators in Personal Health Data (PHD) to catalyze the use of these data for the public good. This Network brings together companies, researchers, and strategic partners to strategize, coordinate, and experiment with using PHD to understand health.\n\nTwitter: @HDexplore\nWebsite: http://hdexplore.calit2.net/ \n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreilly\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
