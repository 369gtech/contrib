description: "As developers, we hear (hopefully!) a lot about making what we build accessible for the users. There are company-wide initiatives, conferences and conference sessions, tooling, blog posts, and more to help us build products for people with disabilities. But, what we don’t hear much about is how to make the development experience *itself* accessible.\n\n\nThat means that engineering teams, are often built by, of, and for people without disabilities. Julia’s talk will look at some common development practices and see how they can become barriers for developers with disabilities. We’ll then see how to make some simple changes that reduce or remove these hurdles.\n\n\nBy instituting good practices around code accessibility early on, you can foster an inclusive team that can run an accessible project. In addition to making your code base accessible to those with disabilities, these adaptations can make your project easier to navigate for everyone, new contributors and senior developer alike."
