description: "Hiring good people can be hard. Keeping good people can be hard. It’s made easier though if you can set your company apart as a place that people want to work at. But how do you make the community aware that that’s the case?\n\nDeveloper evangelists typically evangelise products to developers, but what if the thing you’re trying to sell is the team itself? How can you get your entire team sharing with the community what you’ve built and how you work?\n\nThis talk will examine why you should evangelise your team from an individual, team and community perspective, and give concrete examples of how to encourage your team to do so.\n\nABOUT MELINDA SECKINGTON\n\nMelinda is a Ruby developer at FutureLearn, a social learning platform. She loves attending BarCamps, Hackdays and other tech meet ups, and since 2009 has been organising them at Geeks of London. She also writes at MissGeeky, a blog about all things geeky and girly."
