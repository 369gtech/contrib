description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nKubernetes has entirely changed the way we build our infrastructure, enabling organizations to ship more changes faster. But, with all that speed comes challenges — containers introduce a non-trivial level of complexity when it comes to maintaining visibility into your infrastructure. Just as Kubernetes has required us to rethink how we build and deploy our applications, so too must we rethink the traditional approach to monitoring.\n\nIn this webinar, Sensu CEO and co-founder Caleb Hailey will review some of the existing and popular patterns for monitoring Kubernetes (like Prometheus), and what gaps remain outstanding, especially when it comes to monitoring the applications running on Kubernetes. He’ll go over best practices for monitoring workloads on K8s, including the sidecar pattern for monitoring."
