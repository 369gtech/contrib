description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nTutorial: Service Mesh for the Developer Workflow - Christian Posta, Solo.io & Nic Jackson, Hashicorp (Limited Available Seating; First-Come, First-Served Basis)   \n\nPlease bring your laptop fully charged as we will have limited charging stations available in the room.   Service mesh is often presented as a solution for network engineering and system operability, increasing security, reliability, and observability. However, service mesh is also an incredibly useful tool for developers, and understanding how to leverage this technology can dramatically simplify your day to day workflow.  By leveraging free and open-source tools and a scenario-based approach, we will illustrate how a service mesh can help with application resilience, observability, and debugging.  By the end of this workshop you will understand: How to use metrics and distributed tracing effectively Reliability patterns like retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking How to leverage Canary deployments How you can effectively debug distributed systems  The cloud-native, open-source technology used in this tutorial include: Envoy Prometheus Gloo shot Consul Service Mesh Loop Squash Open Census \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaeb"
