description: "As compilers like gcc and clang advance, they probe deeper for weaknesses in source code, generating additional build-time warnings.  These enable Perl 5 contributors to write more accurate and portable code.  In this talk we discuss tools we have written in the past year to identify such warnings.\n\nSlides: http://thenceforward.net/perl/tpc/CiC-2020/slides/\nTarball of slides: http://thenceforward.net/perl/tpc/CiC-2020/build-time-warnings.tgz\nText of talk: http://thenceforward.net/perl/tpc/CiC-2020/further-adventures-in-qa.pdf"
