title: 'Kubernetes in the Context of On-premises Edge and Network Edge Computing'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605041313
description: "For cloud native edge computing applications there is a need for facilitating data processing at the edge of the network to stay at proximity to the source of events with characteristics of ultra-low latency and high bandwidth connectivity, enabling innovative and cutting-edge applications such as video analytics, virtual reality, the Internet of Things (IoT) and self-driving cars.\n\nThis webinar will introduce you to the Open Network Edge Services Software (OpenNESS), an open source, reference cloud-native architecture that enables the Cloud Services Providers (CSPs) and Communication Services Providers (CoSPs) to deploy end-to-end on-premises and network edge services leveraging various CNCF ingredients with Kubernetes at its core - an implementation that delivers recipes for generating new network edge capabilities such as:\n\n- Abstracted platform & network complexity\n- Enhanced dataplane\n- Hardware accelerators management\n- Dynamic discovery & optimal apps/services placement\n- Open integration with Cloud Native Functions (CNFs)"
