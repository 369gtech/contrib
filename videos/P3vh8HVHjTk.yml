description: "Kurt Andersen, LinkedIn\n\nWith the popularity of \"SRE\" as a job role, people have become aware that not all such roles are entirely equivalent. There's been a slack channel on the USENIX-SREcon workspace (https://usenix.org/srecon/slack #sre_between_companies) where people have started to explore these distinctions.\n\nThis session will be an opportunity to crowd-source more information. It will be a moderated, audience driven session. Come and tell us what SRE means at your company!\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
