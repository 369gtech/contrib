description: "In this fun and down to earth session, Seb will demo his new project \"PixelPhones\", which turns all the phones into individual pixels on a large audience sized display. We'll also be looking at how we can use this network of phones to bring an audience together, experimenting with multi-player games and toys.\n\nThe project runs in a mobile phone browser on Android and iOS, and Seb will be talking through the development process, and exactly how he solved the two main challenges with this project - finding the phones and synchronising them together.\n\nHe's been working to improve this project, and we're hoping to run it on a scale that's never been attempted before! There'll be prizes for the games, so make sure your phone is fully charged before you arrive if you want a chance to win.\n\nAbout Seb: https://twitter.com/seb_ly\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
