description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotjs.io on December 5th in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nBabel is amazing, and we all use it to get the latest language goodies now, but we tend to use an all-or-nothing, sledgehammer approach to it. In this talk Christophe shows how to tweak your Babel settings to tailor its level of code transformation to the native support your runtimes offer."
