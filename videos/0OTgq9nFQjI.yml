description: "Can you take an existing app and refactor it to make it better? That is what you will need to do as a C# developer so you should probably practice it. This challenge will push you to better understand how to refactor an application.\n\nChallenge Page: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/courses/448006/lectures/6877632\nSubscribe to the Solutions: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/c-weekly-challenges\n\nPractice makes perfect, right? Well, mostly, but practice is very important. This series is all about getting you to practice the things you learn. I would encourage you to do every one. See which ones are just easy refreshers and which ones are difficult learning experiences."
