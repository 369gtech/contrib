recordingDate: 1297703768
description: 'Good programmers test, and great programmers test everything. But it''s much harder to test user interfaces than raw code. Still, in iOS applications, the user interface is critical... and nothing gets a 1-star review like a bad interface. In this Breakdown, Dan Pilone introduces and demonstrates the UIAutomation framework, which allows for robust testing of your app''s user interface. You''ll learn how to ensure your keyboards and swipes and text boxes all behave, and quickly impress your users with a flexible and responsive user interface.'
