In addition to being a standard component for deploying secure and stable Kubernetes clusters, CRI-O has the unique advantage of being able to tailor its behavior to the needs of the Kubernetes ecosystem. In this talk, Mrunal Patel, Urvashi Mohnani, Sascha Grunert and Peter Hunt, the maintainers of CRI-O, will provide an update about the latest feature developments, as well as live demonstrating typical real world use cases around them. In addition to a review of the basics of setting up and using CRI-O with Kubernetes, the talk will cover improvements around the handling of CNI resources, the ability to tailor container resources with workload types, and updates to the collection and broadcasting of stats and metrics. Join the CRI-O maintainers to learn more about how CRI-O works in action and why it’s the perfect choice for your Kubernetes cluster!"
