title: 'Building Rock SOLID Serverless Applications - William Liebenberg'
language: English
recordingDate: 1611571240
description: "The world has embraced Serverless computing but some systems still end up with the same problems we thought would be a thing of the past. I can hear someone in the background whispering \"Distributed monoliths!\" In this talk, I start by covering how we should apply familiar SOLID principles to our Azure Functions software architecture and infrastructure so that our systems are light, easy to maintain and benefit from unbounded scalability. I follow through with some hardening techniques that involve event messages and triggers that boosts our application's resiliency to outages, security, and low-coupling. After this talk you can go and build Rock SOLID Serverless applications that will be able to withstand the test of time.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
