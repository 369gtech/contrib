description: "Billy Korando, Developer Advocate, IBM\n\nJUnit 5 has been out for a year, so what is the big fuss and why should we take the time to update our existing automated tests to use JUnit 5? This session looks at all the features that have been added to JUnit 5 since its release and how they make automated testing easier and enable developers and organizations to encourage and enforce good development practices through the tests they write. If you have been wondering why you should make the switch from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5, you will definitely want to check out this presentation."
