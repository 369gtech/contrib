description: "This recording of Joe Armstrong's talk was recorded at the Erlang User Conference 2012 in stockholm. More info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2012/talks\n\nThere are two types of thing in Erlang. Forms and Expressions and the two don't mix. The shell is an expression evaluator. The shell reads an expression evaluates it and prints the result. A module is a sequence of forms. The compiler takes a sequence of forms and compiles this into an object file. You can't put forms in shell because they are not expressions. And you can't put expressions in a module because they are not forms.\n\nThis is a mess - in many other languages the input to the shell is the same as the input to the compiler - but not in Erlang. There is a fix to this. \"All\" you have to to is define a form to be an expression. This needs a small syntactic change to the language. \n\nBut we define this to be an expression with a side effect. It's value can be anything we like (say true). But it has a side effect. The side effect is to define the factorial function. \nWith this and a few other changes the shell, modules, and escript become more or less identical. I call it erl2.\n\nTalk objectives: Some insights into some inconsistencies in Erlang and how these can be fixed.\n\nTarget audience: People interested in future developments in Erlang."
