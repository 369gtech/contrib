recordingDate: 1603114875
description: "Ever wondered how Wolfenstein managed to render almost convincing 3D worlds in the 90s?\n\nIn this session, you'll learn about ray casting, the fun hack that'll let you build a 3D renderer from scratch all of your own, only using C#.\n\nWe'll cover the (not) scary maths bits, rendering things at a distance and basic texture mapping in this 1 hour deep dive."
