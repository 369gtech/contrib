description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/c...\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nSecurity of the BEAM\nby\nViktória Fördős\n\nABSTRACT\nBEAMers handle customer's data with utmost care since we believe protecting data is one of the most basic obligations of any company. Achieving our goal requires more effort since the Erlang ecosystem was designed for private networks where the concern about malicious users performing attacks was not given relevance. Therefore, every day we must have a security aware mindset: we must put on our security hat to design, develop and review code changes going into production. \nJoin Viktória to explore the challenges that today's Erlang systems are faced with, analyse the vulnerabilities exists in Erlang, learn how to apply the principles of secure design to software projects running on the BEAM and learn about the tools exists today that can help in security reviews.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Viktória Fördős\n\nViktória is passionate about security, consistency models, highly available and scalable software. She first came in contact with Erlang in 2010 when she joined the RefactorErl project. Has been active in R&D, and of course in Erlang, ever since. She was contributing to FP7 EU projects (PharaPhrase, RELEASE, SYNCFREE), has published her results in academic and industrial conferences and journals. She believes that research is to be consumed by industry, and promotes research that has immediate impact and helps software engineers. She joined Cisco Systems in 2019. She is an NSO core engineer, she solves (network orchestration) problems in Erlang everyday.\n\n---\n\nCode Mesh V\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/c...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshio"
