Docker has been the buzzword in the technology sphere, in the recent past to ship applications as containers. \n\nA research states that there are already 10,000 companies who have adopted containers for taking their application to production and there are already 185 million containers on use in the world. The rate of adoption of Docker is increasing by 40% every year. Now that Docker has become the most integral part of production environment, various organizations are now looking out for tools that can help them effectively manage and orchestrate their containers. \n\nHere is when industries started adopting a Google open sourced tool called Kubernetes for effectively managing the containers.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\nAnkur Kashyap, DevOps, Build & Release says: ‚ÄúI was enrolled into Devops training from Edureka On a professionalism, they provide a great presentation on the topic that helps to understand the indepth of Devops technology.
