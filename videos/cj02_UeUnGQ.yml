title: '"A Political History of X" - Keith Packard (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579213012
description: "Keith Packard\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/186/\n\nStretching back over 35 years, the X Window System is one of the\r\noldest surviving free software projects. Having its origins before the\r\ninvention of the GPL, the history of X offers a slice through the\r\nwhole lifetime of the software freedom movement. Using X as a lens, we\r\ncan study the causes and effects of licensing, community and\r\ncorporations in the world of free software.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will describe the origins of X, a discussion about\r\nthe influences and interactions with the major Unix workstation\r\nvendors and early interactions with the Free Software Foundation. Also\r\nincluded will be a description of how internet performance bottlenecks\r\nin the mid 80s drove structural and governance changes in X that haunt\r\nthe larger software ecosystem to the current day. Finally, a\r\ndiscussion on how software licensing choices drive community structure\r\nand affect corporate engagement will be included.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
