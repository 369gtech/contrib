title: '[DevFest Nantes 2019] Building a Complex Application with Web Components and LitElement'
language: French
recordingDate: 1572525670
description: "Speaker : Justin Fagnani\n\nThis talk would cover more advanced techniques necessary for building large apps: cross-component coordination, state management, lazy loading views and components, deferred rendering, context-like APIs based on events, render-props with lit-element, theming, and possibly SSR and rehydration. This will focus much more on overall architecture and advanced techniques than web components basics. Non-web components topics like service workers and PWAs may be touched on, but the focus will be web components and LitElement."
