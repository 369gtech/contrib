This talk is a guide for alternative architectures e.g Hexagonal/Onion/Clean.\n\nIn this talk Peter:\nReviews some ideas of designing software. What separation of concerns really means.\nDiscusses how to use the tools we have to organise our code such as mix, umbrellas and releases.\nFinally asks some questions about what more the Elixir ecosystem needs to reach its potential.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2OpmrfP\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - PETER SAXTON\nElixir developer at paywithcurl.com\n\nWorking with Elixir everyday at paywithcurl.com, and loving it. Discovered Elixir after using Python, JavaScript, Ruby and Scala. Before programming was conducting research into quantum optics.\n\nBelieves that message passing is a great way to think about distributed systems. Nowadays developing Raxx with the goal of extending message passing beyond the BEAM. \n\nMore on Peter Saxton: http://bit.ly/2OpmrfP"
