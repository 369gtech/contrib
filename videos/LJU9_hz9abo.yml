description: "We will share how we built a modern Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to use in all our machine learning services using Jinja for the templating, pre-commit for the automatic checks, Drone CI for the continuous integration and Databricks jobs for the training. I will also explain how we manage our models using MLflow.\nIt shows how we laid the foundation for our machine learning platform using open-source software to be able to manage our services powered by data.\n\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1nMF39X3pgiwsPv5g4WtNRhTDbXA-1vUe/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
