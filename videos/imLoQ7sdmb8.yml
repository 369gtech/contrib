description: "Kito Mann, Principal Consultant, Virtua, Inc.\n\nYou’ve been comfortable building back-end services in Java or using a Java web framework, but now you must build an application with a JavaScript framework such as Angular, React, Polymer, Ember, Backbone, or a homegrown mismatch of jQuery and custom code. Suddenly you have entered a parallel universe with foreign terms such as “bower,” “node,” “npm,” “webpack,” “AMD,” “CommonJS,” “ES6,” “ES2015,” “TypeScript,” “Babel,” “gulp,” “grunt,” “shim,” and “polyfill,” to name a few. What do they all mean, and how are they related to each other? More importantly, how do they compare to what we know and love in the Java universe? Attend this session to explore another universe."
