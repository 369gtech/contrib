description: "Around 5 years ago, we embarked on a journey to create TypeScript. It all began with our love and passion to help JavaScript developers create applications that scale. TypeScript has come a long way since then. This session will dive head first on a demo driven tour of what Typescript is and the value it brings for JavaScript developers. You'll walk away knowing how to quickly add TypeScript to your own apps, see some of the latest features in action and most importantly, get a first-hand experience of the productivity gains it brings to your JavaScript apps.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeJS Interactive North America 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBowden Kelly, Microsoft\n\nPERMISSIONS;\n\nThe Linux Foundations provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YOHg3rt3W8"
