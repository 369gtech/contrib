recordingDate: 1333572311
description: "Balloons are a central tool in the Public Laboratory mapping kit. Mathew Lippincott will demonstrate a camera-bearing helium balloon that is small enough to fly without prior FAA clearance to altitudes up to 4000 ft. It is an approachable, inexpensive way for civic organizations to document their events and environments. Small-scale mapping offers communities high temporal as well as spacial resolution, capturing phenomena ranging from Deepwater Horizon oil to vegetation growth to occupy camps.\n\nMathew Lippincott\n\nPublic Laboratory for Open Technology & Science\n\nA founding member of the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (PLOTS), Mathew is an artist and designer who has worked in technology education for eight years. He became involved in Grassroots Mapping through materials testing and the design of low-cost balloons and kites. In addition to developing flying machines, he supervises the production of kits and other materials. He is also a founder of Cloacina, Cewas startup. Cloacina is currently developing educational materials with ReCode:Oregon's Ecological Sanitation Campaign and PNCA's Collaborative Design MFA Program.\n\nStewart Long\n\nPublic Laboratory for Open Technology & Science\n\nA founding member of The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science, Stewart is a geographer focused on making aerial image maps. Inspired by the digital age of map making and virtual globes, his work centers around making maps with both new technology and classic field techniques. As Director of Geography and Data for Public Laboratory, Stewart coordinates and executes mapmaking projects while managing the Public Laboratory Archive."
