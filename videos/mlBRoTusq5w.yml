Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Kubermatic - Fighting the Final Boss: Complex Multi-site Multi-cluster App Deployments\n\nSpeakers: Sascha Haase\n\nWith the rise of Kubernetes’ popularity across various use-cases, including edge computing, IoT, 5G, or AI/ML, single-cluster Kubernetes deployments are increasingly becoming an exception rather than the norm. As the number of clusters increases, the management of these clusters and the applications running in them quickly becomes the operators’ final boss.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will show you how you can master this challenge with open source platforms developed by Kubermatic: Kubermatic Kubernetes Platform for multi-cluster infrastructure management and KubeCarrier for multi-cluster application deployment and management.\n\nCome and learn how you can use these tools to master the final boss and automate the full lifecycle of complex multi-cluster solutions consisting of applications spread across multiple Kubernetes clusters."
