description: "JSWORLD Conference 2021\n\nManfred Steyer \nFederated Angular: Micro Frontends with Module Federation\n\nThe implementation of micro frontends has so far been anything but easy.\n\nSince common frameworks and build tools didn't even know this idea, you had to dig into the tricks bag. Module Federation offered by Webpack 5 initiates a crucial change of direction here. It allows you to load separately compiled applications at runtime and to share libraries between them.\n\nIn this session, you learn how to use this mechanism to create micro frontends with Angular.\n\nBesides the default scenarios, we also look into dynamic Module Federation, sharing libraries, and dealing with version mismatches. At the end of the session, you know how to use Module Federation in your projects and what the consequences are.\n\nSlides: https://www.angulararchitects.io/konferenzen/federated-angular-micro-frontends-with-module-federation-2/\n\nWebsite: https://jsworldconference.com/\n\nSign up for our newsletter: https://www.frontenddeveloperlove.com/newsletter\nStay up to date via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontendlove/\n\nPowered by https://passionatepeople.io\n\n#unittests #webaudio #unittesting #hiphop #frontendlove or #vuejsamsterdam #javascript #reactacademy #react #microinteractions #designsystems #javascript #artificialintelligence #amsterdam #speaker #conference #frontendlove #frontenddeveloperlove #javascriptconference #frontendconference #vue #angular #react #cfp #theateramsterdam #meetup #conferences #events"
