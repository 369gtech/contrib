recordingDate: 1523462990
description: "Modern development is complex, with lots of tools to turn the code we write into the code used by the user’s browser. This can be as simple as minifying assets or as sophisticated as downloading dependencies and turning source code into production code.\n\nIn this session, we will look at the top benefits gained from adopting a Continuous Integration workflow to automate the build process, testing, and deployment. Whether you're a developer wondering why you should try Continuous Integration in the first place or a business owner wondering why you should let your team spend time on adopting a new process when the current one \"just works\" we'll have answers for you!"
