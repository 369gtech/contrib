description: "Welcome to Intro to Deep Learning! This course is for anyone who wants to become a deep learning engineer. I'll take you from the very basics of deep learning to the bleeding edge over the course of 4 months. In this video, we’ll predict an animal’s body weight given it’s brain weight using linear regression via 10 lines of Python. I’ll have a live session every Wednesday at 10 AM PST that covers my weekly video topics in depth. You can click on the little notification bell next to the subscribe button to get an email notification whenever I’m live. And each session is recorded and uploaded to this channel in case you miss it. This Youtube content is 100% created by me (from the writing to the editing, etc.) , it’ll all be released on my channel, and it’s totally free.\n\nI am also very proud and excited to announce my new, exclusive partnership with Udacity. Together, we’re offering the new Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation program. If you want to take your game to the next level, this is for you! Especially since Udacity will be providing guaranteed admission to their groundbreaking Artificial Intelligence and Self-Driving Car Nanodegree programs to all graduates. They’re offering discounted limited-time pricing, so enroll now to enjoy the unique projects, program sets, and expert reviews. Plus, their community is amazing, so don’t forget to join the Slack channel after you enroll (I’ll be in there too!) And hey, I’m getting paid a small royalty from each enrollment, so let’s do this together!\n\nLink to the Udacity nanodegree:\nhttps://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment. That’s what keeps me going.\n\nThis weeks coding challenge (these weekly challenges are not related to the Udacity nanodegree projects, those are additional):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/linear_regression_demo\n\nMick’s winning code:\nhttps://github.com/mickvanhulst/q_learning\n\nVishal’s runner-up code:\nhttps://github.com/erilyth/Q-Learning-on-Mazes\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttp://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithm-choice\nhttps://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer\nhttps://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/250\nhttp://machinelearningmastery.com/simple-linear-regression-tutorial-for-machine-learning/\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nThe vast majority of this course will use Tensorflow. It's just this first example that's using scikit-learn.\n\nAnd please support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
