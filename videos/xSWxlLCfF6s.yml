description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nEIR: INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WORKING WITH BEAM CODE\nby Hans Elias B. Josephsen\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nBEAM \nLow-level \nCompiler\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nEir is an intermediate representation for Erlang code. It is designed to support advanced code optimizations, and for use with LLVM.\n\nDuring the presentation, two proof-of-concepts will be presented, both utilizing Eir:\n• Whirl - A proof-of-concept WebAssembly runtime for BEAM languages\n• Niffy - A tool for automatically generating NIFs from Erlang/Elixir code\n\nThe talk will serve as a walkthrough of Eir and it's related projects, including where it came from, where it is right now, and where it might be headed in the future.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/hans-elias-b-josephsen/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - HANS ELIAS B. JOSEPHSEN\nSoftware developer and electronics engineer\n\nHans is a programmer and electronics engineer who likes working with both electronics and software, including everything in between. On the software side, he has a keen fascination for language runtimes, compilers and low-level programming. Outside of Erlang and the BEAM, he enjoys using Rust.\n\nKey Achievements\n\nThe Rustler project: https://github.com/hansihe/\n\nMore on Hans Elias B.
