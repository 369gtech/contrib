title: '"What UNIX Cost Us" - Benno Rice (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579132537
description: "Benno Rice\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/28/\n\nUNIX is a hell of a thing. From starting as a skunkworks project in Bell Labs to accidentally dominating the computer industry it's a huge part of the landscape that we work within. The thing is, was it the best thing we could have had? What could have been done better?\r\n\r\nJoin me for a bit of meditation on what else existed then, what was gained, what was lost, and what could (and should) be re-learned.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nWed Jan 15 13:30:00 2020 at Room 5"
