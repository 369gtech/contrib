title: 'Quantum Computing Concepts - John Azariah'
recordingDate: 1554724878
description: "Quantum Computing exploits quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to realize a form of parallelism that is not available to traditional computing. It offers the potential of significant computational speed-ups in quantum chemistry, materials science, cryptography, and machine learning.\n-With no prior knowledge of condensed matter physics or advanced mathematics, it's hard to separate hype from reality.\n\nCome learn the fundamentals of Quantum Computing, get a sense of where it applies and what it can do, and the challenges being faced to make it a reality. Oh, and we'll write a little quantum computing code too!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndccopenhagen.com"
