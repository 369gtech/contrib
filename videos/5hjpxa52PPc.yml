title: 'How thanking people can lead to a better culture - Jim Bennett'
recordingDate: 1553248105
description: "Think back to the last time you said \"Thank you\" to someone. Not the thanks you might give when someone holds a door or passes the salt, but a genuine, heartfelt thanks. It felt good, didn't it!\n\nAs it turns out there is actually a bit of science behind this - thanking people has a chemical affect similar to falling in love. If you can build a workplace culture of thanks, you can actually make people fall in love with their job.\n\nThis lightning talk investigates thanks through a case study of a company in New Zealand that decided to take thanks from a biweekly meeting held by one team, to a company wide culture change that led to a happier workplace for everyone.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
