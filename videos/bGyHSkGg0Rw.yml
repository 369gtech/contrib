description: "The talk from JS Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: will be added soon. \nFb: https://www.facebook.com/JSFestua/\nWebsite: http://jsfest.com.ua/\n\nWe all love JavaScript. So much so that we tend to use it where it is not strictly needed and at the same time talk down on technologies that actually make more sense. The big CSS vs. JavaScript debate is upon us and it's getting ugly. In this talk Chris Heilmann wants to remind us about the goals of our work and how we communicate is a big part of this. We need to own the JavaScript story, and this means focusing on what has an impact."
