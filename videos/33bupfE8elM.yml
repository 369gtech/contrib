description: "HBF has a vision to create a unique community where Members are renowned for being healthier, happier people. HBF delivers this in part, through a range of web based and mobile health tools to allow members to track and monitor their wellness, and by capturing insights from these services alongside broader member data. This case study will present how three solutions originating through experimental innovation days within the HBF IT developer community, applied new technology to local opportunities, to create true member value and a shift in thinking and capability. Examples include the development of a pilot application using Google Glass for HBF Fitness; an application for members to upload their wearables data into an integrated service to record and compare data and receive rewards and incentives; and the use of rapid data discovery and interactive visualisation tools to bring HBF’s data to life.\n\nEric Wong is responsible for HBF’s member and employee IT digital portfolio including web, mobile and enterprise integration.Eric has a unique skill set and experience across the software development lifecycle, virtualisation and infrastructure operations.Eric leads a team of 25 developers and has been a key influencer in the adoption of new technology and innovation at HBF.\n\nFor more on YOW!
