description: "Ward Bekker will talk at Erlang Factory Lite inLondon on the 8th of November\n\nErlang is designed for building massively scalable and highly available soft real-time systems. Unsurprisingly , Erlang provides us with powerful libraries for automated testing of these type of systems. In this talk, we take a look at three of the popular automated testing libraries for Erlang, discuss their individual strengths and weaknesses and illustrate the importance of continuous integration by deploying sample automated tests to Travis-CI, a free continuous integration service for the open source community.\n\nWard Bekker will be talking about automated testing \n\nTalk objectives: Describe and explain popular Erlang automated testinging libraries (EUnit, QuickCheck, Common Test) and the advantages of continuous integration.\n\nTarget audience: Test-conscious Erlang programmers.\n\nAbout Ward:\nWard Bekker is a Travis-CI contributor at TTY. He started developing back in the day when 'On Error Resume Next' was a popular idea of fault tolerance. Since then he used quite a few languages and frameworks for delivering high-traffic web-applications. Along the way he discovered that pretty much all popular languages are a surprisingly poor equipped for taking advantage of distributed computing and the current multicore revolution. Now he codes primarily in Erlang.\n\nFavourite quote: \"The only constant is change\"\ntwitter: @wardbekker"
