The call stack may consist of a limited amount of address space, often determined at the start\n of the program. The size of the call stack depends on many factors, including the programming language, machine architecture, multi-threading, and amount of \navailable memory. When a program attempts to use more space than is available on the call stack (that is, when it attempts to access memory beyond the call stack's\n bounds, which is essentially a buffer overflow), the stack is said to overflow, typically resulting in a program crash.\nIn this video we will see Stack Overflow as use case of MapReduce Design Patterns.\n\n\nRelated Blog : http://www.edureka.co/blog/tailored-big-data-solutions-using-mapreduce-design-patterns?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=webinar&utm_campaign=stackover-mapreduce-design\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would\nprefer a hassle free and self paced learning environment, accessible from any part of the world.\n\nThe topics related to Stack Overflow have extensively been covered in our course 'MapReduce Design Patternsâ€™.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
