language: English
recordingDate: 1526546709
description: "Eve Kleiman\n\nBlockchain technology and Bitcoin will potentially revolutionize business transactions. Blockchain offers a robust, decentralized platform for privacy and trust. It underlies the digital crypto-currency Bitcoin, which can be exchanged freely and anonymously, without a central authority. Bitcoin transactions - recorded publicly, provide an invaluable dataset to gain insight into the behavior of digital currency and the underlying Blockchain technology. Blocks, transactions with potential multiple inputs and outputs, and flow of bitcoins between addresses, form a sophisticated real-time graph. This talk details a pipeline used to gather bitcoin transaction data and analyze it with powerful graph cloud database technologies."
