description: "by Jakub Jelen\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.218A/pkcs11_in_os.webm\n\n\nDuring last year, we worked hard to make cryptographic tokens usage consistent across the operating system and to improve its usability, mostly using the means of PKCS#11 URIs. This was done for both administrators and end users, in the end resulting in easier configuration of HSMs and authentication using smart cards and cryptographic tokens. I will outline what we worked on to improve the user experience and support for smart cards, cryptographic tokens and HSMs across the operating system. I will share experience with implementing or improving this support across various applications, libraries and tools, experience with testing them and making sure they work together in Linux distribution. I will focus on the current state in Fedora and RHEL 8 and propose some future steps that we have yet to take. \n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 16:30:00+01"
