description: "Deep Dive: kops (Cluster Lifecycle) SIG - Justin Santa Barbara, Google & Mike Splain, Sonos \n\nWe'll dig into the recent progress in kops: etcd-manager and etcdadm getting us to etcd3; support for CRDs and the server mode; starting to move to cluster API and our future plans here; starting to adopt bundles to allow for richer upgrades. Also kops is now a conformant kubernetes distribution! We'll discuss the status of our support for more clouds, including the recent OpenStack work. We'll also talk about some of our general initiatives e.g. secure by default. But most importantly let's talk about your pain points and figure out what you would like to see, and let's discuss how you can get involved. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPkU"
