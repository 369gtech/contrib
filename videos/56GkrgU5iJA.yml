description: "Cubes, Hexagons, Triangles, and More: Understanding the Microservice Architecture Through Shapes\n\nThe microservice architecture is becoming increasing important. But what is it exactly? Why should you care about microservices? And, what do you need to do to ensure that your organization uses the microservice architecture successfully? In this talk, Iâ€™ll answer these and other questions using shapes as visual metaphors. You will learn about the motivations for the microservice architecture and why simply adopting microservices is insufficient. I describe essential characteristics of microservices, You will learn how a successful microservice architecture consist of loosely coupled services with stable APIs that communicate asynchronous. I will cover strategies for effectively testing microservices.\n\nChris Richardson is a developer and architect. He is a Java Champion, a JavaOne rock star and the author of POJOs in Action, which describes how to build enterprise Java applications with frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate. Chris was also the founder of the original CloudFoundry.com, an early Java PaaS for Amazon EC2. Today, he is a recognized thought leader in microservices and speaks regularly at international conferences. Chris is the creator of Microservices.io, a pattern language for microservices, and is the author of Microservices Patterns, which is available at Manning. He provides microservices consulting and training to organizations that are adopting the microservice architecture and is working on his third startup Eventuate, an application platform for developing transactional microservices.\n\nFor more on YOW!
