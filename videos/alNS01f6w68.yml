description: "It's half a century since the NATO Software Engineering conference in Garmisch. How are we doing? Are we nearly there yet? Or is there no 'there' there? We are excited by new language releases, microservices, machine learning, agile development, testing all the things... but what is genuinely new in our practices, our programming languages, our understanding of software architecture? What could we have learned and what have we still to learn? In this talk we'll try to understand what 'engineering' means for software and its development, what is helping us go forward and what is holding us back, which ideas are old and which are genuinely new. We can learn from our experience, but the future doesn't necessarily have to look like our experience.\n\nKevlin Henney, Curbralan\nKevlin is an independent consultant and trainer based in the UK. His development interests are in patterns, programming, practice and process. He helps teams adopt techniques and improve their software development through training, mentoring and reviewing. He has been a columnist for various magazines and websites. Kevlin is co-author of A Pattern Language for Distributed Computing and On Patterns and Pattern Languages, two volumes in the Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture series. He is also editor of the 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
