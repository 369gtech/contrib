description: "You’ve built your application. You’ve tested it from every angle. It’s a masterpiece of engineering. Nothing you ever develop again will ever surpass your work. Unfortunately, these days, your job isn’t finished. Now you have to deploy your application, if you’re lucky, internally to your company, maybe onto some sort of cloud. If you’re unlucky, onto a customer site, complete with grumpy sysadmin.\nMonitoring is a hot topic, but one that developers have not focused on until recent years, given newly found responsibilities. This talk aims to give you enough information to get started monitoring your software and deployment, such that you have a fighting chance of not only fixing issues when they occur, but noticing them in the first place.\n\nThis talk will address all the buzzwords, and boil the topic down to the bare essentials.\n\nWhat are metrics, events and alerts? Do I need log parsing and searching? What on earth is time-series? How do I need to instrument my applications? Do I need to? How does this relate to tracing and profiling?"
