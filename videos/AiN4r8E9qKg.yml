description: "This video was recorded at Code Elixir LDN 18: http://bit.ly/2vxJuxL\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next Elixir conference: http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nIT’S SCARY OUT THERE! DISCOVERING DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS IN ELIXIR\nby Maciej Kaszubowski\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nDistributed systems\nTradeoffs\nMulti-node\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nElixir is often advertised as a great platform for building multi-node applications. While there’s some truth in that, there is nothing easy about distributed systems. This talk covers the nice things available to Elixir developers thanks to the Erlang VM. We also learn how these features are actually implemented and what guarantees they give us. With that knowledge, Maciej offers up example problems to be solved and explores possible solutions and their trade-offs. \n\nHave you ever wondered how Phoenix Channels or Phoenix Presence actually work?\nWhy there’s so many different solutions?\nWhat’s the difference between :global and :pg2 modules?\nOr whether these “CRDT” things will solve all of your problems with distributed computing? \nIf so, watch and discover the scary and fascinating world of distributed systems. \n\nRead the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2OljQ6u\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MACIEJ KASZUBOWSKI\nSoftware developer at AppUnite\n\nMaciej is a developer at AppUnite where he's been using Elixir for about two years now. Interested in software architecture, distributed systems, data synchronisation and consistency guarantees. Currently writing his Master’s Thesis on CRDTs. Lately, a frequent speaker and a co-organiser of Poznań Elixir meetup. Started to love speaking even more after giving a talk on ElixirConfEU 2018.\n\nMore on Maciej Kaszubowski: http://bit.ly/2OljQ6u\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 18\nWebsite: www.codesync.global\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\nMail: info at codesync.global"
