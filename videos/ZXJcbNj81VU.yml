title: 'YOW! West 2014 - Adopting Functional Programming Languages - Andy Marks'
recordingDate: 1422351396
description: "For some years, there has been a quiet renaissance in a form of software development once relegated to niche fields of academia and computer science: functional programming. Functional languages like Scala and Clojure are attracting significant attention from developers, and aspects of functional programming are creeping into established development languages/platforms like Java and .Net. But what is the catalyst for this renaissance? The increasing scale and sophistication required of custom software development has led people to reprioritise the benefits of functional languages (e.g., immutability, expressiveness) as a way of increasing code quality, boosting development productivity and reducing complexity. This presentation is aimed at those unfamiliar with functional programming and will describe the reasons for it's recent resurgence and why many IT organisations should be considering trialling functional programming alongside their existing development languages.\n\nFor more on YOW!
