title: 'Building IMU-based Gesture Recognition! (awesome project!)'

recordingDate: 1576270874
description: "An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a device that can sense motion and orientation. If you combine IMUs with machine learning, you can detect gestures! For last Halloween, I built a magic wand that combines IMUs, machine learning, and DIY electronics to detect different gestures when waving the wand. In this talk, weâ€™ll go over the steps I took to build the wand and how you can do it too! Hardware prototyping is becoming more accessible than ever for people without a traditional hardware engineering background, and there are lots of exciting things you can do when computing meets the physical world.\n\n\nEVENT:\n!!Con West 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nJennifer Wang\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9E02GhF3Q4"
