description: "It's no secret that using full-blown frameworks that provide every functionality you could ask for tends to be troublesome - some of them impose a certain structure on your applications, hide implementation details of the parts of your program generated on the fly (making them harder to debug), and require testing your programs in a specific way. \n\nThankfully, there are alternatives, such as not depending on frameworks to do all the work - instead, you delegate parts of the functionality to libraries. In this talk, I'm going to talk about two of them - http4s (a HTTP server/client library) and doobie (a functional JDBC wrapper), how they interact together thanks to a common core (cats-effect, fs2), and how they allow you to write resource-safe applications that you can fully control, and whose parts you can easily test independently or as a whole."
