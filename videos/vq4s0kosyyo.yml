description: "Scene Builder 2.0 will be shipped with a brand-new feature: Scene Builder Kit. This kit is an API and enables the integration of major Scene Builder components and functionalities directly into other applications. With this feature, integrating Scene Builder into your favorite IDE, RAD tool, or custom UI design application will be much easier. This session shows how to use the components, panels, and APIs efficiently to create a seamless user experience embedding Scene Builder. A fully working prototype of an integration on top of the NetBeans IDE is shown as a proof of concept, including code walks and live demo coding.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSven Reimers\nundefined\nView more trainings by Sven Reimers at https://www.parleys.com/author/sven-reimers-4\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
