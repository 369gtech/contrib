description: "The software development industry is changing rapidly. New technologies are born every day, an increasing number of options are presented to development teams to build solutions, and there is an urge to adopt the newest languages, frameworks and tools. This tendency is causing organizations to lose focus on what is really important: Building software solutions that deliver business value.\n\nWe’ll go over the process to identify what business value means for your organization using popular design techniques like Value Stream Mapping, then we’ll translate those business needs into architectural characteristics. Finally, we’ll review the steps to choose the right architecture.\n\nAbel Fresnillo Silva, Senior Software Engineer at Lowe's Companies\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/software-architecture-a-story-about-business-value-and-tradeoffs"
