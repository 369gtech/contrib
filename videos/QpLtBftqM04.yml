description: 'HTTP 2.0 is supposed to be the next big thing for the web, after the overwhelming success of HTTP 1.1. In this session we will examine the HTTP 2.0 protocol, what is the status of its specification, what features does it offer over HTTP 1.1, and how websites can benefit (in speed and money) from it. The session will also explore what does it take to write HTTP 2.0 applications in the Java platform, what plans there are to support it in JDK 9 and which Servlet Containers are already offering HTTP 2.0 support, finishing up with a demo of HTTP 2.0 new features.'
