description: "Worried about finding your next Perl job in a shrinking market? This talk explores what’s awesome (and what sucks) about popular other stacks and how to future-proof your career.\n\nPerl isn’t dead, and Perl isn’t dying, but the number of pure Perl dev jobs is continuing to shrink.\n\nThis talk looks at the technical features of several popular technical stacks (spoiler: testing and documentation suck, and there’s no Moose, but async is pretty cool) as well as market outlook for each.\n\nIt also talks about future-proofing your career - strategies for helping you to leverage your outstanding Perl skills in the context of a shrinking number of pure Perl jobs."
