description: "We’re so pleased to announce that we’ve teamed up with Dave Farley, author of “Continuous Delivery” and frequent GOTO Conferences speaker, for a monthly video series featuring ideas about continuous delivery, DevOps, test-driven development, BDD, software engineering and software development in general. \n\nFind plenty more from Dave on his Continuous Delivery YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfqyGl3nq_V0bo64CjZh8g\n\nDave Farley - Continuous Delivery & DevOps Pioneer, Award-winning Author, Founder & Director of Continuous Delivery Ltd.\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Cyberpunk 2077 release was a disaster. What were the roots of this failure? Why did this very high-profile software project go so badly wrong and how could the software’s producers have avoided it? CD Projekt Red is the studio that produced the release, in this episode Software Engineering expert Dave Farley examines the publicity available evidence for what went wrong from a Software Engineering perspective. This was a failure of poor management and bad software engineering,\n\nThis is a high-profile example of a very common way to fail in the delivery of software. The consequences are always high, how could good software engineering make a difference, and how is that related to better business performance in this case? This was a failure of business strategy, culture and software engineering all of which could have been helped and improved by DevOps & Continuous Delivery (engineering) thinking.\n\nREFERENCES\nSmall Teams are more efficient: https://www.qsm.com/risk_02.html\nContinuous Delivery in AAA Game Development: https://youtu.be/8hXRvvFDztg\n\nCD TRAINING COURSES\nIf you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses\nhttps://bit.ly/DFTraining \n\nDAVE'S NEW BOOK\nYou can grab Dave Farley's new book 'Continuous Delivery Pipelines' here:\nhttps://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOxDaveFarley #Programming #Cyberpunk #2077 #Cyberpunk2077 #Teams #Refactoring #DaveFarley #GOTO #GOTOcon #ContinuousDelivery\n\nDAVE'S LINKS\nhttps://www.continuous-delivery.co.uk\nhttps://twitter.com/davefarley77\nhttp://www.davefarley.net\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
