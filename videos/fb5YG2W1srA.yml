description: "Join Juergen Hoeller, Chris Beams and Rossen Stoyanchev to learn about the 3.2 generation of the Spring Framework.  They will discuss the fine-tuned Java 7 support, container optimizations, and first-class support for asynchronous web request processing.\n\nWe'll discuss some refinements in the core container as well as key updates in Spring MVC: asynchronous MVC processing on Servlet 3.0, REST support improvements, and the inclusion of the formerly-standalone Spring MVC Test project. Spring Framework 3.2 also comes with a new Gradle-based build and a GitHub-based contribution model, making it even easier for community members to contribute to the Spring Framework project."
