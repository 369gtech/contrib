Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\n20,000 Upgrades Later: Lessons From a Year of Managed Kubernetes Upgrades - Adam Wolfe Gordon, DigitalOcean \n\nUpgrading to a new release is one of the most disruptive operations we regularly inflict on our Kubernetes clusters. There are multiple strategies for doing an upgrade, but they all require rescheduling workloads and restarting cluster components.  We started offering upgrades on our managed Kubernetes platform, DigitalOcean Kubernetes Service (DOKS), in May 2019. Since then, our customers have kicked off about 20,000 automated patch and minor release upgrades on their clusters. Most of those upgrades went well, but some didn't and we've learned a few things from the ones that went wrong.  In this talk we will share lessons from a year of automated Kubernetes upgrades: what we got right, what we got wrong, workloads that caused us trouble, and changes we've made to make the process smoother. We hope these lessons will help others avoid pain in their Kubernetes upgrades.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZepW"
