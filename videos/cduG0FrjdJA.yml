The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nEvolving the Kubernetes Ingress APIs to GA and Beyond - Christopher M Luciano, IBM & Bowei Du, Google  \n\nThe Ingress API has existed as beta type since early 2016 release in Kubernetes 1.2. Since its inception, it has been fairly lightweight and additions remained infrequent in attempts to maintain portability within the Kubernetes ecosystem. In response, Ingress API implementations commonly leverage a different internal API or extend the Ingress API by heavily decorating the resource with annotations.     In this session, we will present the Ingress enhancements for the GA/v1 Ingress API and what factors went into these decisions. Furthermore, we'll explore several possible directions for what a v2 API could entail and walk through several examples including existing non-Kubernetes implementations. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaYG"
