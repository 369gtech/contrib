description: "Cloud platforms provide scale and a ton of powerful services. With these options comes the challenge of choice.\n\nTechnologies like Spring Boot, Pivotal Platform, and Apache Geode provide powerful abstractions that give developers a path to create resilient and scalable architectures.\n\nIn this session, we'll build a cloud-native application composed on multiple services that's scalable and fault tolerant. We'll leverage Apache Geode as a cloud-native data store that provides scale and resilience. We'll even explore how it can replicate across clouds.\n\nSpeakers: John Blum, Principal Software Engineer, Pivotal; Luke Shannon, President and Founder, Phlyt\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/scalable-cloudnative-data-applications-by-example"
