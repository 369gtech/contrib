title: 'Getting More Use from Your Resources in .NET: ThreadPool and Options - Scott Price'
recordingDate: 1555396428
description: "Multi-threading is an effective way to take greater advantage of the available hardware resources. More recent versions of the .NET Framework and languages introduce different ways to use threads.\n\nWe will take a very quick look at a few approaches, some of which are underpinned by the ThreadPool, and consider the pro's and con's. We will also discuss some practical real-life problems, some of the limitations of the ThreadPool, and ways we can achieve the desired operational results.\n\nScott Price\n\nTrouble-shooter, problem solver and wearer of too many hats, software consultant, DevOps and security focused supporter."
