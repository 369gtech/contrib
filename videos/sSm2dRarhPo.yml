title: 'Microservices + Events + Docker = A Perfect Trio'

description: "Microservices are an essential enabler of agility but developing and deploying them is a challenge.\nIn order for microservices to be loosely coupled,each service must have its own datastore.\nThis makes it difficult to maintain data consistency across services.\nDeploying microservices is also a complex problem since an application typically consists of 10s or 100s of services, written in a variety of languages and frameworks.\nIn this presentation, you will learn how to solve these problems by using an event-driven architecture to maintain data consistency and by using Docker to simplify deployment.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDockerCon 2016\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nChris Richardson\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)."
