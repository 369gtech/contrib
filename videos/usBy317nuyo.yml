recordingDate: 1445386823
description: "So, you are developing that awesome mobile application that will rock the world, but it is becoming more complex with every code change. You are looking for a way to control every commit in order to ensure that nothing is broken and all features are working as expected. You start writing different kinds of automated tests (Unit, Functional, Performance, UI, ...) using various Test Frameworks (Robotium, Uiautomator, Espresso, Calabash, Appium), but you are missing that final little \"something\" that will assemble everything together.\nThe focus of this session will be to create simple but very efficient Jenkins CI server which will be that final part in putting your magnificent mobile app and all of those automated tests and test frameworks together into a concerted flow."
