description: "An email in your inbox. A conversation with your boss. The company is hiring and you’re to be part of it – you’re going to be an interviewer. Maybe you get some training on the legalities, but soon enough you’re out there experimenting… with someone else’s career. Aside from the odd polite note from a candidate following up, you get no feedback so how do you know what you’re doing well – or not?\n\nIn the tech industry interviews are often particularly adversarial. The coding on the whiteboard. The ominous silence. Just because the experience was bad for you doesn’t mean you need to perpetuate that. Even if you participate in a broken system you don’t believe in, this talk will give you concrete strategies for making them part of the experience you can control better for the interviewee.\n\n\nAbout Cate Huston\n\nCate is a developer and entrepreneur. Ex-Google and IBM, an advisor to Glowforge and a co-curator of Technically Speaking."
