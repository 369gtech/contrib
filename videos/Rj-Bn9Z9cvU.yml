description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/3300ZWl\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\nDo you recall those buzz words like TDD, BDD? Yep, but we know their problems as well! \nTDD is too granular. BDD is too coarse-grained.\nUnit tests are too chatty. BDD is too abstract.\nTDD requires knowledge of implementation details. BDD does not care about implementation at all.\nWhat is in the middle? Integration tests. Let's be Integration driven then! OK, then how to build infrastructure to run Integration tests? Should we start with IaaS first? How to speed up the development and take into account non-foundational requirements like scaling, security borders, isolation, etc. from the very beginning? To answer the questions, we would combine Integration test-based development with serverless (AWS) to solve a typical business task. Based on the example, we would show how to create a solid foundation for further refactoring/refining of the overall solution and concreting it with Unit tests. \nAcceptance tests would be left for home exercise ;)"
