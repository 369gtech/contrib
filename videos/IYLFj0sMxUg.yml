description: "Presented by Jessica Suttles at JSLA (js.la) April 25th, 2013\nComputer programming was once seen as \"women's work.\" Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, Adele Goldberg, and others played pivotal roles in paving the way for today's computing professions. So why then do we see so few women in our community? I'll cover the history of women in computing, possible causes of the gender imbalance, and ideas for how our community can shape a future that includes more women.\n\nTwitter: twitter.com/jlsuttles\nGithub: github.com/jlsuttles"
