title: 'DEF CON 29 Biohacking Village - Panel - Cloud security for Healthcare and Life Sciences'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632624101
description: 'Cloud computing is increasingly used, across sectors, to scale data storage, compute, and services on demand. There are many recent examples of healthcare and life sciences cloud-based projects, including AnVIL for genomics data and the All of Us Research Program for precision medicine research. These cloud implementations include data and analytic workflows that pose added security concerns due to the sensitive nature of the information. This panel will discuss recent use cases highlighting best security practices for cloud computing in healthcare and life sciences.'
