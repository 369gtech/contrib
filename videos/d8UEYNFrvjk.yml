language: English
recordingDate: 1512475954
description: "Speaker: Scott Shaw\r\n\r\nA digital platform is a foundation of self-service APIs, tools, services, knowledge and support arranged as a compelling internal product. Autonomous delivery teams can make use of the platform to deliver product features at a higher pace with reduced coordination.\_ Increasingly, we see large enterprises building their own digital platforms in emulation of successful online businesses.\_ These platforms accelerate digital product delivery by reducing friction between teams and streamlining electronic access to core business capabilities. In this talk, I'll introduce the concept of a digital platform, explain why they accelerate delivery, provide some examples and describe the technical pillars that support the platform.\_ I'll describe the qualities necessary for platform success then focus on the key factor; managing the platform as a product. Successful products incorporate the voice of the customer in a collaborative, evolutionary design process.\_ In the case of digital platforms, the customer or consumer is an internal software developer, so developer experience (DX) becomes a critical factor.\_ To wrap up, I'll talk about the importance of having a strong platform manager and the evolving role of architects in a platform ecosystem. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Scott Shaw: As the Head of Technology for ThoughtWorks in Australia, Scott divides his time between professional services leadership and consulting.
