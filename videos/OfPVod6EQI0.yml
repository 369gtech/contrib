title: 'Bulding a reactive game engine with Spring 5 & Couchbase (Alexander Derkach, Playtika)'
recordingDate: 1504534210
description: "A social game, by it’s nature can spread very quickly to a large user audience. Since a game is typically interactive, the speed of retrieving information needed for the user’s interactions with the system is critical. Applications which exclusively rely on synchronous data access, very often hit a scalability wall, when things get slow and their thread pools are exhausted. New paradigms like reactive programming alleviate this and provide extensive tool sets to deal with the ever growing demands of web applications.\n\nThis talk:\n\n– Describes why Couchbase is the most appropriate solution for many video game and gaming use cases.\n– Shows how to build scalable and reactive applications by making use of the Couchbase Java SDK 2.x, RxJava library and Spring Framework 5."
