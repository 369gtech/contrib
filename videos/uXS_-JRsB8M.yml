description: "With the exception of some of the big players (google plus, facebook), the proper internationalization of a JavaScript application is almost unheard of. The tool chain to make this happen isn't well-known and doesn't even necessarily exist in some cases. There's a lot to consider when internationalizing an app. Number and Date Formatting, Left-to-right display, pluralization and gender aware sentences are among them. The ES6 globalization effort may tackle some of the bigger problems (like collation), but we're still on the hook to get these things right as we move towards catching up with the rest of the application stacks.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
