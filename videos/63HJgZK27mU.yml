language: English
recordingDate: 1619045029
description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nOperating Deep Learning Pipelines Anywhere Using Kubeflow - Jörg Schad & Gilbert Song, Mesosphere\n\nKubeflow makes it very easy for data scientist to build their own data science pipeline with Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow, TensorBoard and Model serving. In this talk we will walk through building a production grade data science pipeline using Kubeflow and open source data, streaming and CI/CD automation tools. Audience will learn about need for data preparation (which is frequently performed using Apache Spark or Apache Flink), data storage (using HDFS, Cassandra), automation via CI/CD (using Jenkins) and request streaming (using Apache Kafka).  In this talk we look at building and operate a complete deep learning pipeline around Kubeflow for multiple tenants and topics such as: * Data Preparation/Cleansing (using Apache Spark) * Data and Model Storage  * Model Serving * Distributed Training * Monitoring  * Automation using CI/CD  * Infrastructure Management across multiple tenants \n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuJt"
