description: "Voice interaction is now commonplace: we converse with the digital assistants on our phones and our connected home devices, and the experience is improving all the time. But how do we design experiences for voice interaction? What can we learn from the experiences of using first generation voice input/output technologies like screen readers and speech recognition tools?\n\nFull of practical ideas and interesting possibilities, this talk explores the past, present, and future of voice interaction design; and considers how to use the Inclusive Design Principles to create voice experiences that really work.- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/amuse\n\nSave the date!
