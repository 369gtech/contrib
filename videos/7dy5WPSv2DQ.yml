description: "Managing data consistency in a microservice architecture using Sagas\n\nChris Richardson\n\nThe services in a microservice architecture must be loosely coupled and so cannot share database tables. Whatâ€™s more, two phase commit (a.k.a. a distributed transaction) is not a viable option for modern applications. Consequently, a microservices application must use the Saga pattern, which maintains data consistency using a series of local transactions.\n\nIn this presentation, you will learn how sagas work and how they differ from traditional transactions. We describe how to use sagas to develop business logic in a microservices application. You will learn effective techniques for orchestrating sagas and how to use messaging for reliability. We will describe the design of a saga framework for Java and show a sample application."
