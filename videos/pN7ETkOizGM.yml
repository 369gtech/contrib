description: "Building an AI to beat pong using just the pixels of the screen as input with no hard-coded rules? Yes, its possible. We'll solve this using an approach called \"Policy Gradients\" which is even more popular than Q-learning. I'll show you how its done using a mix of animations, code, and theory. Let's beat pong!\n\nCode (and challenge) for this week:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/policy_gradients_pong\n\nAlex's Winning code:\nhttps://github.com/msoedov/q-learner\n\nAditya's Runner up code:\nhttps://github.com/avp1598/q_learning\n\nPlease Subscribe!
