recordingDate: 1632325243
description: "So you hitched a ride with your good friend, Spring Data, and have been thrown into a world you never thought possible?\n In this live-coding session, we’ll write data repositories on the fly, craft finders that traverse relationships, filter using query by example, and more. We’ll even throw in an API that WANTS to be used.\n Don’t panic! Just stick out your thumb and join this live-coding session where we’ll explore the galaxy of Spring Data together.\n\nGreg Turnquist, Principal Software Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/live-coding-spring-data-queries-to-the-end-of-the-persistence-universe\n\nCode: https://github.com/gregturn/springone-2021-live-coding-spring-data-queries"
