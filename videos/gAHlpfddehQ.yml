description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: VMware - Kubernetes Is Not Just Kubernetes – Ramp Up with These Eight Open Source Projects \n\n When was the last time you got a Kubernetes cluster up and running and said “Welp, now we’re done”? Probably never. The cluster is only one part of the puzzle. In this demo, you will see 8 open source technologies that provide different aspects of operating Kubernetes. Get a technical demo of Kubernetes automation with Cluster API, use Kubeapps and Harbor to provide easy access to new applications, utilize Antrea and Contour to improve network performance, visualize the cluster with Octant, measure conformance with Sonobouy, and save the day with Velero. There’s a lot more to Kubernetes than just the platform and VMware is committed to open source and their communities so that we can all deliver better solutions. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff22"
