title: 'Functional Reactive Programming with RxJava'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784669
description: "RxJava is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences for the Java VM. It supports Java 6+, Clojure, Scala, Groovy, JRuby, and Java 8 lambdas. In this session, learn how the Netflix API uses RxJava (techblog.netflix.com/2013/02/rxjava-netflix-api.html) to implement highly concurrent Web services against asynchronous datasources without blocking, synchronization, or thread safety concerns by using declarative functional reactive composition. Come see what functional reactive programming looks like, how it fits into Java, and what use cases it addresses.\n\n\nAuthor:\nBen Christensen\nBen Christensen is a software engineer on the Netflix API Platform team responsible for fault tolerance, performance, architecture and scale while enabling millions of customers to access the Netflix experience across more than 800 different device types.  Specializing in Java since the 90s and through years of web and server-side development Ben has gained particular interest and skill in building maintainable, performant, high-volume, high-impact systems. Prior to Netflix, Ben was at Apple in the iTunes division making iOS apps and media available to the world. Open source contributions include Hystrix (https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) and RxJava (https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava).\nView more trainings by Ben Christensen at https://www.parleys.com/author/ben-christensen\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
