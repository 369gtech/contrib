description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2018\n\nhttp://cukenfest.cucumber.io/\n\nWhat is the most important activity of Agile software delivery? Is it building the right software or learning what's the right software to build? Experienced BDD teams will say it's both, but why do we separate them? Is it possible to learn everything you need to know about the software by just building it or build working software by a pure act of learning? There is incremental design, but is it possible to design software by incremental learning?"
