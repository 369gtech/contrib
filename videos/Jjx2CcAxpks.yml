description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/teaching-tdd-to-different-learning-styles\nLearning is not \"one size fits all\". However, sometimes when we are teaching new developers in the work environment, we forget to tailor our lessons to the individual. This talk gives a brief description on the different styles of learning (auditory, visual, kinesthetic) and how to understand and accommodate these styles when introducing Test Driven Development to new developers. We will walk through how to identify a person's learning style and what techniques can be leveraged in order to create the most productive learning environment.\n\nSpeakers:\nTiffany Larson\nSenior Software Developer, HCSC\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
