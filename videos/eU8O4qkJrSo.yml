language: English
recordingDate: 1412796445
description: 'Jennier Siegal visited Google LA to speak on "Motopia Deployed: Strategies for the Language of Movement in an Age of Off-Site Construction". She discusses her project, The AERO-Mobile, a movable flexible exhibition and retail space made of recycled parts discarded by the aerospace industry. This impermanent architecture envisions buildings as a series of ULD’s (Unit Load Device) up-cycled as exhibition space platforms, mounted on electric trucks, allowing for spontaneous pop-up experiences to be deployed throughout the city center and its surrounding suburban neighborhoods. Visually engaging, the AERO-Mobile creates an individual or a communal outlet for instantaneous consumerism, complimenting and reflecting today’s world where life is anything but static. Jennifer Siegal is known for her work in creating the mobile home of the twentieth century. She is founder and principal of the Los Angeles’ based firm Office of Mobile Design (OMD), which is dedicated to the design and construction of ecologically sound, dynamic structures, utilizing portable and prefabricated architecture. She earned a master’s degree from SCI-Arc in 1994 and was a 2003 Loeb Fellow at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design, where she explored the use of intelligent, kinetic, and lightweight materials.'
