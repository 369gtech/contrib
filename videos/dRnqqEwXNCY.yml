description: "Fight fake news with cryptography & human nature\nDaniel Quinn\n\nSaturday 15th, 14:30 (Assembly Room)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nJust as journalism has taken a critical financial hit, fake news is multiplying across social networks faster than facts. The public doesn't know which stories are real any more because anyone with a laptop can forge audio & video in record time. We need to empower the institutions we trust with the ability to tie their reputations to the journalism they produce.\n\nAletheia uses cryptographic signatures + DNS to leverage existing networks of human trust in individual journalists & institutions to help link those people to the work they produce with a view to change our expectations of what constitutes journalism: if it's not verified, it's just some stranger on the internet.\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for teachers."
