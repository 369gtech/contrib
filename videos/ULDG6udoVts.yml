description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nIn this webinar, we will introduce KubeVirt and what VMs with K8s mean for you.\n\nWe’ll explore:\n1. The architecture of KubeVirt\n2. Key use cases where you can already take advantage of Kubevirt to manage legacy applications - Windows apps included! - alongside Kubernetes\n3. ‘Gotchas’, tricks and things to be aware of for different implementations\n4. How KubeVirt compares with other virtualization frameworks\n5. Future of KubeVirt, related projects, and where to start\n\nWe would show a demo of an application that is comprised of VMs, Containers, an RDBMS and a LoadBalancer-type Service. We’ll show how HA scenarios for legacy components are automatically handled by Kubernetes and KubeVirt, along with a couple cool surprises!"
