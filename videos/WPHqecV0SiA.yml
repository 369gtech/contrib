description: "These days APIs are all the craze, evidenced by the fact that everyone is building them. For most people tasked with the job though, this is their first time. And as such, questions about “how to design an API properly” are being asked everywhere I look. Of course it’s natural that we as developers seek quick and easy answers. In this talk, I make it clear that there is no golden rule to API design – instead, APIs must conform and adapt to users' needs. Using examples drawn not just from programming, but also product design and visual design, I discuss how to build an API that developers will love.\n\nSpeaker: Jakub Nesetril"
