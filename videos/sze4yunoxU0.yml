title: 'Amanda Sopkin - The Refactoring Balance Beam: When to Make Changes and When to Leave it Alone'
recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: Amanda Sopkin\n\nMany developers struggle to find the balance between striving to improve existing code and letting good enough alone by accepting certain shortcomings. As a new developer to a team it can be difficult to understand existing strategies and patterns that are sometimes flat out bad (and often openly acknowledged as such). Often the result of tight deadlines or unclear specifications, even the best developers write code they later look back upon with shudders. So how do we decide when refactoring is worth it? Come learn strategies for refactoring with minimal impact, methods for working with bad code you canâ€™t change, and strategies for knowing the difference between what is fixable and what is better left alone. \n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
