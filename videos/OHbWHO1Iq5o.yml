language: English
recordingDate: 1635529501
description: "Your app has its own data challenges. Early on you realize you need headers for all HTTP requests, you need to transform responses, and you want a busy indicator to wait for all requests to complete. The time to own and control your data flow is now. Fortunately Angular provides the right tool for this job in HTTP Interceptors with the HttpClient module.\n\nBut this problem isn't unique to Angular. How do React, Vue and Svelte developers approach these challenges? Do we even need HttpClient for Angular?\n\nLearn how you can take control of your Angular app's data flow by designing your HTTP Interceptors.\n\nng-conf is a multi-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1000's of developers from across the globe join together to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and other community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconfâ€‹ \nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
