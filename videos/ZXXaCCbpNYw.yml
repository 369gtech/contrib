description: "DOES18 Las Vegas — One of the core tenets and powerful promises of DevOps is that less-discussed category of \"CI\" Continuous Improvement. Focusing on flow, feedback loops, and safe organizational experimentation are the cornerstones of facilitating sustained CI. But for as much as we all talk about them, in many organizations and teams the outcome of continual organizational learning and improvement remains elusive. Why is that? In this talk we'll look at five \"dirty words\" that are commonly thrown around while trying to deploy DevOps—and you might even hear during incident postmortems, retrospectives, and other learning exercises—that not only make it difficult for teams to discuss learning, but promote activities and behaviors that are actually counterproductive to continuous improvement. We'll dig into why this is—it turns out we're not the only industry who struggles with it!—and look at some different language we can start using that can more ably facilitate sustainable Continuous Improvement in our work environments.\n\nThe Five Dirty Words of CI\n\nJ. Paul Reed, Managing Partner, Release Engineering Approaches\n\nJ.
