description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotsecurity.io on April 21st in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nBy 2025, quantum computers could be here. These computers enable new types of computations and could break todayâ€™s encryption systems in no time. Even worse, secret transmissions from today can be broken retroactively. It is high time for new encryption methods to protect private and top-secret data against computers of the future."
