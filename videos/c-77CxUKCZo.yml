description: "Keychain, disk encryption, Common Crypto, certificates. Security can be daunting for Cocoa developers. There are so many frameworks filled with words you’ve never heard before solving problems you don’t understand. And why does so much of it have to be in C?\n\nThe truth is that good security is hard, but the code doesn’t have to be. This session will show you how to best use the many security tools Apple provides. You’ll learn how to properly encrypt with AES, how to make the most of iOS’s device encryption features, how to best manage SSL, and more. If you’re using AES for anything, but don’t know what an HMAC is, you need to attend this session."
