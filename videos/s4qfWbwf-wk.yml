description: "The goal of this ignite talk is to make people realize that abstracting some of the complexity does not mean #NoOps. Starting with what Serverless is and is not, I will explain in which steps we need DevOps to the ultimate goal of running successful serverless applications on production.\n\nThe steps like testing, deploying, monitoring are not going anywhere. Some of the steps become a lot more difficult in Serverless environments.\n\nThe need for observability is still one of the most important things if you are running in production. Hence, you need proper logging, distributed tracing, monitoring, and alerting. Also, security is still a top concern while new challenges like cold start adding extra complexity to Serverless environments.\n\nhttps://2018.london.serverlessdays.io/speaker/serhat-can"
