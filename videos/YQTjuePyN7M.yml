In addition, he has won numerous awards and honours based on his brilliant work within the Computer Science field! This includes SIX Honourary Doctorates over the years and his Knighthood back in 2000. He is now the principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge and Emeritus Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Oxford University. \n\nInterview Date: 07.11.2018\nRead the full transcript here: https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/let-s-talkconcurrency-with-sir-tony-hoare.html"
