description: "Many organisations rely on strategic systems that are becoming harder and harder to maintain. The company is unhappy because features are taking longer to be built and they cannot react fast enough to market demands. Developers are unhappy because the code is messy and negatively affects their productivity. Testers are unhappy because of the volume of work and the impossible task of guaranteeing the quality of the software. Clients are becoming disenchanted because of the lack of quality and low frequency of updates. \n\nStrategic software cannot become a burden to the organisation â€“ they need to remain strategic and continuously enable business agility.\n\nIn this talk for the Agile Singapore Community and the Agile Vietnam Community Sandro Mancuso, Co-founder of Codurance, described a strategic approach to software modernisation that allows business and technology to work together towards a common goal.\n\nTo know more about our Software Modernisation service, please visit https://www.codurance.com/services/software-modernisation ."
