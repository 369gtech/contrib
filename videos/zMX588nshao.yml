title: 'BDD all the way down - Enrico Campidoglio'
recordingDate: 1383644215
description: "In this session I'll show how to apply the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) cycle when developing a feature from top to bottom in a fictitious.NET web application. Building on the concepts of Test Driven Development, I'll show you how BDD helps you produce tests that read like specifications, by forcing you to focus on what the system is supposed to do, rather than how it's implemented.\n\nStarting from the acceptance tests seen from the user's perspective, we'll work our way through the system implementing the necessary components at each tier, guided by unit tests. In the process, I'll cover how to write BDD-style tests in plain English with SpecFlow, in JavaScript with Jasmin and in C# with MSpec. In other words, it'll be BDD all the way down.\n\nSpeaker Enrico Campidoglio is a programmer who combines a strong passion for quality with a mild OCD. He has spent a little over the last decade in the Microsoft and Java camps, striving for simple and expressive code that clearly communicates its intent. He's also a technical trainer and a speaker, who regularly presents at conferences and user groups about various topics, such as OO design, unit testing and tools.\nIn his spare time Enrico contributes to AutoFixture, an open source library for .NET that helps alleviate some of the friction experienced when doing Test-driven development by making it easier to generate test data.\n\nEnrico works at tretton37 and can be contacted through his blog or on Twitter @ecampidoglio."
