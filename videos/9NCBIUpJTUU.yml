title: 'CON1606 - Thinking, Fast and Slow, with Software Development'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450130580
description: "In the international bestseller Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman explains how we, as human beings, think and reason and, perhaps surprisingly, how our thought processes are often fundamentally flawed and biased. This session explores the ideas presented in the book in the context of professional software development. Along this journey, the presentation also shares techniques, processes, and models that can help overcome some of the identified limitations of our decision-making abilities. Topics discussed include the “availability heuristic,” which can lead developers to choose the “latest and greatest” technology without proper evaluation; “optimistic bias,” which can blind architects so they can’t see the “unknown unknowns” within a project; and more.\n\nSpeaker:\nDaniel Bryant, Principal Consultant, OpenCredo\nDaniel Bryant is a Principal Consultant at OpenCredo, a software consultancy and delivery company dedicated to helping our clients deliver better software faster. Currently Daniel specialises in enabling agility within organisations, typically by introducing better requirement gathering and planning techniques, focusing on the relevance of architecture within agile development, facilitating continuous integration/delivery, and introducing 'DevOps' methodologies. In his spare time Daniel is a keen programmer and leader within the London Java Community (LJC), where he acts as a mentor and assists with organising meetups and hackdays. He also contributes to several open source projects, is a member of the official OpenJDK Adoption group and contributes to the Java Community Process (JCP). Daniel enjoys teaching and sharing ideas, and regularly presents at international conferences such as JavaOne, Devoxx and QCon."
