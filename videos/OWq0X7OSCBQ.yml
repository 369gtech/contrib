description: "The Spotify Story: Moving from NIH to an Active CNCF Community Member - Jim Haughwout, Spotify \n\nFour years ago, at Spotify, we built and managed the majority of our infrastructure ourselves. We managed our own data centres. We built our own time series database. We built our own orchestration technology (ironically releasing it the same week as Google did Kubernetes). Today our world is very different. We serve over 200 million monthly users from a cloud provider. We are a CNCF member. We have more than doubled our open source initiatives in the last two years. In this talk, Jim Haughwout--Head of Infrastructure & Operations at Spotify--will talk about Spotify’s path on this journey, including how it’s “Build Infrastructure Together” strategy is helping build infrastructure faster and lower adoption costs. He will also share the challenges has Spotify faced on this continuing journey, and some early learnings that may help other CNCF member companies. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPZY"
