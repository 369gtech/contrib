description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/modernizing-the-legacy-how-dish-is-adapting-its-soa-services-for-a-cloud-first-future\n\nLike many companies, Dish has a large number of SOA services that have been built using previous generations of technology. In this session we will discuss the challenges faced in converting legacy services to cloud native applications and the different approaches we considered for resolving the conflicts. We will then dive deeper into the approach that we chose to modernize our services and put us on a track towards a microservices based architecture running on Cloud Foundry.\n\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeakers: Rob Bennett; Director, Development, Dish Networks; Chandra Nemalipuri; Principal Software Engineer, Dish Networks; Lax Rastogi; Senior Manager, Dish Networks"
