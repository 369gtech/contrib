description: "Intro: Harbor - Henry Zhang & Steven Ren, VMware \n\nAs container technology become widely adopted in the industry, how to manage containerized applications poses new challenges to platform engineers. One of the challenges is to securely and efficiently manage containerized application packages with either container image or Helm Chart format. Project Harbor is an open source trusted cloud-native registry project that stores, manages, signs, and scans content, thus resolving common image or Helm Chart management challenges. In this presentation, we will focus on the management of container images and Helm Charts through Harbor. We will review and provide solutions to the challenges faced by organizations, including RBAC (Role Based Access Control), vulnerability scanning, large scale content distribution, content replication, content trust (notary) and DevOps integrations etc.. Real world use cases will be discussed in the session. Of course, fantastic demos will be shown to let you easily understand the related use cases. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPhp"
