description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 19 - http://bit.ly/37xc3Nr\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nDECOMPOSING CONTAINER TOOLS - ABOUT SWISS ARMY KNIVES AND CONTAINERS\nby Valentin Rothberg\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nNo \nOne-size-fits-all \nSolutions\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nOne-size-fits-all solutions come at a price. In this talk, I present four open-source container tools dedicated to specific use-cases:\n \n - CRI-O, a Kubernetes runtime\n \n - Podman, for managing pods and containers\n \n - Buildah, for building containers\n \n - Skopeo, for distributing container images\n \nAll tools are collaboratively developed across the industry and distributions and are built on top of the same libraries, allowing for seamless integration, compatibility and interoperability. Live demos demonstrate how they can cover an entire life-cycle: from local development to migrating to production.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/valentin-rothberg/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - VALENTIN ROTHBERG\nContainers are Linux\n\nValentin is an engineer in Red Hat's container runtimes team, focusing on and maintaining various open-source projects such as Buildah, Podman, Skopeo and CRI-O. He contributed to many other projects in the containers landscape such as Kubernetes, the Linux kernel, Moby, Google Cloud, container-diff and more. Prior to working in the industry, Valentin has been working in academia researching and teaching operating systems and their development.\n\nMore on Valentin Rothberg: https://codesync.global/speaker/valentin-rothberg/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
