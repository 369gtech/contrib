Let me entertain you with my journey to build an Erlang client as a part of a globally distributed feature management platform by LaunchDarkly. We'll start with an overview of how feature flagging works, including architecture of LaunchDarkly service. Then we'll focus on building an Erlang application, covering non-trivial role LaunchDarkly SDK clients play as a part of a distributed feature flag database. We'll draw parallels to other languages for extra fun too.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/zurab-davitiani/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ZURAB DAVITIANI\nFeature flagging enthusiast, wrote an Erlang/Elixir SDK client for LaunchDarkly.\n\nZurab started programming as a kid on an Olivetti 286 laptop running DR-DOS. Since then he has worked anywhere from startups to large corporations, accumulating an extensive experience creating, and leading teams to create, web applications and services. Currently a software engineer at LaunchDarkly, Zurab loves challenges brought by concurrency and distributed systems.\n\nMore on Zurab Davitiani: https://codesync.global/speaker/zurab-davitiani/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
