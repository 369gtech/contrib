description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nNotary v2: Redesigning the Secure Supply Chain for Containers - Justin Cormack, Docker, Steve Lasker, Microsoft, & Omar Paul, Amazon \n\nThe Notary v2 project was launched at Kubecon North America in 2019, as a joint community effort to resolve issues with the first generation Notary, which was launched five years ago. Since then we have learned a lot about how containers are used in practise and the security requirements, and Notary v2 builds on that experience from the whole community. The protocols are OCI registry native and designed to improve the supply chain security of the whole container ecosystem. This talk gives an overview of the progress, and the problems being solved, and then a deep dive into the state of the specification and implementations. We also cover current open issues and the road to production. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekIB"
