title: 'GopherCon 2021: Tom Lyons - Rethinking How We Test Our Async Architecture'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639794105
description: 'Asynchronous architectures are becoming increasingly common in industries that require processing large amounts of data, but many systems fall short when it comes to actually testing how services handle that data. In this talk, Tom will discuss how the team at CrowdStrike is able to reliably test async services, and how they do it live, in production, with production data.'
