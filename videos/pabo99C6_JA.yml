title: 'Using F# on Azure Functions in Production - Nikolai Andersen'
recordingDate: 1499244314
description: "In this talk I'll show a real world example of running F# on Azure Functions. By consuming several APIs in a deployment pipeline we have created a service that generates informative changelogs between environments. I want to show you how easily you can do the same.\n\nUsing the power of F# Type Providers we'll create a new project, integrate with three external systems and deploy to Azure Functions in under an hour. We'll go all the way from the drawing board to running in production. Be prepared for some live coding.\n\nThe presentation does not assume any prior familiarity with F#, Type Providers or Azure Functions."
