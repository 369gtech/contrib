First, you will train your skills with user intents and entities, and will design conversations using Oracle’s new conversation designer. Next, you will create your own digital assistant and add existing skills to enrich its functionality. Finally, you will publish the digital assistant to a messaging application – all within two hours!\n\nLinks Needed for this workshop:\nLab Guide: http://bit.ly/labguide-1117\nSet Up Digital Assistant: https://bit.ly/da-setup\nFree Trial: http://bit.ly/trial-1117\n\nIf you have questions, please email cloudcoach_us_grp@oracle.com\n\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/"
