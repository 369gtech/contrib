description: "Keynote presented by Lajos Lange, Head of Online Development, Axel Springer; Matthias Naber, Software Engineer, Axel Springer; and Tore Sagstuen, CTO, FjordIT.\n\nIn order to ensure diverse, independent and high quality journalism in the future there is a need to rethink the classic publisher business while IT has to become part of the core products. On the way to digital transformation, we have to adapt to agile methodologies, and historically grown, complex infrastructures have to be reinvented in order to speed up the development process. With Cloud Foundry, we realized our vision of an innovative, fully automated service delivery platform by accelerating the time and quantity to market rate and reducing IT costs at the same time. The service oriented nature of the PaaS approach enables a modularization strategy for applications. We will discuss how Cloud Foundry's capabilities helped to establish a culture of prototyping in combination with continuous delivery and business intelligence in order to form minimal viable products."
