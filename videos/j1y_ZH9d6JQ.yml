title: 'The Wix Way of Doing Product  From User Pains to End Solution'
recordingDate: 1624972913
description: 'Let’s start with exploring the reasons why we decided to change the product’s onboarding. We’ll take you down to the Wix Way of product thinking and elaborate on such pivotal questions as: “Why change?”, “What are the issues we want to solve?”, “Why are they important?”. We’ll also touch on the UX-research, and the iterations of the product flow that we conducted.'
