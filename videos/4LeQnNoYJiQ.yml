description: "This a video of Loic Hoguin's talk at London Erlang Factory Lite http://www.erlang-factory.com/ .  Also worth seeing Loic's article & code here\nhttp://ninenines.eu/articles/ranch-ftp\n\n\nThe Ranch TCP acceptors pool allows rapid development of network applications. But how fast is it really to write such an application and implement a protocol? How should the protocol be implemented? What are the traps to avoid?\n\nThis presentation will be a live demonstration of the implementation of an FTP server from scratch up to a working state using Ranch, binary pattern matching and a nice French accent.\n\nTalk objectives: Learn how to use Ranch, Learn how to implement a text protocol using binary pattern matching.\n\nTarget audience: Network programmers and people willing to witness the incredible productivity that Erlang can offer."
