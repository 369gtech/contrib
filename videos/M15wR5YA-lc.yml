description: "Spring I/O 2018 - Barcelona, 24-25 May\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/meistermeier/time-to-graph-up-with-spring-data-neo4j\n\nSpring Data's upcoming release train Lovelace will also include a new version of Spring Data Neo4j (SDN). A good time to show the advantages of using the convenient approach of Spring Data to work with connected data and introduce the technology that powers SDN: Neo4j's Object Graph Mapper. Both libraries can help to improve the insights you can gather when working with data stored in a graph database. A small ride through the Paradise Papers with Spring Data Neo4j will show you some of these benefits."
