title: 'Building the Next Generation of Airlines Websites - Iv√°n Olivares (Globant)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1606803406
description: 'To talk about the future of the airlines, we need to understand the present. Today, large airlines have legacy systems that become an obstacle in the evolution of their business, this based mainly on the highly complex processes that they inherited from that, bringing a long onboarding for new developers and high complexity for new features with a long time to market, in many cases due to technical debt that accumulates in each "digital evolution". In this talk, you will see the challenge that Globant stars in 2019 to create a 100% digital airline, a project where Next.js was the key tech-enabler to an accelerated launch.'
