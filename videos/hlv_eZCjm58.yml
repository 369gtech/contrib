description: "Fatema Boxwala, University of Waterloo\n\nRepresenting the next generation of engineers, interns are integral to a sustainable SRE team.

Unfortunately, there is very little information out there about what this really looks like. I’ve known students who after an internship chose to leave tech entirely, and other who were inspired to start a career in operations. In this talk, you’ll hear about how you can set your intern up for success with concrete steps and examples.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
