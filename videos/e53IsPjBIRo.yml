description: 'Alpla is a global manufacturer of plastic bottles, used for product packaging by Unilver, Lâ€™Oreal, Coca Cola, and many other popular consumer brands. In this session, you will learn how they are using real-time data, generated by hundreds of sensors on each of their product lines across 170 factories, to increase equipment efficiency. We will explain the stack from sensors to database to dashboard, and how it is being scaled 24x7 on Docker Enterprise.'
