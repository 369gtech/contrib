description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nTutorial: Manage Apps and Cloud Resources in Unified Approach with Kubernetes - Jianbo Sun, Alibaba & Jared Watts, Upbound \n\nHow easy is it to use cloud resources alongside with your Kubernetes applications? Actually, provisioning cloud resources and consuming them by the k8s apps is never an easy game. We usually need to struggle in creating cloud services one by one in different cloud product consoles and configuring them separately. Essentially, cloud and k8s are two different systems, interoperability is the missing part. In this tutorial, audience will walk through a unified and standard approach to manage apps and cloud resources. We will do an end-to-end workshop from modeling a distributed app which consumes various cloud resources in unified definition, to practices like dependency management, service binding, and cost management for the cloud. GitOps tool, Crossplane and OAM will be the main open source technology we use in the workshop. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekFl"
