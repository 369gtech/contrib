description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nI find a program much more valuable when I can read it and understand the abstractions that collectively explain a theory of the problem and solution.
