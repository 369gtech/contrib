description: "Customizing Your Windows Experience - Pick Your Own Journey - Guna Vijayaratnam & Rick Ross, Pivotal\n\nCloud Foundry provides users with a great deal of flexibility in terms of customizing the Windows experience (at the IaaS or Application) on the platform. There are several layers where this customization can be accomplished - through Bosh managed Windows releases or the actual Windows containers that host the applications.\n\nSome of the areas that customers typically have a need to customize include:\n\n1. Managing additional Windows services thats running on the actual VM.\n2. Customizing frameworks that developers need to run their applications.\n3. Managing 3rd party add-ons that are necessary to the telemetry and monitoring of their applications from an enterprise monitoring tool.\n\nIn this talk, Guna and Rick will cover strategies for accomplishing each of these tasks with a brief example of how they can be accomplished. \n\nAbout Rick Ross\nRick Ross works at Pivotal as a Advisory Platform Architect where he helps Fortune 500 companies transform the way they build, deploy, run and operate their applications.
