description: "I've created a study plan to help anyone succeed in a programming interview! I've compiled it using my own interviewing experiences at tech companies in Silicon Valley, the experiences of my friends who currently work at Big N tech companies, and multiple advice columns from the cscareerquestions subreddit. It's a 10 step process and should take you anywhere from 2 to 4 months to complete on the side, assuming you are a full-time student or have other work. There are free online tools to aid you in every step of the process, you just have to know what they are and how to use them.
