description: "Push notifications on the web can be a force for good, but is that how they are coming across? We'll take a look at how push notifications permissions are being implemented and how we can do it better. We'll then look at the notifications themselves, find out what the best kind of notifications are and how not to wind up with your app's, or the entire web's, notifications blocked forever.\n\nJSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
