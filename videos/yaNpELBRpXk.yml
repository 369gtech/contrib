description: "UX Research in Gaming:\nBeing able to iterate and reiterate fast is key when it comes to UX. You might apply every single UX rule you know, but that doesn’t mean it’ll work out the way one might expect or hope, especially in games.\n\nWorking closely with a UXR team to validate a design at an early stage is important and time-saving. Also, making sure that a UX design works both on PC and console might require a different mindset and be able to look at the same problem from two directions.\n\nNathalie has been working on the Battlefield franchise for 6 years. She started out as a UI Software Engineer and moved over to UX design 3 years ago. Understanding technical limitations while designing features as well as working closely with UXR, gives her a head start when challenged with new design problems.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nNathalie Ek is a UX Designer / Software Engineer at DICE working on Battlefield, http://twitter.com/Nat0_o\n\nAbout the conference:\nThe theme of The UX Conference on September 7th 2018 in London was collaboration between designers and researchers with speakers from Microsoft, Dropbox, Facebook, Tobii, BBC, McLaren Applied Technologies, Google, Hotels.com, Dice and Power of Uke.\n\nThe conference is organised by The School of UX and made possible by all of our amazing partners from Balsamiq, Space Between, Usabilla, and InVision. Giveaway prizes were kindly provided by A Book Apart, Axure, Loop11, Overflow, Proto.io and Hotjar.\n\nMore details at http://theuxconf.com"
