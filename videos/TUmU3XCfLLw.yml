description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nErlang was originally designed to control telephony switches at Ericsson which, by definition, are embedded systems. Somewhere along the line the application area changed dramatically and now Erlang is being used to tackle challenges which involve gratuitous amount of parallelism and \"The Cloud\".\n\nThe Internet of Things is the physical extension of cloud which describes how everyday objects around us will become sources of data that will transform our daily lives. Analysts forecast the number of Internet connected devices to reach 50 billion within the next decade, which signifies that we need to think of new ways to architect these new generation of connected devices.\n\nThis talk will demonstrate how, by creating a layered architecture for hardware modules and partitioning up complex systems in smaller units, testing becomes easier, runtime errors are contained and the architecture becomes maintainable. Using Erlang processes as compositional units to describe these systems is a new proposal which stands out and challenges conventional approaches."
