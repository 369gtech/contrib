description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nIntro to gRPC - Abhishek Kumar, Google \n\ngRPC is a modern, open source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. Distributed systems and client-server applications are built using gRPC because it provides simple abstractions for application-layer communication, coupled with a broad and powerful feature set. A wide range of languages and platforms are supported by gRPC. Join us for this session to hear about the gRPC project, how you can use it in your applications, and how to get involved as a contributor or maintainer!\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zew6"
