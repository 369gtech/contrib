description: "http://g.co/gtac2013\nSlides: http://goo.gl/wb3nm\n\nTao Xie, North Carolina State University\n\nThis talk presents Pex4Fun (http://www.pexforfun.com/), which leverages automated test generation to underpin automatic grading in an online programming system that can scale to hundreds of thousands of users. It provides a programming-oriented gaming experience outside of the classroom, training users to learn various programming and software engineering skills, including testing skills such as writing parameterized unit tests. Pex4Fun makes a significant contribution to the known problem of assignment grading, as well as providing a fun learning experience based on interactive gaming. Pex4Fun has been gaining high popularity in the community: since it was released to the public in June 2010, the number of clicks of the \"Ask Pex!\" button (indicating the attempts made by users to solve games at Pex4Fun) has reached over one million as of early 2013."
