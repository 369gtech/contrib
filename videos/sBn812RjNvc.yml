recordingDate: 1481790629
description: 'Reactive programming is a paradigm oriented around data flows and propagation of changes. Kotlin is a programming language intended to be a better Java, and it''s designed to be usable and readable across large teams with skill and discipline variances. Despite its object-oriented building blocks, Kotlin fits well in the functional reactive programming landscape. In this essay, I will deep-dive into the most relevant aspects of FRP in Kotlin focusing on the advantages that everyone can get when using this approach to build an Android app.'
