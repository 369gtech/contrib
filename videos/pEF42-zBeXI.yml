In monolithic systems, we depend on traditional tools that report per-process resource usage and latency characteristics that are limited to a single process. In order to be able to collect and analyze resource utilization and performance characteristics of distributed systems, OpenCensus tracks resource utilization through the chain of services processing a user request.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/iliia-khaprov/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ILIIA KHAPROV\nOpen source software enthusiast\n\nIliia started as a C# and .NET developer and then moved to Common Lisp and the Erlang ecosystem.
