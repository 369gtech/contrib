language: English
recordingDate: 1510141205
description: "In this talk we will give an overview of the challenges involved in deploying a Spring Boot app on Kubernetes. How do you deploy the web app and a database together? How do you configure your app with the database password? We will take a look at what's needed to deploy Spring Cloud Data Flow server on Kubernetes, both for testing and for a real production deployment. We'll also discuss using Helm for app deployments.\n\nThomas Risberg is a member of the Spring team at Pivotal contributing to Spring Cloud Data Flow and related projects. Thomas joined the Spring Framework project in 2003, initially contributing enhancements to the JDBC framework portion. Thomas is co-author of \"Spring Data, Modern Data Access for Enterprise Java\" together with Mark Pollack, Oliver Gierke, Jon Brisbin and Michael Hunger published by O'Reilly Media in 2012 and co-author of “Professional Java Development with the Spring Framework” together with Rod Johnson, Juergen Hoeller, Alef Arendsen, and Colin Sampaleanu published by Wiley in 2005.\n\nSee also https://github.com/trisberg/devoxx-spring-boot-k8s/blob/master/demo-hello.adoc"
