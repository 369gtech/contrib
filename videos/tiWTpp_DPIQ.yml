title: 'Enter Integrant:  A Micro-framework for Data-Driven Architecture (James Reeves, 2017)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636121376
description: "Ever used Integrant? Come and join James Reeves for an introduction to Integrant and explore how it works, why it takes the approach it does, and what benefits there are to using Integrant in your own applications.\n\nIntegrant is a recently released alternative to the popular Component and Mount micro-frameworks. These tiny frameworks provide a way of managing applications that are made out of smaller, dependent components. They also decouple the lifecycle of your application from the lifecycle of your REPL, which allows you to avoid the time-consuming process of restarting your REPL during development.\n\nIntegrant builds on the concepts Component introduced when it was released three years ago. Like Component, Integrant defines a way of building an application out of smaller parts, but unlike Component it does so through a configuration data structure. This approach was developed from work on the Duct framework, and was inspired by concepts in Arachne."
