title: 'Rosa Gutierrez - The recurring nightmare. Implementing cross platform in-app subscription purchases'
recordingDate: 1472051861
description: 'We make money out of a subscription model and we want to allow users to subscribe from their mobile devices without leaving our app. Most app stores (iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, Windows Phone Store) let us offer in-app recurring purchases in exchange for a percent of the price but that doesn''t come without headaches. Unlike most one-time in-app purchases the backend piece is critical for subscriptions. Trials, expirations, renewals, hacking attempts... In this talk we''ll see an overview of what to consider when handling different stores and some quirks and annoyances we''ll need to deal with.'
