description: "Over 600 Million Members and Hundreds of Micro Services: How We Scaled Our Monitoring System to Keep up\n\nMahak Lamba, LinkedIn\n\nBehind our platform serving over 600 million users, there is an ever scaling infrastructure comprising of hundreds of servers running in different geographic locations and hosting a multitude of services including database services like Espresso, streaming services like Kafka, offline jobs and ML ranking services, written across various languages like Java, Python, and Go. To keep up with these ever growing member and infrastructure needs, we need to scale our monitoring systems accordingly, in order to efficiently deliver a seamless user experience. But is this possible using the existing tools and technologies that exist?\n\nThis talk will focus on the scale that we operate at, the challenges we faced while scaling our monitoring system and a 360-degree view of how we monitor our microservice architecture.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
