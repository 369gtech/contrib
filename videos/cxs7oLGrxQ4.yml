title: 'From Dependency injection to dependency rejection - Mark Seemann'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492498933
description: "In object-oriented design, dependency injection is a well-known design pattern, although it's a complicated solution to the problem of decoupling. Functional programming offers a simpler way.\nThis talk examines dependency injection in object-oriented design, and explains how it's not required (nor desired) in functional programming. You'll also learn how a proper functional design eliminates the need for mocks and stubs in unit testing, enabling you to entirely reject the notion of dependencies.\n\nYou don't need to know Haskell or F# to attend this session; relevant syntax will be explained just-in-time. Object-oriented examples will be in C#."
