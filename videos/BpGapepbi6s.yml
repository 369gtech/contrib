title: '#FOSSBack: Chris Coleman - Introducing the Clinic for Open Source Arts'
recordingDate: 1614694498
description: 'The Clinic for Open Source Arts (COSA) is focused on the health of open source creative tools. We look at communities, access, innovation, and sustainability to help new projects emerge, strong projects grow, and unstable projects change. COSA does this work through training, supporting, guiding conversations, and sharing community wisdom. This short talk will introduce the organization and what we have been up to over the first 2 years.'
