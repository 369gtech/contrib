description: "Implementing a good architecture in our mobile apps is really useful because the code is more robust and testable, easier to extend, and to reuse.\n\nI have shared my own interpretation of the clean architecture with many teams around the world, both as an instructor and as a consultant, and one of the questions that I get more often when the people gets familiar with the basic piece of the architecture is \"what is the best way implement concurrency in this architecture?\"\n\nEven if you haven't implemented a Clean Architecture variant in your app yet, you can enjoy the session, because I will provide some context on how I propose to do the basics.\n\nIn this session I will share with you my views on the constrains for that implementation, the different \"tools\" that we can use (protocols, closures, Rx...), where to use those tools, and show real code that implements them.\n\nThis is a must go if you are into advanced architectures for mobile apps. Join me for this one!\n\nKey takeaways\nProvide background on how to implement an advanced architecture in an iOS app written in Swift\nUnderstand the two typical scenarios: backend (frameworks) and interactors.\nUnderstand the alternatives to implement it: protocols\nSee some implementations using the different alternatives and learn advantages and disadvantages of them.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
