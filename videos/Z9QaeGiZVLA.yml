recordingDate: 1493218784
description: "As a site builder, have you ever encountered a wireframe or design that’s caused you to take pause and wonder, “how am I going to build this thing?” I have. In fact, it’s been my experience that there’s rarely a clear-cut solution for producing a Drupal layout that’s both complex in arrangement and easy to edit.\n\nWhen you find yourself at this crossroads, it’s important to have a broad understanding of the many tools available that will help meet your goals as a site builder and your clients’ goals as an editor.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll cover the differences, use cases, and advantages/disadvantages of a variety of layout options:\n\nBlocks\nContext\nDisplay Suite\nPanels\nPanelizer\nParagraphs\nTwig templates\nWYSIWYG / CKEditor templates\nPractical Examples:\n\nI’ll walk through layout decisions I’ve made on a couple of production Drupal 8 sites.\nWe’ll also analyze a real design and talk through the pros and cons of different build plans.\nQuestions we’ll address along the way:\n\nHow will my site building decisions impact a frontend developer?\nWill the content be straightforward for an editor to maintain?\nShould this layout offer flexibility or a standardized viewing experience?\nAfter attending my session, you’ll be better equipped to create a Drupal 8 layout that makes most sense for both you and your clients."
