description: "Graph Networks are extremely useful tools to help understand the graph data that's all around us. In this episode, I'm going to explain what some of the latest advancements in graph networks are and how you can leverage them to build your own graph network in a few lines of Python code. This space has matured so much that there is never a single library to discuss, there are always multiple competing options (which is a great thing). We'll be weighing the pros and cons of the Deep Graph, Graph Nets, and PyTorch Geometric library as well. I'm particularly interested in Graph Networks because of how well suited they are for interpreting the most complex biochemical factory that we know of - the human body.
