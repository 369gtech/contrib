description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - No one knows that the floppy disk means save. At least, that''s what the campus librarian insisted when she reviewed the website I worked on for her university. I had done research on just this issue, proving that over 100 college students could identify what the floppy disk meant, and though I beamed with excitement as I showed her this, it wasn''t enough. New students are always coming in, she said, much younger than the ones I polled. So I went back and surveyed 526 high schoolers to find out definitively: Do teenagers understand the outdated tech in our icons? The survey says yes.'
