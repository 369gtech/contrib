description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nDisaster Recovery of Stateful Applications in a Multi-Cluster Environment - Orit Wasserman & Shyamsundar Ranganathan, Red Hat\n\nHave you ever wondered how to provide for disaster recovery of the state stored in your persistent volumes? What needs to happen to recover the workload on an alternate kubernetes cluster? How can the state be replicated and workloads recreated to use their replicated volumes? Our talk aims to elaborate on the various issues around recovering a workload and its state, in a multi-cluster and a multi region environment. We will demonstrate how replication capable storage systems, such as Ceph/Rook, instead of higher level tools, can be leveraged to provide disaster recovery of workloads across clusters. In addition this session will tease out features required in a multi-cluster control plane, to enable one-click disaster recovery solution for stateful workloads. Attendees will learn how to approach building disaster recovery solutions for their own clouds."
