description: "Ward Bell only writes business applications with Template-Driven Forms. Contrary to prevailing wisdom and the Angular documentation, Template-Driven Forms are as capable as Reactive Forms for the most sophisticated, reactive business applications and they are much easier to read, write, and maintain.\n\nOver the last three years, we developed a complex payroll application of over 200 Template-Driven components that serves tens of thousands of users. We neither used nor missed any feature of Reactive Forms.\n\nIn this session,  he will demonstrate the superiority of Template-Driven Forms in a variety of so-called “advanced”, real-world scenarios. He will leave you with the companion stackblitz sample to enjoy on your own.\n\nIf you’re fond of Reactive Forms, carry on. If you’re feeling guilty because you use Template-Driven Forms, hold your head high knowing that you’ve chosen wisely.\n\nng-conf is a multi-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1000's of developers from across the globe join together to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and other community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf​ \nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
