description: "The Node ecosystem is thriving. But the more popular an ecosystem, the more interesting it looks to attackers. Let's look at the current state of security in Node. We'll talk about some of the interesting security improvements in Node in the past year. Drawing on original research, we'll also look at the frequency of vulnerabilities in npm packages, which types of vulnerabilities are the most frequent and the roles that enterprises, package owners and package managers all play in keeping Node.js secure.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNodeJS Interactive 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nTim Kadlec, Snyk\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with its permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14IJEjTcG9g"
