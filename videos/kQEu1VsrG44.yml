description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Europe 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nKirk Pepperdine - Kirk knows more about the JVM than most of the engineers that actually build it do\n\nABSTRACT\nWhen developers and operations are asked what their biggest performance bottleneck is, Kirk finds that it is rare that memory inefficiency comes up as an answer.\nUnfortunately, this runs counter to the observation that 60% of all applications are memory-inefficient.\nQuite often this memory inefficiency hides as lower application throughput and longer, more frequent tail latency events, meaning that other things often take the blame. In this talk, Kirk will look at the telltale signs that your application is in that 60% and the steps you can take to attack [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:12 Demo\n04:15 What is your performance trouble spot?\n11:57 War stories\n13:19 Allocation site\n16:39 Java heap\n20:12 Problems\n22:22 Pause vs. occupancy\n23:56 Reducing allocations\n25:21 Demo\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/2020/sessions/1461/memory-efficient-java\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Java #JVM #MemoryEfficiency #MemoryInefficiency #Programming\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
