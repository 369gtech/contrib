description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\ngRPC Easy - Richard Belleville, Google \n\ngRPC is a modern, open source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems. Getting your micoservices talking to one another should be as simple as \"import antigravity\". Come hear about the latest developments in gRPC's Python bindings that make getting up and running easier than it's ever been. This talk will cover running services without generating code and simplifications in channel management.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZexG"
