description: "This un-polyfillable / un-transpilable feature now has first class support in all the latest browsers and node.js\nBut what is it even?\nAnd why do I need it?\n\nLet's take a closer look at this mysterious new metaprogramming feature with some useful, abuseful and just plain fun uses of ES6 Proxy, including things like:\n\n   - Data relations and object population\n   - Safe objects (cannot read property 'x' of undefined no more!)\n   - Debugging and testing\n   - Validation and guarding\n\nMetaprogramming can be both fun and useful!"
