description: "More and more developers are writing unit test. And that's really great. They are a great way to ensure code's correctness. But writing test after is often difficult : code may not be testable, \"it works, why bother with test. Let's do real stuff !\",... Testing first could be a solution to those problems. TDD goes further. Unit tests do not only test the code, they become a tool to design a better, cleaner and safer code.\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
