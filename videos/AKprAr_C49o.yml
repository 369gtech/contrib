description: "As a biomimicry expert I believe in changing in an organic way by empowering people. When we talk about agile, we talk a lot about culture and how to create a culture of continuous improvement. All to serve our clients best and to become an agile and sustainable organization. But how to make sure the agile transition is and will stay a success? How to make it a sustainable change? Nature is agile and sustainable for 3.8 billion years. In this talk I will take nature as our agile teacher. Where do we find agility in nature and how can she teach us to become more agile. I will use some great examples of e.g. ants and bees, but there is more we can learn. I will also provide some examples (e.g. Dutch Railways) where I used nature as source of inspiration to lead an agile transition.\n\nAbout the speaker: Mark has first-hand experience leading large organizations through the agile, DevOps and Continuous Delivery transformation. He provides the training and services companies need to successfully harness agile, DevOps and Continuous Delivery as a self-organizing force that becomes part of a companyâ€™s product development culture.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/markheistek/"
