description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation Conference 2019 https://jsnation.com\n\n# Controlling a swarm of drones with NodeJS\n\nWe're pretty used to drones flying around us by now. Until now most of these drones were still controlled by a human operator. But what if we could control them solely using our code? In this talk I will show how to control multiple drones using JavaScript. With the help of Node.js we'll send commands to the drones and read back their telemetry. I will talk about the difficulties of flying and keeping control of a drone completely without human interference. In the second part we will actually send the drones flying and I'll ask two audience members to participate in a small 'drone' game."
