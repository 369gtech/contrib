description: 'In this lecture, we give some insights how Nauto, a Palo Alto based startup, solves the challenges of building an IoT platform collecting and processing data from thousands of connected devices collecting data from within cars and other types of vehicles. We describe how Nauto utilizes these visual and sensor data streams by using a combination of on-device and cloud-based Deep Learning approaches to make driving safer and fleets smarter.'
