title: 'Webinar: Kubernetes and storage. Kubernetes for storage. An overview'
language: English
recordingDate: 1594925211
description: "Originally designed for stateless workloads only, over the last two to three years, the growth of stateful workloads on Kubernetes has been rapid. Today it is common to see monitoring, logging, e-commerce, CI/CD, ML, and other workloads running on Kubernetes. In this webinar, the community leader and chief architect of the CNCF project OpenEBS, Kiran Mova, will explain Container Attached Storage, an approach by which per workload storage is enabled by Kubernetes itself. A brief overview of Container Attached Storage alternatives will be shared including a summary of performance data. Lastly, a brief demo of how Container Attached Storage from the OpenEBS is being operationalized with the help of other open-source software and services will be presented.\n\nPresenter:\n\nKiran Mova, Chief Architect at MayaData and core maintainer of OpenEBS @MayaData"
