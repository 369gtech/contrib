description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nEXOP ON STREAMDATA\nby Andrey Chernykh\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nProperty-based testing\nStreamData\nInspiration\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nI'd like to tell a story how I was inspired by Andrea Leopardi's talk. Property-based testing is a mindset he gave at ElixirConfEU 2018 in Warsaw, Poland, and what is ExopData as the result of this inspiration.\n\nThe audience will find out what are Exop and StreamData with a brief description of these libraries. Next, I'm going to provide the idea behind ExopData, how it was started and evolved, which tricky moments we've faced during the implementation. And how ExopData can help you with data generating or property-based testing.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/andrey-chernykh/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ANDREY CHERNYKH\nFull-time Elixir developer for the last 2 years, OSS enthusiast, medium.com-writer.\n\nAndrey started as C# developer more than 10 years ago, with C# he took the path from junior developer to team lead position. After doing enterprise stuff, Andrey switched to Ruby. Andrey had been working with Ruby on various projects for years when he decided to add new programming language for concurrent, distributed systems into the toolbox.\n\nHe considered Scala, Go, Erlang ... and finally noticed Elixir. Elixir made the same wow-effect as Ruby when Andrey had first switched to it from C#. Andrey had found what he'd been searching for!\n\nAndrey works with Elixir on a daily basis and has done so for the past two years. Andrey's created a number of services which work in production, he contributes to open source (exop, express and other), writes articles on Medium and enjoys Elixir every single day. Andrey is very keen on clean, maintainable code and the DDD principle.\n\nMore on Andrey Chernykh: https://codesync.global/speaker/andrey-chernykh/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
