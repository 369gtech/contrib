description: "Speaker Info:\r\nMichel Beaudouin-Lafon\r\nUniversité Paris-Sud & Stanford University\r\n\r\n\r\nBio:\r\nMichel Beaudouin-Lafon is Professor of Computer Science at Université Paris-Sud (France) since 1992 and was director of LRI, the laboratory for computer science (280 members including 100 faculty and 125 Ph.D. students), from 2002 to 2009. Michel has worked in human-computer interaction for over 25 years and was elected to the ACM SIGCHI Academy in 2006. His research interests include fundamental aspects of interaction, engineering of interactive systems, computer-supported cooperative work and novel interaction techniques. His current research is conducted in the In Situ group, a joint lab between LRI and INRIA (http://insitu.lri.fr) and at Stanford University where he is spending a sabbatical year. Michel founded AFIHM, the francophone association for human-computer interaction, and has been a member of the ACM Council and the ACM Publications Board.\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nCreating the next generation of interactive systems requires experimental platforms that let us explore novel forms of interaction in real settings.\r\nThe WILD room (http://www.lri.fr/~mbl/WILD) is a high-performance interactive visualization environment for exploring the notion of multi-surface interaction. WILD combines an ultra-high resolution wall display, a multitouch table, a motion tracking system and various mobile devices. Our target users are scientists who are confronted with massive amounts of data, including astrophysicists, biologists and neuroscientists. I will describe the design trade-offs and lessons learned during the development of this platform with respect to hardware, interaction, software engineering, and participatory design of applications."
