description: 'Explore the trials and tribulations of introducing Chef, and DevOps into a well-oiled enterprise machine. This talk will dissect the result of fast business growth, the organization of separate technology stacks, and the problems with management of complex systems. Finally, we will dovetail into how a tiger team of seven works with development, systems, and operations to solve this spiderweb of changes with a little spice.'
