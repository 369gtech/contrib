description: "The concept of CSS variables has been around for a while but just recently most modern browsers actually started to support them. I always knew that something amazing would happen and that this feature would allow things beyond our imagination.\n\nWhile the use case for variables might be very obvious the features are often underestimated. Variables in CSS allow behavior that was previously not possible. Looking at every detail and reading the specs carefully can deliver some interesting facts. I found awesome but also scary possibilities and created examples for any use case I could think of.\n\nIt turns out that CSS variables are a real \"Game changer\" with one mind blowing feature after the other.\n\nYou want to interact between CSS and JS, you're looking for a layout framework, or simply want to reduce your code base? CSS variables cover all these cases and a lot more.\n\nSlides: http://slides.com/gregoradams/css-variables-are-a-game-changer\nAbout Gregor: https://github.com/pixelass\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
