description: "Jeanne Boyarsky\nDeveloper\nCodeRanch\n\nSetting up a tool stack for one project is “easy.” Setting it up at scale, not so much. Many CI/CD tools provide a way to write code to automate common tasks. This talk will introduce Java developers to using Groovy for this purpose. Examples will include live scripting for Nexus and Jenkins. Whether you use these tools or others, you’ll come away with ideas for automating and comfort with basic Groovy."
