title: 'KotlinConf 2017 - Real World Kotlin-Powered Android by James Williams'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510747766
description: "Kotlin has been picking up steam as the preferred way to make Android apps; bringing a wealth of features to Android development including: null safety, data classes with automatic property accessors/modifiers, first-class functions, and lambdas. Even with all those clear benefits, starting from scratch can be intimidating.\n\nIn this session, we convert a running Android app written in Java to Kotlin bit by bit.\n\nJames Williams works as the Android Curriculum Lead at Udacity where he has created Android and Web development courses and leads the development of Android content. When James is not learning new tech, you can find him rolling around in the mud at an obstacle course run."
