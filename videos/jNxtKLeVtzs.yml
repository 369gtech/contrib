title: 'YOW! 2014 Matt Barrett & Lee Campbell - Event Driven User Interfaces'
recordingDate: 1514388336
description: "Real-time reactive user interfaces need to scale from handling dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of updates per second, to changes in data on a daily or weekly basis, as well as handling input from users. This means that literally everything is a stream of data.\n\nWe will discuss how the trading applications we’ve built make extensive use of reactive extensions to compose these streams to provide real-time, correct information about the state of the market, and the system. We’ll talk about the internal architectures of real time trading applications built to handle this sort of complexity.\n\nMatt has been built reliable, scalable systems in both television and financial services, and has seen the similarities and differences in their approaches to reliability and functionality. He has been using Reactive Extensions since 2010, and has been building real time trading systems with it since then. He co-founded Adaptive Financial Consulting, which specialises in building real-time systems that need to deliver data quickly and reliably.\n\nLee is a software consultant, developer and author with extensive experience in concurrent programming, composite applications and integration technologies. He has experience developing composite applications for the Financial Services sector from the Buy side, Sell side and Retail banking.\n\nHe specialises in building Trading applications in WPF and Rx, and currently is a consultant for Adaptive.\n\nLee is also the author of the 5-star rated book Introduction to Rx.\n\nFor more on YOW!
