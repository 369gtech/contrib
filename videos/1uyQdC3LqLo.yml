description: "Today we're going to look at aXe Coconut, the leading edge of the aXe developer toolchain. You can think of aXe Coconut kind of like Chrome Canary or Firefox Nightly. It's a preview channel for developers to test out new versions of the library and offer feedback before they hit the stable version. One of the coolest features in the latest version of aXe Coconut is the ability to inspect Shadow DOM! This is huge for anyone doing Web Component accessibility testing. Today we'll walk through inspecting a media player created with Shadow DOM and show off some of the new audits made possible by aXe Coconut.\n\naXe-Coconut by Deque: https://goo.gl/k85bPE\n\nShadow DOM explainer: https://goo.gl/nsGeHc\n\nWatch all A11ycasts episodes: https://goo.gl/06qEUW\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers YouTube channel for updates on new episodes of A11ycasts: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
