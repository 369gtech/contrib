description: "O'Reilly Strata Online Conference\nMoving to Big Data\n\nEveryone buys in to the mantra of the data-driven enterprise. Companies that put data to work make smarter decisions than their competitors. They can engage customers, employees, and partners more effectively. And they can adapt faster to changing market conditions. It's not just internal data, either: a social, connected web has given us new firehoses to drink from, and combining public and private data yields valuable new insights.\n\nUnfortunately for many businesses, the information they need is languishing in data warehouses. It's accessible only to Business Intelligence experts and database experts. It's encased in legacy databases with arcane interfaces.\n\nBig Data promises to unlock this data for the entire company. But getting there will be hard: replacing decades-old platforms and entire skill sets doesn't happen overnight. In this online event, we'll look at how Big Data stacks and analytical approaches are gradually finding their way into organizations, as well as the roadblocks that can thwart efforts to become more data-driven.\n\nPart 2 - Web Analytics: The Enterprise Gateway Drug to Big Data?\nSpeaker: Justin Cutroni (Cardinal Path)\n\nMany organizations are already using powerful Big Data analysis tools, which collect information from thousands of sources and store them in shared, NoSQL-based data systems. They just don't realize it.\n\nWeb Analytics tools have come a long way since their early days counting page views and visits. Today, nearly any event, regardless of what device it happens on, can be collected and analyzed with speed and precision. While analytics is still predominantly the domain of web analysts and the marketing team, there's no reason these tools can't also be used to track call center times, retail store traffic, social media mentions, and more.\n\nIn this session, Analytics expert and O'Reilly Author Justin Cutroni will look at how analytics tools have changed. Using the example of Google Analytics, which can collect information from almost any device or program that can generate an HTTP request. He'll show how, with a well-defined data extraction API, the information can easily be ported to other tools for integration and analysis. He'll look at how analytics tools can be put to work beyond the website, in effect becoming many companies' first taste of Data Warehousing and BI, and address some of the challenges associated with using a traditional web analytics tool as a massive data collection platform."
