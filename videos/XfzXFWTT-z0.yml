title: 'Extending JavaScript Libraries from ClojureScript - Kevin Lynagh'
recordingDate: 1357585589
description: 'Kevin will discuss using the D3 JavaScript data visualization library from ClojureScript. In particular, using macros to construct a ClojureScript fa√ßade that implicitly coerces types and allows one to naturally extend jQuery-style chained syntax. He will also discuss miscellaneous ClojureScript tips and rough edges, and compare ClojureScript with CoffeeScript and more traditional JavaScript functional-mixin libraries like Underscore.js.'
