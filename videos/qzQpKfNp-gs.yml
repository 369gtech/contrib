description: "Public Enemy once said “Don’t believe the hype”, so it’s easy enough to take the concept of “conversational bots” and dismiss them like many of the other hyped-up technologies with the attention span of a tweet. We can now order pizza by messaging with a bot, who cares? But let’s stop and consider bots conceptually as a new interaction model, conversation. With a new perspective, we may find that bots are the next generation of interaction (Facebook, Slack, Google, Snapchat, & Skype believe it is already here), as well as lead to our eventual extinction (ok, maybe we’re being slightly hyperbolic…).\n\nIn this session, we will start by looking at why now is the time for us to consider designing & building bots, how we should conceptually design them and what makes a good or lame bot. Then we will talk about tools we can use to build simple bots that can give us baby otter pics to complex bots that use machine-base AI that can recognize your emotions. If you are looking at a new way of engaging online, then you have to check out this session.\n\nNotes:\nhttps://github.com/fitcevents/webu-2016/blob/master/The%20Humans%20Are%20Dead%2C%20We%20Are%20All%20Bots%20Now.md\n\nFITC produces events for digital creators in Toronto, Amsterdam, NYC and beyond\nSave 10% off any of our events with discount code 'youtube'\n\nCheck out our events at http://fitc.ca\nor follow us at https://twitter.com/fitc"
