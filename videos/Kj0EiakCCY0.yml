description: "Have you been wanting to add some smarts to your castle, but you're concerned about getting locked into an expensive closed system? Getting started doesn't need to be expensive and it definitely doesn't need to be closed. Grab a Raspberry Pi and let's set up OpenHab, an open source solution for empowering your castle (smart home.) I'll discuss some of the features and capabilities of OpenHab, demonstrate installing it on a Raspberry Pi 2 and walk through the built-in control interface. Having a castle is good, but a cloud castle is awesome. I will demonstrate how to connect OpenHab to a cloud database using a restful interface. I will create the data structures and interface then modify my installation of OpenHab to take advantage of the new data store. You'll leave this session with the tools to track the data in your own IoT projects and hopefully some new ideas.\n\nSpeaker: Blaine Carter"
