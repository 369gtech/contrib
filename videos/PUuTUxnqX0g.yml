title: '"Don’t eat my data - 30+ years of storage war stories" - Steven Ellis (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1578987170
description: "Steven Ellis\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/109/\n\nWe are in an era of explosive data growth, with everything from cat pictures to NASA’s incredible archive of space photography, and this all needs to be stored and catalogued in a reliable and easily accessible form. How can we safely store/backup/manage this data across  a diverse range personal devices, never mind the challenges of enterprise class scale out storage, with the occasional (rain) cloud along the way?\r\n\r\nWe’ll start off with a bit of history on data storage formats to set the scene, and then dig into some stories from the last 35+ years of Steven’s own journey in IT, with some names changed to protect the “innocent”.\r\n\r\nThemes covered will include\r\n    Getting physical\r\n    Bits, Bytes, Blocks and Blobs, with a file or three\r\n    Performance sanity tests\r\n    Hardware Raid - pain or pleasure?\r\n    File-system selection and why checksums matter\r\n    Going mad with MDADM (part 2)\r\n    DRBDont\r\n    HA NFS aren't the droids you're looking for\r\n    Vacuum Cleaners and Dehumidifiers\r\n    Raid is not a backup, and erasure coding isn’t about data deletion\r\n    The cloud is just someone else’s SAN\r\n    When physical disks trump flash storage\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
