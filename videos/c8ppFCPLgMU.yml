description: "While launching a container may look simple, changing the complexity of systems at scale running via containers can result in significant issues. Kubernetes, a production-grade container orchestrator, is designed to support teams deploying containers at scale with multi-cloud support.\n\nIn this talk, Ben will share his experience of how Kubernetes supports container-based deployments, with a focus on deploying existing Windows-based applications. Topics will include:\n\n- Migrating applications to Windows Containers\n\n- Introducing Kubernetes and the Cloud Native eco-system\n\n- Deploying applications to Kubernetes\n\n- Deploying and managing the Kubernetes infrastructure\n\n- Integrating process into a CI/CD pipeline.\n\nBy the end, attendees should understand the approaches to take and potential problems when moving applications to containers and deploying them onto a Kubernetes cluster."
