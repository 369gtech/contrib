description: "From the 2016 Design Conference in San Francisco, a conversation between Tim O'Reilly & Mike Bracken on design's role in government websites.\n\nAbout Mike Bracken (Co-operative Group): Mike Bracken is chief digital officer for the Co-operative Group, the largest mutual cooperative in the world. Previously, he was executive director of digital and chief data officer for the UK government from July 2011 to September 2015. Mike was responsible for transforming public sector services to a “digital by default” model by building and championing a digital culture that puts the user first and delivers the best, low-cost public services possible. Prior to joining the government, Mike worked at Guardian News & Media as digital development director for nearly four years, cofounded e-democracy site My Society, and was a director/shareholder at technical services company Wavex.\n\nAbout Tim O'Reilly (O'Reilly Media): Tim O’Reilly has a history of convening conversations that reshape the industry. In 1998, he organized the meeting where the term “open source software” was agreed on and helped the business world understand its importance. In 2004, with the Web 2.0 Summit, he defined how Web 2.0 represented not only the resurgence of the Web after the dot-com bust, but a new model for the computer industry, based on big data, collective intelligence, and the Internet as a platform. In 2009, with the Gov 2.0 Summit, he framed a conversation about the modernization of government technology that has shaped policy and spawned initiatives at the federal, state, and local level and around the world. Tim has now turned his attention to the implications of the on-demand economy, AI, and other technologies that are transforming the nature of work and the future shape of the business world. He is the founder and CEO of O’Reilly Media and a partner at O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures (OATV). He is also a founder and board member at Maker Media, which was spun out of O’Reilly Media in 2012, and a board member at Code for America, PeerJ, Civis Analytics, and POPVOX.\n\nWatch more from the 2016 Design Conference: https://goo.gl/eZxddk\nVisit the O’Reilly website: oreilly.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
