title: 'Adrienne Tacke – Documentation: The Missing Pieces'
recordingDate: 1626347493
description: "Most documentation, technical tutorials, and quick demos are written in a certain way. But for the true beginners, the career-transitioners, or those crossing domains? That technical content is certainly not written for them! Funnily enough, these same shortcomings affect “technical” people too, especially when it comes to learning something new.\n\nIn this talk, I’d like to explore the ways we can make our documentation better by considering more kinds of people. We’ll discover common oversights and assumptions most documentation has built-in by default and learn how to fix them. We’ll also strengthen our technical writing skills to ensure, to the best of our ability, that every anticipated reader of our documentation never feels lost or frustrated.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you’ll leave and never write documentation in the same way again…and that’s a good thing!\n\nSpeaker:\nAdrienne Tacke – https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/member/adrienne-tacke-0\n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/documentation-missing-pieces"
