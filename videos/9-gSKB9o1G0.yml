description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2018\n\nhttp://cukenfest.cucumber.io/\n\nI will talk about Lehman’s categories of software systems. I find Lehman’s categories a useful tool that helps me understand the dynamics of software projects, design software architecture, and guideways of working. I’ll illustrate with stories from recent projects."
