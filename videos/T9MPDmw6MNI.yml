description: "Production is where the money is made and where customers are satisfied - but only as long as our application is up, running and responsive. If our application is down or latent, it's worthless - and even worse, we loose money and reputation.\n\nThis is a real challenge in today's complex, distributed and highly interconnected application landscapes and availability can no longer be handled solely on infrastructure level but needs to be addressed on application level - and concepts like cloud computing or microservices make it even more challenging.\n\nThat's what resilience is about: how to design applications that they are highly available and responsive - even in the face of unexpected failure and load situations.\n\nIn this session you will learn a (small) resilience pattern language organised around some of the core principles of resilience, including many useful tips and tricks."
