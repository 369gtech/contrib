title: 'An AI with an Agenda: How Our Cognitive Biases Leak Into Machine Learning - Arthur Doler'
recordingDate: 1558526370
description: "In the glorious AI-assisted future, all decisions are objective and perfect, and there’s no such thing as cognitive biases. That’s why we created AI and machine learning, right? Because humans can make mistakes, and computers are perfect. Well, there’s some bad news: humans make those AIs and machine learning models, and as a result humanity’s biases and missteps can subtly work their way into our AI and models\n\nAll hope isn’t lost, though! In this talk you’ll learn how science and statistics have already solved some of these problems and how a robust awareness of cognitive biases can help with many of the rest. Come learn what else we can do to protect ourselves from these old mistakes, because we owe it to the people who’ll rely on our algorithms to deliver the best possible intelligence!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
