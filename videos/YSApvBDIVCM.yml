description: 'Follow me as my passion for motorcycles, goes head first into my passion for computers, and I build tools and software to reverse engineer my motorcycle''s CAN system. Python scripts, microcontrollers, pulse width modulation, some potentiometers, and a bit of what I like to call “Ruthless Engineering”, has helped me finally reach the pinnacle of CAN bus packet reversing. We’ll cover some engine simulation, execute some packet capture session analysis, and put it all back together again, for the development of an aftermarket gauge cluster.'
