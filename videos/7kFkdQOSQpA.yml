description: "Not too long ago, applications could focus on feature functionality alone and be successful. Today, they must also be beautiful, responsive, and intuitive. In other words, applications must be designed for user experience (UX) because when they are, users are far more productive, more forgiving, and generally happier. Who doesn't want that? In this session learn about the psychology behind what makes a great UX, discuss the key principles of good design, and learn how to apply them to your own projects. Examples are from Oracle Application Express, but these principles are valid for any technology or platform. Together, we can make user experience a priority, and by doing so, win the hearts and minds of our users.\n\nSpeaker: Shakeeb Rahman"
