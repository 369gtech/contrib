title: 'Drinking a river of IoT data with Akka.NET - Hannes Lowette'

description: "You can’t develop a device any more without it connecting to something. These ‘smart’ devices all have one thing in common: they generate a never-ending stream of data. If you want to process all that data for 100, 1000 or 10000 devices, you can probably get by with a very simple web stack. But as soon as you want to scale to 1000000 or more devices, you’re going to need a better strategy.\n\nScaling software is always tricky. We all have been through this. You load balance your web farm only to find out that your database is a bottleneck. Or to find out you need to synchronize caches across your farm, etc. Akka.NET and its implementation of the actor model make scaling a bit easier. Developing stateful code becomes a breeze, as well as scaling it and making it resilient. But there are pitfalls as well.\n\nNo prior Akka.NET knowledge is required.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
