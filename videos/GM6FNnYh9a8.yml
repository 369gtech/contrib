description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012.\nSpeaker: Craig Walls\nIn the modern web, user interfaces are expected to be rich, highly responsive, and available anytime, anywhere, and on any device. Round-trip server-side HTML rendering doesn't fit the bill any longer and numerous JavaScript frameworks have stepped forward to simplify development of client-side user-interfaces. With so many great options available, we now face a paradox of choice and it can be difficult to decide which UI framework best suits our needs.\n\nIn this session we'll explore a handful of the most popular client-side UI frameworks, including Backbone, Knockout, Sammy, and Spine (and others) weighing their strengths and weaknesses and helping decide which framework is most suitable for a given set of UI goals."
