title: '"Allegro" Means Both Fast and Happy. Coincidence? - Andrei Alexandrescu'
recordingDate: 1568890944
description: "In all likelihood, sorting is one of the most researched classes of algorithms. It is a fundamental task in Computer Science, both on its own and as a step in other algorithms. Efficient algorithms for sorting and searching are now taught in core undergraduate classes. Are they at their best, or is there more blood to squeeze from that stone?\n\nThis talk will explore a few less known – but more allegro! – variants of classic sorting algorithms. And as they say, the road matters more than the destination. Along the way, we'll encounter many wondrous surprises and we'll learn how to cope with the puzzling behavior of modern complex architectures.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
