description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCase Study: Developing and Scaling Kubeflow’s Web Apps - Andrey Velichkevich, Cisco & Kimonas Sotirchos, Arrikto\n\nAt this moment, Kubeflow maintains at least 5 different web apps, for managing Notebooks, PVCs, Tensorboards, Models, AutoML Experiments, that allow users to interact with the platform. At their core these web apps act as a graphical interface for performing CRUD operations on top of K8s Objects and Custom Resources. Designing, creating, and maintaining these apps is not a trivial task. In this talk, attendees will learn how the Kubeflow community overcame all the challenges to create true cloud native web apps, for managing ML workflows on top of K8s. Follow our journey as we explore the architectural decisions we made regarding authentication with Istio and authorization with K8s SubjectAccessReviews. How we factored out the common code and enabled application scalability. The UX decisions for managing K8s objects via a GUI. And last but not least, how we can efficiently fetch new data for Kubeflow dashboard in the context of how users can perform advanced AutoML techniques."
