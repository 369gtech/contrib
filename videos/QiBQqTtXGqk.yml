title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Skeletor Scaffolding: Architecture & DevOps for Progressive Decoupling'
recordingDate: 1506604385
description: "Progressive decoupling comes with the best of both worlds for modern Drupal instances: the performance of traditional web documents and the experience of progressive web applications. But how do we get these two systems to play along with each other in the same code base?\n\nEnter Skeletor, an open source scaffolding system based on Drupal and React best practices. Come see how you can build, test, and deploy a progressively decoupled Drupal site running multiple react applications throughout. One team, one code base, one build! This presentation is perfect for Developers looking for simple ways to introduce progressive decoupling into an existing site, and DevOps looking for ways to streamline a decoupled build process.\n\nIn this session, participants will learn:\n\nHow to use and extend the Skeletor system to create a progressively decoupled site\n\nHow to use continuous integration to build Drupal and React from the same code base.\n\nHow to use JSON Schema to test for data consistency.\n\nHow to build a test suite for React components within Drupal architecture."
