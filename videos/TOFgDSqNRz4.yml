description: "http://velocityconf.com\nHTTP Archive is a treasure trove of performance data. Wouldn't it be nice if you could query it with own questions and build custom reports? This demo will show you how to do exactly that, live and from the comfort of your browser, using Google BigQuery!\n\nIlya Grigorik\nGoogle\nIlya Grigorik is a developer advocate and web performance engineer at Google. He spends his days and nights working on making the web faster and building and driving adoption of performance best practices.\n\nPrior to focusing on web performance Ilya was the founder and CTO of PostRank, a social analytics company which was acquired by Google and became the core of social analytics reporting within Google Analytics.
