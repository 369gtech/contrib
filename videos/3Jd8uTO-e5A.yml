description: 'In this talk, we’ll discuss how we think about building tools and services to help each of these users be more productive and work better together. Specifically, we’ll explore how we’re working with our most advanced users to democratize complex techniques for less-technical people. From exploratory and open-ended tools designed to allow rapid exploration of data and optimization of processes to specialized tools designed to allow deep-dives into a single, complex problem-space, our strategy is to provide our users with a catalog of products that they can rely on to make informed decisions. Data science is not just for data scientists anymore! - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/crunch'
