description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nHarbor is an open source container image registry that secures images with role-based access control, scans images for vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted. A CNCF Incubating project, Harbor delivers compliance, performance, and interoperability to help you consistently and securely manage images across cloud native compute platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.\n\nIn this webinar, Harbor Core Maintainer Michael Michael and CNCF TOC Chair Liz Rice will walk you through the benefits of running your own registry, concentrating on some of the new functionality that lets you extend Harbor with pluggable third-party scanners. The webinar will show you how to deploy cloud native apps with the confidence that Harborâ€™s scanning abilities help enforce compliance and protect you from vulnerable packages."
