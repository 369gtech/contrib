language: English
recordingDate: 1449578951
description: "Although modularity support as part of Project Jigsaw/JSR 376 is the largest language change coming in Java SE 9, this session discusses many other improvements also slated for JDK 9 in the Java programming language and related tooling. On the language front, some polish has been added to the Project Coin features and the number of uninformative compiler warnings has been reduced. The javac tool can now accurately cross-compile to older platform versions, and improved engineering of attribution better supports type inference. Javadoc is getting a search box, a new modernized doclet API, and HTML 5 support. The jshell command is an interactive tool for exploring and using Java APIs. The presentation demonstrates usage of these and other features in NetBeans.\n\nSpeakers:\nJoe Darcy, Member of the Technical Staff, Oracle\nJoe is a long-term JDK engineer and previous JavaOne Rock Star speaker. Joe's work has ranged from Java numerics, to release management of OpenJDK 6, to leading Project Coin, to most recently being technical lead of JDK infrastructure.\n\nVicente Romero Zaldivar, Senior Member of the Technical Staff, Oracle\nCompiler engineer at Oracle. Leader and main developer of the Tiered Attribution project. Worked on the implementation of javac8 which introduced lambdas, method references and default methods, among other features, to the Java language."
