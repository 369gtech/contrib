description: "Javassist makes Java bytecode manipulation simple. ZeroTurnaround uses Javassist a lot to implement integrations for its tools. Integrating different Java solutions turned out to be the bread and butter for Javassist. It enabled the company to integrate its solutions with third-party software even if the existing code wasn’t designed for integration. This session goes through examples of how you can apply Javassist to alter applications’ behavior and do all kind of fun stuff with it. Why is it interesting? Because while you’re trying to do unusual things in Java, you learn much more about the language and the platform itself, and learning about Javassist will actually make you a better Java developer.\n\nSpeaker:\nAnton Arhipov, Product Manager, ZeroTurnaround\nAnton is a product manager at ZeroTurnaround, working on XRebel, the Java profiler for web applications.
