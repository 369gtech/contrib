description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune, 16 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAttend this session and learn how you can prevent today's most significant data security vulnerabilitiesâ€”the kind that leave businesses open to fraud that ranges from capturing tens of millions of credit card numbers to stealing money from bank accounts to constructing next-generation botnets. We'll review how cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion and SQL injection attacks work and discuss their impact on Web 2.0, AJAX, mashup and social networking applications. We'll present industry-wide statistics on security vulnerabilities, cover emerging security trends and discuss the current state of security education. Then we'll tell you how to defend against security attacks and how to modify your software development process to achieve security, and we'll recommend certification programs, books and organizations that can help you secure your applications.\n\n\n\nSpeaker: Neil Daswani\nNeil Daswani has served in a variety of research , development, teaching, and managerial roles at Google, Stanford University , DoCoMo USA Labs, Yodlee, and Bellcore (now Telcordia Technologies).
