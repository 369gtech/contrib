description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nBuilding Reusable DevSecOps Pipelines on a Secure Kubernetes Platform - Steven Terrana, Booz Allen Hamilton & Michael Ducy, Sysdig \n\nOnboarding development teams can often be the critical point in determining if a team will adopt modern Cloud Native and DevSecOps practices. If there is too much friction for developers to build, scan, and test their applications or to secure their application environments then these best practices are often pushed aside. In this talk weâ€™ll cover how we automated the creation of a trusted software supply chain. Through a live demonstration, we will show how this approach accelerates adoption by allowing developers to inherit a preconfigured pipeline performing various security tests (and underlying tooling) as well as safeguards (via the CNCF Sandbox project Falco) put in place to monitor production workloads for security problems. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaWr"
