language: English
recordingDate: 1531904471
description: "Focused on a top-down approach, it covers the main layers where a software architect or performance engineer must be involved by revealing performance design principles, tactics, patterns, algorithms, strategies, operating system and hardware level optimizations. Each of these layers are detailed by offering suggestions and examples (including some performance tests) for the audience regarding what it really matters and what should be avoided when designing for performance.\n\n \n\nMain topics:\n\ndesign principles\ntactics, patterns, algorithms, strategies\noperating system\nhardware\nAlso few benchmark comparisons will be shared (e.g. IO Scheduler: cfg/ noop/dedline; HDD/SSD/RamFS, memory access patterns and BigO notation) in order to prove which approach is better."
