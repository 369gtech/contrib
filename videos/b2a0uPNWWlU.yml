description: "On March 4, 2017, FITC hosted another Spotlight event, this time focusing on ReactJS. The event was sponsored and brought to you by Nulogy.\n\nWithin a matter of a few years, we saw Reactâ€™s popularity and adoption rates skyrocket and its ecosystem evolve into a world of its own. Where did this all begin? And what makes React so great to result in this tremendous growth and success? How does one navigate through its massive ecosystem?\n\nHaris Mahmood\nFront End Developer, Shopify\nhttps://twitter.com/harismahmood89"
