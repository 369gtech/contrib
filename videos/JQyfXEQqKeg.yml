Many stream compute algorithms require trailing data in order to compute the intended result. One example is computing the number of user logins in the last 7 days. This creates a dilemma where the results of the stream program are incomplete until the runtime of the program exceeds 7 days. The alternative is to bootstrap the program using historic data to seed the state before shifting to use real-time data. This talk will discuss alternatives to bootstrap programs in Flink. Some alternatives rely on technologies exogenous to the stream program, such as enhancements to the pub/sub layer, that are more generally applicable to other stream compute engines. Other alternatives include enhancements to Flink source implementations. Lyft is exploring another alternative using orchestration of multiple Flink programs. The talk will cover why Lyft pursued this alternative and future directions to further enhance bootstrapping support in Flink.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
