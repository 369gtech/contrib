description: "DevOps Dojo: A Massive Internal Coaching Program\n\nOlivier Jacques, IT Distinguished Technologist, DXC Technology\nSlawek Zachcial, IT Manager, DXC Technology\n\nWe are 3+ years in our DevOps journey. With pockets of awesome in 2014, and an important DevOps rollout across the early adopters in 2015 - where we measured the benefits - we came to the point where we needed to embark the rest of the organization. \nThe talk goes through the state we reached with the early adopters in 2015, how we came with an initial DevOps Dojo setup - which was largely inspired from DOES 15's Target talk, how we composed a scalable coaching program with a mix of white/green/black belt DevOps dojos - and what they are, how we use the Dojo program to identify change agents which in turn can also coach others and grow the \"can do\" crowd, and finally benefits we have seen as we scale this.\nWe will share few slides, lots of pictures, a-ha moments as we iterated in creating such a program, actual facts, and how we are trying to find the right balance between culture, processes and tools.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
