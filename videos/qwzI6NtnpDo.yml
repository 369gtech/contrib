description: "SAP’s DevOps Journey as told by Darren Hague, Cloud Infrastructure Architect at SAP during the DevOps Enterprise Summit in London 2016. http://itrevolution.com\n\n\nDarren Hague - SAP’s DevOps Journey: From Building an App to Building a Cloud\n\n\nSAP has been using a DevOps & Continuous Delivery approach for building its web and mobile apps for several years, and is now building and running a global cloud at the scale needed to support the digital transformation needs of its customers. This talk recaps the story of how SAP originally adopted DevOps practices before moving on to describe how the Cloud Infrastructure Services team is building and operating its 3rd generation cloud automation system using microservices, containers and open-source software.\n\n\nDarren talks about the important tools and technologies and what is most important: the people.\n\n\nSAP is the world leader in Enterprise Applications with over 300,000 customers in 190 countries. Nearly half of their 78,000 employees are in technology.\n\n\nIn 2010, SAP started to pivot to DevOps with a small project and have since grown to a cloud scale.\n\n\nShare this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwzI6NtnpDo&list=PLvk9Yh_MWYuzAfazAe6m8uE-_lVvshjX6&index=7\n\nShare your experience with DevOps or DOES16 in the comments below."
