description: "Optimized for speed and agility. Diversity and scale. Ambitious blue sky research coupled with a driving application. Because we don’t believe in false choices.\n\nProjects that integrate our physical world with our digital lives… that connect us with our humanity and leave us with a sense of wonder. Fabrics that interact. Radars that sense. Platforms that are modular. Computers with a new vision. A feast for your eyes and ears in 2D, 360 and VR.\n\nATAP + developers + commercial partners… showing the world that the seemingly impossible is possible.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
