recordingDate: 1510141205
description: "Last year we demonstrated why open blockchains were such a big deal and the kind of opportunities they opened with our talk titled \"Why you should really care about the blockchain\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQVxbPqlBkE). This year, we are going to take you with us on a journey to create and develop your first decentralized application on the Ethereum blockchain. Setting up your development environment, developing your first smart contract, unit testing it, deploying it to various instances of the chain, creating a user interface for your app, you will do it all.\n\n# Sebastien Arbogast\nSebastien started his career as a Java software consultant, with a strong focus on productivity. He was a strong advocate of Model-Driven Architecture before discovering Groovy and Grails. Then he also started developing iOS applications, and in 2011, he created his first startup, Kodesk. After learning a lot as an entrepreneur, he co-created the NEST'up startup accelerator program and coached several startups on the Lean Startup tools and techniques. In 2016, he created the ChainSkills initiative with Said Eloudrhiri to educate people about the power and techniques of open blockchains as a development platform.\n\n# Said Eloudrhiri\nSaid has started his career in 1992. As an IT Consultant, he was involved in several missions as a developer, Team Leader and Agile coach. As a co-organiser of the Wajug, Said helps in the organisation of talks for IT professionals.
