description: "Marketing automation is a buzzword that some people struggle wrapping their head around. During my speech, I will show you how easy it is to get started with automated processes. I will also show you how difficult it can be to do it properly. I would like to prove to you that it is not the technological aspect that is most crucial but the organisation and effort you would like to put in that garners the real success. I will also give you useful tips based upon several marketing automation processes that I have recently managed. \n\nThe speech took place on 9th May 2019 on Marketing Stage during Infoshare 2019."
