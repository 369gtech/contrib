title: 'DEF CON China Party 2021 - DEF CON Culture - Dead Addict'
language: English
recordingDate: 1617868399
description: 'In this highly structured rant, Dead Addict will discuss the history of DEF CON culture, and the hacker culture from which it emerged. While some people associate DEF CON with ‘infosec’, when DEF CON began there wasn’t an infosec industry. There were hackers, phreakers, misfits, civil libertarians, crypto-anarchists, and pirates gathered together to make friends and enemies, create and solve problems, and party until dawn. This is our story, or at least one version of it.'
