description: "Take instructor-led Live class on Java Tutorial at : \n http://www.edureka.co/java-course\n\n\nThe following topics were covered in this Java Tutorial:\n\nSql Basics, Databas, JDBC Connection, Insert query, Update query, Delete Query and Sql functions.\n\nDatabase:\nDatabase is a collection of data in an organized way so that we can update, modify data present in database easily. You can update it, modify it, insert rows, delete rows in your database and you can manage your database easily. Data stored in database is permanent until you delete the database. Oracle, MySQL, MS-Access, DB2, Sybase are the different databases available.\n\nWhy do we need database? - Database is used to store and whenever required it will retrieve data from database and use it in your application.\n\nHow to store data in database?\nData will be stored in \"Tables\" in database in the form of \"Records\". One by one you will add rows to the table. Each row is called a record. Table is a collection of relational data in 2D i.e in the form of rows and columns. i.e first we create a database and then create a table in that, later store data in the table.\nSQL ( Structure Query Language):\nSQL is a language used to access and modify the data stored in database. It uses statements to access the database. All the things like insert data into database, retrieving data from database, updating and deleting can be done using SQL statements. SQL Statements can be divided into two types: DDL, DML\nDDL (Data Definition language):\nDDL statements are used for creation or deletion of database. The commands present in DDL are: Create, Alter, Drop.\n\nDML (Data Manipulation Language):\nThese statements are used for managing the data in database. The commands present in DDL are: Insert -- to insert the values in the table of database. We use \"insert\" keyword for this.\nUpdate-to update the record or column in the table by specifying the condition so that the database knows where to update. We use \"update\" keyword for this.\nDelete - to delete the record(one or many) in the table by specifying the condition so that the database knows which record to be deleted. We use \"delete\" keyword for this\nSelect -- to retrieve the records from the table. You can retrieve either all the columns or specific columns of the table. You can apply conditions while retrieving records. We use \"select\" keyword for this\n\nHow to write a program in jdbc?\nRegister the Driver i.e connecting to DSN that you have actually created.\nConnecting to database i.e we use an object of connection interface and establish connection\nCreate SQL statement in java i.e create statements and prepared statement\nExecute SQL statements i.e writing queries for inserting , deleting, updating, retrieving\nRetrieve Result i.e store the retrieved values from ResultSet.\nClose Connection i.e close the connection after the task is completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \n http://www.edureka.www.edureka.co\n\nVisit - http://www.edureka.co/java-course"
