description: "Presented by John Bender at JSLA (js.la) January 31st, 2013\nJohn Bender is the co-creator of Vagrant, a jQuery Mobile contributor, and a recovering polygot. During the day he works full-time on jQuery Mobile at Adobe and otherwise spends his time hacking on open source.\nCoffeeScript is an extremely popular JavaScript replacement, but its flexible syntax has been the source of some confusion. This talk covers one troublesome interaction between CoffeeScript terms and how mathematics could prevent similar issues in the future. You don't need a background in math to enjoy the talk, just an interest in language design and how math can help solve tough problems.\nTwitter: twitter.com/johnbender\nGithub: github.com/johnbender\njohnbender.us"
