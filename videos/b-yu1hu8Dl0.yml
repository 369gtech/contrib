title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Get off your Agile treadmill and build a community instead.'
recordingDate: 1506520357
description: "It’s time to take a fresh approach to project management. Stop gazing inwards, incessantly tweaking internal project processes but get out and use your skills to build a community.\n\nIf your project management approach never changes and your team looks tired and jaded it’s time to look beyond a strictly Agile approach, be more creative and use the power of the community (and yes that includes Drupal!) \_to refresh your team.\n\nLearn how to progress products quicker by taking full advantage of everything that Project Management has to offer while making the best use of your community’s resources. \_Encouraging flexible informal feedback doesn’t mean you can’t also apply a rigorous change management process to handle new functionality in as objective a way as possible. It’s this process that allows us to enhance the user experience of both our Content Management System and the visitors to our website.\n\nWe’ll take a new look at continuous improvements and how you should be applying this to your community building (whether this be clients, users or your team) as well as your products. So not just building services and functionality but organising events and engaging with the people that use your software and websites as well.\n\nThe University of Edinburgh has a large devolved development community, a bit like an open source one, with the same obvious wealth of talent and experience. When we turned to Drupal we could see the power of community development and immediately wanted to make code sprints a part of our development approach. We’ll show you why you should be doing the same.\n\nCode sprints for us are not just about getting work done but building community spirit and team morale, encouraging and supporting knowledge transfer, and upgrading everyone’s skills.\n\nWe had some hurdles to overcome so we’ll be exploring these and how to avoid them and we’ll look at what governance models you can put in place to stop everything descending into chaos.\n\nWe’ve used this approach to deliver over 300 websites in a central service and have also allowed our internal business units to take a Drupal distribution, customise it to suit local needs, and ultimately to feed this work back to benefit everyone. What we want to encourage is a developer working to meet his immediate departmental needs but then feeding back to meet the University needs and then hopefully on further to meet global needs of Drupal as well.\n\nWhat'll you'll take away\n\nTake a new look at your approach to project management and how to harness the power of the community.\nLean to think creatively and use the best bits from the open source community.\nStop it falling apart by adding layers of governance and project management.\nTopics to be covered:\n\nCombine strong project management skills with community led flexibility and creativity.\nThe use of change management and a Change Advisory Board\nEncouraging developers to contribute back to Drupal by submitting code but also by actively participating in the Drupal community e.g. hosting events."
