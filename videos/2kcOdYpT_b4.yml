title: 'Building a real-time serverless app in Blazor using AWS - Martin Beeby. -NDC Oslo 2020'
recordingDate: 1599849864
description: "In this session, we will build an interactive dashboard using Blazor that reacts in real-time to events that happen in the real world. We will connect the Blazor application through to a serverless backend built in .Net. Rather than requiring a cluster of servers to maintain our WebSocket communications, we will use a managed service called Amazon API Gateway and take advantage of itâ€™s WebSockets support. This service introduces a whole new way of thinking about, and architecting, applications that require duplex communication.\n\nBy the end of the session, you will have the knowledge to build highly scalable and resilient real-time applications without having to manage or scale servers."
