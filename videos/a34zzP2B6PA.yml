In eBay we inspire from the idea of CoreOs Operator pattern, and build a framework to make it easier and agile to manage the multi-component, GEO distributed stateful workloads on Kubernetes. With this Operator Framework, users could get any applications they required in just one yaml file, databases or message queue or streaming processor. The framework leverage our self-designed workflow engine to deploy the applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters and manage the applications with in-depend components automatically. The management functions like self-healing, scaling, upgrading, configuring are provided to achieve production grade reliability and high availability.  \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuJh"
