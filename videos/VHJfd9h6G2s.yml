description: "Sniffing and attacking Bluetooth Low Energy devices has always been a real pain. Proprietary tools do the job but cannot be tuned to fit our offensive needs, while opensource tools work sometimes, but are not reliable and efficient. Even the recently released Man-in-the-Middle BLE attack tools have their limits, like their complexity and lack of features to analyze encrypted or short connections. \n\nFurthermore, as vendors do not seem inclined to improve the security of their devices by following the best practices, we decided to create a tool to lower the ticket: BtleJack. BtleJack not only provides an affordable and reliable way to sniff and analyze Bluetooth Low Energy devices and their protocol stacks, but also implements a brand new attack dubbed \"BtleJacking\" that provides a way to take control of any already connected BLE device. \n\nWe will demonstrate how this attack works on various devices, how to protect them and avoid hijacking and of course release the source code of the tool. \n\nVendors, be warned: BLE hijacking is real and should be considered in your threat model."
