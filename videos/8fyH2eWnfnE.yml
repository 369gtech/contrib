title: 'Srinivasa Desikan- Computational Social Science with Python | PyData Global 2020'

description: "Talk \nA new research paradigm has taken footing in the social sciences and humanities: that of computational social science and digital humanities. An exponential increase in historical and contemporary datasets which are relevant for this sphere of academia has led social and human scientists to move from dusty libraries to large data centers, and Open source and python has been crucial in this move.\n\n\nSpeaker\nHello! I am a Research Fellow at the Knowledge Lab at the University of Chicago, where I also received my MA in Computational Social Science. Open source and python have been a large part of my life, and I have contributed to multiple scientific computing libraries, spoken at over 15 PyCons/PyDatas, maintain two python packages, and have written a book on doing Natural Language Processing in Python. Iâ€™m a strong believer in accessible and critical science with a clear focus on the social impacts and nature of computing and science. I love my cat, dancing to techno music, hanging out with my awesome friends and family, and cooking Indian food.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
