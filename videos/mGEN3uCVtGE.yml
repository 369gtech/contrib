description: "For years mobile development teams split their talent between Android and iOS in a way that was costly, slow, and inefficient. Then, in 2015, Facebook developers came up with a cross-platform solution called React Native.\n\nIn this episode we follow our Wix mobile engineering team as they adopt React Native and work with it for several years while building the official Wix app."
