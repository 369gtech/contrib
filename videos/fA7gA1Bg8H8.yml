description: "In the age of the Cloud we have almost grown accustomed, or even weary at times, of paradigm shifting technology promising gold and green forests. And here is another one – Serverless Compute.\nIt was in fact Amazon who coined the term for their popular Lambda service. Microsoft’s retort is that they did in fact plant the seed for the concept with “Simple Batch” aka. WebJobs. Azure has now followed suit in the Serverless wave with Azure Functions a very competent and interesting service with full hooks into the Platform and all other services that live there, such as VSTS, Logic Apps and much more. We developers, architects and DevOps are able to dig into the spoils of the battle of the giants and enjoy a new paradigm which will make us much more effective developers at a fraction of the cost! The Cloud breaths innovation in every breath. The advent of Serverless Compute certainly is one such energizing advance!"
