recordingDate: 1539209910
description: "Laura Noren offers an overview of a research project—conducted jointly by researchers at NYU and UC Berkeley—on the various infrastructure models supporting data science in research settings in terms of funding, educational uses, and research utilization. Laura then shares some of the findings, comparing the national federation model currently established in Canada, with the support of the Canadian federal government, to the more grassroots efforts in many US universities. The research project utilizes spoken and written interviews, evaluation surveys, and reviews of public posts about data science infrastructure on GitHub from more than 50 different US and Canadian institutions to understand the specifics of the current infrastructures and systems.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
