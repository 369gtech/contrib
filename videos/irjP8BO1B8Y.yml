title: 'Introduction to Logic Programming with Clojure - Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant'
recordingDate: 1357585589
description: 'A well written logic program is a gold mine. Logic programming represents a problem as a set of declarative logical axioms, or facts, which a logic engine uses to construct a proof. With a set of facts, the programmer can offload the work of collecting results to a logic engine in exciting ways. Beyond these wonderful properties, writing a logic program is tremendous fun! We will use Clojure''s logic engine core.logic to introduce these concepts and jump into the fascinating world of logical programming.'
