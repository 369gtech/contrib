description: 'Naming is one of the two hard things in Computer Science. And we fail at it every time we create another Manager or Service, or when we follow "framework conventions". Especially those of us living in OOP world desperately need better abstractions, although FP is no panacea either. This talk is designed to help you improve your names and naming habits by taking advice from Eric Evans (DDD), Uncle Bob, Kent Beck and other experts.'
