title: 'Practical Domain-Driven Design with EF Core - Hossam Barakat'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605257486
description: "You have probably heard about Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and read about the benefits of building complex software applications with DDD, but struggled in applying DDD to your project especially with legacy code bases that have anemic domain models. In this session, we will cover the fundamentals of DDD with focus on the tactical patterns like aggregates, entities, value objects and domain events, how to use a pragmatic approach to craft a cohesive domain model, and finally how to leverage EF Core capabilities to persist the domain model into a relational database. By the end of this talk, you will be equipped with enough knowledge to apply DDD principles to both greenfield and brownfield projects without cluttering your domain model with dependencies on EF Core.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
