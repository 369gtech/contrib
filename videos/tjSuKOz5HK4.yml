The primary objective of this talk is to help the practicing software developer prepare for their effective usage. It examines software architecture requirements for programming in the large and linguistic support offered by the coming C++20 standards. The talk augments the programmer’s toolbox with new programming techniques based on componentization and isolation offered by C++ modules. Finally, it shows how the practitioner can start experimenting with these ideas with in-development compilers such as MSVC, GCC, and Clang.\n\n— \n\nGabriel Dos Reis\nMicrosoft\nPrincipal Software Engineer\n\nGabriel Dos Reis is a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft, where he works in the area of large scale software construction, tools, and techniques.
