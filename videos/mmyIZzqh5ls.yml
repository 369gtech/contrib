description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nWG21 has established SG21 to finalize a design for contract checking in C++.\_ For nearly 15 years, Bloomberg has been leveraging a macro-based contract-checking facility that has contributed greatly to the ongoing design of the future, language-based one.\_ In this talk, we will walk through the ups and downs of having implemented industrial-strength runtime pre-condition checking in real-world scenarios.\_ We will discuss how we initially used our home-grown macro-based solution to successfully detect bugs, how we've had to evolve our methodology over the years, and how these needs will help guide SG21 contracts so that you'll be able to take maximum advantage of language based contract when they arrive.\n\nWe will provide a detailed review of the most important features (to us) that contract checking in\_C++ will need to provide.\_ Then we will discuss what might be learned from what we've used successfully in the past so that contract checks can be added to large libraries, deployed across large organizations, and maintained as those organizations continue to adapt and grow.\n— \nJoshua Berne\nBloomberg\nSoftware Engineer\nJoshua Berne has been programming in C++ since first reading \"The C++ Programming language\" some time in the last century. After many years building distributed trading systems in other languages, Joshua has recently been working on the core libraries at Bloomberg. This has primarily included evolving Bloomberg's internal contract checking facilities, and efforts to bring that experience to the language and the C++ community as a whole.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
