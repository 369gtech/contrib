title: 'TOC 2011:  Walter Walker, "What Becomes of Publishing without the Page?"'
recordingDate: 1298138737
description: "Whereas Gutenberg gave us moveable type and brought structure to page creation; XML brings us structured content and opens the door to outputs beyond the page. Still, publishers remain obsessed with recreating their bound publications in digital form. This brief keynote draws on historic precedent to make the case for evolutionary changes in publishing -- changes that will come from writers and creators of a new form. Arguing that publishers have adopted digital formats, but not adapted to the technology, this presentation admonishes publishers against the wholesale pursuit of \"enhanced\" ebooks, while making the case for \"enriched\" digital editions. Both, neveretheless, are interim steps, while we wait for a generation of XML-enabled authors to lead us forward.\n\nWalter Walker\n\ncodeMantra LLC\n\nWalter heads up codeMantra's Publishing Services Division. He has more than 18 years of commercial publishing experience, having held VP Sales & Marketing positions at Simon & Schuster, Inc. and marketing and public relations positions with Bantam Doubleday Dell and McClelland & Stewart (both now part of Random House). Walter started his career in digital publishing in 2000, with a progressive and optimistic start-up offering Digital Rights Management solutions. He then ventured into industrial publishing, where he marketed and sold high-end dynamic enterprise publishing (DEP) solutions for Advent 3B2, Arbortext and PTC Inc. Walter's extensive understanding of publishing processes and the expanding market for digital content supports a practical assessment of where, and how, XML technologies can best be applied."
