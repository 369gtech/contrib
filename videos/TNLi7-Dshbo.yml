language: English
recordingDate: 1632327236
description: "Too often, we glide past the idea that “software is eating the world” and that organizations must master software to survive. But what problems are they actually having that software can help with? Some of the problems—scale, security, growth, and better customer experience—are the same across an organization type. But each industry also has unique problems, needs, and opportunities.\n \nThis panel will explore those unique needs with industry experts from finance and healthcare.\n \nThis panel will match the whiz-bang wonders for DevOps, cloud native, Kubernetes, lean, and product-driven software to the actual “business outcomes” that organizations need.\n \n The panel will discuss:\n \n - What are the current business needs/headwinds/opportunities/hope and dreams in the industry?\n - How does software help address those?\n - What’s at least one story/anecdote of good or bad things happening along those lines?\n\nThere will, of course, be time for questions.\n\nHenri van den Bulk, Executive Technical Advisor at VMware\nJT Perry, Tanzu Value Advisor at VMware\nMichael Coté, Staff Technologist 2 at VMware\nVivian Ko, Managing Director at Charles Schwab"
