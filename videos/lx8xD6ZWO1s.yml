As part of this talk we will walk through why we need to use AWS Green Grass and its advantages over direct use of AWS IoT. Then we will explore how to custom design and build your own drone using Autodesk Fusion 360 and mount AWS Green Grass to the drone to capture a scene and create 3D mappings of the area. We will be talking about AWS Green Grass, 3D printing, basics of drone building, Autodesk Fusion 360 and Autodesk Recap API's\r\n\r\nLink to Video in the Presentation:  TBC\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/AWS-SG/events/248959334/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/hPUd/"
