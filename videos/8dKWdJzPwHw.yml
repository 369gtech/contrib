description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nIn this talk I will present an advancement on the Compile Time Regular Expression (CTRE) library. The library was designed with new C++20 features, and it uses novel techniques. This presentation independently sums up the work since my previous CppCon talk about the library.\n\nThe primary topic of this talk will be an explanation of the new Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) engine in the library and how it's built and optimised during compilation. I will explain the differences and limitations of the new engine in comparison to the previous Back Tracking engine. I will address these differences with a benchmark and I will discuss the generated assembly.\n\nEven if you are not interested in regular expressions, you will learn new techniques in compile-time meta-programming and see new C++20 features in action.\n— \nHana Dusíková\nAVAST\nSenior Researcher\nBrno, Czech Republic\n\nHana is working as a senior researcher in Avast Software. Her responsibility is exploring new ideas and optimizing existing ones. She also propagates modern C++ techniques and libraries in internal techtalks and gives talks at local C++ meetups.\n\nShe studied computer science at Mendel university and subsequently taught several courses there, including: Data Structures, Computability and Complexity, and Formal Languages and Automata.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
