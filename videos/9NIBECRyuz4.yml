description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nAPPLIED AI RESEARCH WITH STARCRAFT, TORCH AND THE BEAM\nby Barbara Chassoul & Jean Chassoul\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\n#lualang \n#starcraft \n#machinelearning\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nWe present our community bot system build for online competition and AI research on the real-time strategy game of StarCraft, ours is a message-passing, asynchronous system that exploits the hot swap loading, parallelism and standard mechanisms of Luerl and the properties of the BEAM ecosystem.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/jean-chassoul/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JEAN CHASSOUL\n\nJean believes Luerl brings powerful mechanisms to the BEAM ecosystem and LFE macros as the ones that glob intended.\n\nMore on Jean Chassoul: https://codesync.global/speaker/jean-chassoul/\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BARBARA CHASSOUL\nLive for the Spawn!\n\nAs a former physicist found her way into coding Barbara a few years ago, she is always having fun learning new things. Currently working with Luerl on a StarCraft AI bot.\n\nMore on Barbara Chassoul: https://codesync.global/speaker/barbara-chassoul/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync. Code BEAM SF 19 was sponsored by WhatsApp, The RealReal, Brex, Erlang Solutions, 2600Hz, PagerDuty, and aeternity.\n\nCODE SYNC \nWebsite: www.codesync.global\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\nMail: info at codesync.global\n\n#lualang \n#starcraft \n#machinelearning"
