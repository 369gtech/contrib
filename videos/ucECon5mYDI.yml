title: '[Online Meetup] React Hooks: SOLID View - Roman Yakobchuk'
recordingDate: 1596730503
description: "About a year ago, we were celebrating the release of the new React API. ‘Rewrite everything with hooks’ was pretty much the mainstream idea. The community was in awe - certain use cases seemed to have become much simpler, there were new patterns, and the approach to designing components was changing.\n\nYet, when the dust settled, we all had to face the truth: there are no silver bullets out there. Turns out, we’re paying a certain price for those improvements. Let’s clear things out and compare the pros and cons.\n\nIn this talk, Roman covers the following questions:\n\n* Why do we love react hooks\n* What are the use cases that work great with hooks\n* What became harder to implement\n* What should you pay attention to\n* What are new patterns that you can use"
