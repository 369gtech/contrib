Angel and his team are responsible for the technology, architecture, and strategy behind IBM’s hybrid, open, and secure cloud – empowering our clients with a new way to work. When he’s not working to bring greater value to clients through a flexible and interoperable cloud, Angel is IBM’s leader for open technology, where he is spearheading an industry IT residence driven by open source code, community, and culture. A master of the art-of-the-possible, he has been the driving force behind many of the most important cloud, data, and mobile open technology industry movements – all focused on enabling innovation that is built on simple, practical solutions. With a career rooted in IBM Research, building the standards upon which the web runs, and having successfully lead both business and development teams at IBM, Dr. Diaz has a unique perspective on technology’s effect on today’s opportunities. In those rare moments of stillness, you might find Angel vanquishing his foes across Azeroth, or forging amazing new worlds in Minecraft with his daughter.\n\nWatch more from OSCON 2015: https://goo.gl/vD6vda\nFind out more about OSCON: http://oscon.com/open-source-2015\nDon't miss an upload!
