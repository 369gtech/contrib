description: "TestCon Moscow 2017 Conference, April 27. www.testconf.ru\n\nSoftware Testing is infested with many flavours of confusion. Wrong concepts and misunderstandings roam the testing field. For the sake of professional pride, we want to correct that. This session is about identifying areas where wrong thinking and misapplication of simplistic models have lead to situations that are not helpful in advancing our craft. We will walk through sloppy thinking, wrong models and some real-life examples of corporate bullshit. But doing only that would not be helpful. We will, therefore, find ways to counteract those lost paths with replacing it with a better model. This more refined model will help you bring world peace to testing."
