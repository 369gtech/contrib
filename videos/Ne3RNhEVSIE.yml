description: "We learn how to rotate a vector using a quaternion.\n\nDuring the video I said that I'd link a book where you can find the derivation of the vector rotation equation. I thought it would be in \"3D Math Primer For Graphics And Game Development\" by Fletcher Dunn and Ian Parberry but I can't actually find it in there. Still a good book though.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/quaternion-transform\n\nQuestion?
