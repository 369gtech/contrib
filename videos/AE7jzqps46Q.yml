description: "Why Empathy Matters in Infrastructure Technology - Craig McLuckie, VMware \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/ \n\nThe industry has standardized around Kubernetes as its leading orchestration platform. But due to its complexity – and a lack of experience and expertise – Kubernetes remains a challenge to deploy and manage.\n\nFaced with an increasing amount of pressure to create innovative software that delivers competitive business advantages and beneficial user experiences, developers hold a crucial role in the development cycle. Thus, it's the developer experience that must be at the forefront. Empathy must be top of mind for the individuals behind the delivery of orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.\n\nCraig McLuckie, Vice President of R&D at VMware, will discuss the importance of the developer experience, the role empathy can play for the broader developer ecosystem, and how his team is ensuring the VMware Tanzu portfolio extends beyond IT infrastructure."
