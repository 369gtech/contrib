title: 'YOW! 2014 Lindsay Holmwood - 5 Years of Metrics and Monitoring'
recordingDate: 1514387547
description: "Five years ago, monitoring was just beginning to emerge from the dark ages.\n\nSince then there’s been a cambrian explosion of tools, a rough formalisation of how the tools should be strung together, the emergence of the monitoringsucks meme, the transformation of monitoringsucks into monitoringlove, and the rise of a sister community around Monitorama.\n\nAlert fatigue has become a concept that’s entered the devops consciousness, and more advanced shops along the monitoring continuum are analysing their alerting data to help humans and machines work better together.\n\nBut Nagios is still the dominant check executor. Plenty of sites still use RRDtool. And plenty of people are still chained to their pagers, with no relief in sight.\n\nWhat’s holding us back? What will the next 5 years look like? Will we still be using Nagios? Have we misjudged our audience? What are our biggest challenges?\n\nLindsay Holmwood is an engineering manager living in the Australian Blue Mountains. He runs a distributed team at Bulletproof that builds hassle free tools, and was responsible for ensuring 100% uptime for the 2010 + 2011 + 2012 Movember campaigns.\n\nLindsay has been involved with DevOps since the beginning, organising the second ever DevOpsDays in Sydney in 2010, is the Secretary of DevOps Australia, and organises the Sydney DevOps meetup, the longest continuously running DevOps meetup in the world.\n\nLindsay speaks internationally about both the cultural and technical side of DevOps, covering Just Culture, complexity, cognitive biases, and monitoring tools. He also won third place at the 1996 Sydney Royal Easter Show LEGO building competition.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
