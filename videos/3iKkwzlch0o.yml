description: "There's a data structure that essentially makes you a wizard and that data structure is streams. In this talk, you'll learn more about the best data structure you didn't know enough about. There will be history, there will be a real-world demo, and there will be examples of how to leverage this power in JavaScript. Expect walk away having learned about IO streams, ES6 generators, current developments, and being really excited about this awesome data structure.\n\nPam Selle\n@pamasaur\n\nPam Selle is a software engineer, published author, and public speaker. A fan of learning new and old languages, she largely works with JavaScript and organizes Philadelphia's largest JavaScript user group as well as the regional JavaScript conference, LibertyJS."
