recordingDate: 1411270572
description: "The tick tock of an antique clock. The click and whir as the odometer in a classic car rolls to the next mile. There’s something comforting and familiar about measuring things that matter with an analog display.\n\nAnalog displays are fun, engaging, use multiple senses, and become a part of your environment. Often they help you discover surprising things about your data in very different way than a typical computer visualization.\n\nIn this talk, Larry will share how he developed a collection of whimsical and engaging displays to visualize metrics and events. He will introduce some simple hardware platforms including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Spark Core. He will discuss a series of display projects and share code examples connecting them to a variety of data sources.\n\nThis talk is meant to inspire you to interact with your data in a different way and give you a starting point to create your own analog displays.\n\nLarry Ogrodnek\nBizo\n@ogrodnek\n\nLarry Ogrodnek has been a professional software developer for 15 years working in security, networks, and high volume web services.
