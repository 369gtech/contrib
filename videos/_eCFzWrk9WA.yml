Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe in Barcelona, May 20–23 (https://bit.ly/2B2vhMl), in Shanghai, June 24–26 (https://bit.ly/2JZcBjs), or in San Diego November 18–21 (https://bit.ly/2K031wW) in 2019.\n\nManaging and Securing Blockchain Applications on Kubernetes - Haining Zhang & Yang Yu, Vmware\n\nMany enterprises are looking at blockchain technology to solve their business problems. Because of the decentralization nature of blockchain, cloud platforms become an ideal place to run blockchain applications. Kubernetes is a ubiquitous cloud operating system that are available in most cloud providers. Running and operating a blockchain system on Kubernetes become an ideal choice for many users to reduce operational complexity.  In this talk, we will introduce and demo the approach to automating the deployment of Hyperledger Fabric, an open source blockchain framework, on Kubernetes. Furthermore, we will show how to leverage CNI plugin to set network policies based on Kubernetes’ namespace. This measure enhances security by isolating workload between different blockchain entities. Our work can serve as the foundation of enterprise Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) based on Kubernetes.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuKp"
