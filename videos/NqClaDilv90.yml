description: "So you’re done writing the core of your app. It got pretty hairy but you pulled through. You abstracted the business logic, broke down everything into components and mastered the flow of your app state. Good job! Go get yourself a victory cookie.\nOh wait, you can’t, because a legion of designers and motion artists are headed your way chanting something about “storyboards” and “microinteractions”.\n\nHow will that even fit in with your beautiful architecture?\nUnlike state changes which can be instantaneous, animations inherently take time to complete - and that’s a big problem. In this talk we’ll tackle the challenges of adding animations to apps with complex state management. We’ll learn how to orchestrate animations across multiple components while tying it neat and tidy to the app state while working with frameworks like React, Vue and Angular.\n\nSlides: https://slides.com/opherv/yglf2019/\n\nYGLF 2019: Code Camp Blog, Opher Vishnia:\nhttps://www.israel.yglfconf.com/post/meet-the-speaker-opher-vishnia"
