title: 'JavaScriptSphere: Visualizing large datasets with JavaScript using deck.gl by Marko Letic'
recordingDate: 1572516095
description: 'When talking about data visualization and JavaScript your mind usually goes to D3.js. But if our data has a location-based representation, we are faced with a limited choice. The main topic of this talk is to introduce the audience with deck.gl, an open-source WebGL-powered library developed by Uber that allows us to create beautiful data visualizations of large datasets and raise the level of interactivity for the user on a whole new level. A short introduction to the library and it’s API will be demonstrated along with practical use-cases, live-code examples and it’s integration with popular frameworks such as Angular and React.'
