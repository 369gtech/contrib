description: "Nikhil Vaze, Senior Software Engineer, Electric Cloud\n\nDoes it take your developers weeks to get a virtual machine? Do they need to jump through hoops filing tickets and chasing down IT to get the right configuration? Do they waste hours trying to deploy on the right setup, instead of writing or testing code?\nHelp your Dev and QA engineers help themselves. Enable every engineer to deploy their code with a click of a button.\nIn this session we will review a practical use case from a Fortune 500 company implementing an internal deployment-as-a-service solution, servicing thousands of applications and developers globally, across a pool of shared resources- on premise, cloud and hybrid.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n- Solution design and best practices for supporting HA, Scalability and user controls\nBest practices for tracking all the pieces of your application: the status and location of all your artifacts, environments and usage\n- How to leverage Docker and Cloud services to accelerate deployments and reduce friction between Dev and QA\n- Demo of a deployment pipeline using Docker and elastic Cloud environments."
