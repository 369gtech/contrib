title: 'droidcon Italy webinar - Data sync for real-time or offline apps - Richard Threlkeld'
recordingDate: 1592564512
description: "droidcon Italy webinar\n16 June 2020\n\nData sync for real-time or offline apps with Android and GraphQL\n\nData synchronization is a natural part of life for modern applications. This could be via standard fetching techniques, real-time using websockets, or offline transitions with shared data. This talk will be a deep dive on how we built Amplify DataStore using GraphQL to handle these situations, including details of storage mediums across web and native platforms, local vs network serialization of types, and conflict resolution. The talk will go through both theory and practical guidance on how we built this solution over several years with production AWS customers that run Android apps at large scale.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
