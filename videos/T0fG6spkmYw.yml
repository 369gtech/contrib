description: "My First Rust Project: Creating a Roguelike with Amethyst by Micah Tigley\n\nOne of the biggest challenges to learning Rust is finding a project to continuously practice that newfound knowledge on. As someone with a background in front-end web development, the world of Rust was new and exciting to someone with limited systems programming experience. There were a number of open-source projects to choose from and so many areas to explore, it was a bit intimidating. I finally settled on Rust's game development community. This talk looks at my journey diving into game development with Rust by building my first roguelike game with the Amethyst game engine."
