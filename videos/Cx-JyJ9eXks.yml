description: "We all love building with components. But they can lead to difficulties with styling - whether theming whole apps, or styling third-party libraries. This has led some people to describe CSS as \"\"broken\"\" but at Wix, we love CSS - so we’ve extended CSS to make it easier to use in a components world, building it into cross-browser, valid and performant stylesheets.\n\nWe’ll suggest how you too can write typed CSS that can abstract a component’s internals with a stylable API, keeping the power and simplicity of CSS."
