description: "James Weaver, Quantum Developer Advocate, IBM\nMary Grygleski, Developer Advocate - Java, IBM\n\nThis session shows how to develop and run native mobile apps without needing to know much about the native platforms, such as Android and iOS, by leveraging a hybrid development framework such as Ionic, which is built on top of Apache Cordova and is capable of transforming an ordinary web app into a mobile app. The presentation discusses a real-life enterprise-level Android and iOS mobile app developed under pressure for a wireless service provider. It covers some of the technical details of the app as well as how to perform device-level debugging of the Android app, using adb. You’ll get practical tips on what to watch out for and compare the hybrid approach to React and Kotlin/Native."
