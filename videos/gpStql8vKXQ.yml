description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/mongodbasaservice-on-pivotal-cloud-foundry/Pivotal/mongodbasaservice-on-pivotal-cloud-foundry\n\nThe ability to provide your organization with multiple data services on a platform like Pivotal Cloud Foundry is very powerful, and increases the agility of the organization as a whole, when developers are able to provision data services on demand, and all of this is completely transparent to the system operators. This session will cover a very brief overview of Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and will then deep dive into running MongoDB as a managed service on this platform. The MongoDB service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry leverages the capabilities of Bosh 2.0 for on-demand-dynamic provisioning for services while maintaining an integration with MongoDB's Cloud Ops Manager, to provide the best of both - Pivotal Cloud Foundry and MongoDB.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016' \nSpeakers: Mallika Iyer; Principal Software Engineer, Pivotal & Sam Weaver; Product Manager, MongoDB"
