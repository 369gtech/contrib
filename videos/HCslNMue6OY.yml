description: "Google I/O 2009 - Connecting The Clouds: Integrating Google App Engine for Java with Force.com\r\n\r\nRon Hess, Iein Valdez\r\n\r\nIn this session we will outline how to connect the Salesforce SOAP Web Services API to Google App Engine for Java. The project includes an open source Web Service Client that has been completely ported to App Engine. This client is designed for high performance and will work with Force.com WSDLs or other WSDLs that you may want to connect to. We will discuss the porting effort and demonstrate a simple integration between App Engine and the Salesforce.com. Appirio will demonstrate an advanced casino host application & game which blends App Engine and Salesforce. You'll learn how both platforms can be developed on side-by-side within the Eclipse IDE.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
