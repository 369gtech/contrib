description: "Quarks - New Building Blocks for Deploying on Kubernetes - Mario Manno, SUSE & Enrique Encalada, IBM \n\nThere are two popular platforms for deploying your cloud-native applications - Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry. Kubernetes is the great for its flexibility, control over your application and is a great container orchestrator. Cloud Foundry is the go-to platform where you don't want to worry about your infrastructure, networking, scaling, and routing. It also has the best developer experience in the industry.  With Quarks, deployment is simplified using BOSH features, but keeping the flexibility of Kubernetes.  In this session, you will learn about this new framework and its building blocks for deploying cloud-native applications which has the best features of the two worlds.  We also want to give some insight into the work done and get feedback on the current state._  We believe \"Quarks\" is the next buzz word for these conferences. Join us else you miss the train ride. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
