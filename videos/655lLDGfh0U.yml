language: English
recordingDate: 1627318312
description: 'Nowadays, web apps are richer and more interactive than ever before. With more code running right in the browser, it has become increasingly more challenging to deliver fluid, native-like experiences for users, especially on less powerful devices. Enter Web Workers! In this talk, we will learn what Web Workers are, how they allow us to build better and snappier user interfaces by lifting work out of the main thread, and some ways that you can use Web Workers in your React applications today.'
