In this deep dive session we will explore a number of language and JDK changes that programmers will greatly benefit from. We will also discuss the big elephant, Modularization, what that means, how to use it, and also how to transition existing code.\n\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston.
