description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nExperience the joy of flying the Parrot AR Drone using the power of Clojure.\nWe will take a journey that begins with a child's dream of having a \"real\" robot friend. Along the way, we will discover the blessings of a functional language, the power of the Clojure language, the thrill of flying with a REPL, and maybe even gems of wisdom long lost under the snow of the AI Winter.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- Show how Clojure can be used for fun robotics projects. Also explore John McCarthy's AI concept for ascribing beliefs and goals to machines;"
