description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nIn the era of social networks and multimedia, TV that is sitting in our living room is becoming more and more like entertainment center, not just a device that we use to watch news, some sports event or our favorite series. Nowadays, people want to sit back in their couch, relax, and be able to do things that can be done on computers and smartphones, just on a large screen. From watching YouTube videos, sharing and posting on Facebook, or following latest trends on twitter, creators of Smart TV applications are struggling to make this possible and accessible by using only few remote controller buttons. Different solutions that enable user to interact with most popular internet services today, from Android and Apple TV, to standard Smart TVs are not available to everyone. Our wish was to bring this technology to every home that has domestic IPTV service. So, we rolled up our sleeves, took a leap into JavaScript world of different API’s, optimizations for TV box embedded operating systems, limitations of hardware, and interface specifics, and delivered a product that can match today’s most modern solutions in TV applications. This is our success story, one that tells how we took 80$ TV box, and put Facebook, twitter and YouTube inside it."
