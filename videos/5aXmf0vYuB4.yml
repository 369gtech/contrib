description: "In this talk I will show you how to do Bayesian Inference via fully-worked examples using game data from baseball and soccer. By comparing predictions made by plugging in Bayesian estimates to those made by plugging in maximum likelihood estimates, we see how critical it is that your predictions reflect not just your estimate of the most likely outcome, but also your degree of uncertainty.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
