title: 'Serg Hospodarets - You Might Not Need a CSS Preprocessor'
recordingDate: 1475571916
description: "\"You Might Not Need a CSS Preprocessor\"\n\nAll developers got used to use (post/pre) processors for CSS- Sass, Stylus, postCSS whatever. There are powerful variables, mixins and other benefits. But all they are defined and can be changed only during the build phase, which prevents developers from having any flexibility in the browser.\n\nImagine for a second that the browsers includes all these out of the box- you can change variables and apply mixins on the fly and the browser renders everything correctly. Sounds incredible? But it’s already implemented and works!\n\nIn the talk the community will be acquainted with the CSS custom properties (native variables). In short it’s native variables in CSS which provide all the flexibility you dreamed about. Having live native variables which inherit, cascade and have scopes gives abilities e.g. to apply color theming on the fly and easily pass any CSS data to JavaScript + many others.\n\nContinuing the idea of movement from preprocessors directly to browsers CSS @apply rule will be highlighted. It gives a native CSS mixins for the Web. Using it clearfix and others can be easily applied on the fly.\n\nAnd of course a couple of serious demos like generating colors directly in CSS from custom properties and their usage for animations and transitions will take place.\n\nYou’ll learn how to avoid copy paste clones in the code and use the power of live variables and mixins."
