description: "Join us to hear about exciting upcoming talks for this week’s SpringOne conference!\n\n---\n\nCora Iberkleid is a Developer Advocate for Modern Applications at VMware, helping developers and enterprises navigate modern practices and technologies including Spring, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, Tanzu, and modern CI/CD. Prior to that she was an Advisory Cloud Application and Platform Architect at Pivotal. She also spent nearly a decade at Sun Microsystems and Oracle, helping customers design and build enterprise integration applications.\n\nAs a VMware engineer, Glenn Renfro is a core committer for Spring Cloud Task, Spring Batch, and Spring Cloud Data Flow. He has 14 years of experience in designing, building, and delivering enterprise-level applications in Java and 21 years total of software development experience.\n\nExploring new languages, frameworks, and technologies, and then sharing what he’s learned, has always come naturally to Ryan. Even when it wasn’t his day job, Ryan has always been driven by his passion, spending his time and energy educating his friends, colleagues, or anyone else that would listen. Currently, Ryan is working as a software engineer as part of the Spring Cloud team. Ryan has a passion for sharing what he learns via social media, including Twitter and his blog, as well as in person at conferences. When he’s not coding, Ryan likes spending time with his daughter, ice fishing, running obstacle course races, and watching the Red Sox.\n\nMadhura Bhave is a software engineer at VMware on the Spring Boot team. Before joining the Spring Boot team, Madhura worked on the UAA (Authentication and Authorization component for Cloud Foundry).\n\nJoe has been in the Software Industry for over 20 years. He has successfully designed, built and delivered enterprise grade software in the financial services and health sector. He has been using Spring for over 10 years and is very excited to have joined the Spring Security engineering team, in early 2016. Outside of his passion for crafty software, Joe continues to travel the world with his family, snowboarding the most challenging mountains, exploring nature on foot and doing his best to enjoy what life brings.\n\nSpencer Gibb is a software engineer at VMware focusing on Spring Cloud. Spencer’s interests include distributed systems, JVM languages, web services frameworks, message-driven architectures, and making software development simpler. He loves to create software to solve a pain point (for example, by creating a tool to automate workstation setup in his free time). Spencer’s industry experience has taken him from early e-commerce platforms to government and nonprofit organizations to business intelligence startups. He has extensive experience in Java and other languages such as Scala and Python. His database experience runs from Oracle and MySQL to Riak and Cassandra. You can find out more on his blog."
