description: 'This session will give attendees a deeper understanding of the impact seemingly innocuous design and implementation decisions can have on the stability and success of an entire Analytics system. An end-to-end view of the stack will be taken, covering areas including logical modelling, analysis design, and architectural topics. The importance of a holistic view and an appreciation of alternatives will be emphasized as well as the need to understand, comprehend and reflect on the implications of a “best practice” being followed as well as the technology stack simply being misunderstood. Attendees will be in a position to better weigh and judge implementation options knowing their long-term effect and impacts in terms of - user experience - performance - upgrade capability - ease-of-use - reproduciblity - overall ROI'
