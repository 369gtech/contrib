Antonio has spent 20 years bringing hope to this region through extensive human development projects that have had far-reaching benefits. He speaks Bariba and Mokolle, languages spoken in Benin, as well as French, Spanish, and English. He will\r\nrecount his experiences in Africa and explain the low-tech ways he and his community work to solve challenging socio-economical and infrastructural problems. His ability to overcome cultural and political obstacles has made his endeavors in improving living conditions there successful. He is a model worker whose efforts have caught the attention of people, here in California, who are establishing a partnership with Antonio in order to bolster the impact of his work.\r\n\r\nMore information about the projects Antonio is undertaking can be found at http://baobabhi.org. Baobab Humanity Initiative is a grassroots\r\n\r\nCalifornia-based nonprofit organization, which supports the work of Antonio Gutierrez.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Antonio Gutierrez"
