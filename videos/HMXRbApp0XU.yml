description: "Speakers: Sabby Anandan, Mark Fisher & Mark Pollack\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/sabbyanandan/2015\nWorried about Big Data and the challenges inherent in making a real application? You don’t have to worry anymore! Spring XD provides a one-stop shop solution that spans traditional enterprise to Big Data use cases - both batch and streaming. It's important to choose the right tool for each use-case, which is why Spring XD integrates with technologies such as Spark, Reactor and RxJava to demonstrate the flexibility and the unified programming model to support complex data computation use-cases. \n\nIn this webinar, we'll show you how to develop data-driven use cases much faster than other big data solutions on the out of the box XD runtime."
