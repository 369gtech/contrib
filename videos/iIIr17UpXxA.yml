description: 'Microservices Architecture (MSA) is the new black! For many, it is the way to go. Those people also tends to depict Java EE (and Java EE containers) as an antinomy to MSA... It''s one or to other but certainly not both! In this session, we''ll look at the main microservices concepts and see if it is really a bad idea to use some of them within a Java EE context (hint: it''s not always a bad idea!). We will then look at some of the WebLogic features and see if there''s any that might be useful to use in a more Microservices oriented approach. MSA is not just about the tooling; it''s also about the people, their skills and their culture. The goal of this session is to give a fair balanced view of Java EE and WebLogic in a MSA context to help you to make your own judgment.'
