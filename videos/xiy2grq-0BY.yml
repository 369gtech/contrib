description: "Speaker: Karthic Rao (@hackintoshrao)\r\nDeveloper Advocate, DGraph (https://dgraph.io)\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll together compose a GraphQL schema for a twitter clone and using just that schema we’ll autogenerate all the GraphQL API functions required to start building the application using Dgraph. Dgraph is the only native GraphQL Database which natively interprets, distributed, stores and executes GraphQL, no layering required, all you need to do is to compose a GraphQL schema to get started.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/GraphQLHongKong/events/269158848/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/C0I3O/"
