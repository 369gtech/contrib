description: "RubyConf 2018 - Building For Gracious Failure by James Thompson\n\nEverything fails at some level, in some way, some of the time. How we deal with those failures can ruin our day, or help us learn and grow. Together we will explore some of the patterns for dealing with failure in service-based systems graciously. Whether you're integrating with an external system, building microservices, or designing serverless applications, you will gain insight on how to fail gracefully in both common, and uncommon circumstances."
