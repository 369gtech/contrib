description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe Trials and Success of Adopting Envoy at Tinder - Yuki Sawa & Cooper Jackson, Tinder\n\nTinder adopted an Envoy based service mesh for their Kubernetes based infrastructure a few years ago. Our implementation is custom to Tinder's architecture but the lessons we picked up along the way are universal. Whether it's how we store and represent our routing configuration, building out a robust monitoring pipeline for all our Envoy metrics, utilizing Envoy's global rate limiting capabilities to protect our infrastructure, meshing our database and microservice requests, retry and timeout do’s and don’ts, and more, there is plenty of knowledge to share. We will explore our bespoke features like deadline propagation, multi-cluster Envoy metric monitoring, and how we implemented our own xDS control plane. From the early struggles of our service mesh migration, to cautionary tales and best practices, we're excited to walk through the process of building out an Envoy topology that powers Tinder's infrastructure worldwide."
