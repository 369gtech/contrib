description: "How do we build a cost-effective, production-ready, scalable web applications with a beautiful UI, in 45 minutes? With Serverless tools.\n\nBuilding a web application is a complex task: backend application servers, databases, network components, front-end framework, and more. These parts are often built by different stakeholders, and after the web app is shipped, the never-ending chore of technical maintenance, version upgrades, security patching and backup begins. An open serverless platforms mitigates most of these pains.\n\nIn this demo session Adam will build a full web application using Corvid, the Wix Serverless coding platform built into its powerful UI editor, and explain how Serverless design patterns improve development velocity and experience while delivering unbeatable business value.\n\nAdam Matan\nServerless Team Leader, Wix.com\nhttps://twitter.com/adam_matan\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/adamatan/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
