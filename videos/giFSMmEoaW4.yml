description: "\"Software testing? I don’t get it at all.” There was a time when I felt that way, too, but something changed in my career as a web developer, and now I can’t do my job without testing. When should you write tests and when you can get away without them? We’ll cover coding techniques as well as motivations for testing to work better with teams and give ourselves some peace of mind.\n\nEVENT:\n\nSmashingConf Barcelona 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMarcy Sutton\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nSmashingConf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nSmashing Magazine: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/"
