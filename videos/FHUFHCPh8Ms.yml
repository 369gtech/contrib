description: "Google Tech Talks\n\nABSTRACT\n\nJust as garbage collection can free you from the joys of manual memory management, transactional memory can free you from the joys of explicit locking. Come find out how to use it and how it's implemented.\n\nThis is another in the series of talks in Advanced Topics in Programming Languages. The goal of this series is to encourage all of the people at Google who know and love programming languages to share their knowledge.  Credits: Speaker:Adam Langley"
