title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Powering an Interactive SVG and JavaScript Game Engine with Drupal'
recordingDate: 1493241729
description: "Drupal's fielded entities were designed for structuring and displaying traditional web content, but can just as easily be used to build a rich data model for almost any application.\n\nWe'll look at how Aten built a Drupal-powered API for generating levels for an HTML5, SVG\_and JavaScript game engine. This system allowed content editors to create a limitless number of unique, hand-crafted levels for an early childhood education\_game without additional development costs.\n\nThis session will cover how we used Drupal to create configurable level entities, the tools and techniques we used to make an interactive game with SVG and JavaScript, and how we internationalized our audio instructions by integrating Drupal with the Watson API. Attendees of any experience level are welcome to attend, but attendees who can follow along with some\_JavaScript code examples and those with an interest in browser based graphics and animation will find the presentation even more engaging.\n\nWhat you should already know\n\nSite builder knowledge of Drupal\nIntermediate javascript\nFamiliarity with SVG or interest in graphics and animation"
