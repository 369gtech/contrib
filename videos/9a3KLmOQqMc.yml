title: '"Equitable Experiential Access: Audio Description" by Laurel Lawson'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634218297
description: "Accessibility is often viewed as a service, tacked on after the fact, and evaluated by a minimum standard rather than by equity of experience. Instead: centering our users, let's embrace the multiplicity of ways in which we can offer content experiences in an equitable fashion.\n\nThis session dives specifically into auditory accessibility for artists, content creators, and presenters. We'll look at recent and ongoing research with nonvisual audiences and a few ways to put that knowledge into action, including the open source Audimance platform.\n\nLaurel Lawson\nCyCore Systems\n@llcycore\n\nLaurel Lawson (she/they) is a product designer and CTO of CyCore Systems, a small R&D consultancy specializing in novel multisystem solutions. She is also a choreographer & trans-disciplinary artist-engineer and an expert instructor in user-centered design & interfaces, leadership, disability access and equity, and creativity, and is the creator of the Access ALLways method. Laurel is interested in solving problems, whether the correct method is a story, software, a dance, hardware, or process organization.\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop 2021\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"
