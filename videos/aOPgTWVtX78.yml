description: "Have you ever wondered, who is delivering those packages everyone on the network is talking about and what they are? Why does the internet even get chopped in little packages and send all across the globe? Don’t they get lost? And do those which get lost ever find their way home?\n\nAs performance gets more and more important these days, lets step back from all of the optimization of the code and take a close look at what lies underneath.\n\nThis talk will cover everything you need to know about the link layer wrapped nicely with a golden bow.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
