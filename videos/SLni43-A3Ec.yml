description: "Dimitri Gielis\nDirector\nApex R&d\n\nI'll build an application live in the cloud and will go from Low code to customisations and full control. We'll start with creating the data-model with QuickSQL; the fastest way to generate your database objects and sample data. Next we build the initial application with BluePrint in Oracle Application Express; the fastest and most low code way to build a responsive database application. Finally I'll show how to customise and enhance the app programatically and get full control of what you want to do. As it's Live for the Code; I'll have hardly any slides (just as reference), and will do all demo's live and code :)"
