description: "This video will get you up and running with your first AI Artist using the deep learning library Keras!\n\nThe code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/AI_Artist\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nHere's the initial Google DeepDream blog post:\nhttp://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html\n\nA Deepdream web app:\nhttps://dreamscopeapp.com/\n\nThe Neural Style Paper:\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v2.pdf\n\nSome great info on convolutional neural networks:\nhttp://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Conv-Nets-Modular/\n\nYou should train this baby in the cloud using AWS. See ML for Hackers #4 for a tutorial on how to use AWS:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKmIVU8EUbw\n\nThis person went ahead and made a web app so you don't even have to compile the code to try this out:\nhttps://deepart.io/\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page. If you like my videos, feel free to help support my effort here!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&u=3191693\n\nMuch more to come so please subscribe, like, and comment.\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
