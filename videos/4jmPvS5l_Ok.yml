description: "TestCon Vilnius 2016. Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt\n\nDeploy and Destroy Complete Test Environments: Service Virtualization, Containers and Cloud\n\nSick of others telling you when you can and can’t test? Of bureaucracies that make getting useful test data more difficult than a complete government overthrow? Of territorial disputes preventing you from accessing all the dependent systems and services you need for testing, configured the way YOU want? Don’t take it sitting down – fight for your freedom to test on your own terms!\n\nWith service virtualization, containers, and cloud, you can spawn whatever complete test environment you want, at your beck and call."
