title: 'CON3249   JavaServer Faces in Action'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450064353
description: "JavaServer Faces (JSF) is still one of the most popular Java web application frameworks. JSF 2.2, which marks the latest evolution, ships with Java EE 7. This release includes a few major features plus several other enhancements and bug fixes. Even though HTML5 has always been supported, itâ€™s easier than ever with HTML5-friendly markup. Faces flows enable you to package up navigation, pages, and code into easy-to-manage modules. Resource library contracts enable you to swap sets of templates, images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files across your application, simplifying customization for different clients or deployments. Come to this session to see demos of these features as well as proposed features in JSF 2.3, live, in action.\n\nSpeaker Bio: Marty Hall, President, coreservlets.com\nYou can see Marty's more detailed bio at http://courses.coreservlets.com/about-instructor.html and you can email him at hall@coreservlets.com.
