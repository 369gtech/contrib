description: "Business track breakout session presented by Cornelia Davis, Platform Engineer, Cloud Foundry, Pivotal; and Catherine Spence, Principal Engineer and Architect, Intel.\n\nHackathons are fun events where developers innovate, learn and build development communities. Whether conducted in an academic setting or a corporate one, the aim is to rapidly produce functional code implementations focused around one or more designated themes. Cloud Foundry is a perfect target platform for hackathons, since it supports fast application deployment for continuous integration, abstracted infrastructure, and ample technology choices in terms of buildpacks and services. For those less familiar with cloud computing, Cloud Foundry provides an ideal opportunity for participants to be introduced to new application hosting techniques (Platform as a Service) and learn keys concepts of building applications for the cloud.\n\nIn this session we will share our experiences in leveraging Cloud Foundry in support of numerous hackathons. We'll discuss what worked well, and less so, and we will share with you why and how you can deliver your own hackathon event."
