description: "Java Buildpack in 2017 [B] - Ben Hale, Pivotal  \n\nOver the years, the Java Experience team has worked hard to ensure that Cloud Foundry was the best place to run Java applications in the cloud. To that end, we ensure that every year adds new functionality, new integrations, and improves what's already there. This session will discuss some of the exciting new integrations as well as the recent improvements made to JVM memory calculation.\n\nBen Hale\nPivotal Software, Inc.\nCloud Foundry Java Experience Lead\nBen Hale leads Pivotal's efforts to constantly improve the Java experience on Cloud Foundry. Recently he has been working on the Cloud Foundry Java Buildpack with an eye to making it the best place to run Java applications, in the Cloud or otherwise. In addition, he leads the team that is revamping the Cloud Foundry Java Client, a Java language binding on top of the Cloud Foundry REST APIs. Prior to working on Cloud Foundry, Ben worked on large-scale middleware management tools, tc Server, dm Server (OSGi), and Spring. If you go back far enough, he even worked on a network management and monitoring application, but will deny it when asked. Ben has been a regular on the conference circuit for the last 10 years, speaking at Spring One, Cloud Foundry Summit, Devoxx, No Fluff Just Stuff, and more."
