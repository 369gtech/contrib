description: "We are problem solvers. We love looking at the world, seeing a problem, and attacking it with everything we've got. At the end of the day, things work and everyone goes home happy. Except that almost never happens.  \n\nAs developers, we try to approach every problem with code but weâ€™re limiting ourselves to a single tool in the toolbox. If we tried to understand the details and implications of the problem, we might learn that code is the last thing we should use. This applies in our projects and work and the world as a whole because - as problem solvers - we have responsibilities to the people down the hall, across the street, and even the people sleeping on the street."
