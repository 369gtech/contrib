description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nDo engineering teams have to be static? Could you form them, disband them or adjust their composition on a regular cadence to adapt to business needs? Could you go as far as letting your engineers decide themselves what to work on while keeping everyone aligned?\n\nWould it be a recipe for disaster? Or would it give you the flexibility to work on what has the highest business impact while increasing engagement and developing your future leaders?\n\nIn this talk, I'll describe how my team adopted self-selection and self-organisation and how we scaled those practices to 60 people. I'll share with you our recipe to:\n\nSuccessfully plan quarters when managers can't assign engineers to projects anymore,\nEngage with stakeholders,\nSet constraints to encourage positive behaviour,\nCreate alignment and track progress through OKRs.\nYou will leave with a renewed understanding of what Agile means at its core!"
