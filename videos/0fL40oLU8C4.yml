The presentation will include a description of the CKalcuƛator and our motivation for bringing functional programming into the musical paradigm. Central to the presentation will be a performance by the presenters where the pianist is working with the CKalcuƛator and the results of her CKalcuƛator operations are passed onto the live coder working in SuperCollider.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/felipe-ignacio-noriega\n\n---\nTHE SPEAKER - ANNE VEINBERG\nCodeKlavier\n\nAnne Veinberg is an Australian pianist based in the Netherlands and is co-creator of the CodeKlavier together with Felipe Ignacio Noriega.
