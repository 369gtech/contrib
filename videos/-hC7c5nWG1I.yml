description: "What does it take to create a FontAwesome equivalent for comics? \n\nS. Anand delivers this talk for:\n1. JavaScript developers who want to include comics in their pages\n2. JavaScript developers who want to understand gotchas in library packaging\n\nAnand shows what it takes to express data visualizations by evoking emotions â€“ in the form of comics. He talks about the JavaScript utility that his team at Gramener created. This library, called ComicGen, breaks down comic characters into structured components (and how you can break down arbitrary images similarly in JS). The library also allows drawing and composing these images using data. ComicGen handles problems with static content and async loading on CDNs.\n\nEVENT:\n\nJSFood 2019\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ys4qtpUogg"
