description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nIn the last year we started a lot of new projects on kubernetes and discovered that all teams started to build their own pipelines that had a lot in common: automated quality gates, blue/green or canary deployments, automatic switching of feature flags depending on performance metrics. To consolidate we built a new open source framework that automates the orchestration of a container from first push to the registry until it ends up in production. In my session I will demo keptn (https://keptn.sh/) - its main use cases - and how it fits into existing pipelines and DevOps tools because we believe that every company has their unique set of tools and processes already which needs to be integrated."
