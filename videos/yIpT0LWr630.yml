description: "Nikola Dipanov, Facebook\n\nMonitoring a.k.a figuring out what production code is doing is extremely important for an SRE organization. Monitoring services the right way can have a profound impact on how we do SRE. Modern software systems can be incredibly complex, code running on thousands of machines, depending on services we don't control and running code on user devices. Observing behavior of such systems means we have to change how we think about monitoring.\n\nThis talk will go over what a modern monitoring infrastructure for running software at scale looks like:\n\nAsking the right questions—how to decide what to monitor\nTypes of data we want to collect and what answers it can help us find\nA look at how we build services at Facebook\nCollecting, storing and querying monitoring data at scale\nWhen things go wrong—what makes for a good alarm and what makes a bad one\nPutting it all together—debugging an outage using data\nAs an attendee, you will come out of the talk with fresh ideas about logging and monitoring. You will hear how we tackle these problems at Facebook, and why we do things the way we do.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
