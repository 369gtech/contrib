title: 'Pseudofractals! Accidental Aesthetics Where Math Meets Pixels'
language: English
recordingDate: 1528732800
description: "Computers have their own aesthetics, which come from their limitations. \n\nIn this talk, I’ll show you a family of glitch art that is so fundamental to the idea of pixels that it has been independently rediscovered, repeatedly, ever since humans first started asking machines to print drawings on paper. \n\nEvery researcher who has found these has given them a new name – they’ve been called CIRCLE2 algorithms, dot-matrix holograms, degenerate Voronoi patterns, and others – but I think “pseudofractals” is the most evocative descriptor. \n\nI’ll talk a little about the mathematics behind these patterns (the Nyquest limit! Chromogeometries!), and I’ll show how you can experiment with creating your own variants in JavaScript, WebGL, or the language of your choice.\n\nEVENT:\n\n!!Con 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJes Wolfe\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoqQQwP1Duo&t=342s"
