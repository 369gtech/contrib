description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nAugust 6, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nWeb advertising, hasn't delivered its potential value to advertisers. This is partcularly true for contextual advertisement. The main problem is that the marriage of ad and the content of a page is based on algorithms that do not offer satisfactory results in understanding the actual meaning of the content of a web page. Try the search \"stock base\" in Google or Yahoo. You will get many more pages about equities than you do about soup. Yet the ads placed on these pages are too often not related to the main topic of the article. Showing an ad about food when the intended use of \"stock base\" was in the context of equities it's a mismatch.\r\n\r\nExpert System now offers a revolutionary solution that automatically processes the meaning of the text to ensure that the ads selected are relevant. Expert System's CSA (Cogito Semantic Ad) relies on its Semantic Intelligence technology to analyze text on the page through linguistic analysis and Semantic Comprehension to assure that promotional information can be served more effectively. \r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Marco Varone\r\nFounder, CTO, and Director of the Board of Expert System, Marco is the \"father\" of the technology behind the Company's products and a key driver of the Company with his vision and technical skills. Marco is responsible for the R activities and roadmap in the software and linguistic areas. Marco holds a degree in Computer Science at the University of Modena with honors. \r\n\r\nSpeaker: Luca Scagliarini\r\nLuca Scaliarini is VP of Strategy and Business Development for Expert System and responsible for the international expansion and strategic alliances. Prior to joining Expert System, Luca was VP Field Marketing Europe with think3 Inc., and Manager of the Services Product Line at SiteSmith, a managed services provider, where he helped to build the company up to the successful sale to Metromedia Fiber Network. Luca started his career with Hewlett Packard in product marketing roles in Italy and in the US. He holds an Electronic Engineering Degree from Politecnico di Milano and an MBA from Santa Clara University."
