Monolithic codebases have fuzzy boundaries of ownership, massive teams with distributed accountabilities and intertwined dependencies. As you consider a microservices architecture don’t forget the cultural changes that need to be made. Nimble teams with autonomy, accountability and stellar communications are the key to agility.\n\nAbout Sarah Novotny (NGINX):\nSarah Novotny is a technical evangelist and community manager for NGINX.

It's also a fast-moving discipline, where entire suites of best practices become obsolete overnight.\n\nThe O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference is a new event designed to provide the necessary professional training that software architects and aspiring software architects need to succeed. A unique event, it covers the full scope of a software architect's job, from IT to leadership and business skills. It also provides a forum for networking and hearing what other professionals have learned in real-world experiences.\n\nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media by Email - http://goo.gl/YZSWbO\nFollow O'Reilly Media:\nhttp://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OReilly\nhttps://twitter.com/OReillyMedia"
