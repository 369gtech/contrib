description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBeyond the Hype: Cloud Native eBPF - Frederic Branczyk, Polar Signals\n\neBPF being a promising technology is no news, but for a long time eBPF has struggled with portability, it needed to be compiled for each kernel, or a compiler and kernel headers needed to be shipped executing effectively arbitrary code. The eBPF community acknowledged this and started the CO:RE (compile once-run everywhere) initiative, which is young but quickly maturing in the form of libbpf. Parallel to it, we are discovering more and more use cases where eBPF can be useful, especially when combined with Go and Kubernetes, from security, over observability to performance tuning. In this talk, Frederic will explain what libbpf does in order to achieve compile once-run everywhere, how it can be used in Go, and lastly how to bridge the low-level Kernel features to higher-level Kubernetes concepts like Pods, and demonstrate all of it with real-life examples to help measure and improve performance systematically."
