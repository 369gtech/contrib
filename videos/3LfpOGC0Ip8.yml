His friend Ada, Countess of Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron, completed some of the first programs for the machine, and theorised that one day it could be used for the manipulation of any kind of information. Unfortunately Ada died young and Babbage never built his Engine, leaving their story as one of the greatest what-ifs in the history of science.\n\nSydney Paduaâ€™s cult webcomic \"The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage\", now a bestselling graphic novel, combines extensive research with alternate-universe comic-book escapes, where the mechanical computer is finally completed and used to build runaway economic models, defeat spelling errors, and of course, fight crime. In this talk she will tell the story of these two fascinating and brilliant eccentrics, and walk through her 3-d animations of how the Analytical Engine would have looked and operated, some of the first visualisations ever created of that extraordinary machine.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- An outline of the history, mechanics, and programming of the 19th century Analytical Engine\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Anyone interested in the pre-history of computing, mechanical computing, or looking for a light-hearted fun talk.\n\nAbout Sydney\n\nSydney Padua is a cartoonist and visual effects artist whose animation appears in The Iron Giant, Clash of the Titans, and the upcoming Jungle Book. Her webcomic \"The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage\" has been featured in Wired and The Economist and she has spoken at Microsoft, Google, the BBC, and the Computer History Museum."
