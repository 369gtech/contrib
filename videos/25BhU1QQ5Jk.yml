title: 'APEX Authentication and Authorization with Identity Cloud Service'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624634132
description: 'Having visibility into who can access your application is critical in the application development process. Apex is built with the ability to create roles and permissions, but this video takes it one step further through the integration with Oracle Identity Cloud Service (IDCS). Users will be able to login to APEX applications with their own IDCS credentials based on an authentication scheme linked with IDCS. The access can be even more granular through group authorization schemes by only allowing certain IDCS users or groups to have visibility into distinct pages or data within your application. #apex #oracle #cloud'
