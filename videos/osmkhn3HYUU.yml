What Do You Do When the Tool You Rely On is the Cause? - Ana Calin, Paybase & Risha Mars, Buoyant \n\nA service mesh is an increasingly necessary tool when running and debugging modern applications. But what do you do when there’s a bug in the mesh itself?\n\nPaybase offers the most flexible, developer-native, API-driven solution for payments, compliance and risk. They use the Linkerd service mesh to process all requests that come through their complex system of microservices, where it is highly useful for out of the box gRPC load balancing which allows Paybase to scale their application.\n\nIn this talk, Ana and Risha will talk about different Linkerd bugs that Paybase encountered after deploying Linkerd to their staging environment, and how they worked with the Linkerd maintainers to track them down and squash them.\n\nThis talk also explores the relationship between companies that rely on open source software and their interactions with maintainers in the path to getting bugs fixed."
