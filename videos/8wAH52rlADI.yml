description: "Recorded at PyData Frankfurt Meetup.\n\nJoin us on meetup: https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Frankfurt\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PyDataFFM\n\n\nStoring and processing data efficiently is an integral part of successful data-driven applications. An efficient and scalable way to store big data is by using object stores of public cloud providers like ABS, S3 or GCS. These storages come with downsides attached which make the management of tabular data distributed over many objects not a trivial task.\n\nKartothek is a recently open sourced Python library we develop and use at Blue Yonder – JDA Software to manage tabular data in cloud object stores. It is built on Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet and is powered by Dask. It’s specification is compatible with the de-facto standard storage layouts used by other big data processing tools like Apache Spark and Hive but offers a native, seamless integration into the Python ecosystem.\n\nFlorian Jetter started his career at Blue Yonder – JDA Software by building and running machine learning models. Eventually, he got frustrated by slow and inefficient data pipelines and built libraries and tools to support his fellow Data Scientists and Engineers. His focus quickly shifted from Machine Learning to Data Engineering and he leverages the knowledge of both worlds to build a reliable data platform.\n\n----\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
