title: 'Ellen Shapiro - The Triumphs and Tribulations of Kotlin-Native in Practice'
language: English
recordingDate: 1555576962
description: "The promise of Kotlin/Native is intriguing: Write pure Kotlin code that, using the LLVM compiler, can be compiled to run natively practically anywhere. As Android developers, it's a particularly attractive proposition since quite a bit of Android development is already done in Kotlin - you wouldn't have to learn a whole new language, but you could work on new platforms. But what happens when you try to take that promise and use it to implement a real-world iOS and Android application? \n\nIn this session, you'll hear the tale of a developer who's written separate native iOS and Android apps for years, and what happened when she worked to build out an app using Kotlin/Native. \n\nWhat are the things that work well? What are the things which are still a hot mess? \nWhat do Android developers need to be aware of when trying to write Kotlin code for iOS? \nWhere do platform differences still matter? And how do you avoid the classic cross-platform pitfall of \"Write once, run everywhere poorly?\" by making good decisions about where to use shared code and where to avoid it?"
