In case it is hard only for the library implementer then it is not that bad. The problem arises when it also affects the users of this library.\n\nThis talk is summarizing my experience and thoughts gathered during the implementation of the Physical Units Library for C++. The way we do template metaprogramming now results with inscrutable compile-time errors and really long type names observed while debugging our code. That is mostly caused by aliasing class template specializations of non-trivial metaprogramming interface designs. Compilation times of such code also leave a lot of room for improvement, and the practices we chose to use in the Standard Library are often suboptimal. Taking into account the Rule of Chiel while designing templated code makes a huge difference in the compile times. This talk presents a few simple examples (including the practices from the C++ Standard Library) of achieving the same goal in different ways and provides benchmark results of time needed to compile such source code.\n— \nMateusz Pusz\nEpam Systems | Train IT\nChief Software Engineer | C++ Trainer\nGdansk, Pomeranian District, Poland\n\nSoftware architect, chief developer, and security champion with more than 14 years of experience in designing, writing and maintaining C++ code for fun and living. C++ consultant, trainer, and evangelist focused on Modern C++. His main areas of interest and expertise are code performance, low latency, stability, and security.\n\nMateusz worked at Intel for 13 years and now he leads C++ Community at EPAM Systems. He is also a founder of Train IT that provides C++ trainings to corporations. Mateusz is an active voting member of the ISO C++ Committee (WG21) where, together with the best C++ experts in the world, he shapes the next official version of the C++ language. He is also a member of WG21 Study Group 14 (SG14) responsible for driving performance and low latency subjects in the Committee. In 2013 Mateusz won “Bench Games 2013” – worldwide competition in the C++ language knowledge.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
