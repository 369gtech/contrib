description: "It's easy enough to get a build pipeline setup and operational for one team, or even a handful of teams. But in a large organization that requires compliance, governance, and coordination across 100s of teams, putting good build pipelines in place takes some enterprise gumption. After years, we've scaled up CI/CD to many teams. There have been some lessons learned here which we'll cover. Using CI/CD is required as part of the overall software life-cycle to get the all the warm and fuzzy cloud-native benefits, and hopefully this talk will help you get over the hurdles in your organization so you can start worrying about creating high quality software instead of tinkering with your build.\n\n\n\nSlides: TBA\n \nMatt MacKenny, Director of Software Quality, The Home Depot\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
