description: "Mike Williams will be giving this talk at London Erlang Factory Lite on the 8th of November: https://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/London2012\n\nMike Williams joined with Bjarne DÃ¤cker to found the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory 1980. One of the things they did in the Computer Science lab was to \"invent\" Erlang. Mike's role was to develop the first  Erlang virtual machine  (Joe developed the compiler and machine  architecture). He worked out the primitives for fault handling and  dynamic code replacement.\n\nThe Ideal Programmer - Why They Don't Exist and How to Manage Without Them?\nFor many years, I have been trying to define the \"ideal programmer\" only to come to the realisation that they don't exist. This talk will be about the people and skill you must have in your team if you are to run a successful project. It will also touch on what you need to avoid as well."
