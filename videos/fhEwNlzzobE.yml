title: 'Visual building for Next.js - Yang Zhang - (Next.js Conf 2021)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635396163
description: "Next.js is an amazing platform for developers! But non-developers — even with today's headless CMSes — depend entirely on resource-strapped engineering teams. What if we could empower anyone to directly create production-grade experiences within our Next.js app as easily and safely as editing a document or using a design tool? In this talk, we'll look at Plasmic, a headless page builder and visual CMS for Next.js apps. With a hackable core editor, we'll see how Plasmic enables non-developers such as marketers and designers to iterate rapidly and autonomously — freeing up engineering and letting the entire team move incredibly fast.\n\nYang Zhang\nCo-founder at Plasmic"
