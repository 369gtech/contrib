description: "Friday, March 5 | 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM Pacific \n\nJoin us as we talk with Luis Cabrera about how find meaningful insights using new capabilities in Azure Cognitive Search. Then we will check in on some cool frameworks with Suraj Subramanian of PyTorch. Stay tuned after as we get back to work on building our Roshambo game!\n\nSemantic Search\nThe new semantic search capability in Azure Cognitive Search uses Bing AI models to help you find the most relevant information. This will be a discussion on how you can enable your enterprise and customers to find the right information quickly by using an engine that understands the meaning of words, not just syntax/lexical analysis.\n\nWe’ll explain how the system works, answer your questions, demo the capability and discuss its value. While we will use state of the art deep learning models, no prior machine learning background is required.\nAdditional information: \nhttps://aka.ms/AIShow/SemanticSearchBlog\nhttps://aka.ms/semanticsearchdocs"
