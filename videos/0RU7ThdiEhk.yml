title: '"Making Software Development Make Sense to Everyone" by Jen Myers'

recordingDate: 1614285540
description: "In the scope of history, the field of software development has just begun - but its reach and impact is growing so quickly and so robustly that there’s a real difficulty in keeping its growth both in perspective and in sync with the world at large. Computerization permeates almost all aspects of modern society, and those who make the computers work are some of the most sought-after professionals. Yet, we see challenges in finding enough quality developers, demonstrated imbalances in the numbers of minorities among the developers we do have, and confusion about the best ways to create educational pathways into the field. In short - software development, as a culture, could use a better human interface.\n\nLet’s understand why. Are the technical elements of developing software only suited to certain people? Are there artificial barriers in place that turn away beginners? Is software development meant to be an activity pursued only by a small elite? Are there other ways to communicate and educate about what we do? If so, do we need to explore them? Is what we’re doing already good enough?\n\nJen Myers\nDev Bootcamp\n@antiheroine\n\nJen Myers is a web designer, front-end web developer and an instructor at Dev Bootcamp Chicago, an intensive web development education program.

She regularly speaks about topics related to design, education and diversity in the technology field and focuses on finding new ways to make both technology and technology education accessible to everyone.\n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop conference (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Oct 2013."
