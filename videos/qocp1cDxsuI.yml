title: 'Serverless in production, an experience report - Domas Lasauskas & Yan Cui'
recordingDate: 1518776923
description: "AWS Lambda has changed the way we deploy and run software, but this new serverless paradigm has created new challenges to old problems - how do you test a cloud-hosted function locally? How do you monitor them? What about logging and config management? And how do we start migrating from existing architectures?\n\nIn this talk Yan and Domas will discuss solutions to these challenges by drawing from real-world experience running Lambda in production and migrating from an existing monolithic architecture."
