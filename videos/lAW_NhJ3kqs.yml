language: English
recordingDate: 1540396941
description: "Sergey Kuksenko, Java Performance Engineer, Oracle\n\nThe new HTTP Client API, incubated in JDK 9 and reincubated in JDK 10, has been standarized in Java SE 11. This session first provides the background of the API, its history, and its evolution through JDK 9 and JDK 10 and then moves on to the specifics of what has been standardized in Java SE 11. The presentation looks at how to use the API to perform common tasks such as issuing an HTTP request and receiving the response asynchronously, how to chain asynchronous tasks depending on the response, and how the API leverages Reactive Streams and can interoperate with various RS implementations."
