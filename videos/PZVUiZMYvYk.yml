title: 'LISA15 - What Is Federated Identity and Why Should I Care?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639009237
description: "What Is Federated Identity and Why Should I Care?\n\nRob Crittenden, Red Hat\n\nFederated identity lets you outsource authentication to a trusted third party, eliminating the requirement to manage a set of users in each web application. There are several specifications that implement this, for different targets. SAML is generally interesting to enterprises and provides features like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Single Logout (SLO). OpenID is a specification sponsored by Facebook, Microsoft, Google and others, and is generally consumer oriented.\n\nFederated identity servers support a number of common authentication mechanisms from username/password, Kerberos, LDAP, one-time passwords, etc.\n\nThis talk will provide an introduction to Federated Identity providers: what they are, what they are not, and how and when they can be used.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
