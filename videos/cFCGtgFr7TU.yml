title: 'What''s going on at Microsoft? Power Platform, Bots, Teams etc'
recordingDate: 1601018648
description: "Microsoft is on a mission to democratise development to \"normal\" people, and their Power Platform is getting a lot of attention. But, what does that mean for developers?\n\nI'm here to tell you it's definitely nothing to fear, but also not something to ignore. It will make your life easier, save you from boring projects and let you concentrate on the fun stuff, like building bots, or integrating your product into Microsoft Teams.\n\nWe'll talk about all of that as well, with demos and (I hope) 2-way discussion. If your organisation is using Microsoft 365 then I guarantee you will get something out of this talk.\n\n## About Tom\n\nTom is a Microsoft Teams Platform developer and Microsoft MVP who has been blogging at https://thoughtstuff.co.uk for over a decade. He works at Modality Systems, a specialist provider of Universal Communications services, as Product Innovation Architect, with responsibility for delivery of the Modality Systems product portfolio.\n\nHe lives in Norfolk in the UK, travelling internationally to speak about Microsoft Teams development, Office365, Bot Framework, Cognitive Services and AI, and the future of the communications industry."
