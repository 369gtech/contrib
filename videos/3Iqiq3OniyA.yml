description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nEva Andreasson - Cloudera\nDean Wampler - Big Dataist, O'Reilly Author\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Big Data landscape, including Hadoop and NoSQL databases, continues to evolve and mature. New trends include the growth of alternatives to MapReduce, such as Spark, and the resurgent interest in SQL, and the increasing importance of complex event processing at scale. This session will bring you up to date on the state of the art, motivated by example problems that people are solving with Big Data. We’ll explore the landscape and the tools it offers for particular problems. Then we’ll dive into several specific technologies, including Spark for event processing and batch-mode analytics, and new SQL-based options for Big Data.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
