description: "Ben Woods\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/175/\n\nCelebrating 25 years of FreeBSD ports - the \"App Store\" that existed before the term was claimed as trademark. But have you looked under the hood to see how it works?\r\n\r\nThis presentation will provide an introduction to the FreeBSD ports tree works, including:\r\n- why the ports tree is required\r\n- the use case for ports, and how this has evolved over time\r\n- ports tree internals - how it works\r\n- ports development - examples of how to change an existing port, and how to create a new port\r\n- the road to becoming a ports committer, and how you can contribute to the ports tree\r\n\r\nThis presentation is targeted at people who are seeking the answer to the big question \"where do packages come from?\", and also to those looking to advance their use or development of the ports tree.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
