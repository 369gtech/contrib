description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nCompanies are expected to continuously entice customers with more (mobile) interactivity pushing existing core systems to their boundaries. We show the 5 architectural approaches we’ve encountered in bringing new capabilities to systems and round it off with two examples: a data replication, Hadoop & API driven backend enhancement as well as a step-wise renovation of UI capabilities.\n\nDominik Wagenknecht is a Senior Manager out of Accenture’s Vienna Office who defined and delivered the architecture of large scale transformations in many industries with a focus on next-generation data technologies.\n\nRoman Schiefer, originally from Carinthia, is a Consultant and architect out of Accenture’s Munich Office with experience ranging from doing flight simulators in C++ to state of the art JavaScript. One of the focal points of his work is bringing modern web technologies to life for large clients in the financial market.\n\nThis talk was held at the WeAreDevelopers Conference 2016 in Vienna, Austria: www.wearedevelopers.org"
