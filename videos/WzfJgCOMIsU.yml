title: 'JWT Authentication with AngularJS - Forward 4 Web Summit'
language: English
recordingDate: 1457373807
description: "JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are being prescribed as a panacea for webapp security, but you need to know your security basics before you can implement them with peace of mind. JWTs are a great mechanism for persisting authentication information in a verifiable and stateless way, but that token still needs to be secured.\n\nIn this talk, Robert Damphousse, lead front-end developer at Stormpath, will discuss JWTs and how they should be used for front-end applications. Examples will reference AngularJS, but the concepts are useful for React (or any other front-end framework). Topics covered will be:\n\n- Mitigating XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)\n- Mitigating CSRF (Cross-Site-Request-Forgery)\n- How to use cookies securely\n- Why JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are useful\n- Oauth2: Access Token, or Refresh Token? Answer: Both!\n- How to store JWTs in the browser\n\nhttp://forwardjs.com/\n\nAngular2 Training - Instructor-led online training from NewCircle:\nhttps://newcircle.com/instructor-led-training/core-angular2"
