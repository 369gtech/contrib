description: 'The security operations aspect of your Information Security risk management program is where the “rubber meets the road” — the tools and people you have to implement the process and procedures you put together to find the badness and put out the fires. How has the concept of security operations evolved, and where are we headed? There is plenty of buzzword bingo: UBA, UEBA, machine learning and artificial intelligence, network abnormality detection, the marketing conversations of evolving to that SOC of 2020 — what do all these really mean to you and your operations and which can be useful in your efforts to find the badness?'
