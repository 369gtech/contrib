description: "This video was recorded at virtual Code BEAM V Europe conference, which took place on 19-21st May 2021 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2021/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global​ \n\n---\n\nKeynote: Fireside Chat on code design\nby Eric Meadows-Jönsson and Ulf Wiger \n\nABSTRACT\nSource code is much more than a collection of characters which gets compiled into an executable program. It is the place where developers spend a lot of their working time, extending the existing software, as well as debugging and optimizing it. The vast majority of development takes place on an existing codebase. Frequently a large part of that code is written by other people, some of which are not even a part of the team anymore. It is therefore essential that the code gets organized in a way which allow the developers to be both, efficient and effective. But can this even be done, and if so, how exactly? Come and join us in this session, where we'll explore the challenges of designing a codebase written in BEAM languages, such as Erlang and Elixir.\n\n---\n\nSPEAKER -  Eric Meadows-Jönsson\nEric Meadows-Jönsson is a member of the Elixir core team and an active member of the BEAM community. Heis the creator of many libraries, including Ecto and the Hex package manager. \n\nSPEAKER - Ulf Wiger\nUlf Wiger has been using Erlang since 1992, bought the first-ever commercial license in 1993 and has been a full-time Erlang dev since 1996. While at Ericsson, he became something of an Erlang ambassadeur, speaking about the AXD 301 ATM Switch/Media Gateway and about how Erlang works in large industrial projects. After leaving Ericsson, Ulf joined Erlang Solutions as CTO. He then entered the Connected Device market first via the startup Feuerlabs, then as a freelance contractor to Jaguar Land Rover, and Lead Developer of GENIVI’s Remote Vehicle Interaction component. Ulf joined the Aeternity Core Team in 2017 and is now busy exploring and developing blockchain technology. In the Open Source arena, Ulf is perhaps best known for components like Gproc, Jobs, and Exometer. In his spare time, Ulf doubles as an opera singer and dabbles in politics.\n---\n\nCode BEAM V Europe\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2021/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
