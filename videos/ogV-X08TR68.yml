description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\nThe talk starts out setting the stage by a brief discussion of the 3 benefits microservices can bring, which is all about the flexibility the business gains through short lead times, ability to experiment and ability to scale. The main part of the talk is arund 3 concrete rules of thumb that guide decisions around what the responsibility of a microservice should be and a whether new ones should be introduced. Each rule is explained used examples I have encountered in real life projects. The 3 rules are:\n\n    1. The primary driver for scoping microservices is business capabilities\n    2. The secondary driver for scoping microservices is technical capabilities\n    3. The tertiary driver for scoping microservices is effieciency of work\n\nUsing these 3 rules, in my experience, leads to microservices that allows us to realize the benefits of microservices.\n\nTo round things off I explain tactics for for fixing the scopes of services when we get then wrong. Again there is good rule of thumb to follow, namely that when in doubt error on the side of slightly too large. I will show why this is a sane rule to follow."
