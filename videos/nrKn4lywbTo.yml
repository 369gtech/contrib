description: "PyConBY 2020\nPython track\n\nLibCST: modifying your source code for fun and profit  - Kirill Borisov\nPresentation  - http://tiny.cc/kirill_borisov\n\nWhat to do if you need to introduce code quality checks or big-scale refactoring or anything else that requires more care than simply running regexp over a codebase? Can you trust the Machine? Are there any tools that can help with that burden? This and many other questions are discussed in Kirill's talk. \n\nGeneral Partner - Wargaming  https://wargaming.com/ru/careers/\nWith the support of the Python Software Foundation https://www.python.org/psf/"
