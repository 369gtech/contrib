description: "When you’re new to an industry, you encounter a lot of new concepts. This is especially true with DevOps, a fairly young corner of tech where things move very quickly, by design. Some of the concepts we consider central to DevOps are actually pretty old, though, predating the birth of DevOps by a decade or more. Without this context for how things evolved, and for the specific ways in which software development was more difficult without the methodologies and toolsets we have today, grasping the \"why\" for modern abstractions can be difficult. Without understanding the \"why,\" learning to use a new tool well isn’t as easy as it could be.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn about the history of CI/CD: the birth of the concepts that led to what we have today, the slow evolution of tools along the way, and how this has fundamentally changed what software development looks like over the last thirty years.\n\nKat Cosgrove, Staff Developer Advocate at Pulumi\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/the-history-of-cicd"
