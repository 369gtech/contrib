description: "In this video, we'll make a super simple speech recognizer in 20 lines of Python using the Tensorflow machine learning library. I go over the history of speech recognition research, then explain (and rap about) how we can build our own speech recognition system using the power of deep learning.\n\nThe code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/tensorflow_speech_recognition_demo\n\nMick's winning code:\nhttps://github.com/mickvanhulst/tf_chatbot_lotr\n\nThe weekly challenge can be found at the end of the 'Make a Game Bot' video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGYU5t8MO7s\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://www.superlectures.com/iscslp2014/tutorial-4-deep-learning-for-speech-generation-and-synthesis\nhttp://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/machine-learning/speech-recognition-neural-networks/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFDU2GX4AqM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-sndkf7mCs\n\nPlease subscribe!

I don't work for anyone, although I did make a one-off video for OpenAI because I love them:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
