description: "Succinct data structures for python\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Fintry [PyData]]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Konstantin Ignatov\n\nThis is a presentation of and call for participation in development and testing of Python bindings to Succinct Data Structure Library.\n\nFrom Wikipedia: Succinct data structures can represent an object (such as a bitvector or a tree) in space close to the information-theoretic lower bound of the object while supporting operations of the original object efficiently. The theoretical time complexity of an operation performed on the classical data structure and the equivalent succinct data structure are (most of the time) identical.\n\nCurrently bindings are provided for:\n\n\nMutable bit-compressed vectors\nImmutable compressed integer vectors\nImmutable compressed bit (boolean) vectors\nRank and select operations on bitvectors\nWavelet trees\nComressed suffix arrays\n\n\nOriginal library:  https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite\nMost of examples from SDSL cheat sheet and SDSL tutorial are implemented.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
