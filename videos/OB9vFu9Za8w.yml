language: English
recordingDate: 1539211427
description: "John Miller offers an overview of the Emacs IPython Notebook (EIN), a full-featured client for the Jupyter Notebook in Emacs, and shares a brief history of its development. John covers the features of EIN that make it uniquely Emacs—starting and automatically logging into a Jupyter server from inside Emacs, connecting Python buffers to a running kernel, allowing for interactive evaluation, org-mode Babel support, Emacs debugger integration, and company-mode and Jedi auto-complete integration. John then explains how he uses EIN in his own work, with a simple case study of troubleshooting activity decline of highly chlorided alumina catalyst in a pentane isomerization chemical process.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
