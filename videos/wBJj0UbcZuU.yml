description: "Deep Dive: NATS - Colin Sullivan & Wally Quevedo, Synadia \n\nThe NATS project and its ecosystem have been continuously evolving since joining the CNCF and in this session we will share a retrospective of what is the current state of the art and overall direction of the project in terms of security, performance, reliability, and integration with other cloud native tools such as Kubernetes. If are you actively evaluating NATS and want to learn the latest best practices, are writing clients for it, production user or interested in becoming a contributor, then you should definitely attend. For those new to NATS, we suggest also attending the NATS introduction session. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grdm"
