Independently if you choose a domain driven design, hexagonal or even a simple MVC you can either add more files or keep increasing the ones you have. McCabe's cyclomatic complexity is that functions and methods that have the highest complexity tend to also contain the most defects.\n\nIn this talk, Marcelo will show you how using Handlers, Services, Finders and Values you'll be able to scale your codebase linearly in complexy and beautifully in sanity.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\n  LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/27159258\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
