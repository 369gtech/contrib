description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nIn this quick session, I would like to give an overview of some text to diagram free tools useful for software design / project management diagrams.\n\n---\nI'm an embedded software developer working currently in Vehicle Engineering domain. I'm part of a team helping my employer to build vehicle software platform for our next generation cars. My previous domain experience was mostly with embedded healthcare domain where I got the opportunity to work in various projects servicing healthcare giants like Toshiba, GE healthcare, Medtronic and Covidien.\n\nMy first programming love is C++ as it's the first language I learned in school when I was 15. As an embedded software developer, I usually get the opportunity to program in C and C++ interchangeably and occasionally Python too.\n\nI'm really happy to witness how C++ is growing from C++98 days to the upcoming C++23. However I'm struggling hard to get in pace with the language. CppCon is a gem and I am grateful for the opportunity and being titled as a \"CppCon Lightning talk speaker\".\n\nI'm interested in professional networking; learning and sharing knowledge; reusing best practices/standards from other software domains. You will often find me in many virtual meetups these pandemic  days.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
