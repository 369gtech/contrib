description: "Julie Kohler joins Scott Hanselman and shows you how to execute batch routing calls using Azure Maps as well as how to do matrix routing with a given set of origins and destinations. Batch geocoding enables developers to pass up to 1,000 routing queries with a single call while Azure Maps handles the processing in the background. For matrix routing, a developer can pass in a series of origins and destinations and get back the travel times and distances to make important decisions for their route planning for the day.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\nRoute Matrix, isochrones, IP lookup, and more added to Azure Maps (blog)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/477/01\n\nAzure Maps overview\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/477/02\n\nAzure Maps docs\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/477/03\n\nAzure Maps pricing\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/477/04\n\nAzure Maps Functional API reference docs\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/477/05\n\nCreate a free account (Azure)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/477/free"
