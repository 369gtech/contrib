description: "Intro + Deep Dive: Prometheus - Julius Volz, Prometheus & Richard Hartmann, SpaceNet \n\nPrometheus is an open-source monitoring system and time series database. It features a multi-dimensional data model with a powerful query language and integrates many aspects of systems and service monitoring: from the instrumentation of services over the collection and storage of metrics data, all the way to dashboarding and alerting. Native support for various service discovery mechanisms also make it particularly suitable for dynamic cloud-based environments. In the introduction, Prometheus co-founder Julius Volz explains the architecture of Prometheus and shows its advantages over traditional monitoring systems.  For the deep dive: Join Prometheus maintainers to learn more about the design, project goals and history of Prometheus. We will cover in depth concepts of Prometheus to enable you to get a better understanding of what it is all about. The talk will cover topics including federation, relabelling and PromQL joins. In the end, you will leave with an advanced understanding of Prometheus. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPiP"
