description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nIn this talk, I'll discuss the sort of systems we would like to understand better, and why I've found Julia a useful tool to approach them. I'll also discuss what it is about the Julia community at large I feel is great for scientists (and non-scientists!), and how programmers of any skill level can get involved.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
