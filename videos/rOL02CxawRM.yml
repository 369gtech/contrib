recordingDate: 1490596108
description: "There are always certain challenges when it comes to staying productive in a large JavaScript codebase. It becomes more difficult to see how things are connected, and introducing a change may cause more bugs and pain than it actually solves. TypeScript is about making JavaScript scale. TypeScript is where you can optionally define static types in the current state of the art JavaScript, and adhere to them as your principles. \nIn his talk, Ali is going to cover some of the cool things you can do in TypeScript and how he´s made use of TypeScript in some of Axis projects that helped the team develop faster and more reliably. \n\nSpeaker \nAli Arafati is a JavaScript enthusiast who takes pleasure in frontend development processes and tooling. He is fascinated by every single feature that ECMAScript brings to the table. During his time at Axis Communications he´s been working with different Web applications internally and also facilitating the daily activities in producing and maintaining Axis products. \n---------------------------------\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
