description: "Seth Kenlon\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/131/\n\nIf you're new to programming or new to Linux, you can learn a lot with Lua, the functional programming language used in popular game engines like Unreal Engine, Roblox, Cocos2d, Gideros, and many more.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial teaches you how to install Lua, how to programme simple scripts, and how to create graphical games using the LÃ–VE game engine.\r\n\r\nNo previous experience with programming or Linux is required.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
