description: "6th Annual Google Test Automation Conference 2011 (GTAC 2011)\r\n\"Cloudy With A Chance Of Tests\"\r\nComputer History Museum\r\nMountain View, CA USA\r\nOctober 26-27, 2011\r\n\r\nOpening Keynote: Test is Dead\r\nPresented by Alberto Savoia\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe way most software is designed, developed, and launched has changed dramatically over the last decade -- but what about testing? Alberto Savoia believes that software testing as we knew it is dead -- or at least moribund -- in which case we should stick a fork in it and proactively take it out of its misery for good. In this opening keynote of biblical scope, Alberto will cast stones at the old test-mentality and will try his darnedest to agitate you and convince you that these days most testers should follow a new test-mentality, one which includes shifting their focus and priority from \"Are we building it right?\" to \"Are we building the right it?\" The subtitle of this year's GTAC is \"cloudy with a chance of tests,\" and if anyone can gather the clouds into a hurricane, it's Alberto -- it might be wise to bring your umbrella.\r\n\r\nAlberto Savoia is Director of Engineering and Innovation Agitator at Google. In addition to leading several major product development efforts (including the launch of Google AdWords), Alberto has been a lifelong believer, champion, innovator and entrepreneur in the area of developer testing and test automation tools. He is a frequent keynote speaker and the author of many articles on testing, including the classic booklet \"The Way of Testivus\" and \"Beautiful Tests\" in O'Reilly's Beautiful Code.  His work in software development tools has won him several awards including the 2005 Wall Street Journal Technical Innovator Award, InfoWorld's Technology of the Year award, and no fewer than four Software Development Magazine Jolt Awards."
