description: "Full title of the presentation: \"Amplify! How to Get ‘Brainshare’ for your Tech Company in a Noisy Marketplace\"\n\nThere’s never been a time where our culture has been more saturated with marketing messages from every angle, every minute of the day. Translation: there’s never been a more challenging time for companies trying to get the attention, or 'brainshare,' of prospects, investors, and even current customers. \n\nAs consumers, we’ve all grown savvier about blocking and ignoring what we deem to be irrelevant messaging (\"noise\"), and grown intolerant with interruption marketing. Further, we don’t make a buying decision until we’re 100% ready. It's certainly difficult for marketers to reach us and influence us today. \n\nHow can you break through this cluttered new marketing landscape to get the attention of your desired audience? Join Shawna in this eye-opening session that will leave you will fresh ideas to capture more brainshare.\n\nPARTICIPANT OUTCOMES:\n•    Experience several real case studies from companies who captured more brainshare on all types of budgets\n•    Discover what is working today, and what's worth your time and money: influencers? social media? print? and more.\n•    Learn what’s NOT working, so you can re-purpose valuable resources more effectively\n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on Marketing Stage during Infoshare 2019."
