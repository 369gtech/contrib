description: "Python and Web Sockets\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Lammermuir]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Anton Caceres\n\nModern web-apps require bi-directional communication, reacting not only to user actions but also to server events. This can be achieved elegantly using Web Sockets, a protocol standardized by W3C to be a default tool for full-duplex connections on the Web.\n\nAlthough most web-frameworks do not support Web Socket integration out of the box, Python has multiple options available making it a piece of cake. This talk showcases integrating Web Sockets in Python web-apps, focusing on situations that can make good use of it and presenting implementations with most popular frameworks: Tornado and Django. We will explore a similar style but different underlying technologies of both, and finish with a live demo.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
