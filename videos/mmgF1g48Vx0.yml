description: "by John Griffith\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.114/containers_k8s_storage.webm\n\n\nThe popularity and use cases for Containers continues to grow, and storage features are quickly evolving to catch up.  In this talk we'll introduce a few of the latest features being added to CSI and Kubernetes.  We'll go through transferring PVCs across Namespaces, Cloning PVCs and Populating PVCs with data from external data sources.  We'll look at how these features are particularly useful in a Container world, and some of the new use cases that they open up.  Finally, we'll include some demos of the features in Kubernetes as well as where they are currently in terms of release status and when you can expect to see them in your Kubernetes deployment. \n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:30:00+01"
