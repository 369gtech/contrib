title: 'YOW! Connected 2016 Krzysztof Ko?mic - PhoneGap to Native - Rebuilding an Android App Inside Out'
recordingDate: 1486942813
description: "How do you change the fundamental technology your app is built in? How do you rebuild your app gradually, while still shipping regular updates? Those are the questions we faced as Seek, when we concluded PhoneGap, the quick-fix solution we had used to originally create our Android app, wouldn’t allow us to deliver the experiences and features we wanted.\n\nA common approach is to start with a clean slate - do a rewrite. It is a risky and costly approach and we opted for a different solution. Split the problem into smaller, distinct pieces and deal with them one by one. In four stages we went from fully web-based with almost no native capability, to having all the native flexibility we would have if we had started with a clean slate. In this talk, I’ll share the details of how we did it and what we learned in the process.\n\nKrzysztof is working at Seek where he’s responsible for delivering great app experience on Android. Previously he worked as a consultant specialising mostly in distributed systems. He’s passionate about building simple delightful software and high performance highly motivated teams.\n\nFor more on YOW! Connected, visit http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
