description: "DevOps. So hot right now. So hot your managers have jumped on the buzzword bandwagon and have told you to “make it happen”, but also not to subvert the company change process. You can do that, right?\n\nAs tech professionals, we know you can’t just exchange cash for DevOps, but how can you convince the higher-ups? Particularly when upper management won’t let go of the perceived safety of a slow-moving product delivery cycle.\n\nThis session looks at the realities of implementing DevOps in an organisation that is resistant to change. We’ll discuss the levels of technical and cultural change that you absolutely need, the barriers that commonly get in the way, and some techniques to get around them. Expect subtle and possibly even underhanded tips to get things moving in an environment that just wants to use the word “DevOps” without making the necessary changes."
