title: 'How To Test Your React App (unit / functional testing and CI pipeline tutorial)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632067202
description: "Automated testing by a developer is still a topic that is heavily contested. Developers continue to struggle to understand how to test their apps, when to test, and how to put this all together into a continuous integration pipeline. This process can be surprisingly simple with the combination of the right tools. In this live-coding session developers will learn how to create a web-app using React. Afterward, we will shift-left by adding some automated unit tests using Jest. Next, we will shift-right by adding some functional tests using Cypress.io. Finally, the developers will learn how to continuously build and test the web app through a Github workflow. \n\nBy the end of the session, the developers will: \n- Learn a bit about unit testing with Jest \n- Learn Cypress for functional testing \n- Put all of this together into a CI pipeline that builds and tests in a continuous manner.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
