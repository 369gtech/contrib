description: "Many people in the world don't really like their jobs. And most organizations are not healthy. They are badly prepared for increasing complexity and changing environments. Most managers know that organizations are complex systems. But few understand what that means for the way organizations should be managed. Complexity thinking suggests that we should seek a diversity of conflicting perspectives. It explains that organizations need experimentation, not just adaptation. And it says that most innovation happens by stealing and tweaking existing ideas to fit a new context. Ultimately, what organizations need is a \"management workout\".\nThis session offers some practices that make employees happier and your organization healthier, using complexity thinking.\n\n\nAbout Jurgen\n\nJurgen Appelo calls himself a creative networker. But sometimes he's a writer, speaker, trainer, entrepreneur, illustrator, manager, blogger, reader, dreamer, leader, freethinker, or... Dutch guy.\n\nAbout Agile Adria conference\n(agileadria.com)\n\nThis video is recorded at Agile Adria conference. Agile Adria is the biggest agile conference in southeastern Europe. It is organized by Agile Croatia, one of the most active agile communities in Europe. It is a regional event, intended to gather agilests from Croatia, Slovenia, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe focus on a great content. That's why our speakers are all top level experts from all around Europe and US. Also, to ensure a great content we set up a rule of NO SPONSORED TALK.\nThe second important thing that we pay attention to is networking. We want you to really enjoy during a conference, so our attendees enjoyed things like free wellness, free sauna, great hotel, party with live band etc.\nWelcome to a next Agile Adria conference!"
