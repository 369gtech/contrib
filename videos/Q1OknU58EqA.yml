Affecto is the forerunner in the field of Enterprise Information Management, operational solutions and GIS services in the Northern Europe and Baltic countries. Affecto has always focus on understanding the business and how to improve the processes, cut down time-to-market, enabling customer to exploit the key value levers required to succeed in a multi-brand, multi-segment, multi-channel, multi-product, multi-partner world. By focusing on these values Affecto turned to Agile, which helps to achieve its objectives.\n\nChallenges using Scrum in a project if your company is a sub-contractor\nJust imagine that You come to a different country and get a team of consultants with whom You need to do their first SCRUM implementation project. On top of that, it's not You who is managing the communication with the client, as You are only a sub-contractor. Not enough? You don't speak Official project language, what makes communication with the client VERY difficult. Want to know how it goes so far?"
