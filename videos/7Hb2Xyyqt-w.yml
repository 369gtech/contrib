There are great reasons for this as Vue brings a lot to the table.\n\nMichael will be exploring what Vue is and why we need it in the first place. He will also look at what Vue does that has developers so excited. Finally Michael will look at what itâ€™s like to work with Vue through the lens of updating an existing app to use Vue.\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
