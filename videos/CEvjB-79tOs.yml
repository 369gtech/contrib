recordingDate: 1530625299
description: "Chris Hill, Head of Systems Engineering, Infotainment, Jaguar Land Rover\n\nIn 2017, more enterprises have come to embrace the benefits of DevOps in order to deploy higher quality software at a faster pace. Although more enterprises are embracing this ideology, it can be difficult for development and sys admin teams to put it into practice. In this talk, Chris Hill, Head of Systems Engineering at Jaguar Land Rover, will explain how enterprises can successfully achieve complete DevOps by using the appropriate development tools that will encourage greater collaboration amongst developers and sys admins. Hill believes that tools like Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are vital to the DevOps process and, if, used from the beginning can reduce cycle time and prevent code from failing on someone else’s machine. As the Head of Systems Engineering at Jaguar, Hill led a development team of 18+ world-class engineers in DevOps, front-end, back-end, architects, and Linux developers focused on in-vehicle infotainment software. Based on Hill’s expertise, he will outline the benefits and best ways developers can use CI in a DevOps environment. Hill will detail the tools needed for successful CI use by teams, identify the common pitfalls, and detail what other aspects of DevOps work well with CI (such as version control).\n\nDOES18 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
