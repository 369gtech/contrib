description: "This talk was recorded at Scala Days New York, 2016. Follow along on Twitter @scaladays and on the website for more information http://scaladays.org/.\n\nAbstract:\nDeep Learning is taking data science by storm. Unfortunately, most existing solutions aren’t particularly scalable.In this talk, Andy will show how to easily implement a Spark­ ready version one of the most complex deep learning models, the Long Short­ Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, widely used in the hardest natural language processing and understanding problems, such as automatic summarization, machine translation, question answering and discourse. He also shows an LSTM demo with interactive, real­time visualizations using the Spark Notebook and Spark Streaming."
