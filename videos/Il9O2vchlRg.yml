description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nWith the ongoing transformation of StepStone's core application from monolithic to a service-oriented architecture, our frontend developers faced new challenge – how to implement a user interface in this new landscape of distributed systems. We decided to adapt the concept of micro frontends, which is service-oriented approach to frontend development. In this talk, I'll explain our reasoning behind this choice, show how we enhanced our software engineering processes in order to implement micro frontend approach, and share most valuable lessons we've learned during this journey."
