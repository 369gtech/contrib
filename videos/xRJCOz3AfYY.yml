description: "Welcome to The Math of Intelligence! In this 3 month course, we'll cover the most fundamental math concepts in Machine Learning. In this first lesson, we'll go over a very popular optimization technique called gradient descent to help us predict how many calories a cyclist would burn given just their distance traveled. We'll also follow the story of 2 data scientists as they attempt to find the Higgs-Boson (God particle) via anomaly detection. No collaborations, this is an independent course. \n\nCode for this video (with challenge details):\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Intro_to_the_Math_of_intelligence\n\nTypicalHog's winning code:\nhttps://github.com/TypicalHog/THCrypt\n\nSyllabus for this course:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/The_Math_of_Intelligence\n\nPlease Subscribe!
