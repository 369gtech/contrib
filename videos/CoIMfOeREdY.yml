description: "Microservices and Serverless in Python projects\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Moorfoot]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Jose Manuel Ortega\n\nMonoliths, microservices and now Serverless. Function as a Service (FaaS) platforms give us new ways to attack old problems. The possibility of executing functions as a service allows designing scalable and highly parallel applications, but on the other hand, this kind of applications require a particular programming style. For example, bundling dependencies and managing state is not trivial.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of tools and frameworks to help you code serverless applications with Python, and once you get started it is not complicated.\n\nIn this talk we will mention the advantages of Serverless and we will focus on the situations in which we can introduce it into our Python projects. We will use AWS Lambda for the examples.\n\nThese could be the main talking points:\n\nIntroducing Serverless and Function as a Service (FaaS) in Python projects\nAdvantages of Microservices and Serverless \nAWS Lambda functions with chalice\nTesting AWS lambda with docker\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
