title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2011: Stanislaw Osinski - Cluserting & Visualization of SOLR Search results'
recordingDate: 1545060760
description: "\"Solr's search results clustering plugin dynamically organizes search results into thematic groups. Being somewhat complementary to faceting, clustering can reveal relationships between documents returned for a specific query.\n\nIn this talk I will briefly demonstrate how to enable and tune Solr's search results clustering. I will also highlight some performance implications of dynamic clustering. To conclude the talk, I will show how easy it is to turn Solr's clustered search results into a simple yet eye-pleasing web-based visual search application.\n\nhttp://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/clustering-and-visualization-solr-search-results\n\nDescription of Stanislaw Osinski: http://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/stanislaw-osinski"
