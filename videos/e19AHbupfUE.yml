title: 'Enabling Self-Service Prescriptive Adoption of Native Services to Complement Application Workloads'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601026447
description: "The rich service portfolio of reliable, elastic, scalable, secure services is one of the reasons customers select AWS as their preferred cloud. In this session, we will discuss AWS-native services that customers are adopting that complement and evolve their application workloads. We will explore AWS services and integrations that allow customers a self-service prescriptive means of adopting native services. We will focus on options that cater to application platform teams specifically, as well as options for customers who desire a holistic and consistent approach for all teams, even those not making use of an application platform. We will compare and contrast developer experience, management, control and constraints of these options.\n\nRyan Niksch, Senior Solutions Architect at AWS\n\nSlides: link to come"
