title: 'Dirty Samba hacks to make your life easier'
recordingDate: 1548116665
description: "Kirin van der Veer\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/215/\n\nThanks to the proliferation of IoT devices Samba is everywhere.\r\nBut what if you want to use it the \"normal\" way? You know, as a DC and file server for a large number of users?\r\nWhat happens when you need to parse the directory for a list of disabled users and take action? Or have regular helpdesk guys deal with locked files?\r\nFor regularly running scripts what returns queries faster; pdbedit or ldapsearch?\r\nPerhaps you'd like to setup a linux based hotdesk that will automatically RDP into whatever workstation a user happens to be logged into elsewhere on campus. How to you remotely (and securely) request that information from Samba?\r\nHow about a website that acts as a password reset portal? (don't forget your input validation!)\r\nDuring this talk I will outline and demo a number of scripts and hacks used to make Samba work for our organization (including links to source code).\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
