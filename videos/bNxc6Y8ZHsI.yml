description: "Annie Hedgpeth, Cloud Automation Engineer at 10th Magnitude - ChefConf 2017\n\nWith the growing demand for developers, the IT industry is tasked with bringing more workers into the field. Stereotypes and ignorance are a major blocker to this initiative. With the shortage of security and compliance professionals combined with the industry's desire to move security left, it is dire that we think outside of the box to find a solution. My journey into technology (from a background in film and art) begins by learning the InSpec framework and creating a website and using version control for the first time to blog about my journey. I attained the skills necessary to become a cloud automation engineer in 4 months, and I am continuing the narrative into my consulting career by leveraging InSpec and moving security left."
