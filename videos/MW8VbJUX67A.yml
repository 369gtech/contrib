description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — \n\nYou may not have the kind of resources you need when you start. \n \nYour people have to spend a lot of time supporting the on-going development and release so they don’t have the time to work on automation.\n \nYour architecture may not be as clean and well defined as you would like.\n \nYou just started with test automation and your coverage is still very low.\n \nAbove all, your customer and delivery partners are doubtful of the new initiative and are not willing to change.\n\nIn this talk, I will share the story of a successful DevOps implementation in a traditional organization with many these constraints. My experience in leading this journey taught me that if you can take a realistic assessment of your situation and plan your implementation carefully, it is entirely possible for a traditional organization with large and complex computing environment to adopt DevOps practices, in order to deliver software faster with significantly better quality, and at the same time do it in a way that makes peoples’ lives much easier.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
