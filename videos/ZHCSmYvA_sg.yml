description: "Having Microservices without proper monitoring tools is like driving the freeway without lights at night. One of those proper tools is Prometheus.\n\nIn this workshop I will discuss the general architecture of Prometheus and some basics before we will dig into coding. We will implement some metrics with Java and Spring Boot and I will bring in some gotchas on having Prometheus in production. In general this talk is about getting started with Prometheus."
