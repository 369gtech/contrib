title: '"Xiki: GUI and Text Interfaces are Converging" by Craig Muth'

recordingDate: 1614374035
description: "A live demo of the new version of Xiki. Xiki is part of an emerging trend: the convergence of text and GUI. Xiki is like a shell console but better. It lets you execute shell commands and code snippets to controls your web browser, databases, APIs and other tools using text alone, right from a text editor. It uses an extremely simple wiki-inspired text syntax that unifies menu interfaces, files, and code.\n\nIn Xiki, you type out new menu interfaces as text, and immediately begin using what you typed (the text itself) as GUI menus. You then create inline code snippets, or any combination of dirs, classes, scripts (in various languages), templates, and data files to provide dynamic behavior.\n\nXiki can be used as an IDE, a rapid prototyping tool, an interface design tool, or an embedded library (a ruby gem) in other apps.\n\nSee demos of the simplified text syntax being used to quickly create elemental but useful menus, then scaling to create sophisticated interfaces for tools including git, mysql, mongodb, rails, node.js, rspec, jquery, threejs, and many others.\n\nYou can interact with Xiki menus you obtain or create via a text editor, a mobile-ish web interface, via shell commands, or as a web service.\n\nCraig Muth\n@xiki\n\n\nCraig Muth has been evolving Xiki for over 10 years. He is the founder of Memorize.com, and the founder/organizer of the ProtoNight.com pair programming hack events in San Francisco.\n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop conference (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Oct 2013."
