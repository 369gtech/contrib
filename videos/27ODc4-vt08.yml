title: 'GeeCON Prague 2019: E.Demƒçenko - Extending Cloud/Desktop IDEs, providing a new choice for developers'
recordingDate: 1579081218
description: 'Developers, using several programming languages at work, have a choice of IDE and can have the same language support because of new standards like the Language Server Protocol (LSP, https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/ ) and Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP, https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/). The majority of modern IDEs implement support for those protocols giving developers freedom to switch between languages or IDEs, Cloud or Desktop IDEs, or extend or build their own flavors of IDEs using frameworks like Eclipse Theia ( https://www.theia-ide.org/, https://github.com/theia-ide/theia ). Our team of developers build DevOps tools for mainframe developers who often need to work with Java, High-Level Assembler, Cobol or even TypeScript to support enterprise applications running in mission-critical infrastructure spread from mainframe to distributed systems. Our goal is to provide a choice of tools for developers and let them learn technologies, adapt to business faster and enjoy their work in such environment . In cooperation with several open-source communities like Eclipse Che ( https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.che ) , Eclipse Theia supported by RedHat, IBM, TypeFox, CA Technologies a Broadcom company and others we extend Eclipse Che and Theia platforms with our own implementation of LSP, DAP https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-che4z . We also use several languages in our own development, TypeScript for development of Explorer for z/OS https://github.com/eclipse/che-che4z-explorer-for-zos or Java for development of LSP for COBOL https://github.com/eclipse/che-che4z-lsp-for-cobol. Freedom for developer can look like this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcZaOlb98Ec&feature=youtu.be. This presentation is to share our experience with designing and building solution on cloud based IDE. We are going to review a set of cutting edge technologies developers may use to create platform agnostic solutions.'
