description: "Speaker: John Albin Wilkins\r\n\r\nIf you’ve used Sass, you know the advantages of nested rulesets. You may not know that there is an effort to bring nesting to the CSS spec. In fact, the CSS Nesting spec was upgraded from “Level 0” to a “Level 1” W3C Editor’s Draft last year. John will share with us about this cool new specification and also how to get involved and contribute.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://singaporecss.github.io/49\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
