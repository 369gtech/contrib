title: 'Arthur Schmidt (‎fREW‎) - ‎DBIx::Class - The Perl ORM‎'
language: English
recordingDate: 1403622132
description: "In this talk I'll discuss how DBIx::Class, the most popular ORM in Perl, can be used to the fullest. In the past I've done whirlwind overviews of DBIC features, shown a bunch of DBIC extensions, and even had whole talks based on cpan modules that have DBIC at their core. This year, I will take it a bit slower. I will mention DBIC features as well as some extensions, but the goal will be to have a solid understanding, instead of knowing about all the amazing features DBIC can offer.\n\nA big part of this talk will be explaining powerful SQL features, since ultimately DBIC is a powerful SQL generator with some object inflation tacked on"
