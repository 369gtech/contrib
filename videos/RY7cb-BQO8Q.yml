language: English
recordingDate: 1624351789
description: "In this session I'll take you through everything you need to build a robot arm with a Raspberry Pi, .NET 5 a Blazor App and SignalR.\nWe'll begin by seeing how easy it is to install .NET 5.\nThen we'll see how we've connected up the various components to our Raspberry Pi.\nNext we'll spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi.\nWe'll then examine the code to start moving the connected servos for our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.\nFinally we'll then look at a simple Blazor and SignalR app to control the robot remotely!\nThis session will appeal to all knowledge levels. A working knowledge of programming will help, but all the code will be shared on GitHub!"
