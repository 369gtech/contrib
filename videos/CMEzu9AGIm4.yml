description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #25\n11 July 2019\nSponsored by Weissbeerger and Hosted by Google for Startups Campus\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nThis talk will focus on the steps that are necessary to prepare your data for your data-driven product. In particular, we will focus on the practice of going from prototype to production.\nWe will delve into the process of building data pipelines, such as extraction, cleaning, integration and pre-processing of data.\nStarting from some common anti-patterns, we'll highlight the need for a workflow manager for any non-trivial project.\nWe will present a micro service pipeline based on AWS infrastructure. We will prove that the combination of EMR Cluster, Spark, Sagemaker and step functions can help you to be flexible in scale and cost.\nLast but not least, we will expose some pitfalls we encountered along the way while merging this infrastructure to a one single pipeline.\n\nStas is the Head of Architecture at WeissBeerger, with more than 10 yearsâ€™ experience in designing and developing enterprise applications.\nHe led Cloud projects based on cloud services provided by AWS and he is very experienced in Object Oriented Design, Domain Driven Design based on SOLID principles, deep knowledge in Design Patterns and System Architecture.\nDuring the past years, Stas led projects with complex integrations and business requirements by giving full technological support.\nOverall, his strong expertise includes dealing with analysis of complex problems in large systems, performance issues and complex infrastructure developments.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
