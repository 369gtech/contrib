description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nThis talk is to help you learn about how objects are represented in C++. I find it very helpful to have a mental model of how objects exist in the program memory space to understand how my code operates within program execution.\n— \nRichard Powell:  I started using C++ 10 years ago to write a psychoacoustic audio encoder/decoder and have continued to explore how to make software that unlocks the potential of hardware to bring amazing applications to life. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and worked throughout the Bay Area for the past 15 years. I enjoy teaching and learning about C++ and programming.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
