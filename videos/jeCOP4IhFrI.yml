description: "Sometimes we are not sure if using a specific tool is a good decision or not. How many libraries are available in the market? What will become standard? And, what is just a hype?\n\nPWA sounds like a new framework, or a tool to create some sort of web apps. Many developers link it to JavaScript, and that is only achievable with one of those new framework.js out there.\n\nI’ve been wondering about the truth of this previous statement, can we create a PWA in, let’s say, pure Java? I did some research and I’m going to present my findings.\n\nIn this presentation I will demonstrate how we can actually build modern web applications that qualify as \"Progressive Web Apps\"."
