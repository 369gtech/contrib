title: 'Alchemy For the Modern Computer Scientist - Erik Meijer'
recordingDate: 1528199264
description: "In ancient times, the dream of alchemists was to mutate ordinary metals such as lead into noble metals such as gold. However, by using classic mathematics, modern physicists and chemists are much more successful in understanding and transforming matter than alchemists ever dreamt of.\n\nModern computer scientists on the other hand are as unsuccessful as ancient alchemists in their quest to reliably turn formal specifications into code and to accurately understand the mechanics of side-effecting computation. Whereas modern alchemists, by using classic mathematics, have been extremely successful in mutating training data into pure functions using various machine learning techniques, in particular deep learning.\n\nThis modern form of software alchemy is often referred to as \"Software 2.0\" and will require a radical rethinking of the ancestral software engineering and programming practices that have been been developed in the second half of the last century\n\nIn this talk we will discuss how we are building new probabilistic frameworks and differentiable programming languages that support the composition and construction of learnable code, as well as how we can leverage machine learning at every level of the stack to make developers more productive and services and products more efficient.\n\nErik Meijer is Director of Engineering at Facebook\n_________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing and learning.\n\nBorn out of the desire to create a year round conference like atmosphere, Foo Café is THE place for planned and spontaneous meetings of all sizes and interests within the IT arena.\nEnjoy a coffee or a cold beer, along with light pub fare, and engage with other like minded individuals interested in sharing their knowledge and learning from one another. Foo Café is sourced by individuals, small, medium and goliath-sized enterprises, as well as entrepreneurs. Awaiting you, after stepping over the Foo Café threshold, is a space that is recruitment and product placement safe!\n\nWe look forward to igniting inspiration and creativity year round to patrons of Foo Café."
