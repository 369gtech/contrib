language: English
recordingDate: 1474333794
description: 'This session shows how the speaker used the Oracle Java Mission Control and Oracle Java Flight Recorder features of Oracle Java SE Advanced to record large quantities of data from the sensors in a little hobby project: a small autonomous robotic vehicle running Oracle Java SE Embedded. The session focuses on how to use Oracle Java Flight Recorder to great advantage where resources are scarce and where overhead can cause significant problems. It also discusses how to build custom integration for Oracle Java Flight Recorder, using APIs already available in Oracleâ€™s HotSpot JDK, and how the speaker went about designing, 3-D-printing, and building the actual hardware and software.'
