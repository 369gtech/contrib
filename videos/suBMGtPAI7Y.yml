description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nC++ 工作流：基于任务的并行计算和异步网络引擎 | C++ Workflow: Task-based Parallel Computing and Asynchronous Networking Engine - Yingxin Li, Tencent\n\n工作流是于 2019 年开源的。其不仅是面向 C++ 程序的 PaaS 级解决方案，而且还是一个整合了并行计算和异步通信的任务型模式。在 Sogou，C++ 工作流支持几乎所有的后台 C++ 在线服务，包括所有的搜索服务、云输入法、在线广告等。其每天会处理数百亿个以上的请求。不仅包括通信、计算、文件输入输出、计时器、计数器等异步资源，而且还包括创新引入的允许开发人员组装异步任务以实现复杂业务逻辑的任务流概念。其伴随多种通用协议和跨平台，支持多个操作系统，并且具备服务管理和负载平衡。其为一个整合了并行计算和异步通信的编程范型。去年，Yingxin Li 和她的同事们把焦点集中在了开源社区，这是一项巨大的挑战，也是一个值得分享的经验。因此，在本文中，Yingxin 将分享异步引擎中的任务型概念，也会介绍开源后对项目的影响。\n\nWorkflow is open sourced in 2019. It is not only a PaaS level solution for C++ programs, but also a task-base mode integrating parallel computing and asynchronous communication. In Sogou, it supports almost all back-end C++ online services, including all search services, cloud input methods, online advertisements, etc. It handles more than tens of billions of requests every day. Not only includes asynchronous resources such as communication, calculation, file IO, timers, counters, etc., but also the innovatively introduced task flow concept allows developers to assemble asynchronous tasks to implement complex business logic. It comes with a variety of common protocols, cross-platform, supports multiple operating systems, and comes with service management and load balancing. It is a programming paradigm that integrates parallel computing and asynchronous communication. Last year, Yingxin Li and her colleages focus on the open source community, which is a great challenge and also a worth sharing experience. So in this presentation, Yingxin will share the task-base concept in asynchronous engine and also present the influence to the project after open source."
