recordingDate: 1475689714
description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nstd::tuple＜＞has been gaining new abilities, like get-by-type in C++14 and conditionally-explicit constructors in C++17. This talk will begin by briefly summarizing what you can do with tuples in C++11 and C++14. Next, we’ll explore what’s new in C++17, and how it can improve your code. We’ll also delve into how this magic is implemented, with new metaprogramming tools like std::conjunction＜＞. Finally, we’ll look at active issues in tuple’s design, and what the Library Working Group is doing about them.\n— \nStephan T. Lavavej\nPrincipal Software Engineer, Microsoft\nStephan T. Lavavej is a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft, maintaining Visual C++'s implementation of the C++ Standard Library since 2007. He also designed a couple of C++14 features: make_unique and the transparent operator functors. He likes his initials (which people can actually spell) and cats (although he doesn't own any).\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
