title: 'Java Applications: At-Most-Once COMMIT Protocol and Capture/Replay Database Calls'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433261320
description: "Preventing end users from buying the same flight or book or paying taxes twice is an almost insurmountable challenge for online Java applications. The challenge is to make a reliable determination of the outcome of a COMMIT statement when a database outage happens and ensure at-most-once COMMIT execution. This session presents an API implementing an at-most-once COMMIT protocol and also presents a new JDBC datasource that transparently records the interactions of a Java application  with the RDBMS and then, in case of an outage, replaces Java objects (connection, statement, and the like) and attempts to replay RDBMS calls previously recorded, thereby ensuring applications continuity.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJean De Lavarene\nJean de Lavarene is Director of Development within Oracle's Server Technologies. He oversees the development of the Database access for Java. This year Jean will talk about Application Continuity, Transaction Guard, Table Access for Hadoop and in general how to best leverage the latest 12c Database features in your applications.\nView more trainings by Jean De Lavarene at https://www.parleys.com/author/jean-de-lavarene\n\n Kuassi Mensah\nKuassi Mensah is Director of Product Management for Database Access Drivers, Frameworks and APIs including JDBC, Java in the Database, UCP, DRCP, Application Continuity and In-Database MapReduce.\n\nMr Mensah holds a MS in Computer Sciences from the Programming Institute of University of Paris VI.
