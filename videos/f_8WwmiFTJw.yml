title: '18 Months to Migrate 800 Applications: State Farm’s Transformation Journey'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601026244
description: "As the number one insurer of cars and homes in the United States, State Farm® decided to modernize its internal cloud platforms and transform its applications to take advantage of cloud native architectures. In only 18 months, it undertook the daunting challenge of building out a new platform on Pivotal (now part of VMware Tanzu), migrating approximately 800 applications to the platform, and transforming how product teams delivered business capabilities using pipelines.\n \nThis session gives attendees an in-depth look at how State Farm reduced its release schedule from weeks to minutes while modernizing its technical stack for 800 applications. How did State Farm pull this off so quickly? What worked? What didn’t work? Join three State Farm IT leaders as they share their three-pronged approach to transformation that allowed them to be successful in a short amount of time.\n\nJeff Anderson, Architecture Manager at State Farm Insurance; \nRyan Alberti, Technology Manager at State Farm Insurance; \nMatt Hubbard, Technology Engineer at State Farm Insurance\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/18-months-to-migrate-800-applications-state-farms-transformation-journey"
