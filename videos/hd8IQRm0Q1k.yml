description: "It is cliche to say that we live in the age of information, but it is also profoundly true. Information (and access to it) shapes our thoughts and actions as a society, now more than ever. Control and political censorship of that information poses a systemic risk to democratic societies worldwide.\n\nIn this talk we will present the Archain project: a system of permanent data storage aiming to democratise the control and accessibility of information. As well as detailing the aims of the system, its technical implementation and potential effects, we will also discuss the use of Erlang as its base.\n\nArchain is a decentralised permanent information storage system, open to all, forever. Built on a novel blockchain-like data structure (a 'blockweave') that shards across many computers, the Archain is a public library and archive inside a cryptocurrency.\n\nAs well as taking a peek inside the Archain infrastructure itself, we will explore how Archain-based Erlang apps can be used to build incontrovertible election/voting systems, automated traders, and decentralised social media systems, among many other uses.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/sam-williams/"
