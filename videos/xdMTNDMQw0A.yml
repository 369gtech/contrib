title: '"Building optimising compiler for Dart" by Vyacheslav Egorov'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614437787
description: "In early 2012 we started working on a completely new compilation pipeline for the already mature Dart virtual machine. Dart designates itself as a class-based, object-oriented language with lexical scoping, closures, and optional static typing. But what does this mean for the JIT compiler? This talk tries to show how Dart's language features affected design of the compilation pipeline and how our experience with V8 JavaScript engine influenced our decisions.\n\nVyacheslav Egorov\nGoogle\n@mraleph\n\n\nVyacheslav Egorov is a software engineer at Google. He is primarily focused on technology behind virtual machines and compilers, contributing to V8 JavaScript engine and Dart VM. Before joining Google he worked on a Java VM with an ahead-of-time compiler at Excelsior LLC.\n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop conference (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Oct 2013."
