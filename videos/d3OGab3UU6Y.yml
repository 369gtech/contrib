title: 'Microservices, ‘Enterprise’ and Conway’s law (Maciek Próchniak, Poland)'
recordingDate: 1437558335
description: "Microservices are today’s hype. It seems that if you’re not doing them – you’re old fashioned and Doing It Wrong. But to do it properly you have to work in certain environment – ‘you have to be That tall’ as Martin Fowler wrote. In particular if you ignore things Conway’s law you’ll fail miserably.\n\nIn this talk I’d like to tell you about our (small agile software house working for Big Company) experiences – when is it possible to change the company you’re working for and when it’s better to accept its constraints – and what can you do to make it still a bit better place to live – which rules and practices seen on Netflix gorgeous talks can be easily used and which are more problematic.\n\nBe aware that I’ll use old-fashioned words like OSGi, but I’ll try to omit most technical details and focus more on bigger picture – how we tried to move from good (?) old ESB towards fashionable microservices and where and why we decided to stay."
