description: 'Only in the recent past have accurate and scalable methods for biometric monitoring and edge computing become possible, providing a unique opportunity to collect and analyze continuous physiologic measurements and enabling a new mechanistic understanding of acute and chronic diseases. We are focused on using digital health tools such as wearables and smart phones to uncover physiologic signatures of disease, which we refer to as digital biomarkers and that can serve as sentinels of disease onset. Overall, we aim to develop tools and infrastructure using digital health data for disease detection, monitoring, and intervention.'
