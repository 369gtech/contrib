description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotscale.io on April 24th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nDevOps is one of the buzziest of buzzwords thrown around for the last few years, but DevOps often means different things depending on who is speaking or listening. People say they want DevOps, but what does this really mean to them?\n\nStarting with the past and looking toward the future, Andrew outlines what DevOps means to him, the demonstrable impact of why DevOps matters and emphasizes how all the benefits are predicated on learning and changing behavior. Along the way, youâ€™ll hear about game theory, punctuated equilibria in evolution, and the Site Reliability Engineering book, all sprinkled with lively anecdotes, provocative euphemisms and pandas vomiting rainbows."
