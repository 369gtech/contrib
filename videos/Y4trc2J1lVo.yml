description: "This talk was recorded at Scala Days New York, 2016. Follow along on Twitter @scaladays and on the website for more information http://scaladays.org/.\n\nAbstract:\nA collection of horror stories that derive from a lack of best practices. Everything will be covered: How to make companies lose money, shutdown systems and disable payments (or worse) just from overlooking simple procedures that \"take too much time\" or \"cost too much\" to implement. We may even dim the lights at certain points in the presentation."
