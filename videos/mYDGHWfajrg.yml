recordingDate: 1497040066
description: "Mark Rambow & Nadezda Zryanina, AWS - ChefConf 2017\n\nChef solo is a great choice for simple and light infrastructure automation. We all used it back in the day. But with Chef Automate becoming more compelling every day (resource discovery, shared data bags, cookbook distribution, automated workflow, ...), many of us want to migrate to a Chef server. Instead of only promoting the \"why,\" this talk will also focus on the \"how\" and walk you through the migration of a Chef solo setup to a Chef Automate installation managed by Amazon Web Services and OpsWorks."
