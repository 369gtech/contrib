description: "Running .Net Apps on Cloud Foundry: Windows vs. Core - Zach Brown, Pivotal & Rita Zhang, Microsoft\n\nYou’re an operator responsible for running tens or hundreds of .Net apps  in production. Or maybe you're a developer who loves .Net. You’ve heard  that Diego introduced support for running .Net apps on a Windows stack,  but you also know that there’s a buildpack that supports .Net Core apps  running on Linux.   What is the best way to run your .Net apps on Cloud  Foundry?  In this talk we’ll share our experience pushing and running a .Net  application to a Diego cell running Windows 2012 r2, as well as pushing  and running the same application on Linux using the community ASP.Net 5  buildpack."
