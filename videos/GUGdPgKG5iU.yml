description: 'Every company wants to be world-class, so why do so few succeed in that? Anyone who has tried to make it big will tell you that sometimes it’s not just about hiring the right people or the technologies you have on your deck. Success takes a lot of planning, precise estimates, and being able to deal with unexpected changes. It might seem overwhelming, but it’s all about breaking it down into a few simple rules. In his talk, Saulius will be offering several principles to follow on a daily basis that will help any team produce world-class work and get rid of the excuses that prevent them from being the best in the game.'
