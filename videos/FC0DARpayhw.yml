title: 'Keeping the Balance: loadbalancing demystified'
recordingDate: 1548151899
description: "Murali Suriar\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/207/\n\nCan you explain the entire path that an IP packet takes from your users to your binary? What about a web request? Do you understand the tradeoffs that different kinds of load balancing techniques make? If not, this talk is for you.\r\n\r\nLoad balancing is hard, and it is made up of many disparate technologies. It cuts across network, transport and application layers. We'll describe different flavours of load balancing (network, naming, application) and how they work. \r\n\r\nWe will then discuss example use cases, and which load balancing approaches are most appropriate in each case. We'll also relate these to several design patterns for high-availability services that have developed over the years. Finally, we'll relate the techniques we've been discussing to well-known open source technologies and to the major cloud load balancing services.\r\n\r\nYou will come away with:\r\n- An understanding of various load balancing techniques, and some of their high points and pitfalls.\r\n- Some criteria by which to evaluate different load balancing technologies.\r\n- A framework of heuristics to use when deciding what load balancing pattern(s) to use with your service.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
