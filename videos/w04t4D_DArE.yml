description: "RubyConf 2019 - Seven Deadly Sins by Brian McElaney\n\nSoftware projects accumulate many kinds of debt. Each debt comes in the form of small qualitative shortcomings we (knowingly or unknowingly) choose to ignore in the name of shipping. They cause friction -- and over time they can combine to easily grind momentum to a halt if left unchecked. While these kinds of debt can in fact be useful (if not necessary) to creating software - teams need to understand the nature of their shortcomings to prevent \"velocity bankruptcy.\"\n\r\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss the nature of process debt by using classical ideas related to \"unproductive behavior\" as a guide: hitting on shortcomings in culture, empathy, discipline, morale, organization, preparedness, and requirements. We'll discuss examples, tips on identifying the risks in your own projects, and how to decide when to avoid, mitigate, or accept and track these risks.\n\n#rubyconf2019 #confreaks"
