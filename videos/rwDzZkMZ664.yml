description: "Speaker: Shah Widjaja from Palo IT\r\n\r\nThis May of the Design Leader series, we'll be having a conversation with Shah Widjaja from Palo IT! \r\n\r\nAbout Shah\r\n\r\nShah is the Head of Design and Strategy at Palo IT, where he's trying to build the next generation of designers & strategists. He has been working in the digital space since 1998 in Australia, Jakarta and now Singapore. He has worked with global and regional clients in the government sector, high-tech, retail, telco and finance on UX Analytics (measurable user experience design) solutions for cross channels delivery across desktop, tablet and mobile. \r\n\r\nHe loves working in complex problem space where he can collaboratively create and optimise the appropriate experiences with the aim of delivering value to the business by delighting its customers through well-crafted and appropriate design solutions. Shah believes the role of a designer is more than delivering tactical executions. He is still continuously learning on how customer empathy can be used to articulate appropriate insights that help bridge business needs and its customers across the appropriate digital channels. Also, Shah thinks fifth graders are way smarter than him.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/IxDA-Singapore/events/239903219/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/7Wks/"
