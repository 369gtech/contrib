description: 'To reach a diagnosis, a medical professional must now consider not only a sea of symptoms, but also an increasing number of factors: genotypes, functional genetics, proteomics, etc.. Caretakers, insurers, governments, medical researchers and most of all patients are looking technology satisfy their disparate goals. I will describe how our team is using Clojure, Datomic and React to provide a more humane medium for real-time collaboration.
