description: "Donna Benjamin\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/217/\n\nWho is watching? Why are they watching? and why does that matter?\r\n\r\nAs members of the global free and open source software community we're all secret agents in a mission to change the future. Tragedy is, some of us don't even realise this is true, or that the future is already here.  We're up against the powerful forces of distraction, disinformation, fatalism and apathy. We need to rally. we need to defend, and we need to act.\r\n\r\nDonna will re-introduce some old ideas we can all embrace to arm and protect ourselves, and empower each and every one of us to take back our power, and take action steps into the future.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nWed Jan 15 09:10:00 2020 at Arena"
