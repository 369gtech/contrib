title: 'Lambda Jam 2015 - Craig Stuntz - How To Use Real Computer Science in Your Day Job'
recordingDate: 1445132082
description: "When you leave Lambda Jam and return to work, do you expect to apply what you’ve learned here to hard problems, or is there just never time or permission to venture outside of fixing “undefined is not a function” in JavaScript? Many of us do use functional languages, machine learning, proof assistants, parsing, and formal methods in our day jobs, and employment by a CS research department is not a prerequisite. As a consultant who wants to choose the most effective tool for the job and keep my customers happy in the process, I’ve developed a structured approach to finding ways to use the tools of the future (plus a few from the 70s!) in the enterprises of today. I’ll share that with you and examine research into the use of formal methods in other companies. I hope you will leave the talk excited about your job!\n\nCraig Stuntz is a software engineer and a lifelong student of computer science, with specific interests in programming languages, type theory, compilers, and math. He lives in Columbus, Ohio, works for Improving Enterprises, and cofounded the Columbus branch of Papers We Love, a reading group for people interested in academic computer science research.\n\nWhen not at work or playing with his kids, he is usually studying math or playing Irish traditional music on the tin whistle and wooden flute.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
