description: "Google Tech Talks\nDecember, 12 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nJessica Todd Harper makes otherworldly photographic portraits of families and individuals that bring to mind both the religious intensity of Northern Renaissance artists and the quiet eroticism and tenderness of Andrew Wyeth's Helga pictures. She shoots film but works with the images in Photoshop, sometimes piecing together imagery much like a painter integrates drawings into a final painting. Her talk will address the technical side of her work as well the influence of iconic portraits from the history of Western Art.\n\nHarper's images have been widely exhibited, and discussed in publications ranging from the The New Yorker to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. A 2008 NY Photo Festival award winner, a 2008 Lucie Award winner, and a 2005 selection from Photo District News' annual list of rising young stars to watch, Harper published her first book of photographs, Interior Exposure this year. Selected by O, The Oprah Magazine as a top book recommendation, Harper's appeal extends beyond the New York art scene. \n\nSpeaker: Jessica Todd Harper\nHarper teaches at Swarthmore College and The International Center of Photography. She is represented by Cohen Amador Gallery in New York."
