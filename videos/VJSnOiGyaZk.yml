description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nFrom the handaxe to the light bulb, the wheel to the car, the printing press to the television: all these tools and media have changed our world thoroughly. And not only that, but also how we interact with the world. The computer brings us into a unique position to have an impact that lasts longer than only the next iteration of a new technology. What happens when we see ourselves not only as developers and designers, but reconsider the interaction between people.\n\nSlides of the presentation - https://www.dgsiegel.net/talks/the-lost-medium"
