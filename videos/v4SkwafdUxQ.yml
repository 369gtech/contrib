description: "Stratos Project Update: What's Next? - Neil MacDougall, SUSE \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/ \n\nIn this talk, I will review the progress made on the Stratos project since the last summit and demonstrate some of the newer features we've added recently. For those not familiar with Stratos, the demo will also provide an introductory overview of Stratos and its capabilities. I'll end the session by looking forward, talking about what's next for the project, including adding support for the V3 API and improving the extension mechanism. If you don't know what Stratos is, want to hear what the team has been up to and where they are going, this is the talk for you."
