recordingDate: 1579154429
description: "Jonathan Woithe\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/168/\n\nAttendees are invited to submit lightning talks for this session.  These should be short presentations (5-10 minutes) which do not require a longer formal presentation slot.  These can be submitted to the miniconf organiser any time before the miniconf, or on the day.\r\n\r\nThere will also be an opportunity to hold an open informal discussion about Creative Arts, Open Source and Open Hardware.  The exact nature and direction of the conversation will be determined on the day by participants.  Possible topics include the development status of various applications, \"how to\" questions, wish-list discussions and general Q-and-A.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 16:20:00 2020 at Room 5"
