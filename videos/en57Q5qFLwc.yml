title: 'Introduction to Knowledge Graphs with Grakn and Graql'
recordingDate: 1610093082
description: "Sometimes, relational tabular databases just don't quite cut it. When describing relationships, and networks; you might find yourself grasping for a traditional database but could a Graph database may allow you to describe and query your data in a easier more efficient way? Let's find out!\n\n---\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss how Grakn, a database to organise complex networks of data and make it queryable, provides the knowledge graph foundation for intelligent systems to manage complex data.\n\nWe will discuss how Graql, Grakn's reasoning (through OLTP) and analytics (through OLAP) query language, provides the tools required to do the job: a knowledge schema, a logical inference language, a distributed analytics framework.\n\nAnd finally, we will discuss how Graqlâ€™s language serves as unified data representation of data for cognitive systems.\n\n## About Your Host\n\n[...]\n\n## Agenda\n\n18:45 ~~Doors~~ Zoom Call Open\n19:00 nor(DEV): Introduction - Begin streaming to YouTube Live.\n19:05 Speaker Slot\n19:50 Q&A\n20:00 Close...
