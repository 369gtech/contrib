recordingDate: 1251288510
description: 'PowerShell can change the way you work with SQL Server forever. This webcast is the first of a series designed to take DBAs with no knowledge of PowerShell and give them what they need to use this new scripting language. In this first one-hour session, Sean McCown provides a general introduction to the PowerShell language and environment, exploring both the "why" and "how" of this powerful tool. Whether you want to finally get started with PowerShell or you just want a refresher, this is an excellent place to get started.'
