title: 'From Reactive Extensions to Reactive Streams - Bartosz Sypytkowski'
recordingDate: 1533548304
description: "We'll make a quick history recap of building declarative workflows, starting from Rx.NET observables and async enumerables, and how those approaches evolved into multi-platform standard known as reactive streams.\nFinally we'll talk about internals behind Akka.NET streams - one of the implementations of that standard - and how we can use streams as universal building blocks in many different domains, from networking to event sourcing."
