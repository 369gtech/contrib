description: "Grinding the Monolith\n\nMicroservices sound appealing, but what can we do with those ten-million-line code bases? Shared domain objects, horizontal coupling, and years of boundary erosion have left us with enormous complexity and spiderwebs of coupling. Michael will share techniques at various levels of abstraction, from implementation details to API design and responsibility allocation. There’s no silver bullet that will make it easy to decompose a monolith, but you’ll learn some techniques that have helped and some pitfalls to avoid, all based on Michael's experience with both successful and failed transformations.\n\nMichael Nygard is the Vice President of Customer Solutions at Cognitect. Mike is the author of Release It!, and a contributor to Beautiful Architecture. Mike focuses on highly-available and scalable commerce systems but can often be found coding, writing, speaking, or thinking about how the Universe works.\n\nMike’s most recent projects at Cognitect include designing an architecture for an online P2P lending platform, advising one of the world’s largest financial services firms on their overall software direction, and designing a software defined data center for another financial services firm.\n\nMike’s background includes re-engineering and operating some of the most prominent -- and busiest --?web properties in the world, including Best Buy, American Airlines and Hyatt. Mike also architected the software used to process 60% of all school photos in the US. Mike wrote the original control software for the infrared astronomy instruments at the Keck Telescope in Hawaii and programmed ground-based GPS systems for the USAF.\n\nFor more on YOW!
