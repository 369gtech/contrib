description: "The promise of DevOps and automation can only be attained with real cultural and platform change. It isn't always easy. In fact, it's often difficult. And succeeding means understanding the movement's long history, its present, and potential futures.\n\n\"The Once and Future Chef\" will analyze the promise and realities of DevOps and its primary tool of choice - automation. From its roots in the early Internet to potential for rebooting the enterprise as we know it, DevOps is as complex and exciting as the work it's designed to accelerate."
