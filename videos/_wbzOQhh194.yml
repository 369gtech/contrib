description: "#Programming​ #Cpp​ #CppOnSea​ \n2021 Program: https://cpponsea.uk/2021/schedule/\nC++ On Sea Website: https://cpponsea.uk/\nC++ On Sea Twitter: https://twitter.com/cpponsea\nStreamed & Edited By Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk​\n-------\nEast const is all about putting things to the right of what they modify - so what else can we do this with? The most far-east example must be the trailing return type. Is there an argument for them being better than the more traditional form?\n\n-------\nPhil Nash\nPhil is the original author of the C++ test framework, Catch2, and composable command line parser, Clara. He's also the organiser of C++ London and C++ on Sea, as well as co-host and producer of the cpp.chat podcast. More generally he's an advocate for good testing practices, TDD and using the type system and functional techniques to reduce complexity and increase correctness. He's previously worked in Finance and Mobile offers training and coaching in TDD for C++. \n\n-------\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2021 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
