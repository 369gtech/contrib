description: "Intro: Cortex - Tom Wilkie, Grafana Labs & Bryan Boreham, Weaveworks \n\nCortex provides horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant, long term storage for Prometheus metrics, and a horizontally scalable, Prometheus-compatible query API. Cortex allows users to deploy a centralised, globally aggregated view of all their Prometheus instances, storing data indefinitely. In this talk we will discuss a bit of Cortex's history, Cortex's architecture and how to get started with Cortex. Cortex is a CNCF sandbox project. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPhX"
