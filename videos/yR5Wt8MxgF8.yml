recordingDate: 1446492242
description: 'On the road to Continuous Delivery and/or DevOps? Just want to deliver better software faster? Pipelines are a key to achieving these goals because going fast and still producing quality output requires better visibility, coordination, and control. There is confusion out there on how best to use pipelines, and where they should be used. Iâ€™ll separate the ideal from the reality so you can figure out your next steps. During this talk we will demonstrate how ElectricFlow can provide visibility to all stakeholders, coordinate multiple people and automations, and control what gets released into production environments.'
