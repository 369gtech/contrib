description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nTill Rohrmann, Engineering Lead at data Artisans\n\nWith Flink 1.3 being released, the Flink community is already working towards the upcoming release 1.4. Given Flink's high development pace, which manifested in Flink 1.3 being one of the feature-wise biggest releases in its recent history, it becomes more and more difficult to keep track of all development threads. Moreover, it requires more effort to learn about newly added features and which value they provide for your application. In this talk, I want to present and explain some of Flink's latest features, including incremental checkpointing, fine grained recovery, side outputs and many more. Furthermore, I want to put them in perspective with respect to Flink's future direction by giving some insights into ongoing development threads in the community. Thereby, I intend to give attendees a better picture about Flink's current and future capabilities.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-berlin-2017-till-rohrmann-from-apache-flink-13-to-14\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
