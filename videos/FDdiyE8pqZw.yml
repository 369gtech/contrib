recordingDate: 1506598956
description: "-- Live Demo Warning! --\n\nIn this interactive workshop style presentation, we'll take a terrible, awful, broken sample site, look at all the nasty ways that its performance is terrible, and fix them, one by one. We'll get the audience involved with suggestions at every step of the way.\n\nAll examples will be taken from real life experiences, but no real sites will be harmed in the making of this demo/session.\n\nIt will cover both front and back end concepts. We'll look at site-building good practice, how to measure speed, how to find bottlenecks and how to fix them. We'll even touch upon how decisions made at the very start of a project have performance impact and why performance needs to be championed at every stage.\n\nTopics include:\n\nusing Chrome Dev Tools\nmeasuring performance\neasy core performance boosts and why they matter\nimages\nassets\ncompression\nviews\nhooks\ntemplates\ngreat evil\ngreater evil and how to kill it with fire"
