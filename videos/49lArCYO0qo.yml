The AWS Amplify Admin UI allows users to create and deploy an offline-ready application backend in clicks and then extend it with code, lowering the complexity of fullstack development for frontend and mobile developers. We'll build a fullstack application backed by multiple AWS services including Cognito, Appsync, and S3 in minutes.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/error-tracking/javascript/\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nMicrosoft → https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/join-the-azure-developer-community/\nRetool → https://retool.com/\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nCommerce Layer → https://commercelayer.io/\nProgress Kendo UI → https://www.telerik.com/kendo-uii\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.rocks/5zp\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nTara.AI → https://tara.ai/\neBay → https://tech.ebayinc.com/\nRealtor.com → https://www.realtor.com/careers\nWayports → https://wayports.app/\nFastly → https://www.fastly.com/\nSanity → https://www.sanity.io/"
