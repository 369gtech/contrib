description: "Panellists: Jackie Luo (Square), Raul Herbster (Spotify), Marco Alacot Torres (Flywire), Cormac Foster (GitLab)\n\nWhen thinking about team collaboration, our first thoughts usually jump to meetings. And in some ways that makes sense, you have all of your team in the same room and are able to quickly assess the landscape of everyone’s work.\n\nBut how does collaboration scale across multiple teams on expansive projects? And how can you clearly document the work that’s being done so that individuals and teams can gain enough knowledge to foster open collaboration?  \n\nIn this panel discussion, we’ll take a look at how to foster a culture of collaboration in your engineering teams and beyond by streamlining communication, distributing held knowledge, and increasing project and task visibility."
