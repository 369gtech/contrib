title: 'Upgrading to .NET Core: WPF to .NET Core 3.0 - A TimCo Retail Manager video'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573239610
description: "In this last upgrade video, we are going to upgrade WPF to .NET Core 3.0. We will need to spend time working on our dependencies, especially Caliburn Micro, since how it works is different with the new upgrade. Learn how to use a separate NuGet server, how to take our application Async, and more.\n\nFull Course: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/timco-retail-manager/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List Signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nOne-off tutorials are awesome but they aren't the only thing you should be doing to learn C#. Another vital part of learning is learning how to put it all together. This interactive course is all about putting the pieces together. You can watch each video on its own or you can watch them in order and see a bigger picture. The choice is yours.\n\nThis course focuses on real-world development. As such, we are simulating that we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions on a brand new product, the TimCo Retail Manager. Just like in the real world, we are starting out with one set of requirements but know that over time they will change."
