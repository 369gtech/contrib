recordingDate: 1471055240
description: "In this video, we talk about how machine learning is used to create antivirus programs! Specifically, a classifier can be trained to detect whether or not some piece of software is malicious. \n\nCheck out my friend Danooct1's Youtube channel on viruses (dope AF):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/danooct1\n\nThe code in the video is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/antivirus_demo\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nPaper 1: A Machine Learning Approach to Anomaly based detection on Android\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04122.pdf\n\nPaper 2: SMARTBot - A Behavior Detection Framework for Botnets\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4792466/\n\nPaper 3: A New Malware Detection Approach Using Bayesian Classification\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00848v1.pdf\n\nMore on Machine Learning + Cybersecurity:\n\nhttp://www.lancaster.ac.uk/pg/richarc2/dissertation.pdf\n\nhttps://www.sec.in.tum.de/malware-detection-ws0910/\n\nhttps://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2011/09/using-machine-learning-to-detect-malware-similarity.html\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page.
