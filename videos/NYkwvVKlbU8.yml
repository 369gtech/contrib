description: "Cyber-attacks are increasing in terms of sophistication, speed and dynamics. Defenses are not keeping up. Why does the attacker have such an advantage? Because most software is not designed with 'let it fail' in mind. Our community has a significant advantage in the area and we should capitalize on it. The talk will start with some cybersecurity fundamentals. I'll explain the advantages of OTP from a cybersecurity perspective. There are still pitfalls and I'll cover some of them as well as present some best practices to help your code be more secure. I'll do a survey of the open source software available as well as touch on areas where work is needed. The goal is to promote the \"let it be hacked\" mentality - which will both promote erlang/elixir and be good for cybersecurity.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nThis talk aims to:\n\n    educate everyone (at least a little bit) in cybersecurity\n    explain why beam/erlang/elixir are great for developing cybersecurity software\n    give some ptifalls to avoid and best practices to follow\n    present a survey of cybersecurity open source software from a BEAM perspective (ie both what is there, and what is needed)\n    an unabashed plea for helping promote beam for cybersecurity"
