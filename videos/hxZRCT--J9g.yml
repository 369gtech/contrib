title: 'Julian Dontcheff - Migrating to Oracle Cloud using the Oracle Database In-Memory Advisor'
language: English
recordingDate: 1464238938
description: 'The presentation is about best practices for how to test new Oracle options using Oracle database cloud. When a multitenant database running on premise needs to be migrated to the Oracle database cloud one should consider the performance load caused by one or more PDBs inside the container. Especially the impact of upgrading to in-memory (12.1.0.2) on the PDBs. We show how to use the in-memory advisor in order to tune the existing structures for in-memory and how to validate this on the database cloud using RAT & SQL tuning advisor.'
