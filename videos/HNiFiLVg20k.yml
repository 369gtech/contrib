description: "Writing reactive programs can be challenging. Such programs need to be able to react efficiently to changes as they stream in from the outside world, which often leads people to make their program logic incremental in an ad-hoc way, directly expressing their logic in terms of how to integrate a change, rather than as an all-at-once\ncomputation.\nBut such ad-hoc incrementalization is complicated, and the resulting programs can be hard to reason about. In this talk, I'll discuss an approach that leverages the fact that functional data structures can often be diffed efficiently. I'll show how the ability to diff and patch can be integrated into a more general reactive programming\nframework to let you write programs which read like simple, all-at-once implementations of your program logic, but which perform like hand-optimized change-oriented programs.\n\nYaron Minsky got his BA in Mathematics from Princeton and his PhD in Computer Science from Cornell, where he studied distributed systems. He joined Jane Street in 2003, where he started out developing quantitative trading strategies, going on to found the firm's quantitative research group. He introduced OCaml to the company and managed the transition to using OCaml for all of its core infrastructure, turning Jane Street into the world's largest industrial user of the language. In the meantime, he's been involved in many different aspects of Jane Street's technology stack, including trading and risk systems, developer tools, and user-interface toolkits. Yaron has lectured, blogged and written about programming for years, with articles published in Communications of the ACM and the Journal of Functional Programming, and is co-author of the book Real World OCaml.\n\nFor more on YOW!
