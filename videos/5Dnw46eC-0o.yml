recordingDate: 1413566701
description: "From the 2014 Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City.\n\nThere are two essential skills for the data scientist: engineering and statistics. A great many data scientists are very strong engineers but feel like impostors when it comes to statistics. In this talk John will argue that the ability to program a computer gives you special access to the deepest and most fundamental ideas in statistics. John’s goal is to convince the non-statistician engineers in the audience that the road to statistical fluency is much, much shorter than they think.\n\nAbout John Rauser:\nJohn has been extracting value from large datasets for over 20 years at hedge funds, small data-driven startups, Amazon, and now Pinterest. He has deep experience in machine learning, data visualization, on-line experimentation, website performance and real-time fault analysis. An empiricist at heart, “Just do the experiment!” is his favorite call to arms.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop World 2014: http://goo.gl/UUfrR7\nFind out more about the conference: http://strataconf.com/stratany2014\n\nDon't miss an upload!
