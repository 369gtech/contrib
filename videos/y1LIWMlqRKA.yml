description: "Titel: Lost in transaction? Strategies to manage consistency in distributed systems\n\nIf you do microservices you will work on a distributed system. This leaves you in charge of dealing with consistency yourself. ACID transactions are only available locally within components and protocols like two-phase commit donâ€™t scale. Many projects either risk adventurous inconsistencies or write a lot of code for consistency management in the application layer. In this talk I discuss these problems and go over possible solutions, including the Saga-Pattern. I will discuss recipes and frameworks that ease the management of the right level of consistency. This allows you write business logic code. Expect fun little live hacking sessions with open source components, but also real-life stories.\n\nSpeaker: Bernd Ruecker - Technologist\n\nThroughout his 15+ years in software development, I have helped automating highly scalable core workflows at global companies including T-Mobile, Lufthansa and Zalando. I have contributed to various open source workflow engines. I am co-founder and developer advocate of Camunda, an open source software company reinventing workflow automation. I co-authored \"Real-Life BPMN,\" a popular book about workflow modeling and automation, now in its fifth edition and available in English, German and Spanish. I regularly speak at conferences and write for various magazines. I am currently focused on new workflow automation paradigms that fit into modern architectures around distributed systems, microservices, domain-driven design, event-driven architecture and reactive systems."
