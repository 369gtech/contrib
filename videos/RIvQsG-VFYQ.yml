recordingDate: 1478851765
description: "Java is becoming a first-class language for cross-platform mobile development. In this session, we give an overview of the status of Java on iOS and Android. We cover the VM and AOT options, the JavaFX UI framework (using javafxports), the IDE plugins and other tools, and the integration options with cloud and back-end systems.\n\nThe Write Once Run Anywhere idea is no longer a dream. Your favourite IDE and the Gluon plugin is all you need to create apps that can be uploaded to the App Store and Play Store.\n\nJohan Vos started to work with Java in 1995.\n\nHe was part of the Blackdown team helping port Java to Linux. With LodgON, the company he co-founded, he is mainly working on Java based solutions for social networking software.\n\nBecause he can't make a choice between embedded development and enterprise development, his main focus is on end-to-end Java, combining the strengths of back-end systems and embedded devices. His favourite technologies are currently Java EE / Glassfish at the backend and JavaFX at the front-end.\n\nJohan is a Java Champion, a member of the BeJUG steering group, the Devoxx steering group and he is a JCP member. He is a co-author of the Pro JavaFX 2 book, and he has been a speaker at numerous conferences on Java.\n\n[PBU-8531]"
