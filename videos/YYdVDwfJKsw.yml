description: "Over the past 10 years, CSS has transformed from a descriptive language for presentation into a Turing-complete, domain-specific, declarative programming language for layout on the web.\nOkay…but how does one go from describing presentation to programming in CSS? And what on earth is a “CSS Algorithm”?\nThis entertaining and personable talk will answer these questions and more, before delving into practical steps for creating CSS algorithms of your own to bridge the gap between design and development.\n\nEVENT:\n\nWordCamp 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nLara Schenck\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWFBSf_ViTA"
