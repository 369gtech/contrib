description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThanos: Highly Available, Pluggable, Long Term Metric Storage for Everyone! - Wiard van Rij, Fullstaq\n\nPrometheus was initially made for short metric retention to answer questions on “what is happening ‘now’”. It is a strong project that solves certain problems really well, but still as a monolith when doing so. Thanos has been made to enable scaling, highly available setups and long term (cheap) storage for Prometheus. Everyone could leverage Thanos for these features. It does not stop there; Thanos has multiple components that could be used for multi-cluster telemetry, remote writes, and multi-tenancy. We want to introduce everyone to Thanos. Explaining the use-cases and how it could benefit your stack now observability becomes such an important factor in tech."
