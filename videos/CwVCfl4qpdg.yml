description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nStop Writing Operators - Joe Thompson, HashiCorp \n\nSince the introduction of the operator pattern by CoreOS in 2016, operators and even operator coding frameworks have proliferated seemingly without limit. But *should* you write an operator? If not, what should you be doing instead? In this session, Joe Thompson gives a quick overview of the state of the operator ecosystem, points out situations where writing and using them may not be ideal, and offers opinions on alternatives that may be more effective for maintaining your applications. You'll leave with the knowledge to be confident that whether you choose to write an operator or not in any given situation, you're making the correct choice. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekAR"
