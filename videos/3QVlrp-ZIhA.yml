description: "Lambda expressions, coming in Java 8, will dramatically change the programming model. They enable new functional programming patterns that were not possible before, increasing the expressiveness and power of the Java language. In this presentation, you will learn how to take advantage of the new lambda-enabled Java 8 APIs by building out a retro video game in JavaFX. Among the Java 8 features you will learn about are enhanced collections, functional interfaces, simplified event handlers, and the new stream API. Start using these in your application today, leveraging the latest OpenJDK builds so you can prepare for the future Java 8 release.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAlexander Belokrylov\nAlexander have spent more them 15 years in IT industry.
