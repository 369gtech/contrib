title: 'Graph Analytics Using the Python API'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604407866
description: 'Graph analytics is a powerful tool to analyze your data based on connections and relationships between data entities. With the new Python API in Oracle Graph Server and Client 20.4 you can use Python to access the rich features available with property graph support in Oracle Database. You create a graph from database tables, run PGQL graph queries, analyze the graph with over 50 pre-built graph algorithms, and more. We will demo this new API and show how this can be used with popular data science tools like Jupyter Notebook.'
