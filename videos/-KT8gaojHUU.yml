description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nThere are two proposed parts of this talk - \nPart 1 - Integration: \n\nIntel have offered to contribute an implementation of the C++17 parallel algorithms to libstdc++ (GCC) \nand libc++ (Clang). This talk will cover - \n* brief introduction to C++17 parallel algorithms and execution policies \n* overview of Intel's implementation \n* considerations and changes necessary to integrate a substantial 3rd party contribution like this \ninto a standard library implementation. \n* support for different execution back ends, tailored to the target platform \n\nPart 2 - Mapping parallel algorithms to the proposed Executors design: \n\nThere is strong support for Executors to be part of the next version of C++. Support for parallel algorithms targeting \nthe proposed Executors design will be an important part of that work. The Intel parallel algorithms implementation \ncurrently being integrated into libstdc++ and libc++ provides basic support for pluggable execution environments. \nThis talk would cover integrating the current Executors design as a concrete execution target for the parallel \nalgorithms implementation, with a focus on how you would use the proposed Executors API as a target for common \nparallel algorithm implementations. \n— \nThomas Rodgers\nSr Software Engineer - Platform Languages Runtime, RedHat, Inc\nThomas has been programming in C++ since 1989 and a member of the C++ Standards Committee since 2013.
