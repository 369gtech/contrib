title: 'Sociocracy for Creating Better Products - Jutta Eckstein'
recordingDate: 1538558529
description: "Imagine you can suggest just any kind of feature you think will be important for the product you're working on, or even any kind of product to work on- and you will work on that product only with people who are interested to work on that feature / product as well?\nAnd now imagine furthermore, that for every decision you need to make in your team, there will be full buy-in for that decision from every team member - no matter if some colleagues (or even you) were at first very opinionated about (not) using that framework, that library, etc. Well, Sociocracy will help you to make that happen. In this session we will explore these concepts, so you can use them back at work.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
