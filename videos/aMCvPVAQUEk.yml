Let's be honest: this is far from the disruptive and revolutionary technology we've been promised. What if there was more to it?\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore why this definition of AR is overly narrow and constraining. The first part covers the lessons learned from designing mixed-reality experiences at Osmo. I present some of Osmo's early prototypes and explain why they failed. I also cover the key early design decisions that made Osmo successful in retrospect.\n - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/amuse"
