title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2014 - Functionally Oblivious and Succinct - Edward Kmett'
recordingDate: 1421916182
description: "This talk provides a whirlwind tour of some new types of functional data structures and their applications.\n\nCache-oblivious algorithms let us perform optimally for all cache levels in your system at the same time by optimizing for one cache for which we don't know the parameters. While Okasaki's \"Purely Functional Data Structures\" taught us how to reason about asymptotic performance in a lazy language like Haskell, reasoning about cache-oblivious algorithms requires some new techniques.\n\nSuccinct data structures let us work directly on near-optimally compressed data representations without decompressing.\n\nHow can derive new functional data structures from these techniques? Applications include just diverse areas as speeding up something like Haskell's venerable Data.Map, handling \"big data\" on disk without tuning for hardware, and parsing JSON faster in less memory.\n\nFor more on YOW!
