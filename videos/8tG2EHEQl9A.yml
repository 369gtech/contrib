description: "I hosted an event in a Long Beach mansion before NIPS (the big AI conference) started called TITS (Transformationally Intelligent Technologies Symposium). 150+ AI researchers from DeepMind, Google Brain, and other institutions showed up for the party. One of the invitees was George Hotz, a kid who built his own self driving car in his garage in Palo Alto. He also jailbroke the iphone first, as well as the PS3. He now runs comma.ai, a startup that builds self driving car technologies for everyday consumers. He's a really cool guy, and i whipped out my camera during party setup to get a brain download from him. Hope you like it!\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
