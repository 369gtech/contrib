In this talk, we’ll walk through the spectrum of public speaking fears and learn tactics to address them, so you can feel confident and equipped to step into the spotlight.\n\nAbout Lara Hogan\n\nLara Hogan is an Engineering Director at Etsy and the author of Designing for Performance and Building a Device Lab.
