description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2019 Conference: https://jsnation.com\n\n# Turbo charging 2D on the web\n\nThis talk will be about looking at alternatives to traditional ways of presenting 2D content in the browser. We will look at the different methods along with the pros and cons of each one. I will take a slightly deeper dive and show examples of how WebGL can be used to render incredibly fast 2D graphics and also do some pretty interesting effects."
