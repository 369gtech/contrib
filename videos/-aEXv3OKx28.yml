description: "http://www.slideshare.net/AgileLietuva/scaling-agility-across-the-enterprise\n\nDavid Weir has worked over 15 years with Software Development and more than 10 years with agile techniques as Head of Development/Quality/Delivery/Architecture in different companies across the financial, utilities and regulated markets. One of his main passions has been to use agile methodologies and agile engineering practices to create high productive delivery teams. An early adopter of DSDM becoming certified in 2001, progressing into other methodologies Scrum (master/coach), Lean, Kanban, XP and PrinceLite. David is keen to ensure Methodologies/Frameworks are supported by equally important engineering practices, such as TDD, BDD, Continuous Integration, planning poker and refactoring. Currently David is responsible for several development teams across the UK and Lithuania, promoting tried and tested agile delivery for Callcredit Information Group.\n\nRimantas Benetis is senior developer at Callcredit Information Group.\n\nScaling Agility Across the Enterprise\nWhilst agile frameworks are excellent at encouraging and tracking velocity for individual projects, when you are running 20+ projects at the same time these can sometimes be at the consequence of the bigger picture. Our discussion, presents a number of techniques that can be used to observe trends and ensure both technical & project strategies are achieved across the enterprise, which complement projects remaining agile. You can study any number of Agile practices. Scrum, DSDM, XP, Kanban, Lean, TDD, Pair Programming, Continuous Delivery..... we'll let you know what's worked in the enterprise, what hasn't and why so hopefully you can avoid some of the many pitfalls along the path to sustained Agility, with some humble suggestions in tow."
