language: English
recordingDate: 1540249664
description: 'First, Dragnet collects dozens of OSINT data points on past and present social engineering targets. Then, using conversion data from previous engagements, Dragnet provides recommendations for use on your current targets: phishing templates, vishing scripts and physical pretexts- all to increase conversions with minimal effort. Finally, features like landing page cloning and domain registration (alongside your standard infrastructure deployment, call scheduling and email delivery) make Dragnet one hell of a catch.'
