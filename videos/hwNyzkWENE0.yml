description: "Speakers: Oliver Gierke and Thomas Darimont\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/olivergierke/spring-data-repositories-best-practices\nThe repository abstraction layer is one of the core pieces of the Spring Data projects. It provides a consistent, interface-based programming model to allow implementing data access layers easily for relational and NoSQL databases.\n\nWe will have a look at the lessons learned from the application of it in various customer projects and summarize best practices for you to apply in your projects. The session will also discuss advanced features like the Querydsl integration, the integration of custom implementation code as well as hooks into Spring MVC and Spring HATEOAS.\n\nLearn more about Spring Data at: http://projects.spring.io/spring-data\nLearn more about Spring HATEOAS at: http://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas\nLearn more about Spring MVC at: http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework"
