description: "Capacity Management for Fun & Profit\n\nAly Fulton, Elastic\n\nAre you looking to move past the \"throw unoptimized infrastructure at a problem and worry about waste later\" stage? Join me as I talk about my journey green fielding all things infrastructure capacity for Elastic's growing multi-cloud-based SaaS. This talk is NOT about cost savings or cost optimization directly in the traditional sense, but you will discover that proper capacity management and planning do lead to increasing profit margins!\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
