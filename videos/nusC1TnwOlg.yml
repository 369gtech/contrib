description: "Dates and times are confusing and crazy. What nut invented Daylight Saving Time? Someone who'd never imagined a computer, that's who!\n\nDealing with dates and times might seem simple at first, but there's a lot of gotchas.\n\nThis talk will start by covering some concepts worth knowing about (What is an Olson timezone? What's the Gregorian Calendar?).\n\nAfter that we'll talk about how the DateTime suite of modules can make your life a little easier. I'll show you some best practices for working with dates and times, and highlight some gotchas in DateTime's API, and with datetimes in general."
