description: "Many people think of Linear Algebra as intimidating, difficult, and great for ending conversations at parties. The truth is that Linear Algebra is extraordinarily useful, often unreasonably so. By studying one equation, y = Ax, you will add an arsenal of tools and intuition to your skillset that can be applied in any technical situation (even nonlinear ones).\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
