description: "The last version of Java, 17, was released recently and will mark a major point of change in the Java community as many organizations migrate to the latest Java runtime. So what has changed in Java if you are still primarily writing in Java 11? Or even Java 8?\n\nIn this presentation we will look at some of the key changes that have been added to Java post-8. The large changes; the Module System and Records, quality of life improvements; var, text blocks, pattern matching, and the many performance and runtime improvements. We will finish the presentation with a brief look ahead to some of the changes that will be coming to Java in the near future and why Javaâ€™s future is bright.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
