description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nAt Facebook, the main bottlenecks in build times are caused by auto-generated code from our core RPC Framework. Through the use of templates we were able to obtain up to 50% build speedup in our slowest compiling files. Generic programming is usually avoided because it slows down compile times. Why is it that, in this case, the use of templates actually improved it? \n\nThis talk will take a deep-dive into the entire compilation process, from parsing and linking to template instantiation and code optimizations. It will teach you how to gather concrete data on these build steps and the techniques used to move code to templates while reducing build times.\n\nhttps://github.com/eduardo-elizondo/cppcon2017\n— \nEddie Elizondo: Facebook, Software Engineer\n\nEddie is a Software Engineer working with Core Systems at Facebook\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
