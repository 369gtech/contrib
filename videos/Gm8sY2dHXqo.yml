description: 'This session will have aha moments for everybody. Sysadmins and developers alike. During this session we will go from nothing to functioning deployment pipeline in VSTS to Kubernetes on Azure hosting a highly flexible and resilient application running on Windows Nanoserver, the new purpose-built container OS from Microsoft. How do we build the container? How do we build the pipeline? How do we monitor our application once it is deployed? Also, a bit of a critical look at Nanoserver itself. Be prepared for some strong opinions on everything.'
