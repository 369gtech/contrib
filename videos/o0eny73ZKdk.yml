title: 'Building Kotlin DSL''s - Johan Haleby'
recordingDate: 1543225581
description: "Kotlin has rapidly become a popular programming language on the JVM due to its fast learning curve, powerful-enough features and pragmatism. \nGoing a bit beyond the basics and one will find great support of building nice DSL's. This talk will be mostly about that. We'll start with an introduction to Kotlin to get everyone up to speed and continue looking at two ways of building DSL's in Kotlin. \nWe'll do this by exploring two open source libraries written in Kotlin. The first one is the Awaitility Kotlin DSL, a library that helps us test asynchronous systems, and the second one is Kystrix, a DSL wrapping the Hystrix fault-tolerance library from Netflix.\n\nJohan Haleby is a developer working at Parkster with a strong passion for software development. He has founded and contributed to numerous open source projects such as PowerMock, REST Assured and Awaitility and has spoken at several international conferences and user groups. \n_________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend. To make an event at Foo Café, you have to become a partner company with us or you can run a user group with an in-depth technical focus.\n\nWe welcome companies with sponsor challenges.\n\nWe are currently present in Stockholm and Malmö and have made over 2048 tech events since the start in 2012. \n\nAt Foo Café there’s an event going on everyday, year round."
