title: 'Ingress? That’s So 2020! Introducing the Kubernetes Gateway API'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327349
description: "The legacy Kubernetes Ingress and controller architecture is fragmented and has limited portability across different implementations. In this session, we’ll introduce the Kubernetes Gateway API, which is an evolution of the Ingress API. This new API is the future of ingress in Kubernetes and has broad vendor adoption. \n \n The audience will learn the architecture and key benefits of the new Kubernetes Gateway API and how it compares to the current ingress solution. It supports a variety of use cases that elevate the developer experience by significantly improving productivity. We’ll demonstrate features such as traffic splitting together with the continuous delivery (CD) of microservices. The CD solution will use GitOps-style deployment with tools such as Skaffold and Kustomize.\n \n This session will provide developers with practical advice and tools necessary to use the new Gateway API in their Kubernetes projects.\n\n Abhinav Rau, Principal Architect at Google\n Madhav Sathe, Cloud Customer Engineer at Google\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/ingress-thats-so-2020-introducing-the-kubernetes-gateway-api-250134938"
