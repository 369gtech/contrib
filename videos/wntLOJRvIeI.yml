recordingDate: 1597687911
description: "Starting with a brief history of why and how we built Azure SQL, you‚Äôll then learn about the various deployment options and service tiers, including what to use when. This includes Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL managed instance and SQL Server in Azure VMs. Understanding what Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) encompasses and how it compares to the SQL Server ‚Äúbox‚Äù will help level-set what you get (and don‚Äôt get) when you move to the cloud.\n\nWe‚Äôll then get in to covering deployment, configuration, and other getting started related tasks for Azure SQL. You'll learn how you should plan for deployment, deploy, and verify your deployment, and how it compares to SQL Server. Then, you'll learn how deploying and configuring databases compares, plus some insights on loading data.\n\n4:40 Azure SQL Bootcamp Begins\n\nüìΩÔ∏è: Watch all sessions: https://aka.ms/azuresqlytrecording\n\nüìå Let's connect:\nTwitter - Bob Ward, https://twitter.com/bobwardms\nTwitter - Anna Hoffman, https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna \nTwitter - AzureSQL, https://aka.ms/azuresqltw\n\nüîî Subscribe to our channels for even more SQL tips:\nMicrosoft Azure SQL: https://aka.ms/msazuresqlyt\nMicrosoft SQL Server: https://aka.ms/mssqlserveryt\nMicrosoft Developer:  https://aka.ms/microsoftdeveloperyt\n\n#AzureSQL #AzureSQLBootcamp #LearnAzureSQL #AzureSQLDeployment #AzureSQLConfiguration"
