description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\neBPF and Kubernetes: Little Helper Minions for Scaling Microservices - Daniel Borkmann, Cilium \n\neBPF has come a long way in the Linux kernel and is gaining more and more adoption and popularity in the context of Kubernetes in the networking, tracing and security space. In fact, it is changing the way we think about operating systems by opening the doors to fully customise the Linux kernel as a platform. Given the rapid pace of development of eBPF in the kernel, it is often times quite challenging to keep up with all the exciting advances coming from the eBPF community.  This talk provides a deep dive from the perspective of one of the eBPF co-maintainers and core developers in the Linux kernel of where we came from, where we currently are, what the future brings, why eBPF has cloud native roots and how Kubernetes users can benefit from all that. We will cover the user space landscape around eBPF as well as its inner workings and interactions with the rest of the kernel.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZemQ"
