title: 'Reactive Architectures with RSocket and Spring Cloud Gateway'

recordingDate: 1571229945
description: "Spring Cloud Gateway introduced a flexible API for configuring the edge service of our applications. Built upon Project Reactor, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Boot 2.0, Spring Cloud Gateway provided a modern and efficient architecture to handle a large number of concurrent requests. However, as with all things Reactive in the Java stack, features like back pressure were only effective within the scope of the JVM. Once a request entered the network, all bets were off. \n\nThe RSocket protocol allows us to overcome this limitation by extending the capabilities of reactive architectures down to the network level. In this talk, we'll provide an overview of the key benefits of RSocket-based networking and introduce the integration of Spring Cloud Gateway with RSocket. We'll discuss the benefits of this integration, including the impact on speed, scalability, security, and more. We'll also discuss use cases, and show how you can leverage this new technology in your applications.\n\nSpeakers: Spencer Gibb, Spring Cloud Co-lead, Pivotal & Cora Iberkleid, Advisory Platform Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/reactive-architectures-with-rsocket-and-spring-cloud-gateway"
