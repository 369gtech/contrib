description: "Continuously Improving Culture through Design Decisions\n\nZachary Meath, Two Sigma Investments, LP\n\nWhat makes for a healthy tech culture, and how do our technical decisions influence it? Zachary Meath works on Two Sigma's DevOps platform “COIN”, which uses Jenkins hosted in Kubernetes to provide a scalable environment in which teams can run their CI/CD pipelines. Due its ubiquity, COIN plays a key role in DevOps culture at Two Sigma. In this session, Zack will discuss how culture was at the forefront of COIN’s design, and how the two influenced each other over time.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
