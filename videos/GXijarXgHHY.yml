description: "GoWayFest 4.0, Online – July 11-12, 2020\n\nWhat's in a name?, Dave Cheney\n\nThe art of writing software is the act of communication. You\nmight feel that this is a private conversation about your code with a\npersnickety compiler, but the audience for software is much larger.\nIt’s the people who use your libraries and your APIs, the folks who\nwork with you maintaining the codebase, and it's you, in the future,\nsearching for clues about why you wrote what you wrote the way you\nwrote it.\n\nThis talk is all about naming. It’s about the names we give to things\nin our programs and how those decisions can affect the maintainability\nof the software we write."
