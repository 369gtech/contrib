description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2019\nhttps://dddeurope.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nOld School System Dynamics in a Data Science First World (Talk)\n\nHow to use a pre-software-age science in new-school software-design where data is everywhere and cheap.\n\nIn the talk i'll be covering :\n- what is system dynamics and what is it's value in today's application models\n- how can use the (same) model for simulation and production monitoring : added value of this kind of monitoring\n- presenting an simple example case, and one real life model used by Bridgestone\n- the concept of SD model patterns\nif possible try to elevate the examples with running model reacting on current twitter feeds (still thinking on that one)\n\nthe talk will also explain the difference between linear and non-linear event-stream, and how to incorporate both into a model.\n\nthe 'big message' is to not only design/model 'a process', but also to model the 'behavior of a process'. Something that is most often left to the helpdesk in a post-production-release era :) \n\nBiography\n\nBusiness Analist and founder of software engineering company Debreuck Neirynck. We construct niche systems involving complex planning & calculation demands.\nRecent projects:\nInsurance platform for diamand industry antwerp.\nBackend engine for Graphius group.\nVendor management Inventory system.\n\nCertified Vol√©re \nSpeaker at BA & Beyond Antwerp 2018\nMember IIBA\n\nhttps://debneir.tumblr.com/post/174405812544/old-school-meets-new"
