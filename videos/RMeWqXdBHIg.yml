description: "How do quantum computers work? What is a qubit? What the hell happened to Schr√∂dinger's cats? During this talk we'll together unravel the mysteries of entangled qubits. We'll explain the basics of quantum computing in simple and fun ways, including visual demonstrations with polarsation filters and a skippyball (known as Mr Qubit).\n\nWe'll even build an actual working quantum computer.... tribute, a simulator, in Java!\n\nAnd I'll explain how larger quantum algorithms work by explaining the quantum benefits in Shor's Prime Factoring algorithm.\n\nBut beware, this talk isn't for the faint hearted. We'll keep away from all the unnecessary complicated math, but if Math.random() is unlucky we might kill some more cats."
