description: "Making furniture with Javascript An open-source community run platform for designers to experiment with parametric furniture design.\nby Amit Nambiar\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1308/furniture_javascript.webm\n\n\nAn experimental project which uses web technologies to help design, display and make furniture. O-LAP is an open-source community run platform for designers to experiment with parametric furniture design. Designers create parametric furniture designs as plugins into the framework. Registered designs gets displayed in the online gallery. Users can view the designs from the gallery and customize the design. Framework lets users extract CAD drawings which can be used to fabricate the design using a CNC machine. The project is built as an open access network of git repositories delivering updated Javascript for the clients. O-LAP is a community of makers who like to make furniture from code. Designers write code which can create designs for furniture pieces. They make the designs like a plugin into a web app. The app can then extract drawings from the designs which can be used to fabricate the design using a computer controlled machine (similar to 3D printing). Designers can get creative in different ways when they start writing code to create furniture designs.\nFor example they can make the design for a chair which changes for people with different heights, or furniture which learns from your genetic data to customise it for you.\nWe also adapt a new way of production so that such designs can be manufactured by anyone with a CNC machine. It distributes the task of production to independent makers, so the designs are fabricated closest to the place where they are needed, reducing transport.\nThe group has grown with people across the globe interested. It would be great to showcase it to the broader OS developer community. \n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 16:00:00+01"
