description: 'Is engineering an art or a science? Despite years of research and countless books on the subject, our understanding of what quality engineering means is imperfect at best. Many companies, including some here in Silicon Valley, still judge engineering performance by lines of code written and the number of bugs closed. In this talk, Jem Young (@JemYoung) covers some of the big ideas we’ve had in Netflix UI Engineering. But more importantly, what quality engineering is and what we mean when we say “human performance.”'
