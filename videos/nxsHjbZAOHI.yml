description: "\"No design method has as much power to transform how you design, build, and evolve interactive systems as prototyping. This talk distills over a decade’s worth of insights about prototyping into ten easy ways to improve the way you design and iterate. If prototyping is already part of your design process, these guidelines will help you get the most out of it. If you aren’t prototyping or your organization is resistant to it, this talk will arm you with an array of stories and examples that will help you get started in the way that works best for you.\n\nFred Beecher\nhttps://twitter.com/fred_beecher\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca\""
