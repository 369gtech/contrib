description: 'The new accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1) was released during the summer of 2018. They bring WCAG up to speed with modern technology, and mobile features in particular. At the same time, many new technologies working its way into mainstream adoption are great for accessibility, like voice control and text-to-speech. This talk explores the future of mobile accessibility, looking at both regulations and the possibilities in new technology that will influence the next few years.'
