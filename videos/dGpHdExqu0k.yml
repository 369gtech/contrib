In this session we''re going to get into some real talk about landing your first security gig. We will analyze the challenges that aspiring security professionals need to overcome in order to find their way into an entry level position. We''ll look at the issues of job descriptions, certifications, degrees, and other job search related challenges. We''ll analyze data from a recent primary research to better understand how education, certifications, mentoring, and other characteristics impact the job search. Finally we''ll use that information to share tangible real strategies you can use to overcome those hiring obstacles.'
