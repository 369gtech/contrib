description: "What's the Performance Overhead? Answering the Biggest Question in Tracing - Gabriela Soria, Outreachy \n\nWith the increased adoption of microservices architecture, performing tracing is becoming crucial to understanding the behavior of our applications, detecting abnormalities and interpreting transactions. In this session, we'll present the results of performance tests in order to understand how the instrumentation affects the performance of applications.  The scope of this research is the OpenTracing Java API, and some representative libraries that use it under the hood, e.g. Java Servlet Filter, Spring Boot and Cloud, JAX-RS and JDBC. We'll be showing tests comparing a non-instrumented application with the same example application using different tracers.  We'll include the main concepts of tracing for those who are new to microservices and/or distributed tracing, but you'll benefit even if you're already familiar with OpenTracing. Familiarity with Java is useful but not strictly required. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPbd"
