title: 'DEF CON 26 CANNABIS VILLAGE - Michael Hiller - The Ongoing Federal Lawsuit Against Jeff Sessions'
language: English
recordingDate: 1543722703
description: 'Michael is the founding and managing principal of Hiller, PC. He has built a career on fighting for his clients against large institutions, multi-national corporations, and state and local governments, with specialties including Commercial Litigation, Land-Use, Insurance, and Cannabis. Heâ€™s won numerous awards and designations in recognition of his achievements on behalf of community groups, neighborhoods, and corporate clients. Michael - helping represent some professional athletes, military vets, and parents who wish to treat their children with CBD derived products - is currently involved in a federal lawsuit against the US Attorney General, Jeff Sessions regarding the scheduling, or classification, of Cannabis. This lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act as it pertains to Cannabis/Marijuana. In a 90-page Complaint, attorneys representing five plaintiffs maintain that the CSA, in classifying Cannabis as a Schedule I drug, is so irrational that it violates the U.S. Constitution.'
