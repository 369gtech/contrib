description: "Seasoned Java architect and Agile Development consultant Gordon Force discusses Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with the San Francisco Java User Group on January 10th, 2012. BDD evolved by incorporating what works from Test Driven Development, Agile User Stories, Domain Driven Design and XP with an emphasis on product behavior testing over unit testing. Project stakeholders and team members focus on the problem domain and develop a common language for expressing a product's desired behavior as stories and acceptance test criteria. Developers can then map the stories and criteria on their test code to verify application behavior and report results in the same common language.\r\n\r\n** For more videos and educational resources on open source development, head to http://marakana.com"
