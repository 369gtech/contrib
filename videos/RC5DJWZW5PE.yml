title: 'RealEstateCore – Enabling the smart city using Semantic Web tools by Erik Wallin'
recordingDate: 1581884552
description: "Property owners use RealEstateCore to describe the data of interaction within the buildings that they operate – as well as the management, storage, and sharing of this data. RealEstateCore is a modular ontology, that is, a collection of data schemas that describe concepts and relations that can occur in data that is generated to model buildings and building systems, or that is sourced from such systems.\n\nWe use Semantic Web technologies combined with a business-usefulness-approach; the result is the RealEstateCore (REC) ontology.\n\nThe ever growing RealEstateCore consortium is working on improving the core ontology, adding more modules, and as well is working on making better tools to integrate and use the ontology in smart building platforms and its applications.\n\nErik Wallin\nRealEstateCore Consortium\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
