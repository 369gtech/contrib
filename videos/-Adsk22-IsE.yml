description: "Jacob Thornton \n\nTwitter\n\nI work at twitter on the platform team and I'm the co-author of some pretty nifty open source, Ender, Bootstrap, and Hogan.js with my good friends @ded, @mdo, and @sayrer (respectively).\n\nI'm not a computer scientist. Also, I'm not obese. But I will respond to fat. I am hungover. And I'm probably eating pizza."
