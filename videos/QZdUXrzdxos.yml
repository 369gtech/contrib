description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/fast-and-furious-searching-in-a-distributed-world-with-highly-available-spring-data-redis\nRedis is one of the most beloved data stores in the world, and is a natural choice for developers building Spring applications. The Spring Data Redis framework allows developers to easily write Spring applications that utilize Redis. \nRedis Enterprise extends upon the core principles of Redis: simplicity, transparency, and that making software should be fun. It provides the capabilities you need in an enterprise context - including stable high performance, zero downtime, linear scaling, and hassle-free true high availability, all with operational cost savings. With the introduction of Redis modules, Redis Enterprise now natively supports JSON data (ReJSON), full-text search (RediSearch), graph, and more. This significantly expands the range of use cases a developer can use Redis for. \nThis session will provide insights into the Redis Enterprise architecture and demo active/active Redis clusters across two geo-distributed Pivotal Cloud Foundry foundations. We will build three microservices to populate the database using Spring Batch and Spring Data, perform full-text searches with RediSearch, and view the results using Spring Boot Web and Angular.\n\nSpeakers:\nJulien Ruaux\nSolution Architect, Redis Labs\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
