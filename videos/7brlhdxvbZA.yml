description: "Tiki: Easy setup of wiki-based knowledge management system This talk demonstrates how to build up a simple but powerful knowledge management system starting from a freshly installed Tiki\nby Jean-Marc Libs\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/collab_tiki_wiki_knowledge_base.webm\n\n\nI will demonstrate an easy and fast way of configuring Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware for the purpose of having a central repository for a knowledge base.\nI will also explain how to manage permissions for various use cases, how to separate different topics, how to access stored knowledge. This presentation will start with a minimal Tiki site and show how to build structures of pages and file repositories with a knowledge base in mind.\nThis will rely on a concrete real-life working example of a site for collaboration between a freelancer/company and their various separate customers with different projects. \n\nI will show how to configure permissions for:\n* a publicly visible and editable knowledge base;\n* separate knowledge bases which are restricted to groups of users and invisible to others;\n* intermediate scenarios with groups of editors and groups of read-only viewers. \n\nI will show the basics of how to make the knowledge accessible, searchable, navigable and allow comments from people who can only view it. \n\nI will provide hints about more powerful approaches using Tiki's inbuilt user-configurable database feature. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:50:00+01"
