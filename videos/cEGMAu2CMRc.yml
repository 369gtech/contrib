Our plant-filled gallery is also a venue for art events and musical performances highlighting emerging artists and underrepresented visionaries. \n\nPowrplnt is located at 562 Evergreen in Bushwick. As protests continue, we will be opening our space as a sanctuary site in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. We have sign-making supplies, PPE, water and snacks to pick up and use. We are operating as a rest space, as well as offering access to computers, WIFI, and a printer. We are also a donation drop-off center, and we are looking for folks who can distribute supplies at protests, man the space, teach workshops on digital security, protest safety, and surveillance, and link us to informational texts we can print.
