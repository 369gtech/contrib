description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nCaptains on the Careem platform recently got the ability to use iOS earlier this year with the launch of the iOS Captain app. Under the hood, this iOS release is powered by Kotlin Multiplatform. Having been in production for several months now with a large number of captains using both apps daily to transport people from one place to another, this talk is about our journey and things we learned on the way.\n\nSome of the points this talk will cover:\n- How we got buy-in to work on Kotlin Multiplatform in the project (both from the management and from our iOS colleagues).\n- The different approaches we tried when developing the SDK and sharing it between the iOS and Android developers - what worked, what didn't, and how we resolved these issues.\n- How we handle our library releases\n- How we organized and set up our code\n- How we decide what code to share and what not to share\n\nWhile this is a technical talk, it is intended to focus more about the development process and how we overcame some of the challenges that we faced on the way to releasing this app.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nAhmed is an Android engineer working on the captain experience at Careem.
