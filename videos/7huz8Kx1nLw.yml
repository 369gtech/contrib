description: "Felix Rieseberg (Slack): Desktop Apps with JavaScript\n\nYou might already use desktop software written in JavaScript: Popular apps like Atom, Slack, or Visual Studio Code use the framework Electron to combine native code with the convenience of Node.js to build cross-platform desktop software.\n\nIn this talk, Felix will give an introduction to Electron, explaining both the up- and downsides of building apps with JavaScript. Building a small code editor live on stage, he’ll cover the basics as well as advanced scenarios like deep integration with the operating system, performance optimizations, and security concerns.\n\nThe speech was given on 2017-05-17 at infoShare 2017 (Tech Stage) in Gdańsk.\nhttp://infoshare.pl\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
