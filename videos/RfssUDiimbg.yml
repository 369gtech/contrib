title: 'Lambda Jam 2015 - Joe DeVivo - Chatterbox: HTTP/2 for Erlang'
recordingDate: 1445131085
description: "HTTP/1 has had a good run, and to be honest, it’s not going anywhere anytime soon. What it is doing, is going through TCP connections like nobody’s business! If you’re looking to streamline communications overhead between a browser and a server or lower the network traffic of your webservice calls, you might want to get on board this HTTP/2 bandwagon.\n\nI’m going to chat with you all about the HTTP/2 protocol. How it does the things that it claims. What’s so cool about HPACK? (Spoiler: it’s the dynamic table, and the static table, and the Huffman encoding, ok there are a lot of cool parts).\n\nJoe spent about a decade writing more and more ceremonious Java before he started writing Erlang at Basho, and now CHEF. He’s spoken at several Erlang conferences, but is looking forward to branching out into the broader Functional Programming world. Joe lives just outside Phoenix with his wife, daughter, and son where they play board games, practice Tae Kwon Do, and are never ever cold.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com"
