description: "Better graphics performance leads to richer, smoother and more responsive user experiences. Several new APIs (OffscreenCanvas, ImageBitmap and more) are geared at increasing graphics throughput and smoothness in applications that rely on the HTML canvas element. The possibilities offered by the new APIs range from simple performance tricks to powerful programming paradigms, such as asynchrony, multi-threading and transfer semantics. The target audience is web developers already familiar with WebGL or 2D canvas.\n\nUpdate: Examples in this video use deprecated commit() call. Use worker.requestAnimarionFrame instead (see https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5681560598609920).\n\nWatch more Chrome and Web talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/Q1bFGY\nSee all the talks from Google I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/D0D4VE\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome channel: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf\n\n#io17 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2017"
