description: "Ralph Loura, CIO, HP Enterprise Group\n\nOlivier Jacques, CI, CD, DevOps Practitioner, HP Enterprise Group\n\nRafael Garcia, Director of Emerging Technologies R&D IT, HP Enterprise Group\n\nWeâ€™ve all heard DevOps can greatly accelerate velocity and efficiency. The challenge is how to transform a large scale enterprise with established processes and systems.\n\nThrough the looking glass of a number of DevOps myths (are they really?), we will share how HP goes DevOps, brokering relationships among our business unit and infrastructure IT teams to make the move from organizational silos to integrated teams and continuous delivery pipelines; from physical systems and storage to cloud infrastructure and Docker containers; from templates and forms to infrastructure-as-code; and from change requests to change records."
