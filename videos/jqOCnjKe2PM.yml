description: "Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes: A Peanut Butter and Jelly Application Sandwich - Carl Swanson & Christopher Rosen, IBM\n\nWhile debates continue about whether to use Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes, the real question is how these two make better apps together. So what does this have to with sandwiches? Cloud Foundry developers can rapidly create and deploy (peanut butter), while Kubernetes gives you flexibility to manage and scale complex micro-services (jelly). In this session, we’ll show workloads with both Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, ones that simplify security with cross-compute tools and that are portable across multi-clouds. And just like the multi-facet sandwich, these solutions together give a truly exceptional overall cloud-native application workload experience.\n\nNOTICE: Please be advised that presentation doesn’t contain peanuts or fruit-spread, and is gluten-free. But it will make you hungry.\n\nAbout Christopher Rosen\nChris Rosen is a Program Director, Offering Management, for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and IBM Cloud Container Registry.
