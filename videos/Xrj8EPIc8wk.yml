title: 'Beyond the Basics of SonarQube: Improve Your Java(Script) Code Even Further'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433237207
description: "SonarQube is (becoming) more or less the standard tool for managing Java code quality. Unfortunately, most developers use it just as a replacement for separate Checkstyle, PMD, and code coverage tools. SonarQube is capable of so much more that, over time, SonarQube will even replace the Checkstyle and PMD rule sets with its own rule set. This presentation explains a lot of the more advanced features and plug-ins SonarQube has to offer. The topics include measuring coverage of a running Java application in an application server, the JavaScript plug-in, the pitest plug-in, LCOM4, compare, measure, code review, hotspots, architectural constraints, package tangle index, PMD rules for unit test quality, incremental analyses, and more.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJohan Janssen\nJohan is working as a Java lead developer / architect and Java trainer at Info Support.
