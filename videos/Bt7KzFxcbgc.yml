recordingDate: 1499244438
description: "Features always come with costs. Either of performance or code-footprint. With C++11 and its successors we got some exciting new features.\n\nAs the spirit of C++ is \"you pay only for what you use\" it is vital for developers to know what the costs are.This talk presents the cost of features like Lambdas or the all time static. The focus is on modern C++. At the end attendee are able to rate features more precisely whether to use them in a project or not."
