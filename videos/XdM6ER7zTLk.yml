title: 'How to Do Linear Regression using Gradient Descent'
language: English
recordingDate: 1490824039
description: "The point of this is to demonstrate the concept of gradient descent. Gradient descent is the most popular optimization strategy in deep learning, in particular an implementation of it called backpropagation. We are using gradient descent as our optimization strategy for linear regression. We'll draw the line of best fit to measure the relationship between student test scores and the amount of hours studied. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/linear_regression_live\n\nYes, I've done this video before. But I'm doing it again because\n1. Gradient Descent is really important. Know how it works.\n2. Last time was in Google Hangouts (Ghetto) this is better quality\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/06/24/gradient-descent-linear-regression/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent\nhttp://machinelearningmastery.com/gradient-descent-for-machine-learning/\nhttps://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/introduction-to-gradient-descent-algorithm-along-its-variants/\nhttp://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/OptimizationStochasticGradientDescent/\n\nJoin us in the Wizards Slack Channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nPlease Subscribe!
