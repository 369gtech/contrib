recordingDate: 1470317206
description: "With the fast developments of powerful Augmented, Mixed and Virtual reality devices like HoloLens science fiction movie technology is becoming reality for consumers.\nIn this session, Rene Schulte will talk to you about the challenges that AR and VR pose and why 3D is an essential part of this experience. Comprehensible demos will show how every developer can develop outstanding HoloLens solutions with Unity and be part of this computing revolution.\n\nWhen you leave this session, you will understand how to setup your Unity environment, what skills you need to create compelling HoloLens applications and what best practices will help you move forward quickly. Starting with a simple “MR Hello World” demo, we will use this to understand all of the pieces required to run your app. Last, but not least, we will demonstrate some of the applications that Rene and his team have been working on in the past few months, to give the viewers a sense of what can be accomplished with the right skill targeting one of the most anticipated devices in a while.\n\nWhen you leave this session, you will know the challenges we faced while building HoloLens apps and how we solved them. You will also have learned best practices and recommendations to avoid pit falls and you will hopefully be inspired to build your own HoloLens apps."
