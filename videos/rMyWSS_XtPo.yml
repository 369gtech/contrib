title: 'Paweł Badeński "The Catcher in the Code"'
recordingDate: 1358522938
description: 'If you could ever imagine one reason the source code is all about -- it is communication. And while communicating your goal to the computer is essential, it is the other human being -- a fellow programmer, who desperately needs you to tell them your intent well and clear. It takes a journey to become a grown-up software developer and to master the skill of making your code to say what your brain can only imagine. I will try to give an insight into some of the lessons I learnt on my journey about the different way of communicating with the code and how to get it to „speak its mind".'
