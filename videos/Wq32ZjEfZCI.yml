description: "This video was recorded at Lambda Days 2019 http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019\n\nGet involved in Lambda Days' next conference http://www.lambdadays.org\n\n---\n\nFROM HASKELL TO C#, A STORY OF CULTURE SHOCKS AND HAPPY REUNIONS\nby Øystein Kolsrud\n\nABSTRACT\nSix years ago, I joined Qlik as a software engineer in a group developing products in C#. My previous experience came primarily from Haskell and C++, but with C# I quickly realized that I could leverage my knowledge of functional programming also in this object oriented language! And (to the great confusion of my colleagues) I did! This talk focuses on my experience of using C# with a touch of Haskell and the reactions I got from my colleagues when doing so.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/oystein-kolsrud\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ØYSTEIN KOLSRUD\nA functional ambassador in an object oriented world\n\nØystein Kolsrud is a software engineer with a background in Haskell that currently mostly develops solutions in C#. He has been doing multiple talks intended for an object oriented audience on the functional background of some of the features found in C#, and how those features are typically leveraged in a Haskell.\n\nMore on Øystein Kolsrud: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/oystein-kolsrud\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
