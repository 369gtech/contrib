recordingDate: 1544126022
description: "The motivation for this talk is showing the basis of development of Reactive Server server from scratch. This will teach the audience the basics of non-blocking I/O in java and will show the power of Reactive Programming with Project Reactor and expand the powerful API available within that project.\n\nIn this speech, we are going to talk about developing your own server using pure Non-Blocking Java API. First of all, we will start with the reason why non-blocking is important in the development of modern web applications. Smoothly moving from that point, we will cover the central challenges of building non-blocking servers. In turn, we will introduce the Reactive Programming technique for simplification our code and be turning everyday software development into the art. Since Java Non-Blocking API is nothing more than actionsâ€™ execution and reacting to asynchronous responses, we will see how simple become development of complicated things with the usage of Reactive Programming with Project Reactor."
