description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nThe desirable date of the birth of a child follows the full duration of pregnancy. According to WHO data, 15 million children are born prematurely every year, of which 1.1 million dies, unfortunately. In this talk, we will present how to improve prediction rate of the spontaneous preterm delivery using deep learning and computer vision methods.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
