description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\n2018 and 2019 will see a flood of mobile multiplatform libraries for Android and IOS using Kotlin Multiplatform. Mobile developers have had a decade to fine tune state-of-the-art best practice for the Android and iOS platforms. Those libraries will need analogs, and will quickly appear once the tooling and community mature. This talk will be an overview of what major libraries are available, what's coming soon, what libraries somebody desperately needs to build, and best resources on how to get started.\n\nAbout Kevin Galligan:\nPresident of Touchlab. Have been coding Android since before the G1. We run the big Android meetup in NYC, and Droidcon NYC. Currently obsessed with platform convergence topics."
