description: "Code Royale is a free-to-play online, multiplayer game that introduces beginners of all ages & backgrounds to Machine Learning in a fun, engaging way. We’ll drop a public beta for iOS/Android/Mac/Windows in a few weeks since initial play-tests have been positive enough. Before we do that though, I’m hosting the first ever, public live-stream of gameplay of a 4 player free for all. I’ll compete against 3 of the past winners from these weekly live-streams in the game (with voice chat) so that you can get a better glimpse of what the game is like. During the stream, I’ll pause the game 3 times to ask you 3 questions, and each will be related to Machine Learning. I’ll put a study guide for those questions below in the description. The 3 winners will receive $50 in BTC each. I hope to see you there!\n\nSign up to answer live questions, compete for the prize pool, and later on receive access to the iOS/Android/Mac/Windows release:\nhttps://www.playcoderoyale.com \n\nBackup link to answer Qs  in case the web app doesn't work\nhttps://www.itempool.com/llSourcell/live\n\n\nJoin the discord: \nhttps://discord.gg/v8QqtPy3Af \n\nSubscribe for more educational videos!
