language: English
recordingDate: 1602000007
description: "To provide customers with an easier network configuration, all newly created virtual clusters will be enabled for access over global virtual network peering connections, now in general availability. This enables customers to pair managed instances in failover group configuration, in an easy and performant way, by simply connecting virtual networks in different regions. By utilizing global virtual network peering for your managed instances, you will save time through easy network configuration and offload your gateways from database replication traffic.
