description: "https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2018-205-http_tunneling_in_go_using_http_2_streams\n\nAnd making it highly available with Serf and Raft\n\nThis talk describes our experience developing Wormhole Connector, a distributed proxy component that connects external enterprise systems to a Kyma Kubernetes cluster. The connection between the Wormhole Connector and the Kubernetes cluster is based on HTTP/2, taking advantage of the stream concept to multiplex multiple connections (HTTP/1 or HTTP/2) through one active HTTP/2 connection.\n\nIt will cover how we use the Serf and Raft libraries to make the Wormhole Connector highly available, our experience using the Go standard library to support HTTP/2 connections, and technical details describing how everything works under the hood.\n\nThis talk describes our experience developing Wormhole Connector, a distributed proxy component that connects external enterprise systems to a Kyma Kubernetes cluster.
