title: 'Looking for the Holy Grail of Mobile Web Performance by Adam Bar'
recordingDate: 1519830139
description: "There’s a long-standing myth in the mobile world that only native apps are able to provide a decent performance for the mobile user. With the emergence of Progressive Web Apps that suppose to mimic all the native goodness, the push for performance in the mobile web is now stronger than ever before. Is the Web Platform ready to keep up with these expectations? This talk is a wide overview of the many practices and strategies we can employ to satisfy our mobile users’ needs - from the HTTP-level tweaks via load and render time optimization to smooth scrolling and animations tricks.\n\nAdam Bar\nI started my developer career 10 years ago with simple PHP websites. Later on I touched on .NET, Ruby, Java and Objective-C, but I have always come back to the Web that I value for its openness and accessibility for everyone. And even though I admire simple structures, simple rules and order, which are often hard to find on the Web, these are Web technologies that are my programming passion. On a daily basis I work on versatile web apps in Bright Inventions and take care of my website that aims to review device integration capabilities of the web - https://whatwebcando.today/.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
