title: '"The Internet: Protecting Our Democratic Lifeline" - Brett Sheffield (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579222218
description: "Brett Sheffield\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/116/\n\nThe Internet is arguably the most useful tool for enabling democracy that has ever been developed. It allows citizens to communicate, to organize and to disseminate information. It enables whistleblowers and journalists to expose corruption and malpractice. It enables people to communicate across borders, to share and discover each others cultures and beliefs, to promote understanding and encourage peace.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Internet is today threatened from all sides by criminals, governments and corporations alike. Unless we take steps to prevent it, the weakening of this democratic tool will continue. Instead, we can choose to make it stronger and leave the next generation with a truly global, rights-enabled communication network.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore the threats to our democratic lifeline from increased centralisation, tracking, censorship, and harmful legislation, and what we need to do about it.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
