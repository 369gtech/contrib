description: "(Sponsored by Io-Tahoe) - Data democratization was a chief goal and major benefit of the big data revolution. Data owners no longer have to wait for the EDW IT Department to write ETL jobs before they can access and query their data. Anyone can store their data in the data lake, in any structure (or no consistent structure).\n\nTen years later, we’re struggling with the unintended consequences of the big data revolution. Data is often multiply redundantly stored. Data of interest is difficult to locate, and its schemas are often difficult to understand. Precise connections among putatively related datasets are not captured. The great promise of the big data revolution—integration of data across silos to discover otherwise hidden trends and improve customer experience— has largely gone unrealized due to this postrevolutionary chaos.\n\nBarbara Eckman shares lessons learned from early big data mistakes and the progress her team at Comcast is making toward a postrevolutionary big data vision.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
