title: 'SREcon19 Asia/Pacific - Building a Scalable Network Event Executor Using GO'
language: English

description: "Marek Denis, Facebook\n\nWith ever increasing growing networks, automation plays a critical role. We want engineers to have time to work on exciting projects versus staring at graphs 24/7 and reacting to events.\n\nIn this talk, we provide an introduction on how our monitoring and remediation systems work; we will also describe the initial steps on how to build a simple remediation system—scalable machinery that can watch for symptoms of errors/failures and react to these in a pre-defined way.\n\nWe will cover not only architecture, but also give recommendations on how to keep the system scalable. The talk will present a walkthrough of an open source system (URL Hidden) written in GO—a static typing language with concurrency built in its philosophy. To finish the presentation, we will do a live demo of the system.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
