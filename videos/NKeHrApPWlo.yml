description: "Opening keynote on day two of KotlinConf. \n\nErik Meijer has been trying to bridge the ridge between theory and practice for most of his career.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for his work on, amongst others, the Haskell, C#, Visual Basic, and Dart programming languages, as well as for his contributions to LINQ and the Reactive Framework (Rx).\n\nMost recently he is on a quest to make uncertainty a first-class citizen in mainstream programming languages."
