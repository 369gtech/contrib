description: 'Visual Studio for Mac is the Microsoft IDE for .NET developers working on macOS and in this talk we’ll show you how to build a web application using C# and ASP.NET Core. We’ll also build a mobile companion app using Xamarin with Xamarin.Forms and XAML. Using Visual Studio 2019 for Mac, you’ll see how you can be even more productive with the latest release of the IDE, including getting the most out of the brand new C# and XAML editing experiences built on the same core editors as Visual Studio on Windows.'
