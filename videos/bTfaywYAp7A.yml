description: "It is a truth, universally acknowledged, that diverse teams produce better outcomes. But how do we make a diverse team inclusive? How do we make space for differences in thinking, and understanding on our teams. Through personal stories of an adult life in technology, queer theory, and practical examples that cost nothing to implement (they don’t even need policies!) this talk shows how you can make space in your team for difference. Simple things can make space so your teams are inclusive for all sorts of Diversity\n\n\n\nAbout:\nDr J Harrison, Harbinger of Change - ThoughtWorks\n\nDr J joined ThoughtWorks as a Business Analyst, they have almost 20 years experience from their work implementing Call Centres, and building service teams for Symbian and then Nokia.
