description: "The PyData ecosystem is rich with tools for working with and visualizing data. Until recently, it has been difficult to put these tools together into a shareable application to let non-Python users explore and make use of the data. The new tools Panel (https://panel.pyviz.org) and Voila (https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) make it much simpler to build, adapt, and explore your data, moving seamlessly between Jupyter notebooks and deployed web applications. Here, we will show you how to get started using Panel to build apps and dashboards in notebooks and make them into deployable web applications.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will see how to use Panel (https://panel.pyviz.org) to add widgets and layouts to the output from just about any plotting program, and then how to share the result as a fully standalone application. You should walk away knowing you can very easily make any of your analyses interactive and shareable, in just a few lines of code!\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
