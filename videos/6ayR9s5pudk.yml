title: 'Life Without Objects - Osvaldas Grigas'
recordingDate: 1514211689
description: "Transitioning from OOP to functional style can be quite challenging, not least because OO developers are used to modeling nouns, but not verbs. Programming languages, like Clojure, use functions as primary means of abstraction, so one is forced to try out other approaches to design. Assuming basic familiarity with the fundamentals of FP like immutability and purity, Osvaldas explores new ways of designing things, doing composition and polymorphism. Fear not! What you have learned about good OO design can be applied to FP, in obvious and sometimes weird ways. After all, an object is just a collection of partially applied functions.\n\nOsvaldas Grigas is a polyglot developer who uses mainstream as well as less popular JVM languages in production and is passionate about software design. He organizes Coderetreats and leads a community of Clojure enthusiasts in Vilnius. Osvaldas likes to talk about TDD, OOP, FP and to facilitate coding workshops."
