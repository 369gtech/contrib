description: "Google TechTalks\nMarch 24, 2006\n\nAlan Nash\n\nABSTRACT\nI will discuss two fundamental problems in information integration:\n\n(1) how to answer a query over a public interface which combines data from several sources and (2) how to create a single database conforming to the public interface which combines data from several sources.\n\nI consider the case where the sources are relational databases, where the public interface is a public schema (a specification of the format of a database), and where the sources are related to the public schema by a mapping that is specified by constraints."
