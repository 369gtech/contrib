description: 'ReactJs has a young brother called React Native that it is ready to jump from the web development to mobile native development. And that is great, because React and its "one direction data flow" philosophy is one of the coolest things that happened past year :) In this talk I''ll give a brief summary about React, its style and philosophy and how we can use React Native to build native applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript and the same set of tools and workflow we use to create web applications.'
