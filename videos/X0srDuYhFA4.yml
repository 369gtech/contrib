description: "Speaker: Mark Corben, Senior Support Engineer, Acquia\n\nThe Internet Of Things is here and is Open Source!\nThere is a growing collection of open source projects that are helping us to connect IOT for populous use.\nPart of the need in having these devices is for a central place to manage the array of Things.\n\nOne such project that has been setting the framework for this is OpenHAB - Open Home Automation Bus (https://www.openhab.org/). OpenHAB has a pluggable architecture that supports more than 200 different technologies and systems and thousands of devices. This can be run on a number platforms including Raspberry PI as a OpenHABian installation (https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/openhabian.html#features).\n\nHowever, the configuration is driven by a text based one which can be confusing to users.\nIf this can be made accessible through a Drupal 8 site this improves the ease of use as well as use the power of Drupal to collect and present Home Automation data.\n\nI have started working on a module that communicates with the OpenHAB API to bring that information to Drupal 8 with the intention of eventually being able to control IOT items from within Drupal.\n\nI will be talking about the process of creating the module and progress to date.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.drupalcamp.sg/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: Zion Ng"
