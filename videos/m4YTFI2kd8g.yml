title: 'Making Night in the Woods Better with Open Source'
recordingDate: 1484832207
description: "Jon Manning\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/194/\nNo matter what your role, you've almost certainly used open source code in your project. But it's much rarer to see a game release code of it's own, when doing so can be a huge boost to your production. In this session, you'll learn how Night in the Woods open sourced Yarn, the dialogue system managing all of the text in the game, in the middle of production. We'll discuss how the community took it over, made it better, and improved the life of the development team as a result. Come and see how to give back, and get more."
