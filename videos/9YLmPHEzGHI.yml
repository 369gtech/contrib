description: "Scripting languages that are emerging and not yet mainstream vie with each other to stake a claim that they have the potential to become mainstream and be regarded as big-league. Don’t miss this panel discussion, in which these emerging languages are portrayed by their respective champions, who explain how they may help your everyday life as a Java developer. To present a complete picture, the session includes some languages that may not run on the JVM. Afterward you will have a better grasp of the emerging languages and the ecosystem. One or more of the languages may catch your fancy for doing development alongside Java.\n\n\nAuthors:\nCharles Nutter\nCharles has been programming most of his life, as a Java developer for the past decade and as a JRuby developer for over six years. He co-leads the JRuby project, an effort to bring the beauty of Ruby and the power of the JVM together. Charles believes in open source and open standards and hopes his efforts on JRuby and other languages will ensure the JVM remains the preferred open-source managed runtime for many years to come.\nView more trainings by Charles Nutter at https://www.parleys.com/author/charles-nutter-4\n\nDierk Koenig\nDierk König (JavaOne Rock Star) works as a fellow for Canoo Engineering AG, Basel, Switzerland.\nHe is a committer to many open-source projects including OpenDolphin, Groovy, Grails, GPars and GroovyFX.\nHe is lead author of the \"Groovy in Action\" book, which is among the publisher's best-selling titles of the decade.\nView more trainings by Dierk Koenig at https://www.parleys.com/author/dierk-koenig\n\nHadi Hariri\nHadi Hariri is a developer, speaker, podcaster and Technical Evangelist at JetBrains.
