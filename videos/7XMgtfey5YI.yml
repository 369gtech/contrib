description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nMesh in a Mesh: A Model for Stronger Multi-tenancy of Kubernetes Workloads - Nitish Malhotra & Akash Baid, Affirmed Networks \n\nMost organizations use some flavor of multi-tenancy in their clusters for their teams, applications or customers. Namespaces paired with RBAC, ResourceQuota & NetworkPolicy provide ways to isolate tenants at some level. However these primitives are insufficient for setting L7 policies on the ingress/egress traffic per tenant.  If you’re administering clusters for multiple tenants, attend this talk to learn a new model for deploying workloads in tenant specific sub-meshes within your service mesh. This model uses Envoy based ingress/egress gateways per-tenant, which helps: - set traffic policies and scale resources per-tenant - hide tenant application topology when communicating with external entities - assign per-tenant identities (SPIFFE) for use with transport authentication (mTLS), authorization (OAuth2) & origin authentication (JWT) - share mesh control plane resources across tenants\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zelb"
