description: "As a child of science fiction, the words that captured my imagination from the Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship were 'Raising the bar'. How can we raise the bar? What is the realm of possibility? What is beyond what we imagine possible? In this talk, I will go through a number of ideas that can help raise the bar. Here are a few:\n\n- Reaching out to scientists\n- Turning back time to fix our design mistakes\n- Mixing software development with other domains: usability, material physics, or maths\n- Get inspired from the work of other designers\n- Fundamental properties\n- My hope is that these ideas will capture your imagination and you will help improve, test and implement some of them.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2018, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
