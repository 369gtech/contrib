description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nDiscreetly Studying the Effects of Individual Traffic Control Functions - Lee Calcote & Prateek Sahu, Layer5 \n\nLike path-based routing? How about attribute-based whitelisting? Manipulating request headers and routing? (yes, you do.)  Service meshes offer granular control over service traffic, allowing you bend network traffic to your will. But, how do these individual traffic controls perform? How much latency do they induce? We present a study on the effects of individual traffic controls in a service mesh.  Using a simple application, we will show how users can chain together multiple (fake) microservices, which are configurable in terms of their behavior (i.e. respond precisely and consistently) in performance test environments.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zetg"
