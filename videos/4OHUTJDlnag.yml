title: 'Flink + Pulsar: The Path To Unified Batch and Streaming'
recordingDate: 1603985710
description: "While Flink supports unified batch and streaming compute, most stream storage systems aren’t capable of supporting it. Apache Pulsar’s unique design, combined with some new features currently in development, solve this problem. \n\nIn this video, we talk about these new features, such as parallel batch reads to enable batch workloads, Key_Shared subscriptions for simpler and more scalable consumption, and the inclusion of the Pulsar Connector into Flink. \n\nWe discuss how these features are enabling advanced use cases in Flink today, such as BIGO, a live-streaming app that uses Flink and Pulsar to power its core technology that is delivered to over 100 million users. \n\nWe also cover the current state of a unified stream and batch processing solution that can handle both large, historical jobs and near-time applications."
