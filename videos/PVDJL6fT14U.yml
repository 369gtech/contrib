title: 'NAME THAT SCRIPT!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526567107
description: "How many third-party scripts are loading on our web pages these days? How can we objectively measure the value of these (advertising, a/b testing, analytics, etc.) scripts — considering their impact on web performance, user experience, and business goals?\nWe’ve learned to scrutinize content hierarchy, browser support, and page speed as part of the design and development process.\nSimilarly, Trent will share recent experiences and explore ways to evaluate and discuss the inclusion of 3rd-party scripts.\n\nEVENT:\n\nSmashingConf San Francisco 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nTrent Walton\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nSmashingConf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video."
