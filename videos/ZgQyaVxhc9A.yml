description: "https://developer.oracle.com | Jerry Ward, Managing Partner, Viscosity North America. Erik Espinoza, Solutions Architect, Viscosity North America.\n\nYou can now use a single framework and codebase to build your web, mobile, and desktop applications. Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (Oracle JET) paired with Oracle Cloud Platform and DBaaS make it possible. This session demonstrates a timekeeping application written once but running as (1) a web application, (2) a native mobile application on iOS and Android using Apache Cordova, and (3) an offline desktop application using Electron (Chromium and Node.js). Not only is it faster and cheaper to build your applications with Oracle JET but also your apps will inherit the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) elements that so many are familiar with in Oracle’s other SaaS and PaS offerings.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com"
