description: "Meg Cassidy & Robert Wood from Nuna, Inc. - ChefConf 2017\n\nThe risks faced by corporate IT teams have been rapidly changing in recent years, causing us to forego many of our previous assumptions about security, perimeters, and endpoint management in particular. To lay a foundation, we will discuss our assessment of the organization's corporate IT attack surface, as well as our corporate IT threat model and technology stack. We will delve into the processes and technologies we rely on to mitigate these known and unknown risks, with a focus on how we are utilizing Chef for securing our macOS-based fleet."
