It opens a rich opportunity to not only monitor health of Flink pipelines but also attach real-time business intelligence metrics to run alongside existing Flink data jobs, thus avoiding a need to build a separate BI data-flow infrastructure. However, most of the work still resides with application developers: they have to define how those metrics are registered, calculated and attached to Flink functional operators â€“ and then Flink will do the computation and reporting.  The most challenging task is to add BI-like metrics, with key dimensions dynamically extracted from streamed data and metric values likely needed to be aggregated over multiple Flink tasks. We present a toolkit that extends Flink metrics and allows to decorate existing Flink operators with both simple health-check and complex BI-like metrics, updated and observable in real-time through IT monitoring and BI visualization dashboards. This work is based on a real-world production use-case of computing retail merchandise prices in real-time for the Walmart e-commerce catalog using Flink.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
