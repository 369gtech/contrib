title: '4 JVM Web Frameworks in 40 Minutes by Joe Kutner'
language: English
recordingDate: 1447405618
description: "Play, Rails, Ratpack, and Immutant. These frameworks use alternative JVM languages -- Scala, JRuby, Groovy and Clojure -- to reimagine how we build web applications. But are they mature enough for production? Can they scale? Will they solve your problems or create new ones?\n\nIn this talk, you値l learn how JVM developers are using these frameworks in the real world. We値l compare the benefits and drawbacks of each, and look at what unique features they provide.\n\nWe値l begin with a brief introduction to each framework. You値l learn how to get started, build content, and deploy to the cloud. Then we値l compare caching, database connectivity, templating, asynchronous request processing, language paradigms, build tools, web sockets and even documentation. After this talk, you値l be able to decide which framework is best for your next project."
