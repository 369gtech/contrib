How do you take advantage of “Best in Cloud” features from multiple cloud providers? These are just some of the questions that technologists are grappling with in the new multi-cloud reality.\nIn this session, we will confront these questions with an example of a Java-based microservices application running globally on multiple clouds, taking advantage of different infrastructures and services including Spring Cloud.\nThe Cloud Foundry platform is an important enabler of the capability to deliver multi-cloud, reliable applications to users world-wide.\nThe audience will learn about the benefits achieved by running applications in a multi-cloud model, and how to do it effectively. \n\nAbout Maggie Ambrose\nMaggie is part of the Global Ecosystem Team at Pivotal.
