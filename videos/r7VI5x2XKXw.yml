description: "Feature toggles are a great asset to your development workflow - they make experimentation and incremental changes easier and help push features through faster. But there are potential problems: old flags, unused flags, or worse, re-used flags can come and bite you when you are least expecting it.\n\nThis talk will cover how to use feature toggles effectively, cover some of the horror stories, how the horrors can be avoided, and how to deal with them if they do occur."
