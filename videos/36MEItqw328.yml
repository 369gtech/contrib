title: 'Inside a static analyser: type system - Yuri Minaev - NDC TechTown 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635935799
description: 'C++ is a wonderful language to use. It becomes even more wonderful if you''re looking at it from the other side of the fence. Parsing and compiling C++ code is far from trivial. We''ll take a look at possible representations of types inside a program which does just that. For that, we''ll look at the PVS-Studio C++ analyser''s internal mechanisms that deal with types. The current implementation is somewhat questionable, so, it is being redone. I''ll give you an idea of how it currently works and how it will be working. We''ll also take a look at some implementation details of the new type system.'
