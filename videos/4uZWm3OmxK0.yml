description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nPanel: Security Is Not A Unicorn - Jay Beale, InGuardians; Marlow Weston, Intel; Trupti Shiralkar, Illumio; Aeva Black & Sarah Young, Microsoft \n\nDo you have to trade performance for security?  Panelists will gather to discuss whether current kubernetes security best practices are at odds with the architectural requirements of heavy computational workloads such as those in machine learning or High-Performance Computing (HPC). The panelists will discuss where the bottlenecks are, what security risks are known, and what industry tools are used to address these issues. The panelists will also draw comparisons to more traditional HPC-style workloads and see what lessons can be drawn from that stalwart legacy.  The panel will be moderated by Jay Beale, CTO of InGuardians, who co-leads the Kubernetes project’s third party security audit working group.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zerz"
