title: '[VDT19] One app to rule them all - Building a white-label application with React Native'
language: English
recordingDate: 1570813031
description: "by Amedeo Zucchetti\n\nMore and more companies want to have their own application, some even want to have more than just one. But, as you know, the cost of developing one app is high, and often enough developing a whole suite of applications, even if similar to each other and sharing some characteristics, is even more expensive and time consuming. Developing three to four applications at once is often too much for a small team of developers.\n\nHere comes in our help React Native. The framework already provides a way to build applications for both iOS and Android in one go, but we can push it even further. In this presentation we will see how to build a white-label application, a mould that can be used to generate several apps.\n\nGiven a suite of applications that share a similar structure (e.g., the navigation system) and have common content (e.g., an area that appears in two or more applications), we will see how to build an application that helps avoiding code repetition, yet allows each individual app to have its own content and custom styles."
