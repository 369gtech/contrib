description: "by Gautier de Montmollin\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.125/ada_hac.webm\n\nIn the Ada world, we are surrounded by impressive and professional\ntools that can handle large and complex projects.  Did you ever\ndream of a tiny, incomplete but compatible system to play with?\nAre you too impatient, when developing small pieces of code, for\nlong compile-bind-link-run cycles?  Are you a beginner intimidated by\nproject files and sophisticated tools?  Then HAC (the HAC Ada Compiler,\nor the Hello-world Ada Compiler) is for you.\nHAC is a revival of the SmallAda project, which supported the \"Pascal\nsubset\" plus tasking.\n\nRoom: AW1.125\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 10:30:00"
