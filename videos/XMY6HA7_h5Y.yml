description: "Although Java’s strict type system is a great help for avoiding programming errors, it makes it difficult for framework developers to access and extend their users’ unknown type hierarchies. At the same time, the framework users often do not want the framework types to intrude on their application code, a concept known as working with POJOs, plain old Java objects. To overcome this, many of today’s frameworks make use of code generation. This way a framework can create new Java classes at runtime when the user types first become visible to the framework. This session gives you an overview of runtime code generation on the Java platform and introduces Byte Buddy, a novel library that comes with an easy DSL for creating compiled Java classes.\n\n\nAuthor:\nRafael Winterhalter\nRafael works as a software engineer in Oslo, Norway. He is a proponent of static typing and a JVM enthusiast with particular interests in code instrumentation, concurrency and functional programming. Rafael blogs about software development, regularly presents at conferences and was pronounced a Java One Rock Star. When coding outside of his work place, he contributes to a wide range of open source projects and often works on Byte Buddy, a library for simple runtime code generation for the Java virtual machine.\n\nOnline: http://rafael.codes\nTwitter: @rafaelcodes\nView more trainings by Rafael Winterhalter at https://www.parleys.com/author/rafael-winterhalter\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
