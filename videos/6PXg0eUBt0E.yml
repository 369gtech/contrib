description: "by Patrick HÃ¶hn\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.126/geo_navit.webm\n\n\nNavit is a car navigation system with routing engine. Navit's modular design is capable of using vector maps of various formats for routing and rendering on the screen. It's even possible to use multiple maps at the same time. Points of Interest of various formats are displayed on the map. The current vehicle position is either read from gpsd or directly from NMEA GPS sensors. The routing engine not only calculates an optimal route to your destination, but also generates directions and even speaks to you in 49 languages. It can run on various platforms, e.g. raspberry pi, tomtom, desktop pcs. \n\nThe talk will in particular discuss challenges and approaches faced in the continious integration and testing of an open source GPS app. \n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:05:00+01"
