description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nThe term \"programming language\" is often used to describe the medium we use to build software. However, to what extent can we also consider programming languages as interfaces in their own right? Are they sufficiently expressive, interactive and dynamic to, say, control a musical instrument? What if the programming language was the musical instrument? How might that challenge our perception of programming language and tools in general. For example, what happens when we consider the act of programming as a performance? What might a music programming environment which has sufficient liveness, rapid feedback and tolerance of failure look like? What benefits would such a style of programming offer business? Could live coding be beneficial for rapid prototyping, exploring big data sets, and even communicating formal business ideas?\nWeaving Immutable Data Structures into Ephemeral Sounds - Conference Party\n\nArmed with laptops, monomes and number of simple MIDI Kontrollers, we harness the full power of the SuperCollider synthesis engine through the incredible Overtone platform. We don't just use our laptops to tweak GUI sliders and pots, we write raw Clojure code into Emacs live in our performances. We also generate real-time visualisations perfectly synchronised to the sound with Quil and Shadertone. All the code for our sets is open source and available for you to play with: Meta-eX Ignite.\n\nLive Hacking allows us to generate music on-the-fly enabling us to change the direction of the sound and respond to our environment at a whim. Our sounds aren't pre-recorded and tweaked on-stage, they're coded and generated live in real time. We produce a real raw noise rather than manufactured industry-polished pseudo-perfection. Our sound isn't hardcore, breakcore or speedcore - it's multi-core and fully hyper-threaded."
