title: 'What I now know about HAproxied Django DB connections, and wish I''d known sooner'

description: "Florian Haas\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/YZYTMX\n\nWhen you’re running a Django application, the following things are all pretty commonplace:\r\n\r\n* You use MySQL or MariaDB as your Django database backend.\r\n* You don’t run a single standalone MySQL/MariaDB instance, but a Galera cluster.\r\n* You run asynchronous tasks in Celery.\r\n\r\nNow suppose your application doesn’t talk to your Galera cluster directly, but via HAProxy. That’s not exactly unheard of; in fact it’s an officially documented HA option for Galera. And, to complicate things further, this may be a feature of your setup that you, the application developer, don't necessarily have control over.\r\n\r\nIn such a scenario, you may be dealing with very \"interesting\" features of HAproxy which — if you are unfamiliar with them — can throw you very nasty curveballs.\r\n\r\nHaving been in the position where, together with my team, I *was* indeed unfamiliar with some of HAProxy's/Galera's intricacies and we were thus on he receiving end of those curveballs, I am taking this opportunity to share our findings so that our pain is someone else's gain. You have multiple options at your disposal — some in your infrastructure setup, and some in your Django application code. This talk covers both those angles.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 13:55:00 2020 at Obvious"
