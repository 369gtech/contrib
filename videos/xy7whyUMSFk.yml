description: "► Check out https://gorails.com for Pro episodes and more!\n► SaaS business template for Ruby on Rails with built-in features like Payments, Teams, and much more: https://jumpstartrails.com\n► Ruby on Rails hosting with Hatchbox.io: https://hatchbox.io\n► Learn how to add Stripe Payments (with SCA support!) with Ruby on Rails: https://courses.gorails.com/payments-with-rails-master-class\n\nRails 6.1.0.rc1 was just released which means we will be upgrading our Rails apps very soon!\n\nUpgrading Rails can be tough, that's why it can be super useful to dual boot your Rails app against two versions. This allows you to work on your app like normal but also keep an eye on your code's compatibility with the next version of Rails. This way you can be ready for an easy upgrade to the next version."
