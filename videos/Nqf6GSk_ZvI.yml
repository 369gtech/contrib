description: 'JUnit5 (JUnit Lambda) is a project to update the de facto standard in Java testing tools. This session describes how the framework has evolved to enable the modern features of the JVM as well as the underlying architectural changes that make JUnit5 ready for the modern era of Java. Test parameters and dynamic test generation are now supported. Other key facets of the new architecture are modularity and the inclusion of callbacks to allow extensibility from many points in the test lifecycle. After an introduction to JUnit5, demonstrations include how to write JUnit5 tests, how to run JUnit5 tests, and how to write extensions to alter the default test engine behavior. No familiarity with automated testing is assumed.'
