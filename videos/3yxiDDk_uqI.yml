recordingDate: 1553256592
description: "It’s not always easy to start, with a number of languages and technologies you can pick what you like the most. What about people who just start their adventure? How should they judge which language will be the best to learn? What should they do first? It took me many years, from the time when I wanted to write some code, to actually doing it. That’s why, I try to help young children, learn coding the fun way. Join the session to hear more about CoderDojo and how you can inspire a future generation of passionate coders.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
