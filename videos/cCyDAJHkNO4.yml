description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nKubernetes Attack and Defense: Inception-Style - Jay Beale, InGuardians \n\nThis demo-heavy talk starts by monkey-in-the-middling a software update, to create a poisoned pod. From there, the attack follows the plot of the movie Inception, incorporating a monkey-in-the-middle attack on a service, a public cloud API attack, and a pod security policy evasion. We will demonstrate a defense, replacing pod security policies with OPA/Gatekeeper. The scenario demonstrated will be added to the open source Bustakube cluster, allowing everyone to practice the same attack and defense. \n\nhttps://sched.co/aO4n"
