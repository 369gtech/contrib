recordingDate: 1447631079
description: "With over 160 dealerships in all corners of Australia, the task of delivering hundreds of individually customised tablets across the Hyundai dealer network at first seemed quite daunting. Learn how through the use of system backups and Android UI automation, webqem was able to streamline the setup process and configure hundreds of devices in parallel, and how these techniques could be leveraged on a wide variety of projects.\n\nThis talk will touch on creating software to manage parallel device setup and management, the ins and outs of Android backups, how Android UI automation can be leveraged for more than just application testing, and explore ways in which having root access could simplify this process.\n\nChris is the lead mobile app developer and architect at webqem, a collective of 40+ strategists, creatives & geeks with a unique digital-DNA.\n\nFor more on YOW!
