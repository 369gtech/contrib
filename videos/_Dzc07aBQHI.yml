description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWhat Do You Mean K8s Doesn't Have Users? How Do I Manage User Access Then? - Jussi Nummelin, Mirantis Inc.\n\nWhat if I told you that once you give someone client certificate access to your Kubernetes cluster you can't take it away again? It's true. Once you create an authentication key and give it access to the cluster, there's no way to revoke it. That person has access forever. And that's just one of the weird things about Kubernetes Authentication and Authorization. In this session, you will learn about how Kubernetes handles users and permissions, and how to set up your cluster to do it more efficiently and securely. You'll learn: How access keys work How permissions work How to segment your cluster for greater security How Role-Based Access Control limits what individual users can see and do How to use OpenID Connect to get around the issue of permanent access without having to manage hundreds or thousands of individual Roles You will leave this session ready to create a more secure and convenient way to manage your cluster."
