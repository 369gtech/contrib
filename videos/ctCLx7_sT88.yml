Are there other results to mention?\n\nðŸ“º Related Episodes to watch next:\nDevSecOps: bringing security into your DevOps practice on Azure  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DrRFsnrj7k&list=PLlrxD0HtieHjThIheXKKON1YJA2K2uE-P&index=13\nImprove app security with Application Security Groups https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iapLro95MO4&list=PLlrxD0HtieHjThIheXKKON1YJA2K2uE-P&index=11\nBetter app token security through application roles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L4rzy8h_CI&list=PLlrxD0HtieHjThIheXKKON1YJA2K2uE-P&index=12\n\nðŸ”´ To watch more episodes in the Well-Architected Series, check out our playlist: https://aka.ms/azenable/yt/wa-playlist\n\nðŸ“² Connect:  \nDavid Blank-Edelman @otterbook https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fchannel9.msdn.com%2F&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&region=follow_link&screen_name=otterbook&tw_p=followbutton\n\nðŸ“² Victoria Almazova @texnokot https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fchannel9.msdn.com%2F&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&screen_name=texnokot&tw_p=followbutton\n\n#Azure #AzureEnablementShow #WellArchitected"
