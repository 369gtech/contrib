description: "Welcome to 2019: Everything* is online. No one cares about security*. That's the state of the Internet.\n\nTraveling back to the 80s: a very young, very curious boy finds not much joy in playing with his toys and smashing now vintage cameras with a hammer. His relatives gift him a homemade computer that the Soviets bootlegged from the West. That's the beginning of story about a road to becoming a white-hat hacker.\n\nThis talk is also a story about cybersecurity and how it came to be. The inception of the Internet. The dot-com bubble. The first malicious cyberattacks. That's how we got to where we are.\n\nYou'll ask â€” but what about the future? I can tell you your future: you will get hacked; your employer will get hacked; your home will get hacked; your government will get hacked... likely they already have.\n\nThe speech took on 8th May 2019 on DevTrends Stage during Infoshare 2019."
