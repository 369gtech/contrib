title: 'GeeCON Prague 2018: Ansgar Brauner - Introduce girls to programming and reduce the gender gap'
recordingDate: 1541257470
description: 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) is what our society needs to focus on if it wants to be competitive in the future. But in order to succeed with that, it also needs to let kids discover the best career for them without any negative influence from gender stereotypes. In the tech-industry we are missing out almost 50% of a populations potential if we do not encourage girls to choose a career in tech. In this session we will share the tools and projects that helped us to organize an event we call Hackdays4Girls and which will enable you to awake your daughters (and sons) enthusiasm for technology and programming. We will let you know what you have to think of if you want to encourage not only your own kids but also other girls from within your company, your Java User Group or your daughters school. Beside looking at block-programming and Javascript with “Scratch” we will have a look at microcontrollers like the “BBC Micro:bit” or the “Calliope”.'
