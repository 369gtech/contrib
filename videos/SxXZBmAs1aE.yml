description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/how-data-science-is-preventing-college-dropouts-and-advancing-student-success\n\nEducational institutions have a wealth of information, which can be brought together in an institutional data lake to predict and influence student behavior. In this webinar, one of Pivotal's principal data scientists discusses a recent collaborative project with a top university, in which many data sources were used to build a 360-degree profile of student activity on campus and help predict student success. Learn about the data science pipelines that Pivotal developed and how they are now being used to predict student metrics (such as GPA, course grade and time to graduate), and even as intervention tools to help prevent students from dropping out.\n\nSpeaker: Bill Vorhies, DSC; Regunathan Radhakrishnan, Pivotal"
