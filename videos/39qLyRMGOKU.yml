description: "Synthesizing Plausible Infrastructure Configurations for Evaluating Edge Computing Systems\n\nThomas Rausch, Clemens Lachner, Pantelis A. Frangoudis, Philipp Raith, and Schahram Dustdar, TU Wien\n\nThis paper proposes a framework for synthesizing infrastructure configurations for evaluating edge computing systems under different conditions. There are a number of tools to simulate or emulate edge systems, and while they typically provide ways of modeling infrastructure and network topologies, they lack reusable building blocks common to edge scenarios. Consequently, most edge computing systems evaluations to this date rely on either highly application-specific testbeds, or abstract scenarios and abstract infrastructure configurations. We analyze four existing or emerging edge infrastructure scenarios, from which we elicit common concepts. The scenarios serve as input to synthesize plausible infrastructure configurations, that are parameterizable in cluster density, device heterogeneity, and network topology. We demonstrate how our tool can generate synthetic infrastructure configurations for the reference scenarios, and how these configurations can be used to evaluate aspects of edge computing systems.\n\nView the full HotEdge '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotedge20/workshop-program"
