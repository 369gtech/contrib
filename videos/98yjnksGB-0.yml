description: "What happens when a linguist learns to code?\r by Erica Sosa\n\nWhen people find out about my former career as a linguist and language teacher, they often ask if my background helped me learn how to code. I started to wonder if there was some overlap between learning a natural language and a programming language. What can we draw from the fields of first and second language acquisition that will help us become better software engineers? How can we apply the principles of language learning and teaching when training new developers? Join me as I discuss my journey from Ruby as a first language to JavaScript as a second, and stay for some code-learning tips from a former language acquisition professional.\n\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
