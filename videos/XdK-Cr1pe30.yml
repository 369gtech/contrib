recordingDate: 1343768016
description: "Metric doesn't work. At least, not for what it was intended to be: \"for all people for all time\". Scientists don't use metric. And even what we think of as metric isn't metric. It's a bastardization. And we've paid a price for this. Let's talk about it. (Cause, after all, you've always just assumed metric is better.)\n\nDan Bentley\n\nGoogle\n\nDan Bentley manages http://code.google.com. His passion is finding places that require the application of a little technology to have a big cultural win. His perfect project is boring and easy but impactful. He has a BA in English and an MS in Computer Science."
