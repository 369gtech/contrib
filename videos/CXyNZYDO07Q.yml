title: 'Technical debt isn''t technical - Einar W. HÃ¸st'
recordingDate: 1533039334
description: "Technical debt is not primarily caused by incompetent developers, architecture astronauts, unrealistic UX people or even stupid project managers. What causes it then? It is a symptom of weak abstractions, which stems from insufficient understanding and modelling of the problem domain. \nThese inadequacies are compounded by organizational inertia and communication problems. What does this mean? It means that we cannot hope to address our so-called technical debt by virtuous programming alone. In order to avoid technical bankruptcy, we must instead improve the way we collaborate and build our understanding of the problem we are trying to solve."
