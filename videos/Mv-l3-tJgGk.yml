In this talk, Ewa Gasperowicz and Addy Osmani show you how to find and fix the most common web performance bottlenecks to improve your UX by using tools like Lighthouse and DevTools, and discover the latest browser APIs (e.g. Service Workers, Async Images, Fetch Priorities) to get more control over your loading experience.\n\nRate this session by signing-in on the I/O website here → https://goo.gl/fPdi7z\n\nWatch more Chrome and Web sessions from I/O '18 here → https://goo.gl/5fgXhX \nSee all the sessions from Google I/O '18 here → https://goo.gl/q1Tr8x\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel → http://goo.gl/LLLNvf\n\n#io18"
