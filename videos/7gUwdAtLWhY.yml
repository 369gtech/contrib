Conundrum #5 : with many Microservices touching many data sets, how do I guarantee uniformed security (GDPR anyone)?\nAnd the list goes on. This presentation is an opinionated answer to these questions. And yes we do demo these concepts.\n\nEmmanuel Bernard \nFrom Red Hat\nEmmanuel Bernard is Chief Architect, Data at Red Hat. He oversees how data and middleware interact and is involved in open source communities like Hibernate, Infinispan, Teiid, Debezium (Change Data Capture) and more. To sum up, everything data :) He is a Java Champion and a Java Community Process expert group member (JPA) and former spec lead (Bean Validation). He co-hosts two podcasts Les Cast Codeurs and JBoss Community Asylum.\n\nYou can follow him on twitter at @emmanuelbernard.\n\n\nMadou Coulibaly \nFrom Red Hat\nHello, my name is Madou Coulibaly and I am a EMEA Specialist Solution Architect at Red Hat since 2016 with a strong focus on Data. With 8+ years experience in Data & information management (BI, DW, Big Data, …), I am now working with customers across EMEA for providing expertise, guidance and knowledge about these Data products. Microservices is a new journey Data has to embark on with the big challenge to “live” in a distributed and complex environment. So to help it, Data brings me into this new adventure."
