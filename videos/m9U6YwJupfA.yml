description: "Hannah Thompson\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/126/\nI've challenged myself to learn Go in two months, with the aim of using the Gobot framework to control an Arduino device.\r\n\r\nI'm part of that emerging group of women who have learnt to code in order to career change. But instead of taking the plunge and quitting my job to spend six months at a bootcamp, I harnessed one of strongest skills - learning - and taught myself (I have a PhD, which basically means I'm really good at learning).\r\n\r\nThis talk will chart my journey of learning a new language - Go. I'll discuss the challenges, successes and failures I experience along the way and finally demonstrate what a new programmer can achieve in two months.\r\n\r\nWhy did I choose Go? Well, it's open source, there's an active community in my new hometown, there are plenty of resources for new users, and gophers are adorable. Also there are a lot of Go puns."
