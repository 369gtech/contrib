description: "Mike Jang\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/66/\n\nHave you ever looked at a beautiful website and said, “Huh\"? You can incorporate the latest JS framework and the best CSS, excel in accessibility, and make your website as beautiful as a Rembrandt, but websites with walls of text will still drive users away. Mike Jang explains that to keep your users happy, you need excellent UI text, also known as microcopy. Microcopy can save time—and make the difference in selling an application.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSun Jan 24 13:30:00 2021 at Blemings Labs"
