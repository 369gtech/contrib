description: "Controlling your race with Micrometer and Spring Boot / Micronaut\nKo Turk, Blue4IT\n\nAbstract \"Imagine that you’re part of a (car) race team. You’re the one behind the screens to control the race and make some tough decisions (like changing the team's strategy).\n\nBut you don’t have the insights (or metrics) about your car, opponents or even the weather. Sounds painful right? But why are we making this mistake when building our software? Why don’t we implement metrics by default?\n\nSLFf4J logging is one side of the story, but we also need to know our application health. That’s where Micrometer comes in! It’s a library which you can use to define your own custom metrics, like:\n\ntimers (to check the performance of your microservices)\ncounters (to check how many times a certain event is occurring)\ngauges (to check the current value of a variable)\nand many more\nThese metrics are exposed by REST endpoints (JSON) together with Spring Boot actuator, which can be saved into a database like Prometheus or Graphite. And to visualize the data you can use a tool like Grafana. Pretty interesting right?\n\nIn the demo (live coding!) Ko Turk will show you how to create such applications using Micrometer, Spring Boot and Cloud Foundry as our platform. Ready to win this race with him? Jump in!\n\nRecorded Tuesday 4 May 2021 kl. 12:00"
