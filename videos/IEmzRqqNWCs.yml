description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIntro to CNCF’s Telecom Initiatives - Taylor Carpenter, Vulk Coop & in Remembrance with Dan Kohn, The Linux Foundation \n\nDedicated to the memory of Dan Kohn.  CNCF is helping Telcos navigate the cloud native and open source landscape to obtain the benefits touted by cloud native technologies. Guided by cloud native principles, CNCF hosts three main initiatives for Telco operators and service providers: Telecom User Group, CNF Testbed and CNF Conformance. The Telecom User Group (TUG) is a user group for telecom operators, vendors, and developers to share ideas and ask questions about using cloud native technologies. The CNF Testbed is a set of tools and reference implementations used for reviewing cloud native technology innovation in the Telecom domain. The CNF Conformance is a test suite to self-validate that Cloud native Network Functions (CNFs) and the underlying Telecom platforms adhere to cloud native principles and best practices. This session will introduce these Telecom Initiatives, explain how downstream projects and communities can collaborate, and discuss how service providers and their vendors can get involved. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekG9"
