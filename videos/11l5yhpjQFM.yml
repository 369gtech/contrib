description: "Transforming the Retail Experience with Cloud Foundry and Machine Learning - Michael Goddard & Scott Truitt, Pivotal\n\nA superior customer experience is now a competitive advantage, as Amazon so deftly demonstrates through its effective combination of software and data.  We explore how traditional retailers can thrive in this new landscape by delivering a more compelling, personalized experience for their customers.\n\nStarting with personas \"modern customer\" and \"clothing retailer\", we demo a microservices-based experimental solution which combines Cloud Foundry, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Dataflow, cloud-based machine learning, and a mobile app.\n\nThe result: better engage with the customer, understand her, and deliver compelling offers that retain her loyalty.\n\nThe demo code is available under an Apache 2.0 license: https://github.com/pivotal-cf/oss-pcf-gcp-retail-demo\n\nAbout Michael Goddard\nMr. Goddard is a solution architect at Pivotal, working with Pivotal's system integrator and cloud partners. His software development experience dates back to 1994, when he discovered Linux while working on physics simulations; ever since that time, he has been hooked. That morphed into some work with large-ish Beowulf clusters, parallel MPICH FORTRAN codes for weather forecasting, followed by more traditional corporate IT development projects in Perl and Java. More recently, he has done work with the Greenplum (GPDB) MPP database, Hadoop and, now, Cloud Foundry, with a healthy dose of Spring Boot and Python. His current project involves creating a set of Spring Boot starter and autoconfiguration classes to simplify consumption of the Google Cloud Platform services provided by the GCP Service Broker, and this work appears within the proposed talk. He has presented on big data and Hadoop at EMC World events, but has primarily presented educational workshops ranging from a couple of hours to a week in duration, on big data related topics. A few of his e-learning presentations have been made available via YouTube and Pluralsight: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/dLdn1xWn4UY\nhttps://youtu.be/5HYX9SlK80o\nhttps://youtu.be/YKQmnkPNnUA\nhttps://www.pluralsight.com/courses/greenplum-developer-pivotal\n\nAbout Scott Truitt\nScott Truitt is product manager on the Data Innovation Lab team at Pivotal. He works with data scientists, data engineers, designers, developers, and customers to bring user-centered, data-driven projects to life. He is passionate about using data to build better and more meaningful user experiences."
