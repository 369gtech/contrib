description: 'Polis is an open source tool which uses data science to help groups build understanding and make decisions. At the core of this tool is a machine learning engine written in Clojure. As my very first Clojure project, and the reason I got into Clojure, this codebase offers a unique perspective from which to look back on my evolving use and understanding of the language. Along the way I hope to highlight the strengths of Clojure in data-science, and to explain what cybernetics _actually_ is.'
