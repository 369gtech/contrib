description: "\"There’s a Snake in the Birdhouse!\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Brian\nOnline\n\nBy Mason Egger\n\nIt’s no surprise why many of us are so enamored with Python. Its simplicity, accessibility, and community make it a prime choice for many projects. However, not all software engineering shops use Python, maybe even some of the jobs you work at. Introducing Python to your company and building a Pythonic culture from the ground up is no small task, but it can be done. Join me as I take you through the journey of getting Python from zero to hero within my previous company. I’ll share the experience from start to finish, including what worked, what didn’t, what I would have done differently, and how I evangelized Python to bring it to be a supported language within my company’s ecosystem. Viewers will leave having learned from my experiences—both successes and mistakes—and with a solid plan for implementing Python at their job.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
