title: 'Building a Health DAO with GitHub CoPilot (AlphaCare: Episode 5)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636407899
description: "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are the future of the Web. In this episode, we'll build a simple DAO that let's users submit their health data to a marketplace and let's health organizations buy that data, with the proceeds going directly to users. This is an idea I've been toying with for a few weeks as I'm really interested in ways of incentivizing people to be healthy. We'll learn about how DAOs work, then we'll build a toy DAO example. I'll then show you how to build a DAO without coding, then we'll build the Health DAO using Solidity, Truffle, Metamask, Ganache, IPFS, and Javascript. Interspersed in all of this are demos of GitHub's CoPilot tool that I now have access to, which auto-completes your code in an incredible way.
