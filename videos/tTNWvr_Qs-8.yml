description: "Slides: https://cpp-unexpected-behaviour.github.io/meetingcpp2017/\n\nDo you really think to know C++? Then you probably want to participate in this talk, you will discover the most surprising, weird, strange or really \"WTF\" language features you could encounter.\nThere are so many obscure corners of the language that seem to go against common programming intuition. The freedom that C++ gives the programmer may be a double-edged sword; while the user can do many things that have been abstracted away in other languages, it's very easy to shoot ourselves in the foot.\nFrom unintended private member access to unexpected function definitions, in this talk, we will walk you through the quirks that still exist in the language today, and the motivations behind them."
