description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nQuality of software products has always been important. Developers and QA are working hard to make sure our product is well made, bug free and with no regressions. What may go wrong in production then? Well, anything! Therefore monitoring is a critical component of any software solution regardless of used programming language, framework or technologies. Zabbix, enterprise level open source monitoring system, may be your extremely valuable DevOps tool aimed to smart problem detection and automatic resolution. Even more, Zabbix is capable of detecting potential performance and availability issues long before they turn into real problems noticed by end users! How? That’s what am going to talk about."
