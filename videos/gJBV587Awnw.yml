description: "DOES18 Las Vegas — DevOps and digital transformation are worldwide trends but not every country embraces them the same way. While competition may be global, local cultures and market presence affect how large corporations adapt to and measure these changes. A western approach to change in an eastern culture will face serious headwinds. This presentation by Electric Cloud partner Hancom MDS, based in Seoul, South Korea, will present the state of DevOps in Asia and how culture is impacting its adoption in global corporations that dominate their local markets. Included are case studies that will help anyone interacting with Asian companies or divisions understand how best to convey the benefits of DevOps adoption.\n\nThe State of DevOps in Asia\n\nAidan Lee, Systems Engineering Solutions Manager, Hancom MDS\n\nAidan has been HancomMDS’s DevOps Representative for over 4 years. He lived in western culture for 10 years for his high school and university years in both Canada and the United States. He uses his understanding of both Eastern and Western cultures to put Eastern and Western’s hybrid DevOps culture into Eastern culture or Korea.\nHe will discuss about the difference between Eastern and Western cultures, especially for DevOps, and how he implanted DevOps culture into one of the conservative Korea’s giant elephant company in Eastern culture.\n\nDOES18 Las Vegas\nDOES 2018 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
