title: 'LISA18 - Make Your System Firmware Faster, More Flexible and Reliable with LinuxBoot'

description: "Andrea Barberio and David Hendricks, Facebook\n\nAbstract: \nUEFI has largely replaced the traditional BIOS in servers, but it is still often limited and has bugs which can take a long time to be fixed by vendors. LinuxBoot, an open source effort, offers a solution to these and other problems by embedding Linux into a machine's firmware, and using it to initialise hardware and start the boot process. Amongst other advantages, this provides significantly faster boot time, enables us to more securely netboot systems over HTTPS and gives access to real debugging tooling. We will talk about the advantages of running LinuxBoot for reliability, speed and flexibility, and how you can try it today.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
