description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v\n\nGet involved in the next Code Sync conference - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nARGPARSE: COMPLEX CLI MADE SIMPLE\nby Maxim Fedorov\n\n\nABSTRACT\nMost programing languages have a way to interact via command line\narguments. So does Erlang. Tricky part is conversion between Unix\nshell conventions and Erlang. Some languages have libraries to do the\njob. Python has docopt, click, and argparse, all serving the purpose,\nand allowing complicated syntax. Erlang deserves to have some too.\nThis talk introduces argparse for Erlang.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/maxim-fedorov/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MAXIM FEDOROV\nPERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY ENGINEER\n\nMaxim Fedorov is a software engineer at WhatsApp, the largest messaging app. Maximâ€™s work is focused on performance and scalability of the server side.\n\nBefore WhatsApp, Maxim has been developing low-latency TCP/IP applications at NetAlliance (Sydney, Australia), designing Kaspersky Enterprise Security Endpoint (Moscow, Russia), improving Parallels Virtual Automation, called Odin now, at Parallels (former SWsoft), and developing network security software before.\n\nMore on Maxim Fedorov: https://codesync.global/speaker/maxim-fedorov/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM V 2020\nCode BEAM V is powered by Code Sync. Code BEAM V 2020 was sponsored by Klarna, Duffel, PepsiCo, Erlang Solutions, Mux, AppSignal, Clever Bunny, Pragmatic Bookshelf, O'Reilly, Manning Publications, Learning Stone, Groxio, Erlang Ecosystem Foundation.\n\nCODE SYNC \nWebsite: http://www.codesync.global \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/ \nMail: info at codesync.global"
