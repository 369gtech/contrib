title: 'SREcon20 Americas - Jupyter as Incident Response Tool'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608746690
description: "Jupyter as Incident Response Tool\n\nMoshe Zadka, Twisted Matrix Laboratories\n\nJupyter is commonly thought of as a \"\"data science tool\"\". But the same features that make it appealing to data scientists make it appealing for Site Reliability Engineering: dynamic exploration and ability to share results. The talk will set up an \"\"incident\"\" where a cache slowdown is causing site problems and will show how we can use Jupyter to triage and remediate the problem. I'll also cover post-incident best practices: how to make sure that what has been done is properly documented and ready for the incident retrospective.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
