title: 'YOW! 2011 Eric Evans - Domain Driven Design Strategies for Dealing With Legacy Systems'
language: English
recordingDate: 1499176898
description: "Often a team sets out to design a new piece of software using a domain model. At first they are focused on strategically valuable new features and modeling sessions clarify the new approach the business wants to take. Then they get bogged down because the work necessarily involves other systems. The newly designed part must be integrated with an external system and this leads to loss of clarity in the design. Or it must be integrated with a legacy system, compromising the new model. In response, the team may try to redesign more of the legacy system, and the scope expands. There are many ways this may happen, but they lead to the same place. The narrow focus on strategic value is lost, and the fresh and clear new approach to the problem is muddied. This talk will describe a few of the ways that the strategic design patterns of DDD,in particular, Bounded Context, are used to avoid these problems and make timely delivery of new software of modest scope but high value that is integrated with existing systems without being mired in the outdated models of the past.\n\nEric Evans is a specialist in domain modeling and design in large business systems. Since the early 1990s, he has worked on many projects developing large business systems with objects and has been deeply involved in applying Agile processes on real projects. Out of this range of experiences emerged the synthesis of principles and techniques shared in the book \"Domain-Driven Design,\" Addison-Wesley 2003. Eric now leads Domain Language, Inc., a consulting group which coaches and trains teams to make their development more productive and relevant through effective application of domain modeling and design.\n\nFor more on YOW!
