description: "by Diogo Sergio\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2213/git_workflow_for_design_in_os_projects.webm\n\nGitflow design as mentioned in the description is a git workflow for designers and design work. It's meant to be open, platform-agnostic and help minimise dependencies on proprietary software and help to increase collaboration.\n\n\nBy using git, we get to take advantage of a lot of useful features available such as controlled access, review process, feedback system, version control files, preview changes in context with side-by-side diffs, detailed history of changes and more, something developers had for years, but that designers never really took advantage o\nGitflow Design exists as a way to mitigate issues commonly found in design workflows of open-source software projects where the work created never comes into git. Which means such work is not being tracked and doesn't have an auditable history. Files also might not be stored in a common place accessible to everyone, so its always a hit and miss on how to gain access to them, and sometimes due to these being created with proprietary software they can sit behind a closed gateway and as contributors come and go from the project their access can be lost.\n\n\nBy using git we make things easier and open for anyone wanting to collaborate and hopefully streamlining the work process by connecting the development and design repositories together. For this to work a success we need to adopt a design workflow that focuses on open-source ideals, so that no one is restricted by proprietary software and gatekeepers. We introduce such workflow bellow which we have been testing, It's called Gitflow Design.\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 11:30:00"
