description: "HTTP/2 is the newly standardized successor of the HTTP 1.1 protocol. Given the market share of browsers already supporting it (or planning to do so), it will probably take the internet by storm by the end of 2015. You should prepare for it!\n\nThis talk will explain why HTTP/2 was built in the first place, and its differences and advantages over previous versions of the protocol. It will also describe the current server-side and client-side support along with suggestions as to how to implement it in your own infrastructure."
