description: "Behind Your PR: How Kubernetes Uses Kubernetes to Run Kubernetes CI - Sen Lu & Benjamin Elder, Google \n\nAs a contributor of CNCF/Kubernetes project, you open issues/PRs in one or more of the Kubernetes repos, and the k8s-ci-robot will add proper labels, assign reviewers, trigger presubmits, and automatically merge your PR. This talk will walk you through how Kubernetes CI is automated in Kubernetes clusters, how we use CRDs to manage the presubmit/CI jobsâ€™ lifecycle, and how we automate contributor workflows on Github. By the end of this talk, contributors to Kubernetes project should have a better understanding what happens behind the scenes for Kubernetes CI. Other github projects can also utilize our test-infra for their CI. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrSb"
