Moxie is a platform-agnostic component library to provide just that, currently targeting the DOM, win32, and WebRender, with more targets to come. We're on a path to building Rust apps that instantly reflect user intent, correctly handle inputs, and save battery and CPU cycles. We discuss what makes UI hard, how others handled that in the past, and what we can do today in Rust to clear those hurdles and unlock new powers.s"
