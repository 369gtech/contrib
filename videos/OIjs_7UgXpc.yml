description: "JAX-RS 2.0, which was released earlier this year, defines a new standard Java API for RESTful Web services. This major revision of the API adds important new features to cover additional common use cases in the API. The purpose of this technical session is to elaborate on the final form of all the new features that were introduced as part of this new major API revision. The session explores the new client API, concepts behind message filters and entity interceptors, and the newly added asynchronous processing programming model. Among the other new features covered in the session are data validation support, improved support for hypermedia, and server-side content negotiation. It also outlines future plans and focus areas.\n\n\nAuthors:\nSantiago Pericasgeertsen\nDr. Santiago Pericas-Geertsen is an engineer in the Glassfish organization at Oracle.
