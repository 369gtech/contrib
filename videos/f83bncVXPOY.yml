description: "Why and how CAAMI-HZIV entered the G-Cloud\n\nWhen CAAMI/HZIV was looking for a place to host their innovative microservice solution, they chose for the PaaS that Smals offers within the G-Cloud initiative.\n\nIn this session, we will show you an application of microservices architecture, and how the platform helped solving some of our challenges.\n\nWarning : Real world examples included\n\nGilles Stragier is a software architect at Smals. He has been working on various aspects of Social Security systems for the past decade including document management, accounting, or work relations related systems.\n\nHe currently works on a large modernization project at the CAAMI-HZIV federal institution, and daily uses OpenShift, Docker and Spring Boot.\n\nJef Verelst\nAfter his studies at the University of Antwerp (Computer Science & eBusiness) Jef started to work in the telecoms industry (mobile switching and network management).
