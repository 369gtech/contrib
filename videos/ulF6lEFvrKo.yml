Events can be replayed to backfill a new column, to fix a bug or to travel back in time. It is often described as a complex pattern that requires immutable databases, micro services and asynchronous communication.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce you to Event Sourcing and present the simple framework weâ€™ve built at Kickstarter. It runs on our Rails monolith, uses ActiveRecord models and a SQL database. And yet, it gives us super powers."
