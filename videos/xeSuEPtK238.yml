description: "Presented by Brittany Martin\n\nOur city's arts community is dependent on a 24/7 high volume Rails application. We revamped our deployment process to use the new AWS CodeDeploy.

In this talk, you will learn how to skip writing custom deployment tools and celebrate rapid development cycles.\n\nPresented at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA.
