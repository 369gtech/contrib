Are quantum chipsets going to replace classic ones in everyday use or will stay in scientific laboratories? How they can change our approach to encryption and cyber security world – are there more opportunities or threats?\n\nDuring this talk, I’ll try to answer these questions providing basic concepts of quantum computing topic. I’ll present problems that can actually be solved with this technology and as well as popular myths around this topic."
