title: 'Cloud Native Apps with Server-Side WebAssembly'
language: English
recordingDate: 1637185093
description: "Server-side WebAssembly has the potential to increase security, extend application portability, and simplify cloud-native applications when operated in the Kubernetes ecosystem. This talk explores the pros and cons of different deployment models - embedded in a container, native execution, or embedded into other components. We will demonstrate the power that WebAssembly brings to even those projects hosted in traditional containers. This talk features a live build, compilation, deployment, and operation of reference applications. Featuring wasmCloud, Krustlet, and Envoy.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
