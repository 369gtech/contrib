description: "DevOps is about delivering value to your users faster and safer. This sounds great, but it's a goal, not a guide. Let's forget the buzzwords and the tools for a moment and talk about the practical steps you can take to improve your own DevOps story. More importantly, let's talk about why DevOps is worthwhile in the first place.\n\nStarting from basic principles, we'll look at practical tips for your whole process with the aim of actually delivering value to our users as effectively as we can. From taming your backlog, managing your code, and dealing with parallel workstreams, all the way to building and versioning, maintaining infrastructure, deploying safely to production, and gathering feedback to guide your next work.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
