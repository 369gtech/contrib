recordingDate: 1545060707
description: "This talk will show how the relevance of search results can be improved by using morphology and named entity recognition. After briefly explaining the purpose of morphological analysis and of named entity recognition we will analyze their potential advantages for search, faceting, and clustering of search results. It will be shown that not only for languages such as German and French morphology has a lot of advantages compared to simple stemming. Based on these ideas we will focus on details how to implement a morphological analyzer in Lucene and how to implement a natural language question answering system based on Lucene using named entity recognition. The talk will be accompanied by a life demo of these ideas.\n\nMore Info: http://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/improve-relevance-using-morphology-and-named-entity-recognition\n\nDescription of Christoph Goller:\nhttp://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/christoph-goller"
