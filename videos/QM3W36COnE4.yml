description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nI will present a library that utilizes a feature of C++20 to build regular expressions from compile-time strings. This is a novel approach that doesn't have ordinary disadvantages of other regular expression implementations like having to use a linked library or a run-time cost of parsing and interpreting an internal finite machine. \n\nYou will see implementation details of the library and problems I have run into during its writing. In the last part of the talk, I will compare other implementations of regular expression engines and show compiled code in Compiler Explorer.\n— \nHana Dusíková, Avast\nSenior Researcher\n\nHana is working as a senior researcher in Avast Software. Her responsibility is exploring new ideas and optimizing existing ones. She also propagates modern C++ techniques and libraries in internal techtalks and gives talks at local C++ meetups. \n\nShe studied computer science at Mendel university and subsequently taught several courses there, including: Data Structures, Computability and Complexity, and Formal Languages and Automata.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
