description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nI will present a high-level overview of how automated image analysis approaches can be incorporated into pharmaceutical discovery pipelines. By taking a look at two GSK case studies I will demonstrate how to apply computer vision techniques to featurize imaging data, enabling the use of standard machine learning algorithms. I will highlight how these techniques benefit the drug discovery process.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
