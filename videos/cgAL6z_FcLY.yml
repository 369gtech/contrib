description: "Azure Static Web Apps is a new service that provides everything you need to host a modern web app that includes a serverless API. With Static Web Apps, you can use your favorite frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular, or static site generators like Hugo and Gatsby. You can write serverless APIs that are powered by Azure Functions and support Python (and Node.js and more).\n\nIn this demo, Anthony Chu deploys a Hugo site with a Python serverless API to Azure Static Web Apps.\n\n\n\nLearn more about Azure Static Web Apps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=devcloud-18509-cxa\n\n\n\nFollow Azure Static Web Apps on Twitter: https://twitter.com/azurestaticapps"
