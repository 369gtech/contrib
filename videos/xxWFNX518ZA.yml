title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2012: Lars George - Advanced HBase Schema Design'
recordingDate: 1545060606
description: "While running a simple key/value based solution on HBase usually requires an equally simple schema, it is less trivial to operate a different application that has to insert thousands of records per second. This talk will address the architectural challenges when designing for either read or write performance imposed by HBase. It will include examples of real world use-cases and how they can be implemented on top of HBase, using schemas that optimize for the given access patterns.\n\nMore info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/advanced-hbase-schema-design\n\nDescription of Lars George: \nhttps://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/lars-george"
