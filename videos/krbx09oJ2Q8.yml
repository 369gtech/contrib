description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHelping One of Europe's Banks Re-platform with Declarative, Self-healing, Multi-cloud WasmCloud Clusters on Kubernetes - Stuart Harris & Aayush Attri, Red Badger\n\nNext-generation platforms are evolving away from containers, and towards server-side WebAssembly. wasmcloud leverages a NATS messaging substrate to provide self-healing clusters that can span clouds, whilst remaining unaware of underlying network topology and vendor-specific products. Developer productivity is improved by avoiding boilerplate and building highly focused, lightweight, reliable and secure services. Our talk explores this paradigm shift, and demonstrates a declarative way to deploy distributed applications on a wasmcloud lattice that spans multiple cloud providers across geographic locations. It will also show seamless failover (and recovery) between cloud providers when there is a server outage or a network partition. Red Badger was engaged by one of Europe’s largest banks to help them understand what their future state architecture should look like. Multi-cloud is a must, and resilience and portability are highly desirable. We believe that such a platform looks something like k8s+service mesh+wasmcloud+NATS+GitOps. We've built a PoC platform around this technology which we'd love to talk through, demonstrate, and talk about why this approach is game-changer for the finance industry and beyond."
