description: "Turning the Battleship: A Principled Approach to Driving Change in DoD IT\n\nKurt Hockaday, Data Systems Tech Lead, Joint Warfare Analysis Center \n\nThe military works best with a clear objective. It’s no different for the systems that support it. When you are running short on time, people and patience, it helps to see each release marching toward the goal. Just don’t forget about bringing the people with you! I’ll share some lessons learned and forgotten, successes and mistakes made as we try to provide faster, more accurate options to our nation’s warfighters.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
