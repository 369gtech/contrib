title: 'React Native EU 2020: Saknet Sahu - Building Real-Time Multi-User Apps With JSON Patches'
recordingDate: 1603368050
description: "Abstract:\nSON patches can be used over JSON document for persistent storage that opens up the doors for realtime multi-user apps. They are serializable, small-sized, transferable between realms (threads and network); helps in multi-user implementation, easy to version with history (undo/redo), offline first (optimistic updates). Let's use JSON patches with React / React Native to build a framework for real-time multi-user apps."
