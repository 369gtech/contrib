How do you know? What about legacy interfaces written ten years ago? What about the code you will write next week? Are your dependencies exception safe? \n\nBest practices for writing exception-safe code have long been established, but tests for exception safety remain rare even though the seminal work on the topic was written nearly twenty years ago. We will discuss the fundamentals of exception safety and how you can ensure the exception safety of your APIs using new features in Googletest. This will include examples of how we used these features to find bugs in Abseil, bugs in standard libraries, and even bugs in the standard itself! By the end of this talk you will have the tools to ensure that your codebase is exception-safe both now and into the future.\n— \nJon Cohen\nSoftware Engineer, Google\nJon Cohen is an engineer at Google, maintaining our core common C++ libraries. He spends most of his days directing Google's robot army to rewrite its own source code to be more readable and efficient, and has so far managed to do so without accidentally creating Skynet.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
