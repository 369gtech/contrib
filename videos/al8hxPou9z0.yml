title: 'Async Communication Between WARs with WebSockets'
language: German
recordingDate: 1486114324
description: "WebSockets are a built-in way for asynchronous communication between WAR Microservices. In this screencast I create two WARs from scratch and let them communicate with each other. WebSockets come with Java EE 7 so there are no external dependencies needed. Each WAR is only a few kilobytes.\n\nSee you at: http://workshops.adam-bien.com and particularly and / or http://javaeemicro.services"
