description: "What do you do after you learn Kubernetes, after you deploy your applications to a production cluster, and after you fully automate continuous deployment pipeline? You work on making your cluster self-sufficient by adding monitoring, alerting, logging, and auto-scaling.\n\nThe fact that we can run (almost) anything in Kubernetes and that it will do its best to make it fault tolerant and highly available, does not mean that our applications and clusters are bulletproof. We need to monitor the cluster, and we need alerts that will notify us of potential issues. When we do discover that there is a problem, we need to be able to query metrics and logs of the whole system. We can fix an issue only once we know what the root cause is. In highly dynamic distributed systems like Kubernetes, that is not as easy as it looks. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf3"
