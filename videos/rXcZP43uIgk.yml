description: "Charlie Wollborg, or Charlie Curve as he's known online, is a purveyor of attention. He helps growing brands stand out from the clutter.  He opened the doors at Curve Detroit Marketing Strategy & Creative Design after being thrown out of several well respected ad agencies. When he's not building brands, you'll find Charlie inspiring, educating and entertaining business audiences with his lively keynote presentations. He's helping organize the third TEDxDetroit event this fall. Last year, he was named the second best PowerPoint Karaoke presenter in the world. This year, he hopes to win something that people have actually heard of. Charlie is happily married to his unhappily married wife, Elena. They have two young sons with wild imaginations and boundless energy and one lazy cat.\n\nOpening graphic and video produced by LCC-TV.\nVideos edited by Nick Kwiatkowski."
