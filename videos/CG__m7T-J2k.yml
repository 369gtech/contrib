title: 'Taking over someone else''s codebase by Florian Mierzejewski, TradeRepublic EN'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592403195
description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Florian Mierzejewski, TradeRepublic.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=176369\n\nAndroid has now been around for quite a while and it's becoming rare to have the chance of writing a new app from scratch in a professional environment. In this talk we'll have a look at problems that may arise while taking on someone else's codebase, what can be done to have an impact from day one and avoid the usual \"I don't understand this code\" frustration.\r\nThis talk will include both technical bits (quick architecture wins, gradle tweaking...)  as well as more generic advice regarding communicating empathically with other developers and making incremental changes leading to a codebase we feel comfortable and happy with."
