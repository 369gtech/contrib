description: "Tickets are now available for The Lead Developer UK 2018:  https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\n\nThe path from being a developer to a Tech Lead seems like a scary transition. As a developer, you could focus on constantly learning new tools, libraries, frameworks and programming languages. It was mostly you and the computer. The Tech Lead role feels like a path where you will no longer get to code. You feel like you know what makes a good developer, but you’re unsure about what makes a good Tech Lead. In this talk, Pat Kua will reveal the lessons he wishes he’d learnt as a first time Tech Lead.\n\nABOUT PATRICK KUA\n\nPatrick is a Principal Technical Consultant at ThoughtWorks who is normally found leading development teams. He is a conference speaker and author of The Retrospective Handbook and Talking with Tech Leads and is passionate about bringing a balanced focus on people, organisation and technology."
