description: 'There''s a lot of confusion about async/await, Task/TPL, and asynchronous and parallel programming in general.

In future videos, weâ€™ll look at continuations, cancellation, and exception handling. To download the code and get additional information, visit http://www.jeremybytes.com/Downloads.aspx#Tasks'
