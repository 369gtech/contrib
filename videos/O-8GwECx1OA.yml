title: 'The evolution of the AI developer by Dale Lane'
language: English
recordingDate: 1640002830
description: "Learning to code in the modern era is a world away from how many of us developed our skills. \n\nProgramming used to be algorithmic and is becoming ever more heuristic in its nature, with machine learning and artificial intelligence coming more to the fore.\n\nHaving been a developer for 18 years - yes, his development career is officially an adult - Dale Lane has spent much of his time working on AI and ML projects. From involvement in large-scale research ML projects led by expert PhDâ€™s to fun educational projects with a school class of 8-year olds, he has seen first hand how the developer experience has changed massively. \n\nJoin us as we take a retrospective look at how we have coded in the past, speculate on what might come next, and consider what that could mean for the next generation of developers."
