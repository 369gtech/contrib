description: "Grails 3, with use of Gradle as a build system, eases the creation of a modularised application; with smaller modules and less coupling. Sergio del Amo, curator of the newsletter Groovy Calamari ( http://groovycalamari.com), shows:\n- How to create in Grails 3 a multi project build\n- An internal subproject naming convention to keep your build file dry\n- How to keep your plugins small and clean\n- How to leverage the different Grails application profiles to create different applications within the same build If you are using Grails 3, a multi project build is the way to go.In the second part of this talk, he introduces the multitenancy capabilities offered by GORM 6.1. With Multi-tenancy, a single instance of an application is used to service multiple clients (tenants) in a way that each tenants' data is isolated from the other."
