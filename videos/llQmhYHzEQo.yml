description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM Lite Berlin 18 -- http://bit.ly/2vxJuxL\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference -- http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nHOW TO TEACH ELIXIR TO NON-FUNCTIONAL DEVELOPERS\nby Leandro Bighetti\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nTeaching \nElixir \nBetter\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner / intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this talk, Leandro presents efficient ways of teaching newcomers to a programming language: how to get people interested in the language, where people usually struggle and how to overcome these challenges. This will use Elixir as the basis language but will serve as a framework to generalise to other functional languages.\n\n-- Read the full abstract: http://bit.ly/2NC6SQS\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - LEANDRO BIGHETTI\nElixir Developer at Entelios AG\n\nLeandro is originally from Brazil, and has been working as a software developer for the last 7 years, having worked in Investment Banking, Game Development, and currently in the Energy Industry, at Entelios AG. Entelios enables large energy consumers to commercialise their energy usage, and his load control system is implemented in Erlang and Elixir. Out of work, when Leandro's not tending to his responsibilities as a husband and soon-to-be dad, he's usually creating screencast tutorials for his YouTube channel which focuses on developers who aren't familiar with Elixir or even functional programming.\n\n-- More on Leandro Bighetti: http://bit.ly/2NC6SQS\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 18\nCode BEAM Lite Berlin 18 was co-organised by Bitcrowd and Code Sync.\n\nBITCROWD\n-- Website: https://bitcrowd.net/\n-- Twitter: https://twitter.com/bitcrowd\n-- Mail: info at bitcrowd.net\n\nCODE SYNC \n-- Website: www.codesync.global\n-- Twitter: www.twitter.com/CodeElixirIO\n-- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\n-- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\n-- Mail: info at codesync.global\n\n#CBLBerlin #Elixir #CodeSync #Learning"
