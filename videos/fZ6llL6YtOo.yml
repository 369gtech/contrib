title: 'Finite state machines: a design pattern for FPGAs and React'
recordingDate: 1548381201
description: "Tessa Bradbury\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/261/\n\nAt my current job we use React as our frontend javascript framework. After just joining the company, I was reading through the documentation when it suddenly hit me that it was describing was a finite state machine. I knew about finite state machines! I did those back at university! And that was when I realised the most useful unit I did at university for working with React was the FPGA and microprocessor course.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover what finite state machines are, how they are useful across the width and breadth of software development, including both IoT and javascript, and some key things to remember when implementing them.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
