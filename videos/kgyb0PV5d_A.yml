language: English
recordingDate: 1544608487
description: "Node.js is an amazing project in terms of code - it’s evolved rapidly to cover an immense landscape, from web apps, desktop apps, APIs, IoT, robotics, and beyond. There’s something else that Node has also been absolutely killer with, though: the community. \nOne really awesome thing is that the Node.js community has an established community for building the Node community. How meta is that? The Node.js project is sectioned off into different Working Groups (WGs) that are tasked with different objectives - the one that was tasked with building the community was the Evangelism WG. \nThat said, there’s a transition happening. The Evangelism WG planted the seed Node.js Community efforts. Now, the Community Committee has taken this a step further and is mobilizing to start exploding the awareness and understanding of Node and its diverse ecosystem.\n\n\nTierney Cyren\nTierney is a Co-chair of the Node.js Community Committee, and a member of the Node.js Evangelism Working Group. He worked on contributing to Node.js at college in his spare time, and now writes tutorials and articles for the Community, with the goal of always enabling and empowering those who want to learn about Node.js and its vibrant ecosystem.\n\n\nNordic.js is a single track conference with talks by internationally renowned speakers and rising stars in the JavaScript community.
