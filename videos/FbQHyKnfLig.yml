This is especially so for graphs, which can have complex constraints that are difficult to encode using conventional data structures. Join me in the search for a functional, typesafe graph. We will explore different graph representations, and discover how types can help us encode constraints. Using dependent types, we will construct a graph that we can prove satisfies its abstract data type.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/zainab-ali/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ZAINAB ALI\nFunctional polyglot / can squat her own bodyweight\n\nZainab is a functional polyglot.
