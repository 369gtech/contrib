language: English
recordingDate: 1620838283
description: "This week in our Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database Ralf Mueller, Architect for Oracle Intelligent Automation provided the architecture and demo of integrating Process Automation with direct calls for scoring OML models using the OML Services REST APIs in real-time.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks offers an easy-to-use, interactive, multi-user, collaborative interface based on Apache Zeppelin notebook technology, and support SQL, PL/SQL, Python and Markdown interpreters. It is available on all Autonomous Database versions and Tiers, including the always-free editions.\n\nOML includes AutoML, which provides automated machine learning algorithm features for algorithm selection, feature selection and model tuning, in addition to a specialized AutoML UI exclusive to the Autonomous Database.\n\nOML Services is also included in Autonomous Database, where you can deploy and manage native in-database OML models as well as ONNX ML models (for classification and regression) built using third-party engines, and can also invoke cognitive text analytics.\n\nVideo highlights:\n01:04 Agenda\n02:36 Digital Process Automation and Machine Learning\n03:39 Two patterns for Process - Structured vs Dynamic\n04:57 Oracle Process Automation internal SaaS adoption\n05:36 Use of OML Services for Real-time scoring\n09:36 Demo \n09:42 Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI\n10:16 Oracle Machine Learning Models   management\n10:39 End-to-end Process Applications demo: Car Rental\n16:50 Oracle Integration Cloud demo for Process Applications\n17:34 Oracle Integrations for REST Connector with OML Services\n21:03 Oracle Integrations with connection to OML Services via OAuth Two Legged Flow\n22:30 Process Automation Roadmap\n24:08 OML Services links and Github\n24:49 Announcement of OML Services Hands-on-Lab for May 18, 2021\n25:24 Q&A"
