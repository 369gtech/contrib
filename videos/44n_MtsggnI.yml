title: 'Spring to Image'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027975
description: 'In today’s cloud native world, Docker Images are the lingua franca for platform portability. Unfortunately, there’s no clear direction for developers to turn their Spring applications into those Docker Images. The most likely tool for Docker Image creation, Dockerfile, has serious Day 2 limitations that make it a poor choice for many situations. This session will explore how to use the https://buildpacks.io Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNCF) project and its integrations into the Spring ecosystem. It will cover the use of Spring Boot’s Maven and Gradle plugins, the https://github.com/buildpacks/pack" CLI, the https://github.com/pivotal/kpack" Kubernetes service, and more.'
