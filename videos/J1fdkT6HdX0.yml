The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Keynote: Network, Please Evolve: Chapter 3, Stretching Out –\_Vijoy Pandey, Vice President and CTO of Cloud, Cisco \n\nCloud Native has become a synonym for scalable and reliable distributed applications. And a well-behaved, distributed system is synonymous with a highly-available, consumable, and composable Network.  Over the past 2 chapters of our evolutionary tale, we have discussed the need for the Network to evolve beyond the 35-year old concepts that still define it to this day. And we have demonstrated, through a real-world database (Vitess) use case, the developmental and operational power and simplicity this new paradigm delivers.  In this new Chapter, we will discuss how we can stretch these capabilities all the way into the enterprise, edge compute location, or a branch, and show how it eases the life of a developer building a new cloud native app.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZfBq"
