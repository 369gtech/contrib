description: "Java EE 7 was the first Java release to harness the power of the transparency and participation requirement of the latest version of the JCP program. Community members and Java user groups (JUGs) worked together through the JCP program and the Adopt-a-JSR program to improve the platform and bring greater levels of participation and community feedback into the release. This session discusses several of the contributions to Java EE 7 through the Adopt-a-JSR program. In addition, it looks at how the planned Java EE 8 will feature even greater community participation in this release.\n\n\nAuthors:\nEdward Burns\nEd Burns is a Senior Staff Engineer for Oracle Corporation where he chairs the JSR 344 (JSF 2.2) Expert Group and contributes to the open source Mojarra project.
