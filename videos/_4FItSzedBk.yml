Almost. \n \nWhile it is true that we have quad-core Raspberry Pi computers and the term \"bare metal\" gets thrown around a lot, the reality of chips and architectures used in commercial embedded devices often create friction between the hardware and software world.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/omer-kilic/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - OMER KILIC\nHardware Startup Survivor, Heterogenous Systems Enthusiast\n\nOmer Kilic is an embedded systems engineer who works at the various intersections of hardware and software engineering practices, product development and manufacturing.\n\nMore on Omer Kilic: https://codesync.global/speaker/omer-kilic/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
