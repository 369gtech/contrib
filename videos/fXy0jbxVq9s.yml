recordingDate: 1605559698
description: 'Passwords are the most commonly used authentication tokens for the Oracle Database. This month we will focus on passwords, including how passwords are stored, how database clients use passwords to authenticate to the database, how passwords are controlled with database profiles, and what the different capabilities are in various database versions. If you are responsible for administering or securing an Oracle Database, this session is sure to have information you can use!'
