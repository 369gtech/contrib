description: "Exploring the opportunities of impact-driven tech startups through a Nordic lense. \n\nThe Nordic countries have a unique position to become a global hotbed of impact-driven, fast-growing startups. Increasing numbers of the brightest minds are moving into building \"companies that matter\".  There is already an emerging group of venture capital funds and angel investors that focus increasingly or only on impact startups, and they will play an instrumental role in selecting which problems get solved and when. \n\nThe uprise of impact VCs is a tremendous opportunity: the networks they can help entrepreneurs tap into will boost the building of these new kinds of companies. I'll provide a first glimpse into what is happening in the emerging Nordic impact VC scene by taking a network theory-based view and highlighting some example cases.\n\nThe speech took place on 9th May 2019 on Growth Stage during Infoshare 2019."
