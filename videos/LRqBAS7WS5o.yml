Our systems look at about 10 billion records / day which means we need a fast and effective way of analyzing our data. In our search for a better Map/Reduce framework we found Disco, an Erlang/Python based Map/Reduce framework that's small, fast, elegant, understandable. We needed a way to tame the power of Disco and that's when we came up with the Inferno project which takes even more complexity out of Map/Reduce. With Inferno you concentrate about what you want from your data by letting it take care of all the underlying Map/Reduce complexity. \"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory \nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
