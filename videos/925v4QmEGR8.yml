Our SIG is trying to improve user experiences on bootstrapping a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster that conforms to best practices. With our primarily installer tool, kubeadm, a streamlined installing and upgrading process can be well managed. We've recently introduced a new Kubernetes object, called Cluster API to bring declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration, and management. In this introduction session, we will present our SIG's mission statements, review recent updates, and discuss our roadmaps. Some new lifecycle projects are introduced as well. You are very welcome to join in and contribute to our SIG. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FzHx"
