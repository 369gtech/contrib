description: "My last ever null check  \nby Anthony Ragu\n\nModern software development projects are littered with cross-cutting concerns (think logging or verification). Aspect oriented programming enables increased modularity through the implementation of interceptors and code weaving.\n\nNot only does this simplify your code base but also ensures that, as a developer, you can focus on the actual task at hand.\n\nHere, we will explore how to use AOP and Unity IOC Interceptors in a .NET Project to check for nulls between method calls.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/231093686/\n\nhttp://www.eposnow.com/"
