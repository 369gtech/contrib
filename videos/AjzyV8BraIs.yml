description: "Are you a backend developer that‚Äôs being pushed into front end development? Are you frustrated with all JavaScript frameworks and build tools you have to learn to be a good UI developer? If so, this session is for you! We‚Äôll explore the tools of the trade for fronted development (npm, yarn, Gulp, Webpack, Yeoman) and learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We‚Äôll dive into the intricacies of Bootstrap, Material Design, ES6, and TypeScript. Finally, after getting you up to speed with all this new tech, we‚Äôll show how it can all be found and integrated through the fine and dandy JHipster project.\n\nMatt Raible - Java Champion and Developer Advocate at Okta with a passion for skiing, mountain biking, VWs, and good üç∫. Driving a '66 21-window and a '90 Syncro. Made in Montana. @mraible on Twitter."
