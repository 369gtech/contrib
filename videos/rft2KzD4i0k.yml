description: "WatchKit presents an unique design and development challenge. On one hand you are very limited with what you can do while on the other it allows you to escape the confines of must-have-a-device-in-hand.\nLearn how to efficiently transfer data between the iOS and Watch OS app and how to properly cheat when needed and create an illusion of real-time communication between the two.\nLearn how to creating a compelling UI, thinking differently.\nMost importantly, learn to not think about the app, but design in terms of glances and notifications."
