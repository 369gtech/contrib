title: 'GeeCON 2018: Michał Łosiewicz-How to avoid common pitfalls when migrating from monolith to µservices'
recordingDate: 1532330769
description: 'Most startups begin with simple technology allowing for fast paced development with frequent changes which ends up being a monolith. After some time this monolith grows to the size that gets harder and harder to maintain and enhance further Then we decided to go microservices, which turned out to be much harder than we expected. We went through multiple bright ideas like “bieda-stage” and docker based development environment. Our devops team was so busy that creating new machines for services was taking two months and no one knew which part of ansible waas safe to run where. A year later the monolith is deployed as a microservice, developers make changes to infrastructure and creating new service on production is a matter of minutes - not months, requesting a new database is not a devops task and requires a few lines of code and one click in Jenkins and our environments are almost fully automated. Did I mention that we have only around 20 developers in Azimo? You do not need a whole army of devs to fix your technology. This talk will be about Devops Culture in opposition to devops role and why developers can’t just sit back and not care about where and how their code is running and devops/admins should not just restrict access to everything and keep all the cool stuff to themselves.'
