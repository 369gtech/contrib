description: "Dan has been a tester for 15 years, working within a diverse range of development organisations, mostly in the south west of England. He currently works at Medidata, in London, where most of his time is spent developing test strategy. This includes mentoring, supporting and training members of the team to use these skills also.\n\nDan’s love of testing drives me to become an active member of the testing community, helping to organise local tester meetups in the Bristol and Bath area. He is also a co­facilitator with Weekend Testing Europe, and also organises the South West Exploratory Workshop in Testing. He has spoken at a number of testing events including TestBash, EuroStar, Nordic Testing Days and Let’s Test among others. \n\nTalk summary \n\nMost of us never know who does the security testing for our development teams. Sometimes it’s an internal team, maybe external. Sometimes it doesn’t even happen at all. \n\nSome of us are building security testing into our current practices, from the ground up. Some managers may feel that there isn’t the time, skills or resources to do security testing. \nMany testers may feel they don’t have the skills. A few of you might not feel empowered to take the lead. Inevitably, they might feel that they don’t need to worry about it, as it is someone else’s problem. And this is a serious dysfunction. Let’s look at the essential steps to build and execute your own security testing strategies. Let’s examine how learning and mentoring can aid in the development of strategies. \nYou can and should build up your own skills with integrated security testing. This will ensure ongoing relevance of your role in a security context, and the success of your organisations."
