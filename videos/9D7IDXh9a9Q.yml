description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Pierre-Antoine LaFayette, Facebook.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=IVS-2334\n\nA core use-case for Facebook for Android is scrolling through a feed of autoplaying videos. We've needed to have a deep understanding of video playback to optimize performance in our apps.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll examine the details behind video playback on Android. We’ll look at the actors that play a role in delivering decoded video pixels to the screen. We’ll go beyond the high-level MediaPlayer / ExoPlayer components and examine what's happening in the system. Understanding how video playback works under the hood can help you figure out how to get the best performance for your applications.\n\nWe’ll cover the details behind fundamental graphics components used by video rendering: e.g. SurfaceView, TextureView, SurfaceTexture, etc. These components also enable more complex media rendering such as 360 videos, 3D scenes, and AR experiences.\n\nWe hope to leave you empowered to look deeper into the Android system beyond the high-level Android framework components and expand your knowledge and expertise.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
