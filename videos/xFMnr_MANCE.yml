description: "You’d expect Microsoft’s cloud-hosted Continuous Integration platform to have great support for .NET. However, you can use Azure Pipelines with any language, on any platform, thanks to cloud-hosted build agents for Linux, macOS and Windows.\r\n\r\nEdward Thomson will show you how you can use Azure Pipelines for everything you need. Build a Swift app on macOS, then deploy a Node.js app on Linux; all without having to create any infrastructure yourself.\r\n\r\nBut what if you want to target other platforms? No problem! In this session you'll also see how you can bring your build server to harness the power of Azure Pipelines and build your code for almost any imaginable platform, including x86, ARM or even something truly outrageous like a Commodore 64."
