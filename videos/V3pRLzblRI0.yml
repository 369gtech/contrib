Itâ€™s also one of the most data-driven, too. Data powers Netflix. It informs decisions and challenges assumptions across the entire company. It fuels experimentation and innovation at unprecedented scale. It helps us discover fantastic content and deliver personalized experiences for our 150 million subscribers around the world.\n\nIn this talk, youâ€™ll get a behind-the-scenes sneak peek into what it takes to make that possible. Using Jupyter notebooks as a case study, weâ€™ll explore some of the ways Netflix leverages data, give you a quick overview of the Netflix Data Platform, discuss our motivations for investing in Jupyter, and share some of the early results weâ€™ve been seeing. Weâ€™ll wrap up with ways that each data roleâ€”including data scientists, data engineers, data analysts, PMs, and moreâ€”are actually leveraging notebooks today.  - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/crunch"
