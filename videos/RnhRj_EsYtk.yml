description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nA Safari of Kubernetes and its Natural Habitat - Noah Abrahams, StormForge\n\nHave you ever wondered what life in the data center really looks like, after the sun goes down and the people leave? Come along on a journey as we visit some of the inhabitants of the Cloud Native savanna on this trip through the ecosystems of Kubernetes and its natural predators. Attendees will learn the warning cries of an ever alert Prometheus and watch as the cluster is hunted by a gaggle of red teamers, while they all try to drink from the same data lake. This talk will be a whimsical introduction into the daily life of kubernetes and common production deployments while you listen to some very mediocre impressions of famous naturalists."
