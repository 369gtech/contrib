description: "In its 3.2 and 4.0 generations, the Spring Framework focuses on Web applications, core features for asynchronous processing and message-oriented architectures, and enhancements to its caching support and language support. The Spring Framework project also comes with a new Gradle-based build and a new GitHub-based contribution model. This session discusses key features in this year’s Spring 3.2 and next year’s Spring 4.0, including support for upcoming standards such as JCache; JMS 2.0; and, not least of all, Java 8’s language features. It also explains how Java EE 7 is being tracked.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJoshua Long\nJosh Long is the Spring developer advocate.
