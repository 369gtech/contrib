description: "A note on this interview’s audio quality\nThis was one of the first Unscripted interviews we recorded in a busy live conference setting and without our usual recording setup, which is reflected in the somewhat low audio quality you’ll hear in this episode. This is not reflective of the audio quality featured in most of our videos, and we hope you’ll find that the fantastic content more than makes up for it.\n\nThis interview was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2019 for GOTO Unscripted. #GOTOcon #GOTOUnscripted #GOTOchgo\nhttps://gotopia.tech\n\nRead the full transcription of this interview here:\nhttps://gotopia.tech/articles/inclusion-in-the-workplace\n\nJill Wetzler - Head of Engineering at Pilot\nEvan Sutter - Founder of Hapzly\nJørn Larsen - CEO of Trifork\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n04:48 Inclusivity: Is it worth it?\n08:50 How to engage people\n11:28 How to shake the system\n17:03 How to engage management\n20:45 How can HR help engagement\n22:30 What are the biggest challenges minority groups face at companies today?\n24:52 Tips & tricks to get the ball rolling\n28:05 What can we take away from this?\n30:08 Is it important to understand the values of your company?\n34:25 How to focus on diversity when hiring new employees\n36:22 Outro\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOinterview #Inclusion #Inclusivity #Diversity #Teams #HumanFactors #SoftSkills\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
