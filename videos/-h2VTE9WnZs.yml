description: "Every year at DockerCon, we expand the bounds of what Docker can do with new features and products. And every day, we see great new apps that are built on top of Docker. And yet, thereâ€™s always a few that stand out not just for being cool apps, but for pushing the bounds of what you can do with Docker.\n\nThis year we had two great apps that we featured in the Docker Cool Hacks closing keynote. Both hacks came from members of our Docker Captains program, a group of people from the Docker community who are recognized by Docker as very knowledgeable about Docker, and contribute quite a bit to the community."
