description: 'In Java 8 functional style programming was introduced in Java. Now with release up to Java 11 there are even more possibilities. For many people it is hard to grasp the idea of functional style programming after so many years of purely working in the imperative OOP style. The opportunities Java gives us out of the box are massive, but with great power comes great responsibility. Brian points out common mistakes that are made when integrating functional style programming in your every day Java project and how to prevent this. This way you can write better, cleaner and more readable code. But even more important, you will be able to utilize the functional code constructions in Java (11) to it?s full potential? and maybe, you even start to like it.'
