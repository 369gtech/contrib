title: 'GopherCon 2021: Markus WÃ¼stenberg - HTML Components in Go (or, Why I Sometimes Miss React)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1640044968
description: 'Javascript has a great frontend component ecosystem in React/Vue. Markus misses that when writing good old backend HTML pages in Go. What if we created a similar ecosystem for Go that made it really easy to not reinvent every component again and again? Using his little gomponents library, we could do that. This talk is about why Markus wrote gomponents, what you can get out of it, and where he hopes it could go one day.'
