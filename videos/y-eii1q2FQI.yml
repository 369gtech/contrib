description: "#dotnetby meetup-33 – 18.02.2019\nПри поддержке ISsoft & Playtika.\n\nIn today’s world it’s imperative to be able to make split second decisions based on real-time data. Real-time event-based systems process millions of messages per second by defining and combining small flows to create processing graphs.\nThis session talks about a reactive approach to your application design, and how to account for handling events in near real time employing the Functional Reactive Programming paradigm, which is used to implement complex reactive system with simple and composable semantic.  \nIn this talk we cover the concepts behind streamed-oriented processing systems using high-performance messaging queue systems, in particular, we will leverage technologies such as NET Core, Akka.NET, CosmosDB and SignalR to build a near real-time pipeline for streaming data.  \nYou’ll walk away with a new way of thinking about handling events in a near real-time fashion. \n\n#dotnet #netUG\n\nСообщество:\nFacebook – https://www.facebook.com/groups/dotnet.minsk/\nTelegram – https://t.me/dotnetby"
