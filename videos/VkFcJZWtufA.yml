description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Jeroen Mols, Philips Hue (Signify).\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=LNH-0175\n\nWind back one year ago:\n- releasing took us 10 weeks\n- our app was plagued by regression\n- developers felt completely detached from our users\n\nClearly our traditional strategy of heavily testing each release (up-front quality) wasn't working. So we decided to flip things around: why not try to reduce the cost of errors instead? Hence we decided to move our Philips Hue Android app to continuous deployment.\n\nIn this talk you will learn that if releasing is painful, you should actually release even more often. Step by step I'll explain how we moved the Philips Hue Android app to continuous deployment, what our current release process/CI looks like, what changes we made to our overall testing approach, how we empowered developers and testers, and how we made our release process completely painless.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
