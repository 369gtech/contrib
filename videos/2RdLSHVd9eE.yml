description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS Conference 2017, June 8 https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nAlbert Brand, Senior Consultant at Xebia\n\nThe new kid on the block in browser land is WebAssembly. It allows precompiled code to run at native speed, connected via JavaScript to your browser. But how does it work? What are the (dis)advantages? Can we optimise our SPA with it? With many examples, I will talk you through the setup, pitfalls and rough edges."
