description: "RubyConf 2018 - The New Manager's Toolkit by Brandon Hays\n\nCongratulations, you've been entrusted to lead a team! But wait... what does that mean? You didn't go to school for this. You may not have even been told what your job exactly is. Some call this new responsibility the \"Stone of Triumph\".\n\nIn this talk, we'll explain leading and managing (and how they're different), outline what success looks like, and show techniques to get there. You'll learn how to build the skills and tools to carry the \"Stone of Triumph\" with less pain, and set yourself up for a long and happy career leading creative and technical teams."
