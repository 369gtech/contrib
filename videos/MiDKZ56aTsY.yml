GitOps at State Farm is adopted in all our strategic cloud platforms - AWS, Multi-tenant Kubernetes (on-prem), and Cloud Foundry (on-prem). This talk will walkthrough how we scaled GitOps in our large organization. The GitOps team is 5-person team. We have successfully rolled out GitOps, supported our customers, and continue to advance the offering towards observability and resiliency of the applications or products using GitOps.   We will give an insight on how our typical day is like and also highlight the different bumps and challenges (including outages) we’ve faced and how these all became opportunities for us to continuously improve."
