description: "Garbage collection is an integral part of application behavior on Java platforms, yet it is often misunderstood. Developers have choices in selecting and tuning collector mechanisms as well as in application architecture. This session reviews and classifies various garbage collection techniques available in JVMs today. After a quick overview of common garbage collection techniques such as generational, parallel, stop-the-world, incremental, and concurrent algorithms, it defines terms and metrics common to all collectors. The presentation also classifies each major JVM collectorâ€™s mechanisms and discusses the trade-offs involved in balancing requirements for responsiveness, throughput, space, and available memory.\n\n\nAuthor:\nGil Tene\nGil Tene is CTO and co-founder of Azul Systems. He has been involved with virtual machine technologies for the past 20 years. Gil pioneered Azul's Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector (C4), and various managed runtime and systems stack technologies that combine to deliver the industry's most scalable and robust Java platforms.\n\nGil is a frequent speaker at technology conferences worldwide, and an official JavaOne Rock Star. In 2006 he was named one of the Top 50 Agenda Setters in the technology industry by Silicon.com. Prior to co-founding Azul, Gil held key technology positions at Nortel Networks, Shasta Networks and at Check Point Software Technologies, where he designed ground breaking traffic management solutions. He architected OSs at Stratus Computer, HA solutions at Qualix/Legato, and served as an officer in the Israeli Navy Computer R&D unit.\n\nGil holds a BSEE from The Technion Israel Institute of Technology, and has been awarded 31 patents in computer-related technologies.\nView more trainings by Gil Tene at https://www.parleys.com/author/gil-tene\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
