This talk will look at how to use systems like Spark & BEAM to train your models, but also that important next step of actually serving the results in “production”.\n\nSpeaker: Holden Karau, Open Source Developer Advocate at Google\n\nHolden is a transgender Canadian (from Ottawa, living in SF) open source developer advocate at Google with a focus on Apache Spark, BEAM, and related \"big data\" tools. She is the co-author of Learning Spark, High Performance Spark, and another Spark book that's a bit more out of date. She is a committer and PMC on Apache Spark and committer on SystemML & Mahout projects. She was tricked into the world of big data while trying to improve search and recommendation systems and has long since forgotten her original goal.\n\nFollow Holden on Twitter: https://twitter.com/holdenkarau\n\n_____________\n\nSee these Meetups Live by joining the Reactive Data Meetup: \nhttps://www.meetup.com/OttawaReactiveDataMeetup/\n\nwww.yoppworks.com\n\nTalk Sponsored by: Lightbend www.lightbend.com"
