recordingDate: 1618329086
description: "While virtual and robotic assistants are becoming more commonplace than sci-fi fantasy, they still have limited capabilities. Over the last decade, Microsoft has made tremendous progress in reaching human parity in AI areas like computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Yet combining these parts to create a situationally aware computer in a physical space has remained an engineering challenge. \n\nJoin Dan Bohus, Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, as he dives into the development of Platform for Situated Intelligence, an open-source framework for multimodal, an integrative-AI system for physically situated interactions between people and machines. \n\nTo learn more about the latest Dev breakthroughs, visit the Innovation Tech Hub: https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/developer\n\nGet started on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/psi\n\nCheck out the latest Blog: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/platform-for-situated-intelligence-an-open-source-framework-for-multimodal-integrative-ai/\n\nDiscover all the Innovation Tech Minutes for Developers: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHjNJcVCIktce-wSFZ5svwA3"
