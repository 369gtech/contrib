description: "TrueRec.io: A Blockchain Project Running on Cloud Foundry [B] - Nethaji Tummuru, Michael Kunzmann & Mario Ponce, SAP    \n\nWe all have gone through the process of hiring or applying for a job. In most cases, it's very tedious to verify a candidate's credentials (academic, employment, professional records), and even more to prove one’s own credentials. After the job offer, the bureaucracy starts. One of the most time-consuming processes is background checks to verify the applicant’s identity, education and employment history. How can a recruiter trust a resume the moment he receives it? How can resume records be notarized and verified in a blink of an eye with bullet-proof confidence? Is it possible to empower applicants to provide pre-verified records and still allow them the ownership of their information? TrueRec solves all these problems by utilizing Blockchain , Machine Learning all built on Cloud Foundry.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss about the building blocks , blockchain architecture and cloud foundry components that we have leveraged.\n\nMichael Kunzmann\nSAP\nLead Platform Engineer\nMy name is Michael Kunzmann and I am the lead Software Platform Engineer of the truerec.io platform.
