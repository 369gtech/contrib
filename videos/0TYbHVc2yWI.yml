title: 'Autonomous microservices don''t share data. Period - Dennis van der Stelt'
recordingDate: 1554730324
description: "Did you start out building microservices, and somehow ended up with a distributed monolith? If a small change in business logic or in data requires you to modify code in more than one service, you probably did. Isn't it unbelievable that even using the latest technologies like Docker, Service Mesh, Serverless, and more, doesn't help?\nI will tell a story in which we'll take a different look at microservices and discuss why technology doesn't change coupling or autonomy at all. How we need to take a step back and stop sharing data between services.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndccopenhagen.com"
