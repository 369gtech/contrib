language: English
recordingDate: 1474333908
description: 'OpenJDK has very useful serviceability tools for debugging and troubleshooting: jmap, jstat, jcmd, jdb. Especially since JDK 9, those tools have gotten useful new features. However, we need a lot of time to learn how to choose and use those tools differently in various versions and for various issues. This session’s speakers have used these tools for troubleshooting and have contributed to OpenJDK to make them more convenient. They also developed HeapStats, for gathering detailed runtime information continuously for after-the-fact analysis. This session is a quick boot camp on how to troubleshoot in JDK 9 with serviceability tools such as jhsdb, jcmd, and HeapStats. Hear how those tools have helped the speakers in their six years of experience in an OpenJDK technical support service.'
