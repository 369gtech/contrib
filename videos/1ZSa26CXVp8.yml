recordingDate: 1468844355
description: "In todayâ€™s world the decision of which technology to use to create mobile applications has becoming daunting. The best bet is no longer just native Objective C / Swift and Android with many cross platform technologies become more featured and matured.\n\nThree technologies are in the forefront of this space - Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native. These technologies create cross platform applications in very unique ways, each with their own pros and cons.\n\nThis presentation will help explain when and why you would go cross platform, gain an understanding of their differences, what their development experience is like and experience a live demo of each.\n\nGreg is a Senior Consultant for Readify specialising in Mobile and Windows Application Development. He loves nothing more than tinkering with mobile devices and taking those learnings to provide the most cost efficient solutions. Greg has worked in the financial, telecommunication and mining industries since he started as a Software Engineer in 2007.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
