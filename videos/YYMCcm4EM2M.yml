description: "Now, my friends, let there be COLOUR (or color, depending on when you're from ;) ). In this CCS tutorial we'll take a look at how we can use color for properties such as the background & text color.\n\nColor can be used in either Hex or rgb format. Hex codes are made up of 6 numbers &/or letters, and always begin with a # sign 0 #00000.\n\nrgb format is made up of 3 numbers (each ranging from 0 to 255) and start with 'rgb' - rgb(0,0,0).\n\nYou can also use hsl format  (hue, saturation and luminosity), which people from a design background will probably know all about. In CSS, this looks something like hsl(60, 70%, 40%).\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n========== HTML Basics Course ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
