SOLID rules help us with designing our classes, methods etc. But what about organizing those classes into modules? And how to connect modules with other modules? During this talk, you'll learn what are the main principles in terms of designing components and managing dependencies between them. These principles are for designing architecture the same as SOLID rules are for development. You don't have to be a software architect to take advantage of them!"
