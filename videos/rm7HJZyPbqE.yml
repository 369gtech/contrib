title: 'Responsive Typography with Jason Pamental'
recordingDate: 1412801017
description: "Responsive Typography is the notion that our type must move and change and adapt just as the rest of our designs do. In fact, it may have a bigger impact on readability and usability than any other aspect. In this presentation, Jason Pamental talks about the ’4 Ps’ of Responsive Web Type:\n\nPerformance: Load what you need, when you need it (and how to manage the process)\nProgression: Ensure that all devices get a good design and enhance the experience for devices/browsers that can handle it\nProportion: One scale doesn’t fit all screens; Jason shows a more modern scale that can help make designs work better on all devices\nPolish: Great design is detail; type is no different. Jason shows how to add refinements like ligatures, fractions, swashes and more, quickly and easily\n\nJason Pamental \nPrincipal & Co-founder, H+W Design\nhttps://twitter.com/jpamental\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
