language: English
recordingDate: 1604102793
description: '"Citizen Developer" might feel like a new term with all the recent buzz, but the concept of empowering knowledge workers to use technology to solve their own business problems is not new. In this session, we''ll talk about what it means to be a Citizen Developer, how it can lead to being a Traditional Developer (if you want!), and what it looks like to walk that line as a Citizen Developer inside Microsoft. Attendees will leave with resources to learn their chosen tech, finding their community, and inspiration that a tech career is possible for anyone with a passion for solving business problems!'
