description: 'Did you know that the average website takes over 16 seconds to load on a mobile device? Did you know that on average the amount JavaScript and CSS that goes wasted is over 60%! If JavaScript and CSS are our most expensive resources to load, _*why*_ are we hurting our load times by shipping stuff we donâ€™t ever use? How do we get rid of this unused code?
