description: "The talk from JS Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://bit.ly/2KkXOUo\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/JSFestua/\nWebsite: http://jsfest.com.ua/\n\nWhile many developers have created an “admin UI” or editing interface at some point or other, they are rarely built in a way that allows them to work in a real-time, collaborative way as we are getting used to with products such as Google Docs. In this talk, we’re going to discuss some of the challenges of building real-time interfaces and different ways to approach and solve them."
