title: 'Reactive Programming, State Management, and Redux for the Modern Front End Dev - Jennifer Wadella'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623401605
description: "JavaScript can be a scary place where we create and change variables at will and while code can be written very quickly, it can be side-effect prone and hard to debug & maintain down the line. In this talk, weâ€™ll explore the concept of reactive programming, discuss state management and the benefits of having an immutable state, and cover one of the more popular state management approaches - the redux pattern, & look at commonly used libraries that help us with these concepts.\n\nNo matter what the JavaScript framework flavor of choice is, a good understanding of reactive programming and state management helps us write better code that is more closely tied to business logic, is easier to read, easier to debug, and easier to scale."
