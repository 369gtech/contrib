description: "Creating software is hard and unnecessarily complex. Layers upon layers of complexity and abstractions are common among applications, frameworks, and libraries we see and use.\n\nIn this session, we’ll talk about Eve — the programming language that tries to lower the complexity of software development by treating everything as a record that you read and write. Eve offers a human-first programming platform and makes a number of interesting design choices, the most prominent of which are reactive blocks of code. It allows you to focus on what you want to achieve, rather than how you want to achieve it.\n\nJoin me to look at Eve, the platform and the language. We’ll cover how treating everything as a record allows Eve to be a declarative programming language and how it provides an alternative solution for the typical use-cases in software development.\nYou'll get inspired to find whether you can even do things Eve offers out-of-the-box in your Java projects and will be eager to try tools that promise to help you do it.\n\nOleg Šelajev is an engineer, author, speaker, lecturer and advocate at ZeroTurnaround. He spends his time testing, coding, writing, giving conference talks, crafting blogposts and reports. He is pursuing a PhD on Dynamic System updates and code evolution. Oleg is a part-time lecturer at the University of Tartu and enjoys speaking and participating in Java/JVM development conferences such as JavaOne, JavaZone, JFokus and others. In his free time, Oleg plays chess at a semi-grandmaster level, loves puzzles and solving all kinds of problems."
