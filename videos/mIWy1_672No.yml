description: "Multi-cloud Management: Stratos and Kubernetes - Neil MacDougall & Troy Topnik, SUSE \n\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate and describe the work that SUSE has done to extend the Stratos management interface to include support for Kubernetes and Helm.  We will talk about how we have used the Stratos extension mechanism to add new endpoint types for Kubernetes and Helm and we will show some of the features that SUSE has been developing.  Weâ€™ll talk about where SUSE is headed next in extending Stratos beyond Cloud Foundry into a Multi-cloud Management interface. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
