Currently, ML/DL Services of Huawei cloud are running over Kubernetes clusters.In order to make the AI services focus on their business without caring the underlayer infrastructure like physical machines and GPU offering. We provide the serverless Kubernetes services(CCI) in order to meet their requirements. And serverless Kubernetes is very suitable for the users to run the short-time jobs. In this session, we try to introduce the effort we have make on this area. Such as use kata container to protect the container's security so multi-tenant's workload can run on the same physical machine; support AI jobs with multiple devices like Nvidia GPU, InfiniBand; experience of running DL frameworks like tensorflow over Kubernetes in Huawei and so on.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuJv"
