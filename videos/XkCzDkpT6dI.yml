description: "Project GaitNet: Ushering in the ImageNet moment for human Gait kinematics\nVinay Prabhu, UnifyID Inc.\nPresented at MLconf San Francisco 2019\n\nAbstract: The emergence of the upright human bipedal gait can be traced back 4 to 2.8 million years ago, to the now extinct hominin Australopithecus afarensis. Fine grained analysis of gait using the modern MEMS sensors found on all smartphones  not just reveals a lot about the person’s orthopedic and neuromuscular health status, but also has enough idiosyncratic clues that it can be harnessed as a passive biometric. While there were many siloed attempts made by the machine learning community to model Bipedal Gait sensor data, these were done with small datasets oft collected in restricted  academic environs. In this talk, we will introduce the ImageNet moment for human gait analysis by presenting ‘Project GaitNet’, the largest ever planet-sized motion sensor based human bipedal gait dataset ever curated. We’ll also present the associated state-of-the-art results in classifying humans harnessing novel deep neural architectures and the related success stories we have enjoyed in transfer-learning  into disparate domains of human kinematics analysis.\n\nSee Vinay's presentation slides on our slideshare page here:\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/vinay-prabhu-project-gaitnet-ushering-in-the-imagenet-moment-for-human-gait-kinematics/SessionsEvents/vinay-prabhu-project-gaitnet-ushering-in-the-imagenet-moment-for-human-gait-kinematics"
