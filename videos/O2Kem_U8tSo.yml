title: 'Functional Programming in 40 Minutes (Russ Olsen at Haskell eXchange 2021: Novice Track)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1637076804
description: "Functional programming has finally escaped from academia. These days developers are building real systems in functional programming languages like Clojure, Scala, Elixir and F#. Functional techniques are also seeping into more traditional languages like Java and Ruby. Unfortunately somewhere along the way functional programming has also developed a reputation for being deep and mysterious: Good programs achieve the Zen-like state of being functional which somehow involves immutability, higher order functions and being referentially transparent.\n\nIn this talk Russ Olsen will strip away the cloud of mystery to uncover the simple — and wonderful — truth about functional programming: It can make your programming life easier by letting you do simple things simply while also providing you with the sharp tools you need to tackle more complex problems.\n\nThis talk was recorded on 15 November 2021 at the Haskell eXchange virtual conference."
