description: "Recorded at Global AppSec DC 2019\nhttps://dc.globalappsec.org/\n\nThe internet wasn’t built with security in mind, the world has a massive talent shortage, and we can’t rely on automation to solve everything.\n\nIf you’re on an application security team, I’m willing to bet you have more to do than time and resources to do it. Maybe one of your colleagues left for a new job last month, and there are two additional unfilled positions on your team. You could actually be in a position where you’re trying to do the jobs of 4 people.\n\nTalent matters. You matter.\n\nThis talk is about preventing and addressing burnout for overworked application security professionals. It’s also about how to attract, retain, and grow a great team.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
