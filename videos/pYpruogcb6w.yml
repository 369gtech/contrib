description: "Learn more: https://pv.tl/2P0hjSH . \n\nSpring Cloud takes an opinionated, platform-agnostic approach to enable developers to build cloud-native applications. Since Spring Cloud is platform agnostic, its goal is to be able to take advantage of the features of the platform the application is running on while at the same time insulating the application from depending on the platform directly. This is exactly what the new Spring Cloud Kubernetes project enables when running Spring Cloud apps on Kubernetes. Spring Cloud Kubernetes takes advantage of features from Kubernetes, like service discovery and configuration, while allowing developers to continue to use the Spring Cloud conventions they are all familiar with. \n\n\nIn this session, we'll show how to build Spring Cloud applications and deploy them to Kubernetes with ease.\n\nSpeakers: Ryan Baxter, Software Engineer, Pivotal; Alexandre Roman, Platform Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/spring-cloud-on-kubernetes-182540663/Pivotal/spring-cloud-on-kubernetes-182540663"
