description: "Start ups have some interesting challenges and conversely some exciting opportunities.\n\n 1. They have a limited runway of cash – this drives an intense focus on delivering value (before the money runs out)\n  2.  They have no existing culture or processes – there is nothing to undo as they create a new culture\n   3. There is no existing code to build upon - there’s no legacy code to deal with, and you produce applications that match what you need to do\n  4.  There is no set of commonly understood processes – you get to adopt whatever works well and that fits your needs.\n\nThis case study talks about the last 9 months of our start-up where we went from “no team, and limited functionality” – to launching a successful and thriving business backed by completely custom trading platform and fulfillment engine.\n\nI am Head of Development at irexchange with over 18 years experience working in IT, having worked in several start-ups and consultancies before long stints at MYOB, SEEK and nabCapital.\n\nI am passionate about building high performing teams in order to deliver great business outcomes. Having experienced several \"death march\" mega-projects, I was convinced that there had to be a better way of delivering software, based on valuing team members as individuals. Agile and Lean were a natural fit, and I have spent the last 15 years driving Agile transformations within companies.\n\nI have been fortunate to have worked with a range of experts from across the Agile, Lean, and Kanban communities, and love the challenge of adapting what I have learned to each new business situation.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.a"
