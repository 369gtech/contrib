description: "Containers provide a consistent and reproducible environment to run our services. Orchestration systems like Kubernetes help us to manage and scale our container cluster with a consistent API. This is a good start for a loosely coupled microservices architecture but it is not enough. How do you control the flow of traffic and enforce policies between services? How do you visualize service dependencies and quickly identify issues? How can you provide verifiable service identities, handle and test for failures? You can implement your own custom solutions or you can rely on Istio, an open platform to connect, manage and secure microservices. In this talk, we will take a look at some of the key capabilities of Istio and see how it can help with your microservices network.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
