description: 'Java brought the "Write once, run anywhere" (WORA) promise. In the last years a new idea sprung to life "Package once deploy anywhere" (PODA). Containers have proven to be versatile and powerful tools, that provide a clean separation of concerns. Wield them during development, testing and deployment. In this session we will show several examples of how easy it is to use containers during integration tests. Best practices and open source libraries like testContainers will be explained and demonstrated.'
