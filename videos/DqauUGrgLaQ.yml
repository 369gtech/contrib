description: "From the 2014 Strata + Hadoop World conference in New York City, an interview with the Chief Medical Officer of PeaceHealth Labs on the technology paradox, privacy concerns as medicine increasingly relies on personal data, and more.\n\nAbout Brigitte Piniewski, MD:\nDr. Piniewski is the Chief Medical Officer of PeaceHealth Laboratories which services Alaska, Washington and Oregon. During many years of medical practice as a primary care physician in both the U.S. and Canada, she has witnessed the silent and insidious progression of preventable poor health in our modern day families and households. Our communities are no longer accidentally well and require a technology framework to enable transparent insight into our health journeys while reversibility and redirection remains possible.\n\nThrough collaboration with academic and technical experts, she continues to advance crowd-sourced approaches to produce evidence-based health intelligence at the pace of change. By collecting high yield health data from lightly instrumented communities through low cost scalable technology solutions, our communities will be able to proactively and deliberately design optimal and sustainable health futures.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop World 2014: http://goo.gl/UUfrR7\nFind out more about the conference: http://strataconf.com/stratany2014\n\nDon't miss an upload!
