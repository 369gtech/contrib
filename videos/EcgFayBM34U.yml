description: "Simone Bordet's Keynote is talking about HTTP/2: Current Status\n\nHTTP 2.0 is supposed to be the next big thing for the web, after the overwhelming success of HTTP 1.1. In this keynote we will examine the HTTP 2.0 protocol, what is the status of its specification, what features does it offer over HTTP 1.1, and how websites can benefit (in speed and money) from it. Finally, we will explore the status of HTTP 2.0 support in the Java platform, finishing up with a demo of new HTTP 2.0 features.\n\nhttp://topconf.com/linz-2016/generalevent/keynote-http2-current-status/"
