Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Elastic - Autoscaled K8s Observability with the Elastic Operator\n\nSpeakers: Michael Morello\n\nEnsuring the observability of all the dynamic components in a containerized ecosystem can be a challenge. As the number of pods and services in your environment increases, you need observability tools that can scale with you. Your observability tool has to not only collect logs, metrics, and application performance data but also allow engineers to derive actionable insights as soon as issues with services occur.\n\nIn this session, you will learn how to deploy Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes and use the power of built-in autoscaling to seamlessly scale out as you continuously collect and store more observability data for diagnosing, debugging, and resolving issues in your applications."
