description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nThe Common Configuration Scoring System for Kubernetes Security - Julien Sobrier, Octarine \n\nThe Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is widely used to score vulnerabilities found in docker images. But how do you score the risk level of an entire workload, with its runtime configurations, network configurations, Pod Security Policy, privileges and capabilities added, etc.?  Julien will explore the Kubernetes Common Configuration Scoring System (KCCSS), an open-source framework to calculate risk scores for Kubernetes workloads, and kube-scan, an open-source scanner that implements the KCCSS. Based on CVSS, it categorizes risks associated with each runtime setting while considering how settings affect one another, and offers a global risk score for each workload—not just for individual settings. Attendees will learn how the KCCSS works, how it’s being used by end users for DevSecOps, and best practices for bullet proofing their own K8s applications. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ZejE"
