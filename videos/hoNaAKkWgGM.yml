description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Keynote: Cloud Native is Edge Native Too! - Dr. Thomas Di Giacomo, President of Engineering and Innovation, SUSE \n\nWe all know that the cloud is a great place to run cloud native applications, but that’s really just the beginning of the story.  Cloud native is as much about how we deliver applications as it is about where we run them, whether that’s in the datacenter, in the cloud, or at the edge.  In fact, edge computing is one area where cloud native technologies can be, and are being, especially well applied.  In this talk I will highlight some exciting work being done in CNCF community projects to adapt cloud native technologies for edge use cases, including how they connect edge and cloud to enable edge computing solutions. With these advancements we can employ cloud native technologies to work in ways that are not merely cloud agnostic, but are also edge agnostic.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZfHL"
