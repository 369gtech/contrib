title: 'Webinar: Hardware for Kubernetes, Peeling Back the Layers'
language: English

description: "Kubernetes enables developers to deploy and manage applications dynamically, making them more efficient, powerful, and extensible. Many describe the shift away from monolithic stacks on single-purpose machines to cloud native as a “decoupling of applications from infrastructure,” but the reality is that containerized and virtualized software still demands reliable, resilient, scalable hardware – the “servers” in “serverless”.\n\nBecause hardware design & performance directly affects the experience that users have with applications and with services, everyone building apps should appreciate the infrastructure layers that live under the work they do every day at least a little. New models such as hyperscale design and open hardware can be significantly more efficient and cost-effective, making it possible to further stretch and scale users and workloads. Subject matter experts across the industry in servers, storage, networking, power, cooling, and data centers are ensuring that these complex ecosystems work together in harmony and at peak efficiency end-to-end. These systems are designed in the open community and can be matched to run Kubernetes clusters with top performance and scalability from deskside to data center.\n\nIn this session, we will peel back the infrastructure layers that are usually hidden away, demonstrate some of the latest innovations in hyperscale design, and illustrate how to harness the power of the wide and deep hardware ecosystem to realize cloud native applications. Join Erik Riedel, SVP Engineering at ITRenew, as he draws on 20 years of building hardware for clouds before they had a cool name, to learn how it all works and what it means for you in practice.\n\nPresenter:\n\nErik Reidel, SVP Compute & Storage Solutions, ITRenew"
