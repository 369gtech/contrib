description: "This video was recorded at Lambda Days Virtual 2021 - https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2021\n\nMulticloud bindings from web pages | Michał J. Gajda, Science-based solutions \n\nABSTRACT\nWe address a practical problem of inter-language interoperability with cloud APIs from different vendors with HTML documentation and REST calling conventions.  \n\nWe solve this problem, by providing implementing a retargetable cloud application programming interface (API) binding generator. The code for the proposed API is implemented in Haskell, utilising type classes, types a la carte, and a code generation monad (design pattern). It also targets Haskell and allows binding cloud APIs on a short notice and an unprecedented scale. We also note that it significantly decreases maintenance issues with large cloud API bindings due to decreased code-base.  \n\n\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/LambdaDays\n\n  LinkedIn: ttps://www.linkedin.com/company/lambda-days\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Lambda Days conference!\n  See what's coming up at: https://www.lambdadays.org\n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
