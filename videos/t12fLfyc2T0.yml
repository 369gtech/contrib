description: "Over the last year Federico has been writing an open source frontend framework from scratch. In his talk, he will explain some of the reasons behind embarking on this crazy endeavour. He will elaborate on the fundamentals chosen to build the framework upon. Last but not least, he will show us some of the implementation details under the hood. Tag along with Federico and experience the ups and downs of his creative process!\n\nFederico is a full-stack JavaScript developer, originally hailing from Argentina but nowadays an aspiring Leidenaar. He is unduly obsessed with counting lines of code.\n\nRecorded during September AmsterdamJS Meetup https://www.meetup.com/preview/AmsterdamJS/events/242572077\n\nhttps://amsterdamjs.com"
