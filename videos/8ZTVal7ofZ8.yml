description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary 28, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPhotographic Technology EDU Day 6: In this session we examine the steps that a digital camera goes through to take raw data from an image sensor and make a photograph out of it. There are more steps than you might imagine, arranged in what is usually termed a pipeline, and is sometimes implemented on pipelined hardware, to get to a pleasing photographic rendering of the scene.
