description: "FaaS is Not Only the Serverless: Stream Processing with Serverless - Jun Makishi & Kensaku Komatsu, NTT Communications \n\nFunction as a Service is the popular solution of Serverless, which runs a short-lived function. In contrast, we will show a new Serverless: run long-lived function to deal with stream data. Our proposal is unique since it starts multiple Serverless functions for single stream, and let them keep processing the stream one after another. This enables a new use case like enriching an application with AI-powered analytics using video stream in real-time. NTT Communications has developed a new platform with Kubernetes and gRPC. We will throw a live demo to send voice stream from browser to this platform and run media processing functions in real-time. The functions will be open sourced, and all participants can try it out from tomorrow. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPeU"
