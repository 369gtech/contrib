title: 'The Zen of logging. How to face the worst day of your life. (Eugene Safonov, Ukraine) [UA]'
recordingDate: 1577306373
description: "Action! Where do I begin to tell the story of how your architecture is done, you have a logging framework, you know where to store logs. Where do you start writing it clear and useful?\n\nPut the matter another way, during my talk I will try to share my’ experience with the audience on the following subtopics:\n\n– What are logs in common and wherefore.\n– Stuff you should never see in logs.\n– Patterns and AntiPatterns.\n– Logs within a distributed chaos.\n– What to do to spend minutes and safe hours while surfing through a considering amount of data.\n\nAfter all, I do not guarantee that your worst day ever will never happen. You’ll have a log at least. Don’t panic and carry a towel. Always!"
