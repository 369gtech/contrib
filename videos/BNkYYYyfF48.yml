title: 'Paul deGrandis - Unlocking data-driven systems'
recordingDate: 1416515665
description: "Unlocking Data-Driven Systems\nIt is becoming increasingly common to see Clojure-based systems express their primary interactions with data (e.g. Datomic queries) - but what's the rationale?\n\nThis talk analyzes the merits of that design decision, the qualities that emerge, and the tips for implementing similar systems of your own. To motivate the topic, we will walk through a Consumer Reports' pilot project that stretched the concept across an entire stack - Pedestal services, Datomic ETL jobs, and even entire ClojureScript applications all expressed as data. With a heavy mix of core.async and core.logic, let's see just how far the rabbit hole goes!\n\nPaul deGrandis lives for magnificent engineering. Elegant, well-founded, useful solutions to problems that say something about engineering's beauty. He loves metrics, taking on the impossible, and making lives better through technology. Paul has previously worked on next-generation cable systems, autonomous internet infrastructure, distributed search and recommendation engines, massive online social game platforms, and more."
