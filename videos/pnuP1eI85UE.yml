Along the way, she’ll take several long detours into the realms of natural pattern formation, simulation and biology. Her talk will focus on some of Nervous System’s latest projects including a 4D printing technique that creates complex, foldable forms for 3D printing and an exploration into the morphogenesis of plants.\n\nJessica Rosenkrantz\nCreative Director, Nervous System\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/nervous\nhttps://twitter.com/nervous_jessica\nhttps://twitter.com/nervous_jessica\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
