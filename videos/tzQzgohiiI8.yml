description: "Speakers: Joe Gregorio\r\n \r\nLast year at Google IO we introduced you to our new platform we use for developing APIs. A year later we have many new APIs built on that platform, such as Google Buzz, Google Moderator,  Google Latitude API, and Google Custom Search API just to name a few. Come learn about these new APIs, the client libraries we built for them, and the rest of the tools we have to get you up and running fast."
