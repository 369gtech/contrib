description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nExtending containerd - Samuel Karp & Maksym Pavlenko, Amazon \n\ncontainerd, a graduated CNCF project, is a widely used container runtime that provides core functionality for Docker. containerd was designed to be small and simple, but also very modular and extensible. This talk covers the architecture of containerd, explains the responsibilities of each component, and dives deep into containerd’s facility for extension. We’ll cover the individual gRPC services that make up containerd and show how they can be extended with proxy plugins, Go plugins, process interfaces (OCI runtimes and process-based logging), thick client implementations, and build-your-own containerd for compiled-in extension. These extension mechanisms can be shown with simple examples and real-world use in the firecracker-containerd project. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaYP"
