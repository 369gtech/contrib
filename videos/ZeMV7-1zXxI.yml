description: "Supercharge your local BEAM Community - Ole Michaelis, Lydia Grawunder \n\nhttp://www.erlang-factory.com/berlin2016/ole-michaelis\n\nWe run the Elixir User group Hamburg, and we didn't run it the usual way. We want to share our ideas on how we are running our user group, like regular hands-on, socials and not too many regular talks. In order to have more people interested in Elixir.\n\nTalk objectives\n\nWe want attendees to walk away ignited and inspire to run or participate in their local communities so we can make our language more popular\n\nTarget audience\n\nEveryone!"
