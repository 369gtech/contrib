description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nBeing technology agnostic means you are free to explore every deep, dark corner of technology to discover something new, something interesting, and ideally something applicable. From visual recognition API’s to machine learning, paper crafting apps to web VR frameworks, you will never know what you might find, and how it will be useful.\n\nThis session will curate and uncover many of those items to be added to your tinkerer’s toolkit – from tools to frameworks to applications that might inject a new sense of whimsy or even accomplishment in your every day workload.\n\nStacey Mulcahy\nSenior Program Manager, Microsoft Garage\nhttps://twitter.com/bitchwhocodes\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
