description: "Cloud Native Service Mesh Using Spring Cloud and Pivotal Cloud Foundry Technologies - Srini Penchikala, General Motors\n\nLearn about how to migrate from monolithic app architecture to cloud enabled microservices architecture using service mesh and sidecar technologies.\n\nAs we started cloud native transformation to host microservices, challenges of managing multiple services on cloud became clear (Death Star). Also, no single product provided all the capabilities (context-sensitive circuit breaker).\n\nWe developed a service orchestration solution, as part of transition architecture, using custom sidecar solution based on Envoy and leveraging frameworks like Zuul, Eureka, and Spring Cloud Data Flow. It served as a dedicated layer for svc-to-svc communication and provided multi-tenancy, enabling global deployments of apps.\n\nEnvoy based transition-architecture and target-architecture resulted in significant cost savings, reduced time-to-value, and more importantly, secured microservices."
