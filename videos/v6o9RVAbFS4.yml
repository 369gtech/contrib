description: 'Chaos Engineering is an emerging discipline, but even before the first computer was built Failure was already there! Fast forward to today, how do you handle Failure? Do you deny it or accept it? Is your network really reliable? Is "the cloud", "the solution"? In this hands-on talk, I will explore the basic concepts of Chaos Engineering and demonstrate as a microservice application can be prepared for the chaos. I''ll illustrate how to prepare a plan, break things so you will be ready when failure comes by! This talk is about going big or go home! Rolling back is not a plan!'
