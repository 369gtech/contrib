recordingDate: 1435506806
description: "From Solid Conference 2015: Some believe the future will look like more of the same—more smartphones, phablets, and app stores. David Rose, award-winning entrepreneur and MIT Media Lab scientist, has a different vision.\n\nDavid designs products where technology is elegantly embedded into “the ordinary.” Ordinary objects become enchanted with extraordinary powers: A cup knows what you’re drinking; an umbrella knows it’s going to rain; a pen records sounds and gestures; pill bottles tweet. David will demonstrate how these enchanted objects address critical societal issues of health and wellbeing, energy conservation, transportation, urban housing, the future of retail, and creative expression.\n\nAbout David Rose (Ditto | MIT Media Lab):\nDavid Rose is an award-winning entrepreneur, author, and instructor at the MIT Media Lab. His research focuses on making the physical environment an interface to digital information. David is the CEO at Ditto Labs, an image-recognition software platform that scours social media photos to find brands and products. His new book, Enchanted Objects, focuses on the future of the Internet of Things, and how these technologies will impact the ways we live and work. Prior to Ditto, David founded and was CEO at Vitality, a company that reinvented medication packaging, now distributed by CVS, Walgreens, and Express Scripts. He founded Ambient Devices, which pioneered glanceable technology: embedding internet information in everyday objects like lamps, mirrors, and umbrellas. David holds patents for photo sharing, interactive TV, ambient information displays, and medical devices. His work has been featured at the MoMA, covered in The New York Times, Wired, The Economist, and parodied on the Colbert Report. Rose teaches information visualization at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and has also taught at Yale University and Marlboro College. He received his BA in physics from St. Olaf College, studied interactive cinema at the MIT Media Lab, and earned a masters degree from Harvard University."
