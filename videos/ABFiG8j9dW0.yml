title: 'Run Your Own Polkadot Validator, w/ Bill Laboon'
language: English
recordingDate: 1574371201
description: "Presented at Code & Supply in Pittsburgh.\n\nWant to earn interest on your cryptocurrency without running an expensive miner? Learn how at this workshop!\n\nBitcoin has miners; Polkadot has validators. Validators use DOT tokens, instead of solving quadrillions of hash puzzles, in order to produce blocks and add to the blockchain. This reduces the amount of electricity required to generate a blockchain by numerous orders of magnitude compared to a proof-of-work scheme.\n\nIn this workshop, we will learn what DOTs are, how Polkadot's nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) system works, and about the different kinds of roles in the Polkadot ecosystem (validators, nominators, collators, fishermen).\n\nWe will then set up our own validator node and connect to a local blockchain. We will experiment with validating and producing blocks, as well as nominating different validators with our DOTs.\n\nIf there is time, we can even set up your validator node to join the official Alexander testnet!\n\nPresenter: Bill Laboon (University of Pittsburgh / Web3 Foundation)"
