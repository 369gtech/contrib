title: 'YOW! Connected 2017 Justin Mclean - How to become an IoT developer (and have fun!)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510542002
description: "I started off my life as a developer writing machine code and C and working on some low level hardware projects. Then this thing called the internet come along and I moved into the web application space for a couple of decades. More recently I've moved back into commercial IoT development and not unexpectedly a lot has changed over that time.\nIn this talk I'll cover what it's like developing IoT projects. I'll go over the tools you need and protocols you need to be familiar with. I'll look at how the C language has evolved to what it is today and and how to write code that works well on memory constrained devices. I'll go over producing prototypes, rapid development, debugging and testing embedded applications and what and how much electronics you should learn.\nIn short everything you need to know in becoming an IoT developer and have fun doing it.\n\nJustin Mclean has more than 25 years experience in developing web based applications and is involved in the open source hardware movement. He runs his own consulting company Class Software and has spoken at numerous conferences in Australia and overseas including previous ApacheCon conferences.\n\nIn his free time he's active in the Apache Flex and Apache Incubator projects and mentor for a number of projects. He's also co-author of a book on Android mobile development, a casual academic at the University of NSW and runs the IoT (internet of things) meetup in Sydney.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
