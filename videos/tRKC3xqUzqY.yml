title: 'Full Steam Ahead, R2DBC!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027730
description: "It’s almost three years since the inception of the open standard Reactive Relational Database Connectivity specification (R2DBC). R2DBC is driven by the community. It started as a research project to explore how reactive applications running on the JVM can integrate with SQL databases using an end-to-end reactive approach. Learn in this session how R2DBC started and what you can do today. We’ll have a look at various database drivers and client projects. If you’re new to R2DBC, then this session will introduce R2DBC key concepts to you and will give you an overview of the specification.\n\nMark Paluch, Spring Data Project Lead at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/full-steam-ahead-r2dbc"
