This talk covers the design and implementation of tcp/ip communication components, the way how to handle requests and assign the tasks efficiently. A scalable, high-performance and easy-to-use framework based on Tornado is also introduced to help you to set up a tcp server in short time, so you can just focus on writing the logic part.\n\nContents\n\n1/ Design aspects - tcp servers - scale vs performance - design targets - sync vs async vs coroutines. - what options for network library in Python\n\n2/ System Architecture and flow\n\n3/ Implementation overview - Network components - CPython restrictions - Partial data transmission - Socket Tips - worker processor manager\n\n4/ Demo - small instant message application.\n\nEvent Page: https://pycon.sg\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/P6SM/"
