recordingDate: 1603295440
description: "Abstract:\nVisual Regression tests are essential for any type of UI development.\nWith out it, you might ship an application after changing the looks of one page without knowing that you broke several other pages. If we can easily see the difference you made in UI for every single PR, it can make the life of reviewers and QAs much simpler. But how would we go about making visual regression test with react native projects? In this talk, I will be sharing what me and my team has been using to perform visual regression test on react native projects, including how components will look in light mode and dark mode."
