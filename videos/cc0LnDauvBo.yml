description: "Event Storming: From a Pile of Sticky Notes to a Domain-Driven Design Microservices Architecture\n\nOne of the main challenges each company faces is to come up with processes that create business value and a revenue stream for its employees. In the past many technical approaches often have led to expensive trial and error efforts including rewriting existing code bases.\n\nMeet Event Storming. It is a lightweight, rapid and flexible workshop method for everyone that is using sticky notes in various colours for collaborative exploration of your complex business domains – layer by layer. Aligned with Domain-Driven Design working in an iterative manner helps the various stakeholders (product owners, scrum masters and software developers) to not only derive events, commands, aggregates, domain models and bounded contexts but also figure out issues, hot spots and chances for continuous improvement.\n\nSPEAKER: Benjamin Nothdurft – https://twitter.com/dataduke\n\nTechnical Lead for Cloud Technologies at codecentric\n\nBenjamin is an Oracle Groundbreaker, works as technical lead for cloud technologies and regional manager Erfurt at codecentric, speaks regularly at international conferences and loves to teach at several universities.
