recordingDate: 1418151810
description: 'Delegates are an important feature of .NET. They allow us to pass methods as parameters to other methods (among other things). In this video, we''ll see how we can use the built-in delegate type "Func" instead of using a custom delegate. In addition, we''ll see how lambda expressions can make our code very compact and easy to read. For more information and the sample code, visit http://www.jeremybytes.com/Demos.aspx#GF'
