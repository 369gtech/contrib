title: 'Emily Bache - Technical Leadership and Empowered Teams'

description: "In a DevOps world of Agile empowered teams, exerting technical leadership across an organization is challenging. When I was a junior to mid-level developer, the technical leaders in my organization were called Architects. Day to day, I saw little of them. The help they gave me comprised mainly of architectural diagrams to guide development work, and compulsory standard tools and frameworks. Occasionally they would hold workshops with the whole team and go through important technical decisions. These people, although once skilled programmers, did not write code themselves any more.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore recently, I've found DevOps to be a great way to get teams aligned with sensible shared goals, and to ensure they there is enough automation so there is time available for the important work of developing new features. I'm seeing a lot of people migrating to a microservices architecture, and gaining advantage from smaller, more manageable codebases. This is all good stuff. My biggest concerns now that I am a more senior developer and technical leader, is how to ensure the code produced is of good quality, has automated tests, and follows broad architectural guidelines. These concerns are similar to those of the past, but in my opinion the kind of technical leader we need today looks a lot more like a coach than a traditional architect. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/craft"
