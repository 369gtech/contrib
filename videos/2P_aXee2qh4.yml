description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n\nState of Affairs or Affairs of State | Sergey Bykov - SDE at Temporal Technologies \n\nABSTRACT\nCloud services demand fast and resilient execution of large numbers of concurrent requests. Processing of requests is ultimately about managing of application state and handling of failures. When we outgrow the stateless paradigm, for performance or cost reasons, and enter the world of stateful applications, the challenge becomes even more interesting. In this talk Sergey Bykov will give an overview of two different approaches to building such applications as implemented by Orleans and Temporal.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshIO\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
