description: "Who would have guessed Next.js could be used to write an eBook? My ebook Writy.io: \"Content for Developers\" was challenging to write at first as I invariably fought ridiculous formatting issues.  Eventually, I decided to build it with Next.js and WordPress. Next.js offered an exceptional developer experience. No formatting issues, optimized layout, and a — free web version to host on Vercel. WordPress provided a battle-tested headless backend.  By the end of this talk, you'll walk away with lots of creative ideas on how to use Next.js to your advantage — may be in places you never thought possible. \n\nMaedah Batool\nDirector Developer Content at WGA"
