title: '#HITBLockdown D1 Building Next-Gen Security Analysis Tools With Qiling Framework - Lau KJ & S. Berni'
language: English
recordingDate: 1590639593
description: "qiling.io is a sandbox emulator framework with a rich set of Python API to enable highly customizable analysis tools built on top. Using emulator technology inside, our engine can run the executable binary in a cross-platform-architecture way, so we can analyze Windows PE files on Linux Arm64, IoT firmware based on Mips on MacOS, and so on. This talk introduces the internals of Qiling, in which we briefly discuss the design & implementation of our engine, binary loader, dynamic linker, to OS environment, essential system components and APIs to enable binary emulation. As a framework, Qiling paves way for users to quickly & easily build new security tools, without requiring much low-level knowledge. This presentation focuses on how to build a series of advanced applications, ranging from cross-platform coverage-guided fuzzer, malware sandbox, to IoT emulation for vulnerability research. Each case will be discussed in detail, so the audience build more exciting tools. To conclude, we will officially announce version 1.0, as well as the next steps for Qiling Framework\n\n===  \n\nKaiJern (xwings), is Lab Director of The ShepherdLab, of JD Security. His research topic mainly on embedded devices, hardware security, blockchain security, reverse engineering and various security topics. He presented his findings in different international security conferences like Defcon, HITB, Codegate, QCon, KCon, Brucon, H2HC and etc. He conducted hardware Hacking courses in various places around the globe. He is also the owner of hackersbadge.com, actively involved in Unicorn (https://unicorn-engine.org) development and founder of Qiling Framework (https://qiling.io)\n\n---\n\nSimone Berni Master student of Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna and  doing master thesis on binary emulation and malware evasion techniques with Certego. Since two year ago, he partecipated in many online CTF, all with the team UlisseLabBo. He mainly focus on reversing and pwn, and since March he joined the Qiling Community and bec"
