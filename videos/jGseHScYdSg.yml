description: "\"How Thinking in Python Made Me a Better Software Engineer\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Boston]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Johnny Dude\n\nDid you ever wonder why development in Python can be x10 faster than development in languages like c++?\n\nObserving my teams’ experimentations, the python community, and reading, I have adopted various habits, patterns, and tools. But most importantly I learned thinking in Python. I consider thinking in Python a key for rapid development and good engineering.\n\nThinking in a programming language affects the amount of information you need to keep in your working memory. It also affects the abstractions and tools that pop in your mind and then used in constructing solutions. \n\nLet’s explore what it means to think in Python. Why Python allows you to focus on problem solving, while languages like c++ often distract your attention from the problem at hand.\n\nIn this talk I will cover some good and bad practices by examples while trying to consider the amount of effort needed to write it, read it, and talk about it with other team members.\n\nKey Takeaways: Tips for speeding your work without compromising quality, and reasoning for using it.\n\n\nThe audience should be comfortably familiar with the process of software development, and software problem solving, and experience using Python.\n\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
