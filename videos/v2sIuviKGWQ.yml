description: "Kapil Bakshi, Android Engineer\n\nMASTERING THE ART OF A/B TESTING AND BEYOND\nIntermediate / Design / UI/UX / Talk\n\nIn today’s user centric world where companies try their level best to win their users’ hearts, it has become indispensable to capture each and every user data point in order to make data driven decisions. While planning new features it becomes very confusing if you have a lot of variations in mind. No matter how good your hypothesis be, ultimately its the users, their mindset, their behaviour, their habits which govern the validity and correctness of your feature. A/B Testing transforms “I guess, I suppose to I know” by letting us distribute different versions of our product among users and determine in real time which version emerges as the leader. We can then roll out that version to all the users. From learning What is A/B Testing, Why is it needed, Fundamental blocks of A/B Testing to diving deeper into A/B Testing Stuff Designers should know, different A/B Testing Platforms available with some quick exploration of two of them, we will ultimately draw some important conclusions like When not to A/B Test, avoiding Common A/B Testing Mistakes and some of the Best Practices. So my dear Designers Design and my beloved Developers Devise, With A/B Testing Let’s All Rise!"
