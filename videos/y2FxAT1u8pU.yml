description: "Today we're continuing on with polymer-redux and talking about asynchronous actions. To streamline the process we'll be using an addition to Redux called Redux Thunk. Redux Thunk let's you dispatch a function that can asynchronous fire off actions, kind of like an async action creator.\n\nDemo code: https://goo.gl/9j99db\n\nCheck out the docs for redux-thunk on GitHub: https://goo.gl/HLb0Md\n\nPolycasts playlist: https://goo.gl/r5fsMq \nPolymer Slack: http://bit.ly/polymerslack\n\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel: https://goo.gl/OUF4e2"
