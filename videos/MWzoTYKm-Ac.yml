title: 'JavaFX in the Cloud with OpenDolphin'

recordingDate: 1433255772
description: "Cloud applications run on the server. They still need a display, though, and the most capable one is JavaFX on the desktop. OpenDolphin introduces a shared presentation model to merge these two worlds. The cloud application controls what should be displayed, and the client displays that application state and its transitions with all the beauty of JavaFX, including animations, effects, 3-D worlds, and custom controls.\nIf you run a cloud architecture and still seek to provide the best-possible user experience, this session is for you.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDierk Koenig\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Dierk Koenig at https://www.parleys.com/author/dierk-koenig-7\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
