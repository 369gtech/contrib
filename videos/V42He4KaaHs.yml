description: 'This talk will examine the tools, methods and data behind the DDoS attacks that are prevalent in the news headlines. Using information collected, I will demonstrate what the attackers are using to cause their mischief and mayhem and examine the timeline and progression of attackers as they move from the historical page defacers to the motivated DDoS attacker. I will look at the motivations and rationale that they have and try to share some sort of understanding as to what patterns to be aware of for their own protection.'
