description: "A Google TechTalk, 2018-12-05, presented by Alessandro Barenghi\nABSTRACT: This talk will present LEDAkem and LEDApkc, a key agreement scheme and a public key encryption scheme resistant against attacks with both classical and quantum computers.\n\nIn this talk I will present the schemes and report recent results on\nhow we can automatically generate key sizes and cryptosystem parameters tailored for a desired security level, providing practical performance figures.\n\nAbout the speaker: Alessandro Barenghi is currently assistant professor at Politecnico di Milano, and one of the proposers of the LEDAkem/LEDApkc cryptoschemes to the NIST post-quantum standardization initiative."
