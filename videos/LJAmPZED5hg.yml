description: "Michel Schildmeijer, Solutions Architect and Oracle ACE, Qualogy Holding B.V.\n\nDevOps teams work closely together on building, deploying, and managing applications from dev to production environments. Usually the early focus is on turning business functionality into technical solutions. To know how applications behave under heavy load when theyâ€™re live in production is always somewhere behind. The APM module of Oracle Management Cloud can be used in a DevOps team to detect bottlenecks even in early coding stages so the team knows that the release will be stable and performant when it runs in production. This session explains how to embed the module into DevOps methodologies."
