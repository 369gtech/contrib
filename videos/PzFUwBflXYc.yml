It features a multi-dimensional data model with a powerful query language and integrates many aspects of systems and service monitoring: from the instrumentation of services over the collection and storage of metrics data, all the way to dashboarding and alerting. Native support for various service discovery mechanisms also make it particularly suitable for dynamic cloud-based environments like Kubernetes. In the introduction, Prometheus co-founder Julius Volz explains the architecture of Prometheus and highlights its key features.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zex4"
