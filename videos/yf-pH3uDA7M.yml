description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/34gaMYE\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\n.NET has accustomed us to writing code quickly and without thinking about what is going on underneath. Unfortunately, convenience comes with additional cost. It is very easy to lose the performance of our component through simple statement or code block which behaves differently than we thought. I will focus on the everyday performance traps, which can spoil your hard effort."
