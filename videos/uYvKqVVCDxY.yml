description: "What we develop matters. And more: the way we develop it matters. It matters for how it changes us. Software lets us form complex systems faster, and adapt them faster, than any human-made material of the past. This means we can learn how to make better systems.\n\nFor this, we have to learn how to see those systems. Then we have to practice changing them in small ways, and consciously looking at what happens. Jess is known for her keynotes, blog, and tweets. She podcasts on Greater than Code and Arrested Devops.\n\nCurrently, she spends much of her time building symmathesies through Industrial Logic. She has worked at startups (Atomist, Stripe, Outpace) and enterprises (Ford, Bayer, Sprint). Sheâ€™s programmed in and spoken at conferences about Java, Scala, Clojure, TypeScript, Ruby, and Elm.\n\nJess lives in St. Louis, MO with two children who invent worlds and draw characters with superpowers, and two cats who meow and knock over water glasses."
