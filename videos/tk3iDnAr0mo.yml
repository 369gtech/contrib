description: 'Listening is power. By tuning in and applying self-management and directed curiosity, you can help others solve their own problems. Doing this not only leads to greater ownership but also creates more leaders (rather than “order followers”) in your organization. Heidi Helfand shares practical communication skills so you can become a more available and empowering coworker, friend, and leader.'
