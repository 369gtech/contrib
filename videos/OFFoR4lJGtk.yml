A good chatbot can save your users from long and complicated forms, cut down on support requests, and make your services more approachable.\nIf you've ever wondered how do build a chatbot, then this session is for you. You will:\n- Dive into the core concepts of what makes a chatbot.\n- Learn how to employ Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to create a conversation flow that feels 100% natural.\n- Look at a variety of possible conversations and challenges that go with them.\n\nBut more importantly, you will learn how to build a fully functioning chatbot and add it to your Angular app in less than 15 minutes—all without a single IF statement.\n\nSebastian Witalec - Technical Evangelist at Progress | UK\nSebastian is a Technical Evangelist for Telerik with over 8 years of experience in software engineering and architecture. Sebastian has passion for all types of technologies. However in the last few years his focus shifted towards cross platform Mobile development where he gained experience with Apache Cordova and NativeScript (a member of the team). He is always happy to learn about the new stuff and to pass the knowledge as far as his voice (or the wire) can take him. Sebastian is based in London, UK actively working with various Dev communities in the area.
