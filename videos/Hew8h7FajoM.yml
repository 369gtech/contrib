However, I often feel that this is not as appreciated as it should be”\n“I’m often unsure if it is the right time to ask for help”\n“My manager keeps checking on me, I feel she doesn’t trust me”\n\nIf these statements ring a familiar bell, this talk is for you. After Miri’s many years as a VP R&D, she intimately knows both perspectives, yours and your managers’, and can bridge between them. In this talk Miri will discusses:\n- How to convey messages that help you achieve your goals?\n- How to communicate with your manager and peers so that they see you and appreciate your work?\n- And how to do it all when working from home?\n\nBio: Miri Curiel served as VP R&D in various companies (both startups and large companies) until a while ago when she pivoted to a mentoring and consulting career.
