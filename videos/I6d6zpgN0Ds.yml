title: 'Improve the illusion of speed - Optimize your web experience to perfection! - Marius Røed - NDC Oslo'
recordingDate: 1601835189
description: "The importance of having a mobile friendly web page is well established, but most mobile sites are still not optimized to perfection. The result is suffering conversion rates and loss of revenue. User expectations are growing rapidly, and it’s critical to stay ahead of the increasing demand. Your users are not only comparing your user experience against your competitors, but the “best in class” organizations. Mobile speed has become one of the most important factors in mobile web experience in recent years, and as a web developer you are responsible to make sure your web sites are performing in line with users' expectations.\n\nNobody cares how fast your web site is, just how fast it feels. Decreasing javascript bundles, optimizing images and fonts are some common techniques for improving load time, but will not solve the problem alone. This talk will give developers an introduction on how to combine actual page speed optimization with speed perception. We will explore how users are perceiving time and speed, and how can we utilize this when working with performance. Which speed indicators and measurements should developers focus on, and which techniques can be used to not only optimize the actual speed, but to increase the perception of speed, and then create the illusion of a fast website. Some keywords: Early completion, preemptive start, optimistic UI, precognition and visual illusions.\n\nAfter this talk you will know what to focus on when working with mobile web performance, and know which techniques to use both thinking of actual and perceived speed."
