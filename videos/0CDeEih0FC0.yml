description: "Blockchain.currentState() and How Will it Impact Your Industry?\n\nBlockchain technology is a decentralized public domain where every cryptocurrency transaction is recorded and can be traced to the buyer and seller. Blockchain was first used in ensuring the integrity of cryptocurrencies. The concept of blockchain technology starts with providing each stakeholder with a copy of the data in a ledger. While it may take a few more years before the widespread adoption of blockchain, some industries are already beginning to realize the potential and benefits of this technology. In order to realize the benefits of blockchain and other emerging technologies, businesses must be prepared to take advantage of them by ensuring that their enterprise systems are fully integrated. Integration consolidates an enterpriseâ€™s applications and systems and prepares them to support new technologies such as blockchain, Big Data, machine learning, and many others."
