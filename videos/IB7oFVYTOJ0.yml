description: 'With the release of Java 9, our beloved mostly CMS collector was depreciated and G1GC replaced the Parallel collector as the default. The hype surrounding this massive change that the G1GC is the best collector… ever. Make no mistake about it, G1GC will be much much easier to tune. So, is this real or is it #fakenews. In this session we will explore the reality by looking experiences moving applications from CMS to G1GC in real production environments. The implications aren’t simply about performance. A sub-optimally tuned collector will increase your companies operating cost by 10-20%. We will also explore results from benchmarks that expose potential pain points. and offer some suggestions on what actions can offer some relief.'
