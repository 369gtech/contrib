description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nHow to Break your Kubernetes Cluster with Networking - Thomas Graf, Isovalent\n\nOne of the best ways to learn about something is to understand how you can break it. In this talk, we will look at all the different ways you can break your Kubernetes cluster with networking. Learn from this before you learn in production. Misconfigured DNS, DNS, unreliable network protocols and DNS, DNS rate-limiting, network policy side effects, NodePort surprises, MTU and Kubernetes, effects of Kubernetes networking on distributed databases, network rate-limiting effects, bootstrapping race conditions, unexpected service behavior, sudden breakages at scale, and more. The list of potential ways to break your cluster is long. Half a decade of CNI development experience while working with many, many Kubernetes users as a maintainer of one of the leading open-source CNI projects have gone into this talk. It will be fun, you will laugh, and hopefully, in the end, you will avoid some of what others have already experienced."
