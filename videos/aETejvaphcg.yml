language: English
recordingDate: 1524000598
description: "Uday Tatiraju\nPrincipal Member of Technical Staff\nOracle\n\nJDK 9â€™s Java Platform Module System (JPMS) is a performant and scalable platform which provides strong encapsulation and reliable configuration. It can be combined with Vert.x toolkit to build resilient and responsive microservices. The main intention of this talk is to detail the design and development of microservices using JPMS and the Vert.x toolkit. We'll construct the application from a host of loosely coupled modules that communicate over well defined interfaces. We'll use open tracing framework to monitor them, and deploy to Oracle container cloud service, briefly touching upon how easily scalable the application is while using OPC. We'll also discuss various challenges while working with non-modular jars and possible solutions."
