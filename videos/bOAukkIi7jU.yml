description: "In this episode Nicolai Munk Petersen talks about Augmented Reality and explains what it takes to make your first experience with Project Tango. And it’s all about timing.\n\nRight now, people are used to thinking in one of two worlds, the physical world and the virtual world. Augmented Reality is the dynamic and seamless blending of the two worlds. The Project Tango platform mimics how we operate, so understanding how our brain processes images to record movement will help you understand how Project Tango processes images to track movement in real-time.\n\nFinally, we will touch on a few pitfalls to help developers consider best practices for creating an AR environment.  \n\nWatch more episodes of Project Tango here: https://goo.gl/mmC3JA \n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L -\nSubscribe to the brand new Firebase Channel: https://goo.gl/9giPHG"
