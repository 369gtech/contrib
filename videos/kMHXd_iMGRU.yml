title: 'Timmo Verlaan | Nervous System - Nerves Clustering Using Your Own Distribution'

description: "Filmed in Barcelona at ElixirConf EU 2017\n\nComing with Erlang R19 is the option to use your own distribution module. This creates the possibility for having auto-connecting Nerves devices without worrying about the local network or specifying node names upfront. In this talk I will explore the different solutions up until now. One of which was my first go at creating \"distributed blinky\" (having a led blink on 2+ devices taking turns). Then I will take a look at how we can create our own distribution module and see how we can leverage that so we don't need any upfront knowledge about node names and are independent of the local network. Our goal is to create an autonomously connecting Nerves cluster with zero effort! But, can it be done?\n\nElixirConf EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities."
