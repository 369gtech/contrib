description: "The idea of Microservices became accepted over the years. However, sometimes the resulting services are that small and encapsulated that operating the servers, isolating the artifacts and scaling it all out consumes more time than actually developing the services. Wouldn't it be great if someone else would take care of that, making sure that everything works as expected?\n\nThat's exactly where serverless architectures come into play. By examples using the most popular vendor, AWS Lambda, I will show for which purposes serverless is a good fit, how it actually works and in which cases you'd better keep your hands off it."
