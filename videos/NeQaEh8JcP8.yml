description: "There are many important elections this year. As you read this, Russia is already disrupting them. When we talk about election security, most people think of hacking voting machines. But what about other cyber methods and means of disrupting an election? What can nation state threat actors do today, tomorrow, the day of the election, and after to sow chaos and erode our faith in democracy?\n\n\n\nIn this session, we’ll discuss how Russia has influenced worldwide elections using cyberwarfare and how we have fought back. We’ll understand the natural asymmetry between how Russia and other countries are able to respond, and how we have changed our approach since 2016.\n\n\nBy the end, we will be brainstorming all of the ways to disrupt an election that countries aren’t prepared for. Get ready to put your nation state threat actor hat on and disrupt some elections – and maybe even earn some ириски-тянучки.\n\n\n=== \n\n\nAllie Mellen has spent the past decade in engineering, development, and technical consulting roles at multiple venture-backed startups, as well as research roles at MIT and Boston University.
