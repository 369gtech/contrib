description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThis presentation describes the necessity, utility and usage for a library of safe integer types.  These types function in all respects the same way as built-in integers, but guarantee that no integer expression will return an incorrect result.  The library can be reviewed at the boost library incubator.\n— \nJohn McFarlane\nProgrammer\nJohn McFarlane has used C++ for twenty years, specializing in simulation, AI and interactivity. He is a contributor to Study Groups 6 and 14 and is involved in standardizing fixed-point arithmetic.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
