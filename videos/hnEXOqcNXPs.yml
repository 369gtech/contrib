title: 'Battle Of The Microservice Frameworks: Micronaut versus Quarkus edition! by Michel Schudel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1572935063
description: "Micronaut and Quarkus are two cool emerging Java backend frameworks that aim to solve some problems that exist in current frameworks, like faster startup, low memory footprint, and support for ahead-of-time compilation using GraalVM. In this session, we'll square off both frameworks against each other.\n\nHow do they compare, what are the stronger and weaker points of both frameworks?\n\nWe'll compare the following features:\n\nInitializing your project\nBuilding your first restcontroller / programming model\nStartup time\nDatabase support\nIntegration test support\nBuilding native images\nMemory usage and JAR sizes\nEase of cloud deployment\nIn the end, we might have a clear winner! ... or will we?\n\nMichel Schudel has been a passionate Java developer since 1998, building various Java solutions for banks, insurance companies and telecom providers. Since then he has seen the good, the bad and the ugly in Java land. He loves agile development and coding with frameworks like SpringBoot to get up-and-running as fast as possible. Futhermore, he likes to coach junior developers in Core Java. Michel is currently working for Rabobank in the Netherlands."
