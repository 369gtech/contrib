She joined PayPal as a distinguished member, technical staff-open source as of February 2014. She also runs DaneseWorks, an open source consultancy whose clients have included the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Numenta, Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortia, AutoDesk, and if(we) Inc. Prior to founding DaneseWorks she was CTO of the Wikimedia Foundation (home of Wikipedia). Since 1999, Danese has been involved in developing and evangelizing the open source movement and its attached methodologies, including release of some very key open source projects while at Sun Microsystems, such as Apache Tomcat, OpenOffice.org, JXTA.org, NetBeans.org, GridEngine.org, GlassFish, and OpenSolaris. At Intel she worked on projects designed to bridge the digital divide, and fed a growing interest/participation in the social software movement. Prior to the dawn of open source, Danese enjoyed a long career at proprietary companies including Apple, Microsoft, and Symantec. She is also co-editor of the book Open Sources v2.0, and is a reviewing editor of The Art of Community and Getting Started With InnerSource, all from O’Reilly Media.\n\nAbout Arnold Goldberg:\nArnold Goldberg has over 25 years of experience in the software industry and is currently VP of merchant product and technology at PayPal. In his time at PayPal, he has had responsibility for consumer, developer, and merchant engineering for PayPal’s global products. Arnold has focused heavily on shifting the technology organization’s culture to focus on engineering craftsmanship and providing experiences that delight customers. Prior to PayPal, Arnold enjoyed working at both large and small companies. After graduating from the University of Florida, he moved back to Melbourne, Florida, where he grew up, to take his first job at Harris Controls. After Harris, he spent his “formative” years at eBay, between 2001 and 2008, learning how to scale people, process, and technology. Arnold then spent five years at startups, including the early days of LinkedIn and Box. At LinkedIn he was responsible for platform engineering. In his three years at Box he led and scaled product engineering, backend, mobile, sync, platform, engineering services, release, and QE teams. He joined when the company was around 50 people and it was over 900 when he left. Outside of work Arnold and his wife Lisa are raising two children. In his free time he enjoys getting away to Tahoe, running, biking, and a little extreme snowboarding from time to time."
