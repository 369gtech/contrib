recordingDate: 1514468075
description: "MicroService Architectures has debuted on the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar as the first technology they address, and with strong recommendations to immediately experiment. In this talk, we will outline the guidelines we have used at two different companies to implement MicroServices. And more importantly, we will tell you about the pitfalls we have encountered.\n\nFred George is a developer and co­founder at Outpace Systems, and has been writing code for over 46 years in (by his count) over 70 languages. He has delivered projects and products across his career, and in the last decade alone, has worked in the US, India, China, and the UK. He started ThoughtWorks University in Bangalore, India, based on a commercial programming training program he developed in the 90’s.

Oh, and he still writes code!\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
