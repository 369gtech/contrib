description: "Safety Engineering: A Journey\n\nWe engineer our systems to be reliable. The profession has maintained a keen focus on approaches to testing to best ensure that everything goes right. We expect our people to think through potential failures and architect them to be resilient regardless. But despite our best efforts, unexpected failures will always occur.\nThis talk discusses ‘safety engineering’ – the design of IT control systems for when unforeseen circumstances arise. Drawing on the experience of implementing a safety program within a HFT company the talk will cover where safety systems sit in the overall architecture, what they do, and when to invest in them. Finally, the talk will cover the practical aspects of implementing a safety regime within a company.\n\nBrad is an experienced software developer interested in working out what the problems are as much as solving them.\n\nFor more on YOW!
