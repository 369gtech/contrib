title: 'YOW! West 2016 Mark Hibberd - Turning Technical Debt into Monetary Debt: Price Aware Architecture'
recordingDate: 1468845220
description: "How much does your software cost to operate?\n\nSoftware design and implementation has an uneasy relationship with cost. As software developers, we often dwell on the cost of building software, but far less so on the cost to operate. The current zeitgeist of pay-as-you-go infrastructure makes this particularly apparent where rigid, hard to deploy and adapt software directly equates to larger bills. If we want to take control of operational cost, it is critical that we start to make operational cost a first-class constraint in the design and architecture of modern software.\n\nIn this talk we will work through the idea of price-aware architectures, answering: what are the properties of a price-aware architecture? what happens when we design our systems in a way that can leverage variable price and availability of infrastructure? and finally, how do we implement such systems?\n\nMark Hibberd spends his time working on large-scale data and machine learning problems for Ambiata. Mark takes software development seriously. Valuing correctness and reliability, he is constantly looking to learn tools and techniques to support these goals.\n\nThis approach has led to a history of building teams that utilise purely-functional programming techniques to help deliver robust products.\n\nFor more on YOW!
