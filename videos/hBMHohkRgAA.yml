description: "How ML Breaks: A Decade of Outages for One Large ML Pipeline\n\nDaniel Papasian and Todd Underwood, Google\n\nReliable management of continuous or periodic machine learning pipelines at large scale presents significant operational challenges. Using experience from almost 15 years of operating some of the largest ML pipelines, we examine the characteristics of one of the largest and oldest continuous pipeline at Google. We look at actual outages experienced and try to understand what caused them.\n\nWe examine failures in detail, categorizing them into ML vs Non-ML and Distributed vs. Non-Distributed. We demonstrate that a majority of the outages are not ML-centric and are more related to the distributed character of the pipeline.\n\nView the full OpML '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/opml20/program"
