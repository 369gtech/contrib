title: '#AskTHAT live with Scott Addie, Developer Documentation'
recordingDate: 1523904146
description: "Yes I said it.. Developers making those illusive docs. That dreaded task that always feels out of date before you hit publish. In this version of #AskTHAT I talk with Scott Addie about his approach to documenting all things ASP.NET CORE and .NET CORE. \n\nScott Addie is an avid blogger, a Telerik Developer Network author, and a technical evangelist of the modern web. Scott has reached masses of developers through blog posts, articles, and speaking engagements at user groups, code camps, and conferences across the globe. With a strong emphasis on JavaScript and the Microsoft web technology stack, Scott holds numerous industry-recognized Microsoft development certifications and has been named a Microsoft MVP twice in the award category of Visual Studio and Development Technologies. His thought leadership in the .NET community has also earned him a seat in the Telerik Developer Experts program. As a firm believer in giving back to the community, Scott is a frequent open source contributor to high-profile GitHub projects in the Microsoft developer ecosystem. In his day job as a \"blue badge\", Scott produces ASP.NET Core content for docs.microsoft.com. \n\nLinks:\n\n- Scottâ€™s Website - https://scottaddie.com/\n- Docs Authoring Pack extension for VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=docsmsft.docs-authoring-pack\n- Microsoft Writing Style Guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/style-guide/"
