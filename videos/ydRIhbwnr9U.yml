description: "Are you being asked to put more cloud in your strategy? If you’re like most people, the answer is a definite yes. The word “cloud” can mean so many things, however, that making an actionable strategy is impossible. At Pivotal, we divide cloud into two distinct parts: migrating as many legacy applications into SaaS as possible and focusing on perfecting the software you build in-house that runs your business. Gartner is predicting that by 2020, 75% of applications used to support digital businesses will be built in-house. If you’re one of these companies, you’ll need to quickly evaluate how you develop and run your custom written software.\n\nWe believe that soon, every company will either be a software company or losing to a competitor who is. It’s time to focus on the craft of managing the software development life-cycle, and this brief, but dense webinar will help launch your efforts to become a software defined business.\n\nJoin us in the last installment in our series: Organization Transformation - to get the full benefit of a cloud native approach, you'll likely need to change how your organization functions and behaves: you'll have to change its culture. When software is thought of more as ongoing products instead of discrete projects, the way the IT department is managed and run changes accordingly. This last part covers the motivations for those changes and outlines how to start transforming everyday management, strategy, staffing, and operations to become a cloud native enterprise.\n\nPresenter: Michael Coté"
