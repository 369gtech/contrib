title: 'Jens Palsberg - Quantum Computing & the Quantum Internet'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619708215
description: "\"Quantum computers are here and they are getting better at a double exponential rate. Additionally, researchers are building the quantum internet, which will enable quantum computers to work together\nwith unprecedented security.  Quantum computers promise to break cryptography, simulate chemistry fast enough to discover new drugs, and beat classical computers at solving optimization problems.\nHow far are we with this and how does it work?\n\nI will give an introduction to quantum computing and the quantum internet, and I will use quantum teleportation and quantum chess to illustrate the ideas.\""
