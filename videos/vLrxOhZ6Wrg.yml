description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nMaking an Internal Kubernetes Offering Generally Available - James Wen, Spotify \n\nIn the span of two years, Spotify went from two developers investigating what a potential migration to Kubernetes might involve to having an internal, multi-tenant offering of Kubernetes become generally available for all its developers as the new, primary runtime offering.    Spotify has previously given talks on the earlier bootstrapping, experimentation, alpha, and beta phases of this migration process. However, this talk will focus on the latter work involved in bringing the internal offering of Kubernetes “across the finish line.” The talk will cover what was required to bring the offering to general availability, including work shoring up scalability and reliability via a multicluster strategy, DIRT testing, operational metrics and alerts. This talk will also cover the technical and process elements involved in designing a successful self-service migration experience for developers. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uab1"
