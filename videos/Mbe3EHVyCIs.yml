title: 'Yomi - an openSUSE installer based on SaltStack'
recordingDate: 1569085032
description: "https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2019-118-yomi-an-opensuse-installer-based-on-saltstack\n\n\n\nWe will present [Yomi](https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi), a new proposal for installing Linux using [SaltStack](https://github.com/saltstack/salt). This installer is designed to be used in heterogeneous clusters, where you need a bit of intelligence during the installation and be integrated as one more step in the provisioning process.\n\n[Yomi](https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi) is a new kind of installer for the [open]SUSE family based on SaltStack and independent of AutoYaST.\n\nThe goal of this project is to make the installation of Linux (currently openSUSE) when:\n\n* You have a cluster of heterogeneous nodes (different profiles of memory, storage, CPU and network configurations)\n* The installation needs to be unattended\n* The installer needs to make decisions based on local profiles and external data\n* The installation process needs to be integrated, as one step more, into a more complicated provisioning workflow.\n\nThe dependencies of Yomi are minimal, as only Salt and a very few CLI tools are required, which make it ideal to be deployed a booted from PXE Boot.\n\nAlberto Planas Dominguez\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/ASG2019/talk/KDEYJZ/"
