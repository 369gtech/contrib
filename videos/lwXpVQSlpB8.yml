title: '#FlinkForward SF 2017: Timo Walther - Table & SQL API– unified APIs for batch & stream processing'
language: English
recordingDate: 1492195114
description: "SQL is undoubtedly the most widely used language for data analytics. It is declarative and can be optimized and efficiently executed by most query processors. Therefore the community has made effort to add relational APIs to Apache Flink, a standard SQL API and a language-integrated Table API. Both APIs are semantically compatible and share the same optimization and execution path based on Apache Calcite. Since Flink supports both stream and batch processing and many use cases require both kinds of processing, we aim for a unified relational layer. In this talk we will look at the current API capabilities, find out what's under the hood of Flink’s relational APIs, and give an outlook for future features such as dynamic tables, Flink's way how streams are converted into tables and vice versa leveraging the stream-table duality.\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://BashFilms.com"
