title: 'Bayesian hierarchical time series with Prophet and PyMC3 - Matthijs Brouns | PyData Jeddah'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601715685
description: "When doing time-series modeling, you often end up in a situation where you want to make long-term predictions for multiple related time series. In this talk, weâ€™ll see how we can combine the ideas behind Bayesian hierarchical models and Facebook's Prophet package to do exactly that.\n\nResources:\n\n1.

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
