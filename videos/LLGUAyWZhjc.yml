description: "Talk from ChernivtsiJS 2018, 23 June 2018 (https://chernivtsi.js.org)\n\nVasilika Klimova, Artec3D (Gostingen, Luxembourg)\n\nSlides: https://chernivtsi.js.org/this-terrible-word-deadline\n\nI have been working in web development for 7 years. The last one and a half year I am Frontend TeamLead in Artec3D. Our work is always the final step before the releases. In the process of preparing releases and forming deadlines, all work: managers, marketers, designers, backenders and others. In the case of shifted deadlines and the inability to postpone the release, of course, the frontend department saves everyone... We will talk about this.\nHow not to go crazy when you have just 2 weeks before the release, and the design is not yet fully ready? What to do if you have new technology stack, and the team has not already handled it? What if the important developers leaves the team before the release?\nOne day, each of us becomes something more than a programmer who did just Jira-tickets..."
