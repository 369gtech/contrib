description: 'There is no question that Docker has the attention of the majority of developers. It certainly makes isolating applications and their dependencies easy. Less easy and obvious is how to manage these container in a production environment. This session will be lead by a speaker that has been running docker in production since pre-1.0 days and works with dozens of companies that do the same. This session will walk through the basics of creating docker images including details of the Dockerfile. We will discuss typical Datacenter deployments of docker running in Mesos, DC/OS and Kubernetes and how the docker image system works. With that information we will then layout best practices for managing docker images. This session will include limitations of different container runtimes and how processes running in containers are managed in production, along with common failure modes.'
