description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeakers:  Michael Minella,Glenn Renfro\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/task-madness-modern-on-demand-processing\n\nThe flexibility promised by cloud computing is something that hasn't been fully available in many use cases yet. Most application models are still based on long running containers, robbing users of that very flexibility. Spring Cloud Task, a new project in the Spring portfolio provides both functional and non-functional capabilities for building short lived, cloud-native, microservices. This talk will introduce the project as well as look at example applications. Since we're in Vegas, we're going to put that on demand processing to good use by demonstrating how we used it to generate a March Madness NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament bracket. We'll review how it worked, why Spring Cloud Task was the best fit for this type of application, and how we did this past March!"
