title: 'R Blank Brings Physicality to Synthia'
recordingDate: 1282738102
description: "Filmed live at FITC San Francisco R Blank describes the process he followed to create Synthia: how he chose this specific challenge, the individual steps he took along this path, and the various sources of inspiration on which he drew when completing Synthia.\r\n\r\nSynthia hears pictures. She turns any picture into music - an infinite classical canon. She is the first publicly usable musical instrument to emerge from Project Ludi, a long-term skunkworks project at Almer/Blank Labs.\r\n\r\nFor complete event details visit fitc.ca/sanfrancisco\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the speaker visit almerblank.com or follow @rblank9 on Twitter"
