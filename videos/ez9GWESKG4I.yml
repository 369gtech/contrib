title: 'The Art of Discovering Bounded Contexts by Nick Tune'

description: "Bounded contexts are a cherished member of the microservices family, but they mean lots of different things to lots of different people. So what actually are they? How do you find them? How do you design microservices around them? In this talk you’ll learn about advanced domain-driven design techniques for finding bounded contexts, designing microservices and improving the alignment of your whole organisation.\n\nInstead of naively chopping up a system into arbitrary small pieces and calling them ‘microservices that implement bounded contexts’, or merely thinking cross-functional teams will suffice, deeper, more nuanced design skills are needed. All domains are different- there is no flowchart that guides teams into knowing exactly how to break up a large system into smaller pieces that minimise the costs of handovers and shared dependencies.\n\nStrategic domain-driven design introduced the concept of subdomains; things that change together for business reasons. Accordingly, teams that own things that change together for business reasons will own more decision making and have more autonomy. You will learn how DDD heuristics and Theory of Constraints help you to create maximum autonomy.\n\nNick Tune is passionate about delighting users, creating business impacts, and crafting quality software, placing an equal focus on improving both the delivery capabilities and alignment of an organisation. He specialises in transformation projects, having worked with a number of organisations in both the public and private sector to achieve continuous delivery. He is the co-author of Patterns, Principles and Practices of Domain-Driven Design, blogs at ntcoding.com, and is currently on a hugely-ambitious adventure with Salesforce where he is a Principal Engineer."
