recordingDate: 1509732844
description: 'Using Docker Containers, enterprises now have strong, secure-by-default primitives available for deploying apps to their infrastructure. Containers are enabling organizations to adopt better engineering practices like immutable infrastructure -- increasing deployment agility and reducing mean time to patch. Companies are thinking strategically about to securely manage their software supply chains. Moderated by Sean Michael Kerner, collaborators in Docker''s ecosystem will share how Docker Containers are revolutionizing the way apps are secured and how we can expect container security to evolve in the future.'
