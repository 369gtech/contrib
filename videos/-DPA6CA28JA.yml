The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n \nSIG Cloud Provider Intro - Fabio Rapposelli, VMware & Nick Turner, Amazon \n\nThe long-term goal of SIG Cloud Provider is to promote a vendor-neutral ecosystem for our community. New vendors providing support for Kubernetes should feel equally empowered to do so as any of todayâ€™s existing cloud providers. More importantly, SIG Cloud Provider is focused on ensuring a consistent and high-quality user experience across providers. The SIG acts as a central group for developing the Kubernetes project in a way that ensures all providers share common privileges and responsibilities. This intro session will begin with an introduction to the SIG activities in representing the collective interests of all participating cloud providers in the Kubernetes ecosystem, and help guide participants in how to become involved with SIG and to transition from specific cloud SIGs to Cloud Provider Working Groups. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaht"
