title: 'The Haggling Coding Competition - Nurit Moscovici & Yulia Stolin (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1551088058
description: "Haggling is a negotiation game, it consists of rounds of negotiation between pairs of players trying to agree on how to split a set of assets, while striving to maximize their score.\n\nIn Outbrain we used haggling as a coding challenge in the form of a hackathon, which swept up the entire R&D organization; keeping everyone playing, strategizing, coding, hacking & learning - all in two weeks of pure energy and fun. The winning team (out of 41 teams!) was interestingly comprised only of women engineers. Our secret sauce? Both in our teamwork and game strategy was - collaboration!\n\nIn this talk we'll tell you more about the haggling game, how we leveraged it as an R&D organization wide learning activity, and how we won!\n\nBio:\nNurit Moscovici, MSc cum laude from the Technion in the field of concurrent data structures for the GPU. She joined Outbrain six months ago as a Software Engineer in the Smartfeed team in a \"hybrid\" between backend and algorithmic. Before Outbrain Nurit built C++ Embedded programs and highly enjoys the challenge of transitioning to the world of big data.\n\nYulia Stolin, has more than 13 years of hands-on experience in software architecture, specializing in building high volume, scalable, high-performance, distributed data services and systems. She has deep expertise in big data, NoSQL products, software architecture and development. She has been working at Outbrain as an Architect in Recommendation Group for almost 3 years."
