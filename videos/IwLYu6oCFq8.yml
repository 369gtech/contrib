title: 'Engineering at TransferWise the story of Service Discovery (Kyrylo Novotarskyi, UK)'
recordingDate: 1486916969
description: "Rather than traditional departments, TransferWise is organised into several highly autonomous teams, each focused on solving a specific business or customer problem. It’s the very essence of a lean approach – effort invested is justified by quantifiable impact.\n\nWhy do we work this way? How did it change over time? What does this mean for engineering? How does this affect our practices and our culture?\n\nAnswer can be found in this talk."
