title: '"Ten Years of Outreachy!" - Karen Sandler (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612438991
description: "Karen Sandler\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/56/\n\nOutreachy, a diversity initiative that provides remote paid internships to work on critical free software projects, is entering the tenth year of its current incarnation! While the free software community has had to make conferences like LCA and other activities remote during the pandemic, Outreachy was poised to expand to provide much needed opportunities to people who need them most. This talk will share the origins of the program and how it has changed over the years. We'll look at what's happened with the program over the years and  feature our lessons learned.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSun Jan 24 10:45:00 2021 at Rusty R. Hall"
