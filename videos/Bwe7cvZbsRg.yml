language: English
recordingDate: 1584648794
description: "There are three common use cases for Database Vault\n\n- Enforcing a trusted path to access sensitive data\n- Controlling privileged users\n- Enforcing separation of duties\n\nThis session will focus on trusted path - creating policies that only allow access to data by sessions meeting a set of pre-approved conditions. For example: an approved list of IP addresses, running approved programs, as the approved operating system user. \n\nAs always, we'll get started with a few product announcements, then move quickly into the technical session. Database Security Second Thursday for March 2020 focuses on Database Vault, and is applicable to databases running on premises, in the Oracle Cloud, and even in third-party clouds like AWS or Azure. Database Security Product Managers Rich Evans and Alan Williams will lead this session, where we will discuss one of the most common uses cases for Database Vault.\n\nThis is the third of several use-case focused sessions on Database Vault. In our previous sessions, we focused on advanced use cases, but received several request to cover some of the more common Database Vault uses.  Trusted Path is one of the most-desired security controls, and is widely used across the Oracle customer base. If you are new to Database Vault, or even if you just haven't worked with it in a while, don't miss this session.\n\nThere are TWO identical sessions - just pick the one that works best with your schedule. As always, we start with announcements, then move into a technical presentation and then open the lines for your questions related to database security.  The sessions are recorded and the recordings are usually available a few days after the session is held.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
