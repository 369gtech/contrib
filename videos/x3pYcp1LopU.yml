description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/building-applications-with-angular-js-and-spring-security\n\nIn this presentation we show some nice features of Spring Security, Spring Boot and Angular JS working together to provide a pleasant and secure user experience. Things to consider are cookies, headers, native clients, various security vulnerabilities and how modern browser technology can help us to avoid them. In this series we show how nicely features of the component frameworks can be integrated simply to provide a pleasant and secure user experience. We start with a very basic single-server implementation and scale it up in stages, splitting out backend resources and authentication to separate services."
