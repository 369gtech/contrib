description: "From 15,000 Database Connections to under 100—A Tech Debt Tale\n\nSunny Beatteay, DigitalOcean\n\nWhenever a company scales quickly, they invariably take on technical debt. It's unavoidable. However, the existence of tech debt isn't the problem, it's how you handle it when you can't put it off any longer.\n\nIn this talk, I will be telling the story of one company's largest technical re-architecture to date. It was a company-wide effort that extended over multiple years and taught us many lessons. And it all revolved around a single, overloaded database.\n\nThis talk is geared towards mid-level engineers and up who have a solid understanding of tech debt and distributed systems. I discuss some advanced topics and show various architectural diagrams. Though beginners will likely it interesting as well.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
