description: "Emily Jiang, Liberty Architect for MicroProfile and CDI, IBM\n\nPlanning to build microservices? The best practice for building a first-class microservice is to use the 12-factor app. But how do you follow the 12-factor app rules in terms of fault tolerance and externalizing the configuration, for example? Come to this session to build a 12-factor microservice in the MicroProfile programming mode. The presentation includes a live code demo."
