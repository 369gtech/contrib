title: 'Lifelogging for insights: Applying data science to user behaviour data - Håkan Jonsson'
recordingDate: 1434640453
description: "Sony recently launched LifeLog API for application developers. Applications can now access users’ lifestyle, fitness and health data, collected through smartphone sensors and connected SmartWear devices. In this talk we will show how to derive insights from individual user’s LifeLog data using machine learning. Especially,\nwe will look at how to derive personal points of interests from location traces to make your application contextual. Scaling machine learning to millions of users, requires a different approach. We will take a look at how we at the Sony Lifelog team use Spark to scale analytics to millions of users, and how we use it to create new features for Lifelog users, through some live coding.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
