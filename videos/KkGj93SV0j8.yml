description: "Jessica Hische is a lettering artist, author, illustrator, letterpress printer, type designer, mother, procrastiworker, and a million other things. In this practical antidote to a “quit your job and do what you love” talk, she’ll explain that the key to answering the question we’ve all been asked since we were little—”What you want to be when you grow up?”—is finding out who you are in the first place.\n\nShe’ll talk through some of the tools that have worked for her, from the scientific to the witch-crafty, and how the answer to “Who am I?” is never static—it shifts and transforms over and over again as you grow, change, mature, hormonally implode, etc.\n\nJessica is a lettering artist and author living in Oakland, California. She’s had the pleasure of working for some pretty crazy clients over the years (like Wes Anderson, Starbucks, Fender Guitars, and the US Postal Service), and spends a little too much time “procrastiworking” on personal projects. She and her work have been featured in numerous design, illustration, type, and web publications, including Communication Arts, Print Magazine, Novum, Graphis, and Eye Magazine. She was named a Forbes 30 under 30, a Print “New Visual Artist”, an ADC Young Gun, and in 2018 was listed as one of Adweek’s “Creative 100”. Her first children’s book Tomorrow I’ll be Brave, is available everywhere books are sold.\n\nJessica Hische\nLettering Artist and Author, jessicahische.is/awesome\nhttps://twitter.com/jessicahische\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jessicahische\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
