description: "At the sold-out Spark & Machine Learning Meetup in Brussels on October 27, 2016, Holden Karau of the Spark Technology Center delivered a lightning talk called A very brief introduction to extending Spark ML for custom models: Talk + Demo.\n\nHolden took a look at Apache SparkML™ pipelines. Inspired by sci-kit learn, they have the potential to make machine learning tasks much easier. This talk looked at how to extend Spark ML with custom model types when the built-in options don't meet your needs.\n\nFor more information about the Spark Technology Center: http://www.spark.tc/\n\nFollow us: @apachespark_tc\nLocation: San Francisco, CA\n\nApache®, Apache Spark™, and Spark™ are trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation in the United States and/or other countries."
