description: "David is a family man first...an enthusiastic husband of 12 years and a proud father of three energetic boys; Lyric, Londyn and Lennyx. When I'm not spending time with the family, I thrive on all things technology. I love giving back to the developer community and knowledge sharing. I've recently become an international speaker and Microsoft MVP. When time permits you can find me sharing ideas on Twitter, blogging about various technologies and contributing to open-source projects.\n\n\nGitHub : https://github.com/ievangelist\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/davidpine7\nStack Overflow : https://stackoverflow.com/users/2410379/david-pine\nBlog : https://davidpine.net/\nLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpine/\nMVP Profile : https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002736\nDotNetCurry : http://www.dotnetcurry.com/author/david-pine\nMedium : https://medium.com/@davidpine7"
