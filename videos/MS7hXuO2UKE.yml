language: English
recordingDate: 1415988945
description: "This is an explanatory video to accompany the last Computerphile entitled 'Free Software' which had a couple of technical problems. This is not a tutorial, nor is it a recommendation, it is the story of Sean trying to make a Computerphile video with GNU free software.\n\nFree Software -made with free software: http://youtu.be/jaJ7vUu1ixg \nFree Software -made with proprietary software: http://youtu.be/nXYly_wnAT4 \nAnimated GIFs & Space & Time: http://youtu.be/blSzwPcL5Dw \n\np.s. The continuity is all over the place as I filmed some of this while in the process of making the last film and some of it after the film was published â€“ watch my beard miraculously grow and be shaved & grow again as the film goes on, see night become day and day become night... Also I'd be interested to see if you're reading this whether you've decoded the binary in the GIMP-created graphics yet? -Sean\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
