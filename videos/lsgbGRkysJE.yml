description: "Thanks to our Community Sponsors: Honeycomb.io and CircleCI.com\n\nSpeakers: Jai Chakrabarti (Director of Engineering, Core Infrastructure, Spotify), Bryan Liles (Senior Staff Engineer, VMWare), Dan Berry (Lead iOS Engineer, Big Nerd Ranch), Erica Stanley (Senior Research Engineering Manager, Mozilla).\n\nIf you think back to the work you were doing last year, it probably feels miles away - and that’s great! As engineers, we’re continually building and creating great new stuff - it’s what we do.\n\nBut as the stuff that we build gets more complex, the foundations that it’s sitting on can struggle to support it. And rebuilding these systems is a complex process that requires a lot of effort - but almost always necessary for the overall health of your business and to keep down maintenance costs.\n\nIn this panel, we’ll take a look at the main challenges that you’ll face when rebuilding software systems, deciding between partial and total rebuilds, and how to reduce the risks of things going wrong along the way."
