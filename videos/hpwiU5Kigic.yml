It's on everyone's lips, but no one knows what the hell to do about it.\" You don't have to look very far to find examples that prove his point.\n\nOver the last year, Jason Grigsby has been collecting examples of where companies are making mistakes when it comes to their mobile strategies and desperately seeking examples of those who get it.\n\nIn this presentation, Jason will talk about the DOs and DONTs of mobile strategy.\n\nLearn from both the outstanding success and cringe-worthy failures of others as you begin to formulate your plans for navigating the mobile landscape.\n\nFinally, we'll look at methods for evaluating mobile strategies based on demographics, mobile context, and the unique characteristics of mobile devices.\n\nJason Grigsby was one of the project leads on the Obama iPhone Application and helped design the user inferface for the Wall Street Journal's Blackberry application. He founded and organizes Mobile Portland, a local mobile group.\n\nJason is a co-founder of Cloud Four, a small start-up focused on mobile and web development.
