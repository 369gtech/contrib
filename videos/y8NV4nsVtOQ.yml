description: "http://oreilly.com/go/suits-dc14\n\nMulti-national corporations based in the U.S. and elsewhere are all struggling to find a way to safely conduct commerce in an inter-connected world that is fast becoming a digital battleground. Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) and their security teams must deal with insiders, hacktivists, mercenary hacker crews, weaknesses in their supply chain, and state-run network attacks, espionage activities and surveillance. The focus of Suits and Spooks DC is to address the challenge of how corporations can identify their threats, assess their risks, and profitably operate in a globally hostile environment."
