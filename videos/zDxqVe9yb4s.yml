description: "by Adrian Reber\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.118/openhpc.webm\n\n\nHigh performance computing (HPC) - the aggregation of computers into clusters to increase computing speed and power- relies heavily on the software that connects and manages the various nodes in the cluster. Linux is the dominant HPC operating system, and many HPC sites expand upon the operating system's capabilities with different scientific applications, libraries, and other tools. \n\nTo avoid duplication of the necessary steps to run an HPC site the OpenHPC project was created in response to these issues. OpenHPC is a collaborative, community-based effort under the auspices of the Linux Foundation to solve common tasks in HPC environments by providing documentation and building blocks that can be combined by HPC sites according to their needs. \n\nIn this talk I want to give an introduction about the OpenHPC project. Why do we need something like OpenHPC? What are the goals of OpenHPC? Who is involved in OpenHPC and how is the project organized?\nWhat is the actual result of the OpenHPC project? \n\nIt also has been some time (it was FOSDEM 2016) since OpenHPC was part of the HPC, Big Data and Data Science devroom, so that it seems a good opportunity for an OpenHPC status update and what has happened in the last three years. In addition to previous mentioned topics I would also like to give an outlook about upcoming releases and plans for the future. \n\nRoom: UA2.118 (Henriot)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:50:00+01"
