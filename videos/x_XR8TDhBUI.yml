description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v\n\nGet involved in the next Code Sync conference - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nADOPTING ERLANG, ADAPTING REBAR\nby Fred Hebert, Tristan Sloughter\n\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this presentation we'll cover the cycle that brought us from writing Adopting Erlang from the perspective of a new team that has read one of the many books out there about Erlang. We aimed to guide them to applied practice in a development team. In writing this, we found multiple issues that had accrued with time and shifting best practices in the community. These issues became encoded into our toolset.\nThrough maintaining Rebar3, Relx, documentation, and as participants of EEF working groups, we were part of a long feedback loop in the ecosystem. We'll go over the new changes this has led us to make to improve our tooling with very limited backwards compatibility breakage, and how they should improve your life.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/fred-hebert/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - FRED HEBERT\nErlang, Tools, and Systems (Postmates)\n\nFred is the author of Learn You Some Erlang, Erlang in Anger, and more recently, Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and Elixir.

While at Heroku, Tristan, along with Fred, started the build tool Rebar3 after seeing the struggles involved in onboarding new developers to Erlang projects. He is also a maintainer of the release tool Relx and creator of the website How I Start(https://howistart.org/) which collects articles for various languages from experienced developers on how they setup a new project and take it to completion.\n\nMore on Tristan Sloughter: https://codesync.global/speaker/tristan-sloughter/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM V 2020\nCode BEAM V is powered by Code Sync.
