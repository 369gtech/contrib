description: "Speaker: David Gouldin\n\nTimezones are one of those things every programmer loves to hate. Most of us, at\nleast in the US, just try to ignore them and hope nobody notices. Then twice a\nyear, we fear with impending doom those 3 small words: Daylight Saving Time.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. Armed with some best practices and a little help\nfrom supporting libraries, timezone-related bugs can be a thing of the past.\n\nThis talk explores standard library and 3rd party library timezone support, as\nwell as persistence and serialization techniques for timezone-aware datetimes.\nBy the end of the talk, the listener should feel confident in their ability to\ncorrectly store, send, receive, and manipulate datetime objects in any timezone.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
