description: "Why Great Leaders Must Unlearn to Succeed in Today’s Exponential world\n\nEffective leadership comes with a large learning curve. In today’s rapidly-evolving business climate, this is more true than ever for seasoned leaders and entrepreneurs alike.\nMany leaders rely too heavily on past achievements, practices, and ways of thinking to drive positive business results today, but they often need to unlearn those behaviors before they can take a step forward.\nJoin executive coach Barry O’Reilly as he breaks down a transformative framework that shows leaders how to rethink their strategies, retool their capabilities, and revitalize their businesses for stronger, longer-lasting success.\n\nBarry O’Reilly is a business advisor, entrepreneur, and author who has pioneered the intersection of business model innovation, product development, organizational design, and culture transformation.\n\nBarry works with business leaders and teams from global organizations that seek to invent the future, not fear it. Every day, Barry works with many of the world’s leading companies to break the vicious cycles that spiral businesses toward death by enabling experimentation and learning to unlock the insights required for better decision making and higher performance and results.\n\nBarry is co-author of the international bestseller Lean Enterprise: How High Performance Organizations Innovate at Scale—included in the Eric Ries Lean series, and a Harvard Business Review must read for CEOs and business leaders. He is an internationally sought-after speaker, frequent writer and contributor to The Economist, Strategy+Business, and MIT Sloan Management Review.\n\nBarry is Faculty at Singularity University, advising and coaching on Singularity’s executive and accelerator programs based in San Francisco, and throughout the globe.\n\nBarry is also founder and CEO of ExecCamp, the entrepreneurial experience for executives, and management consultancy Antennae.\n\nHis mission is to help purposeful technology-led businesses innovate at scale.\n\nFor more on YOW!
