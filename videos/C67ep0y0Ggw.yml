title: 'GeeCON Prague 2019: Konrad Kami≈Ñski - Kotlin Native 101'
recordingDate: 1574262736
description: 'Can you create native apps with Kotlin? Yes, you can! Kotlin Native allows you to do just that. But if you used Kotlin on JVM then you''ll find quite a few surprises when going native. You''ll encounter a different concurrency model. You''ll see that memory management is also changed. You''ll have to find a way to interoperate with some C/Objective-C code to do something useful. In this talk we''ll go for a tour of Kotlin Native features, which in the end allow you to create safe, robust native applications for a plethora of platforms: Linux (even on Raspberry Pi!), MacOS, iOS, WebAssembly and even some embedded systems.'
