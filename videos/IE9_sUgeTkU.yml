description: "Everyone know that security is important right? The biggest companies like Facebook and Google spend tons of money on bug bounty programs to ensure that their products are secure. But is there a way that we can make our website prone to some of the most popular attacks? There is one security mechanism which can help, but yet not everyone knows and uses it. It’s called Content Security Policy. When properly used, CSP can make your website impenetrable to XSS and many different attacks. My talk will tell you what CSP is, how it works and how to use it. The talk will be backed by real-life examples and some live coding!\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/kacper-sokolowski/"
