language: English
recordingDate: 1635874648
description: "In a world relying increasingly on remote work, we still need to envision new business models, explore our business processes and design our software systems. While nothing can replace the in-person collaboration of an EventStorming session, remote tools bring their own exciting upsides.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns, the international DDD community has experimented and distilled a collection of remote modelling methods. In this session, we will dive into some interesting trade-offs of remote modelling, and work together to find amazing new tools that carry us into the future.\n\nWatch thousands more tech-related talks in our SkillsCast library at https://skillsmatter.com/skillscastsâ€‹"
