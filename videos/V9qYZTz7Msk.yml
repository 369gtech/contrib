description: "Intro: Kubernetes (AWS) SIG - Justin Santa Barbara, Google \n\nsig-aws is responsible for the interfaces between kubernetes and AWS. The kubernetes project is itself increasingly moving momentum outside of the main kubernetes/kubernetes repository into subprojects. sig-aws is one of the leaders here, with 5 subprojects at the start of the year (broadly: cloudprovider, ALB, IAM, encryption, EBS) and likely at least one new one by Barcelona (EFS, FSx). We'll also discuss the cloudprovider extraction and our collaboration with sig-cloudprovider. We'll provide an update on the progress of those subprojects and discuss the future plans and roadmap together. And if you want to, we can describe how to get involved in these projects! \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPhs"
