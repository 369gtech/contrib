This talk collects a set of outrageous stunts and maybe-controversial defying acts I have seen and sometimes made in production, that can give the Erlang Virtual Machine that extra speed or memory edge on different scenarios.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/miriam-pena/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MIRIAM PENA\nOpen source mero, a scalable and lightweight client for Memcached and Spillway for load shedding.\n\nMiriam loves to architect scalable, high performance, high concurrency, and high availability systems. Bonus point if they are written in Erlang/Elixir. She is a Staff Engineer at AdRoll, designing critical parts of their AdServers infrastructure and organizer of the Erlang and Elixir meetup in San Francisco. Prior to AdRoll, she provided Erlang specialized consultancy and studied Computer Science Engineering from La Coru√±a University in Spain. Voted one of the women to watch in 2018 by Women 2.0 here.\n\nMore on Miriam Pena: https://codesync.global/speaker/miriam-pena/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
