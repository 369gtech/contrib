description: "Do we need servers? Do we need to know what our apps are using for their execution? When we first started thinking of generic problem-solving machines, the goal was not about the implementation. It was about gaining speed and control. Over time, we replaced gears with vacuum tubes, transistors with silicon chips. With quantum computers we are going to move from “bits” to “qubits”.\n\nCustomers told us what they wanted to minimize while building applications, and the architectural patterns they were repeating. “It's all about the code, the app, the functions”, so we worked backward from there and serverless computing came along."
