description: "This event follows along the DevOps Learning Path. A learning path is a carefully curated set of technical sessions that provide a view into a particular area of Azure; and often help you prepare for a certification. Each session in a learning path is business-scenario focused so you can see how this technology could be used in the real world. Each session is independent, however viewing them as a series builds a clearer picture of when and how to use which technology.\n\nThe DevOps Learning Path is designed for those who develop and operate software and need to increase collaboration, performance, and reliability. The content is comprised of 5 modules that approach topics ranging from getting started with DevOps, to delivering change, to operating software in the cloud. \n\nEach session includes a curated selection of associated modules from Microsoft Learn that can provide an interactive learning experience for the topics covered and may also contribute toward preparedness for the official AZ-400 Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions Certification."
