description: "Configuring a More Secure BOSH [I] - Saman Alvi & Dale Wick, Pivotal\n\nAs BOSH evolves, grows, and improves, it allows you to focus on making your deployments more secure. The addition of config server allows you to generate, store, and update credentials easily and securely for your deployments. It also allows you to share credentials between deployments, as it is possible to have hundreds for all components to talk to each other. It will also help prevent poor credential choices, which can create security breaches. This talk will go into details about how config server works, how credential generation and storage is handled, and how you can use the reference implementation to choose your own credential generation and storage strategy.\n\nAbout Saman Alvi\nSaman Alvi - Saman is a core project contributor on the BOSH team, and has spoken at the Toronto Cloud Foundry meetup events as an advocate of everything BOSH.\n\nAbout Dale Wick\nWith over 20 years of industry experience, Dale Wick has a wide range of experience with app deployment in the cloud. He was a pioneer of the large deployment with several hand rolled Debian, Red Hat and Ubuntu distributions as elements of distributed systems for customers such as Best Buy, Kodak, Fuji Film and Sears. An advocate of industry advancement through standards adoption he has participated in several standards initiatives including the IETF standard for the Internet Printing Protocol. Today he works on the open source BOSH project for Pivotal, which greatly simplifies reliable, scaleable, software deployment orchestration.Dale has spoken regularly on a variety of programming and operations techniques including system architecture and Java techniques at the Toronto Programmer SIG, mobile user interface design at Canadian Computing show, game design at Toronto Skill Swap and user experience and programming deep dives at AdamCon."
