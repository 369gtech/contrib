description: "Get the Awesome Code: http://goo.gl/qplBS\n\nIn this part of my code refactoring tutorial, I'll show you how to replace conditionals with the command pattern. I'm also going to do more though.\n\nI'll also review what the command pattern is. I'll give an example of when you should use it. We'll look at how to add flexibility with it. I'll answer your questions based on the refactoring to patterns book. And, we'll look at how to store commands in an ArrayList."
