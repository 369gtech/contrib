description: "Concurrency + Distribution = Scalability + Availability, a Journey architecting Erlang Systems - Francesco Cesarini\n\n\nSlides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/berlin2015/francesco-cesarini\n\nErlang/OTP has for years been described as your secret sauce to writing scalable and available systems. Erlang alone, however, will not do any magic. It is merely an enabler that, thanks to its semantics, programming model and predictable virtual machine makes the end results easier to achieve. In this talk, Francesco will walk through the topology patterns of modern distributed Erlang architectures, discussing the tradeoffs in scalability and reliability the actor model, the failure model and the built-in distribution model encourage you to take.\n\nAbout Francesco\n\nFrancesco Cesarini is the founder of Erlang Solutions Ltd. He has used Erlang on a daily basis since 1995, starting as an intern at Ericsson’s computer science laboratory, the birthplace of Erlang. He moved on to Ericsson’s Erlang training and consulting arm working on the first release of OTP, applying it to turnkey solutions and flagship telecom applications. In 1999, soon after Erlang was released as open source, he founded Erlang Solutions, who have become the world leaders in Erlang based consulting, contracting, training and systems development. Francesco has worked in major Erlang based projects both within and outside Ericsson, and as Technical Director, has led the development and consulting teams at Erlang Solutions. He is also the co-author of Erlang Programming, a book recently published by O’Reilly and lectures at Oxford University."
