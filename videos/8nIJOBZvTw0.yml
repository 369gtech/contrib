description: "http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2014/kevin-wright\n\nKevin is an engineer, a programmer and an active contributor to the Open Source community, though much less since becoming a father of two. Occasionally outspoken, he was an early adopter of Scala from before it was cool, and remains a proud advocate of the language."
