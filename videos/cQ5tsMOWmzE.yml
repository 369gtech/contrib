title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: Enterprise Data Workflows with Cascading'
recordingDate: 1385501477
description: "In this hands-on webcast presented by Paco Nathan author of Enterprise Data Workflows with Cascading, he will discuss what defines a \"workflow\", in contrast to notions of \"dataflow\" and the impact that has on the tools required.\n\nOverall, we're talking about middleware for Big Data — how to integrate Hadoop along with other data frameworks to build applications at scale.\n\nPaco will compare and contrast some workflow platforms such as:\n\n- Actian's ParAccel (based on open source Knime and Eclipse)\n- Continuum Analytics (Anaconda platform for Enterprise-grade Python which is gaining traction based on IPython Notebook\n- Pandas, Scikit-Lear\n\nWe will also discuss some popular tools that do not fit in this category (are not for workflows) but are commonly confused as such: Apache Pig and Apache Hive in particular. Understanding where those do or don't fit is helpful. Within the context of Cascading, there are also the Scala community (Scalding) and the Clojure community (Cascalog) — which account for most of the new production deployments. Paco will compare and contract both of these as well.\n\nAbout Paco Nathan\n\nPaco Nathan is a Data Scientist at Concurrent, Inc., and heads up the developer outreach program there.
