description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nThe Least Privilege of Kubernetes - Kaizhe Huang, Sysdig \n\nThe principle of least privilege states that each component of the ecosystem should have minimal access to data and resources for it to function In this presentation, we will first introduce the principle of least privilege. Given the complexity of Kubernetes, we will first look into the Kubernetes subjects and privileges grant. Then we will talk about privileges of Kubernetes workload and the possible ways to restrict them. The goal of this presentation is to help audience understand a few critical concepts: the principle of least privilege, role based access control(RBAC), different Kubernetes objects like namespaces, service accounts, roles and role bindings which can be used to implement the principle of least privilege of Kubernetes subjects, as well as security mechanism like Security Context, PodSecurityPolicy, NetworkPolicy for Kubernetes workload.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp9U"
