description: 'Talk consists of 3 parts. Part 1 gives answer to topic''s question from "theory" which is actually from the Scrum Guide + little insight into Agile Coaching. Part 2 presents my research across the world about what people say is a Scrum Master. Part 3 presents my path to this role and experience in it. At the end, I give tips to current or future Scrum Masters from my own experience.'
