title: 'Jupyter widgets- Maarten Breddels (Maarten Breddels), Sylvain Corlay (QuantStack)'
language: English

description: "Project Jupyter aims to provide a consistent set of tools for data science workflows, from the exploratory phase of the analysis to the sharing of the results. Maarten Breddels and Sylvain Corlay offer an overview of Jupyter’s interactive widgets framework, which enables rich user interaction, including 2D and 3D interactive plotting, geographic data visualization, and much more, as well as the main interactive visualization libraries that were built upon it.\n\nMore than a set of controls, Jupyter widgets are a framework upon which one can build. Just as the kernel protocol is agnostic to the programming language, Jupyter widgets enable bidirectional communication between the web browser and the kernel in a language-agnostic fashion. Beyond the Python reference implementation, C++, R, and JVM languages (Java, Clojure, Scala, Kotlin, and Groovy) have joined this exciting development, allowing users to reuse all the frontend code.\n\nJoin Maarten and Sylvain to explore the capabilities of the framework, from the simplest example with a slider control to building an animated virtual reality 3D data visualization that can be run on your mobile phone or tablet. You’ll also learn how to embed the widgets on web pages outside of the Jupyter Notebook, such as a Flask web server, and dive into the latest developments by the Jupyter team, including the JupyterLab integration and support for other languages.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
