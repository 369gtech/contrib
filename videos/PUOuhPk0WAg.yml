Ray's a Developer Advocate at Google and he travels a lot, often needs to build Docker images on the airplane, in coffee shops, or in hotels with unpredictable Wi-Fi. Learn how Ray adapted to working with large Docker images over slow Wi-Fi by utilizing Docker Machine in the cloud, and a bunch of tips and tricks!\n\nThis strategy also saved Ray from numerous demoes - he once demoed Docker containers and Kubernetes by tethering to his colleagues' phone connection.\n\nIn this session, you'll learn about: - Docker Machine in the cloud - How to reduce your local bandwidth needs when building an image - How to use Docker ONBUILD - Sharing data between local laptop and a remote Docker machine - Strategy w/ ENTRYPOINT and STDIN/STDOUT - Working w/ Kubernetes - Reducing layer sizes\n\nRay is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform.
