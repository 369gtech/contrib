title: Designing a DSL in Kotlin

description: Kotlin is one of those 'new' JVM languages that are currently rocking
  the boat. Although it’s made a great impact on Android, it’s equally good on the
  server side. As Domain-Specific Languages are constrained by the language they run
  on, Kotlin frees developers from Java fluent builders to propose something better.
  Taking the example of a Vaadin UI DSL, I’ll demo how one could design its own DSL
  with Kotlin.
