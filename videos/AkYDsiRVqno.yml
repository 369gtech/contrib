description: 'We’ve all seen them: Ambitious projects, starting out with grand visions, ending up as costly lessons in what not to do, leaving behind the ruins of promising paradigms, technologies, tools, and careers. But why do architecture approaches sometimes hurt instead of providing value? Why has “software architect” become a negative term for some people? And what can we do to improve our own work? We’ll look at some of the most common pitfalls that ensure you’ll come up with a disaster, and discuss how they can be avoided. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/craft'
