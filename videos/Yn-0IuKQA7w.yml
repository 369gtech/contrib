description: "This sessionâ€™s speakers have developed two apps that do the same thing. One was built with Grails and the other with Play Framework. The presentation walks through the differences between the two frameworks in the context of the real-world  UberTracks  application. You will learn about the frameworks and their differences, including performance, lines of code, scalability, and ecosystems.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMatt Raible\nMatt Raible has been building web applications for most of his adult life. He started tinkering with the web before Netscape 1.0 was even released. For the last 15 years, Matt has helped companies adopt open source technologies (Spring, Hibernate, Apache, Struts, Tapestry, Grails) and use them effectively. Matt has been a speaker at many conferences worldwide, including ApacheCon, JavaZone, Colorado Software Summit, No Fluff Just Stuff, and a host of others.\n\nMatt is an author (Spring Live and Pro JSP), and \"kick-ass technology\" evangelist on http://raibledesigns.com. He is the founder of AppFuse, a project which allows you to get started quickly with Java frameworks, as well as a committer on the Apache Roller and Apache Struts projects.\n\nMatt has had quite a ride in the past several years, serving as the Lead UI Architect for LinkedIn, the UI Architect for Evite.com, Chief Architect of Web Development at Time Warner Cable and a UI Architect for HTML5 apps at Taleo/Oracle. \nView more trainings by Matt Raible at https://www.parleys.com/author/matt-raible\n\nJames Ward\nJames Ward is a Technical Evangelist for Flex at Adobe and Adobe's JCP representative to JSR 286, 299, and 301. Much like his love for climbing mountains he enjoys programming because it provides endless new discoveries, elegant workarounds, summits and valleys. His adventures in climbing have taken him many places. Likewise, technology has brought him many adventures, including: Pascal and Assembly back in the early 90's; Perl, HTML, and JavaScript in the mid 90's; then Java and many of it's frameworks beginning in the late 90's. Today he primarily uses Flex to build beautiful front-ends for Java based back-ends. Prior to Adobe, James built a rich marketing and customer service portal for Pillar Data Systems.\nView more trainings by James Ward at https://www.parleys.com/author/james-ward\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
