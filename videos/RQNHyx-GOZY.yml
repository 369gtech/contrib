description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nShaping the Future of Cloud Native Infrastructure at the Age of AI, 5G and Edge - Ying Xiong, Futurewei \n\nThe combination of next generation AI and 5G applications poses major challenges for cloud infrastructure platform to support low latency and high scalability requirements of future cloud workloads. The convergence of Edge with the Cloud is driving the innovation of cloud platform architecture for unified management and large scale geographic deployment across data center and edge infrastructure. In this talk, we introduce a new open source project that provides a highly scalable and truly multi-tenant cloud native infrastructure to build next generation public and/or private cloud. We will present two open source components - Arktos, the large scale and partitioned compute cluster with unified management of cloud resource and workload including VMs and container, and Mizar, the high performance and low latency cloud networking solution that leverages advanced network technologies such as XDP/eBPF and Geneva protocol. Together, Arktos and Mizar deliver a new generation of cloud platform aiming to meet the challenges in the age of AI, 5G and Edge. In this talk, we will also give the use case of autonomous driving that can benefit from the new open source project. \n\nhttps://sched.co/dINS"
