description: "Hybrid. Unicorn. Polymath. Renaissance (wo)man. Multidisciplinary. Multipotentialite. Generalist. T-shaped. Full-stack employee… Those are just some of the terms used to describe a person whose interests are widely diverse, skills seemingly unrelated, and career paths non-linear.\n\nIt sounds glamorous to be multi-skilled and appealing for employers to get a 2-for-1 deal. Hybrid jobs like “Design-Developer”, “Full-stack Engineer”, or “Product Manager” have been growing in demand but, in reality, most workplaces still aren’t optimized for a diverse workforce.\n\nBeing a hybrid can also take a psychological toll on the individual: anxiety, FOMO, feeling like you don’t belong, pressure to take on everything yourself, and/or dissatisfaction with career options.\n\nWhen you’re a jack of all trades, do you feel like a master of none? If you manage a company or team, how can you best foster hybrids in the workplace? In this panel, they’ll discuss these questions and more.\n\nSteve Truong\nhttps://twitter.com/estebanated\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
