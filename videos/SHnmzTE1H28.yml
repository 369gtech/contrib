description: "All around the world, governments are poised to implement new laws and regulations that will shape the Internet and technology in general in huge ways. Whether you’re an independent developer, startup, or an established company, tech policy decisions made in places like Brussels or Washington D.C. actually have a big impact on what you do every day. Yet navigating these proposals can be confusing, time-consuming, and full of legalese.\n\nWe’re here to help! In this session hosted by Google’s Public Policy team, you’ll get a behind-the-scenes look at the year so far, and hear about what we’re seeing coming down the road in the world of technology law and regulation. We cover some of the biggest issues making headlines, including privacy, the future of the app economy, and more. We also share the resources Google has available to help developers learn more and get involved. \n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
