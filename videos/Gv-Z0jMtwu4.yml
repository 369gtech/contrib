title: 'Talk to your home! by Joost den Boer'

description: "OpenHab is a free open-source framework to automate your home. With probably over 100 bindings available for OpenHab, you probably already own something you could automate with OpenHab. My own home is automated using KNX, but it is also connected to OpenHab for a simple UI and as a continuous playground. In this quicky I’ll show how easy it is to control your OpenHab installation via Siri. [Sorry Android-ers, the Google Voice API is not open yet, so this is (at the writing of this paper) not possible yet with Google Voice.] With a few small steps it is possible to control your home with some basic commands, but you can also ask your home for the status of things like the temperature in the living room. I’ll demonstrate live controlling my home from the Devoxx stage.\n\nJoost den Boer\nAs an early Java adopter, Joost has 20 years of experience in building and designing Java applications at different companies. He likes to learn about new ’stuff’; Scala, NoSQL like Mongo, Cassandra and Neo4j, Hadoop, Microservices, Containers, Functional Programming, Akka. He want to know about it all. Having made his home 'IoT ready’ already 2 years ago, he is constantly looking for new ways to extend his home automation.\n\nAfter working at several companies, Joost is started working as a contractor in 2009 and has worked as such at companies like the Dutch National Bank, Bol.com, Marktplaats and currently at Philips Lighting. He is also organiser of both the Brabant-Scala and the '073 Developers BeerChat’ meetup groups.\n\n[JHR-5766]"
