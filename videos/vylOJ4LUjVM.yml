description: "by Karsten Thoms\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/language_server_protocol_2019.webm\n\n\nIn this session I will demonstrate how we implemented a language server for the Solidity language, the language for smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain. The language development is based on Eclipse Xtext, which implements the Language Server Protocol (LSP). By doing so, we were able to deliver Solidity tooling for multiple IDEs at once. I will show the Solidity integration for Eclipse, VSCode and Theia, and give some understanding about the LSP. Further I will show the development of smart contracts with the means of statemachines with the integration of Solidity into the Yakindu Statechart Tools. \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 11:25:00+01"
