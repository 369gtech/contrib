description: "Google Tech Talk\nFebruary 9, 2015\n(more info below)\nPresented by Michael Stapelberg\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn this tech talk, I will present RobustIRC, an IRC server built as a distributed system on top of Raft (a simpler alternative to Paxos), written in Go. Due to its distributed nature and a transport protocol that can take a failing TCP connection, netsplits are a thing of the past in RobustIRC.\n\nThat all said, as the name implies, RobustIRC is usable with plain old IRC clients such as irssi, WeeChat, …\n\nI’ll also cover RobustIRC’s scalability properties and what the limitations are.\n\nTarget audience is anyone who has ever used IRC (or is interested in distributed systems), probably especially SREs due to their inexplicable preference for IRC over other chat protocols ;)."
