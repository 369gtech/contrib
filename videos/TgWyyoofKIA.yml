description: "You can have a killer style guide website, a great-looking Sketch library, and robust documentation, but if your design system isn't actually powering real software products, all that effort is for naught. At the heart of a successful design system is a collection of sturdy, robust front-end components that powers other applications' user interfaces. This talk covers what's involved in establishing a technical architecture for your design system, including front-end workshop environments, CSS architecture, implementing design tokens, popular libraries like React and Vue.js, deploying design systems, managing updates, and more.\n\nResources: http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-technical-side-of-design-systems-at-css-day-in-amsterdam/\nAbout Brad: http://bradfrost.com\nGet his book, Atomic Design: http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com\nFollow Brad: https://twitter.com/brad_frost\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
