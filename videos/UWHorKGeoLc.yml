description: "Andres Almiray\nPrincipal Consultant\nTrivadis AG\n\nDevelopers are used to automating as much as they can. The Oracle Cloud offers a wide range of APIs you can choose from, particularly for a Java developer's point of view the Oracle Cloud Java API is well suited for enabling additional capabilities as plugins to well known build tools such as Gradle and Maven, as well as Java IDEs. In this session we'll discover what this API is, what capabilities it offers for querying, searching, and deploying to the Oracle Cloud, and finally a live example of build tools in action."
