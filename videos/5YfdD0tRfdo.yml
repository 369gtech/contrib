title: 'Let’s Talk About Mental Health - Arthur Doler'
recordingDate: 1550654771
description: "It’s a great time to be in technology. And yet despite the almost constant improvement in our tools, we somehow don’t spend time talking about how to maintain our most important tool - the one between our ears.\n\nConstantly feeling worn down, experiencing anxiety over making decisions, and burning out are *not* just facts of a developer’s life! They’re challenges that can be dealt with. In this talk we’ll cover the most common mental health challenges facing developers, and then learn about some techniques to supercharge your brain by improving your mental hygiene (whether you have a psychological disorder or not). Most importantly, you’ll learn how to have a conversation with your coworkers (and other people in your life) about supporting each other and finding your best selves.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
