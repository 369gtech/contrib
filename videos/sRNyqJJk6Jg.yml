title: 'YOW! Perth 2019 - Gregor Hohpe - Architects live in the first derivative'
recordingDate: 1571115493
description: "No organization ever complained that their IT department was delivering too fast. However, as technologies evolve ever more quickly and product cycle times keep shorting, it’s difficult for any development team or IT organization to be fast enough.\n\nAs these organizations try many things to move faster, from adopting Lean and Devops approaches, moving to the cloud, to working weekends or paying bigger bonuses. Slowly many of them realize that increasing velocity is about more than just moving a bit faster. It takes a fundamentally different mindset – one that looks at the first derivative.\n\nThis talk takes a fresh look why moving faster isn’t just about speeding things up and dissects both systems and organizational architectures that are built for economies of speed.\n\nGregor is a recognized thought leader on asynchronous messaging and service-oriented architectures. He is widely known as co-author of the seminal book “Enterprise Integration Patterns” and as frequent speaker at conferences around the world. He is an active member of the IEEE Software editorial advisory board.\n\nHe has documented his experience as an architect driving IT transformation in the eBook \"37 Things One Architect Knows\".\n\nFor more on YOW!
