description: "As the web has evolved, applications have pushed the management of state to the front-end. This wasn’t a problem when there was little state to manage but front-end applications kept growing in size and thus had more state to manage. In today’s world of server side push and asynchronous module definition, how do you manage state without turning it into your enemy?\n\nDrawing on his experience building cutting-edge applications for the past 15 years, Tasveer will take the audience on a journey to explore how state is managed on the front-end. He will overview how different front-end architectures manage various different types of state so that audience members can discover new techniques to manage state in their applications.\n\nTasveer Singh\ntazsingh.com\nhttps://twitter.com/tazsingh\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
