description: "ðŸ”¥Edureka Hadoop Training: https://www.edureka.co/big-data-hadoop-training-certification\nThis Edureka LIVE session analyses the impact of the lockdown on the spread of COVID 19 using Big Data Analytics in real-time. ( Part 1 - https://youtu.be/7liA2VWzCQA ) The objective is to examine whether imposing lockdown was the right decision. This tutorial will also be discussing significant tools and concepts of Big Data through the course of this demonstration. \nFollowing are the questions answered in this analysis:\nWhat variation and trends do you observe in the number of COVID-19 cases on comparing the countries which imposed a complete lockdown?\n\nWhat could be the number of cases in the US if lockdown was implemented at an earlier stage of spreading COVID-19? \n\nWhich Indian States should further exercise lockdowns?  \n\nCheck our complete Hadoop playlist here: https://goo.gl/hzUO0m\nCheck our complete Hadoop Blog List here: https://bit.ly/2wyIwoH\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nðŸ”´Subscribe to our channel to get video updates.
