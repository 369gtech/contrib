It also powers new capabilities like observability which enables developers and operations teams to get more complete insights into applications and infrastructure.  Despite OpenTelemetry’s advantages, it is a piece of the larger observability puzzle.  This session will discuss how you can augment OpenTelemetry with automation, analytics and AI to identify and resolve problems faster.  The session will center on a demo where we will highlight a real-world case study and focus on the challenges associated with large scale and complex environments.  We will show how you can gain deep insights into root cause analysis with a few clicks using OpenTelemetry data."
