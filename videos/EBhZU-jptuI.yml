title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: Scaling Out CouchDB with BigCouch'
language: English
recordingDate: 1288289709
description: 'Presented by: Adam Kocoloski. A common complaint raised by CouchDB skeptics is that "it doesn''t scale," by which they mean it does not scale horizontally across many servers. This feature is necessary if CouchDB is to be used for Big Data problems. Cloudant has recently released BigCouch, its native horizontal scalability layer for CouchDB, as an open source project. BigCouch allows you to create clusters of CouchDBs that are distributed over an arbitrary number of servers. This talk covers the basics of BigCouch, including deploying and managing your first CouchDB cluster, as well as some advanced features like quorum reads/writes and design patterns for distributed couchdb. Finally, for the erlang hackers out there, we discuss the internals of BigCouch, which will hopefully allow you to start contributing back to the project.'
