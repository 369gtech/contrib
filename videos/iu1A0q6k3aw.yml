title: 'Introduction to GPU Programming with CUDA and Thrust'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634493620
description: "High-performance computing is now dominated by general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) oriented computations. How can we leverage our knowledge of C++ to program the GPU?\n\nNVIDIA's answer to general-purpose computing on the GPU is CUDA. CUDA programs are essentially C++ programs, but have some differences. CUDA comes as a Toolkit SDK containing a number of libraries that exploit the resources of the GPU: fast Fourier transforms, machine learning training and inference, etc. Thrust is a C++ template library for CUDA.\n\nIn this month's meeting, Richard Thomson will present a brief introduction to CUDA with the Thrust library to program the GPU.\n\nProgramming the GPU with CUDA is a huge topic covered by lots of libraries, tutorials, videos, and so-on, so we will only be able to present an introduction to the topic. You are encouraged to explore more on your own!\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
