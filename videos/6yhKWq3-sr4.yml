title: '"smbcmp: A new tool to diff network captures" - Aurélien Aptel (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579268621
description: "Aurélien Aptel\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/35/\n\nWhile debugging network protocol issues we often have to look at network captures. Wireshark is an excellent tool to make and analyze network captures which we rely on. A common scenario is to compare a capture of a \"working\" case and a \"failing\" case, possibly made by different client/server implementation.\r\nBut when you are looking at hundreds of packets holding hundreds of fields it quickly becomes problematic.\r\n\r\nTo help with this problem I have come up with a new open source tool that reuses Wireshark and allows you to look at captures side-by-side and diff packet details similar to a diff for source code. This talk will cover how the tool works, present more advanced features and how I personally use it for my work the Linux SMB client.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
