title: 'Compile Time Regular Expressions - Hana Dusíková'
recordingDate: 1569226449
description: "I will present a library that utilizes a feature of C++20 to build regular expressions from compile-time strings.\n\nThis is a novel approach that doesn't have ordinary disadvantages of other regular expression implementations like having to use a linked library or a run-time cost of parsing and interpreting an internal finite machine. You will see implementation details of the library and problems I have run into during its writing. In the last part of the talk, I will compare other implementations of regular expression engines and show compiled code in Compiler Explorer.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
