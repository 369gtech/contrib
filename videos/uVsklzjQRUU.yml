description: "by Martin Braun\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.120/sdr_grfec.webm\n\n\nIn the 1940s, Shannon proved that we can transmit data error-free depending on rate and SNR. In practical radios, we need to employ forward error correction (FEC) to achieve those rates. GNU Radio has a built-in component to handle FEC, called gr-fec. After some basics of FEC, we will see how GNU Radio does this, and how it can be extended. \n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:00:00+01"
