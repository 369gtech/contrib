description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nKubernetes IoT Edge Working Group: Using Event Driven Architecture at Edge - Steven Wong, VMware & Dejan Bosanac, RedHat \n\nMany use cases at edge face resource limits which challenge the deployment of full K8s clusters, or even single nodes, at the edge “leaf” nodes. We will introduce some techniques that can be used to process edge generated data and commands using Kubernetes hosted applications and services in a loosely coupled tiered distributed system. Agenda: - Characteristics and challenges of Edge Applications. - Introduction to event driven architecture - What is it? How do you deploy and manage it at edge. - Using open source based event driven tools to host data collection and IoT processing on small devices feeding into K8s hosted applications and services. - Demonstration using edge generated CloudEvents with a Kubernetes hosted application. - How to get involved in the K8s IoT Edge Working Group. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekH1"
