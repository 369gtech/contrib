description: "Shubha Vijayasarathy joins Scott Hanselman to discuss Azure Event Hubs, which makes data ingestion simple, secure, and scalable. As a distributed streaming platform, Event Hubs enables you to stream your data from any source—storing and processing millions of events per second— so you can build dynamic data pipelines and respond to business challenges in real time. \n\nWith Azure Event Hubs for Apache Kafka, we're bringing together two powerful distributed streaming platforms, so you can access the breadth of Kafka ecosystem applications without having to manage servers or networks. Event Hubs for Kafka provides a Kafka endpoint so that any Kafka client running Kafka 1.0 or newer protocols can publish/subscribe events to/from Event Hubs with a simple configuration change.\n\nAzure Event Hubs docs\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/495/01\n\nAzure Event Hubs samples (GitHub)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/495/02\n\nAzure Event Hubs overview\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/495/03\n\nAzure Event Hubs pricing\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/495/04\n\nAnnouncing the general availability of Azure Event Hubs for Apache Kafka® (blog post)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/495/05\n\nCreate a free account (Azure)\nhttps://aka.ms/azfr/495/free"
