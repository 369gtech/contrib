title: 'Quantum Computing Concepts - John Azariah'
recordingDate: 1558613287
description: "Quantum Computing exploits quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to realize a form of parallelism that is not available to traditional computing. It offers the potential of significant computational speed-ups in quantum chemistry, materials science, cryptography, and machine learning.\n\nWith no prior knowledge of condensed matter physics or advanced mathematics, it's hard to separate hype from reality.\n\nCome learn the fundamentals of Quantum Computing, get a sense of where it applies and what it can do, and the challenges being faced to make it a reality. Oh, and we'll write a little quantum computing code too!\n\nJohn works on the Quantum Computing team at Microsoft, and serves on the language design committee for Q# - a new language for Quantum Computation.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
