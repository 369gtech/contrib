description: "In this session, I’ll highlight the easiest ways for full stack developers to deliver their code to the cloud and the best ways to reliably make updates and maintain production cloud code. The focus will be on real-world examples with working demos using Linux command line tools, VMs, Docker, Kubernetes, serverless functions, SaaS, Maven, Jenkins, and other free SDKs and tools available on GitHub.\n\nThe examples, tools and demos that I show will be applicable to any cloud platform, and all are available on GitHub. I will show Microsoft Azure running the samples but will not be selling azure - this is a technical talk that will focus on the code.\n\nKey takeaways\nWhat are the easiest ways for full stack developers to deliver their code to the cloud.\nThe focus will be on real-world examples with working demos.\nUsing Linux command line tools\nThe examples\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
