recordingDate: 1557110999
description: "\"Speaker: Hayley Denbraver\n\nIt seems that every week there is a news story that prompts software developers to think about the ethical implications of their work. As individuals, teams, and communities we need to consider the impact of the code we write. But what about code that we are using, but did not create? \n\nHow does Open Source Software factor into this equation? OSS is used across the industry, but is written and maintained primarily by volunteers. What are best practices for maintainers, contributors, individual users, and companies who incorporate open source into their work? How can we protect ourselves and our users, while still benefiting from the innovation and collaboration of open source software?\n\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
