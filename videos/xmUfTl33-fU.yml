description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nRUSTLING UP PREDICTIVE SPORTING BETTING MODELS ON THE BEAM\nby David Lucia\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nVery big NIF\n\nTALK LEVEL: [\"\"Intermediate users\"\", \"\"Proficient users\"\"]\n\nABSTRACT\nRustler is a library that makes easy to bind Rust code to the BEAM as a NIF. At SimpleBet, we took that to the next level by implementing our machine learning models in Rust as an application-level NIF. Affectionately referred to as the Dream Stack, we've used this approach to build a system that generates the odds of every plate appearance outcome at a baseball game. While it worked well to start, we are now migrating to a service based approach instead.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/david-lucia/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - DAVID LUCIA\nUsing Elixir to make every discrete, in-game occurrence a betting opportunity\n\nDave is the VP of Engineering at SimpleBet, a Sports-Betting company that aims to make every discrete occurence in sporting event a betting opportunity. While at SimpleBet, he was the architect of the Rust-based approach to delivering machine learning models to production. Previously, Dave was a founding engineer at The Outline, an online magazine built from the ground up in Elixir.\n\nWhile not Elixiring, Dave loves challenging his tolerance for spicy food, listening to pop-punk/hardcore music, and spending time with his wife and 6lb pomeranian named Pearl.\n\nMore on David Lucia: https://codesync.global/speaker/david-lucia/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
