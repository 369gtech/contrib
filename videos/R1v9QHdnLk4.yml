During this talk members of SIG-Autoscaling will explain why you should be autoscaling both applications and clusters, and the tools Kubernetes provides to do this. You will learn the mechanics of Cluster, Horizontal Pod and Vertical Pod Autoscalers, their new and upcoming features as well as the best practices for applying them in production and things to watch out for. After this talk you will know where to look for information about the different autoscalers as well as which settings can be changed to adapt to different workloads."
