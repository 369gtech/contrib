description: "5G is coming fast and the media and the industry are starting to talk about it. This was particularly true at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last February. While the standardization process is not yet fully finalized, some of you may be asking yourself many questions:\n\nWho defines the standard? when? what will it change?\nWhat are the technologies behind the word _5G_?\nDuring this presentation, I will try to answer these questions. I will popularize and make easy to understand what are 3GPP, mmWave, NFV, 5G-New Radio, Massive IoT, LPWAN, or beamforming.\n\nI am leading the IoT security department and the R&D activities at Rtone. \n\nI am an Engineer in Telecommunications (INSA Lyon, 2015), and I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Lyon (2018) after a thesis on Visible Light Communications for the IoT. \nMy thesis was in collaboration between Rtone and the CITI lab under the CIFRE fellowship, and was supervised by Razvan Stanica, Hervé Rivano and Adrien Desportes, Rtone Chief Executive Officer.\n\nI am actively involved in the PACLIDO collaborative project on lightweight cryptographic protocols for the IoT, for which I am the technical lead for Rtone. \nI regularly attend IT conferences and give talks about security, IoT and Machine Learning."
