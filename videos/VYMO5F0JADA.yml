description: "As publishers, we spend a lot of time choosing typefaces and formats, kerning and justifying, and setting margins, then throw it all out the window when it comes to ebooks. Understanding the constraints of the medium and accepting the ebook as its own unique art form will allow digital publishing to move from mass-produced product back into the realm of book as art. I will discuss the decisions that must be made to create a readable and design-sound ebook.\n\nAbout Amanda Gomm:\nSeattle-born, techy, book nerd, and perfectionist, Amanda received Master's degree in Book Publishing from Portland State University. A lifelong obsession with art, marketing statistics, and digital trends led her to realize the potential for ebooks to entertain and inspire readers instead of annoying and frustrating them in the way they often do. Partnering with design-savvy tech guru Tom McCluskey, Amanda co-founded Digital Bindery to solve digital publishing problems with particular attention to the artisan aesthetic."
