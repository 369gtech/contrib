description: "Shelters have unique challenges due to the incredible resource constraints, scale and scope of problems, and criticality of mission to which they are subjected. In many ways, animal shelters are akin to battlefield medics, in which they must use what they have to save everyone possible. Similarly to battlefield medics, their success is often determined by the time, information, and tools at their disposal. Unfortunately, many shelters do not have access to more than basic IT resources. Austin Pets Alive!, a local rescue which has, in partnership with Austin Animal Center, brought the live release rate from 55% when it was founded in 2008 to 98% in 2019 so far, has been championing the use of more advanced technical volunteers and their skills in order to provide shelters around the world with time saving methods, information, and tools. In this talk, three of the most advanced instantiations of this effort will be shared in areas of health economics, disease spread, and data analytics.\n\nAnimal shelters save millions of pets each year while being overwhelmed with problems for which they have few, if any, tech resources or skills to use to solve. In this talk, we will review 3 case studies at Austin Pets Alive! in which Python-based technologies have been used to advanced the state of the art in animal shelters in: health economics, disease spread modeling, and data analytics.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
