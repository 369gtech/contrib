title: 'Scaling a solution of an NP-hard problem with Apache ZooKeeper (Kyrylo Holodnov, Ukraine)'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1437557222
description: 'NP-hard problems play an important role in cryptography and are frequent in graph theory. Large number of computers donâ€™t reduce a complexity of an algorithm, but a solid architecture and design of distributed system can provide good scalability. In this talk, I will solve a non-standard NP-hard problem and will give examples how to solve it in a cluster of machines using Apache ZooKeeper.'
