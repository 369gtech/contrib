description: "Talk - Chaos Engineering - withstanding turbulent conditions in production\n\nWhy we need Chaos Engineering\n\nThe complexity in modern and distributed architectures continues to increase. We have successfully broken down our application into small and maintainable components. Each individual component can be automated and brought into production at any time. A lot of effort was put into the development to keep the test coverage as high as possible. Every release has to successfully pass our pipeline and countless unit, integration and acceptance tests.\n\nBut why do we have this unpleasant feeling shortly before our arrival at the most beautiful place in the world (production)?\n\nSpeaker - Benjamin Wilms - Senior Developer & Chaos Engineer @ codecentric\n\nBenjamin Wilms works as Senior Developer & Chaos Engineer at codecentric AG. His current focus is on are scalability and resilience in distributed applications. He regularly shares and discusses his ideas as a speaker at conferences and as an author of articles and blog posts. In April 2018 he published the Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot as an OpenSource project and is responsible for its further development."
