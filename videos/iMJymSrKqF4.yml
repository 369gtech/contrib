recordingDate: 1451360508
description: "What does it mean to be complicated? How can we manage complexity when we scale up systems? Why do people find it horrifying when the internal complexity of monolithic apps is replaced by a “death star” diagram of the relationships between microservices? Why do people expect complex adaptive systems to behave predictably? How does complicated relate to intuitive? Why is one of the most complicated things we own, our smartphone, easy to use by 2 year olds?\n\nAdrian Cockcroft has had a long career working at the leading edge of technology. He’s always been fascinated by what comes next, and he writes and speaks extensively on a range of subjects. At Battery, he advises the firm and its portfolio companies about technology issues and also assists with deal sourcing and due diligence.\n\nBefore joining Battery, Adrian helped lead Netflix’s migration to a large scale, highly available public-cloud architecture and the open sourcing of the cloud-native NetflixOSS platform. Prior to that at Netflix he managed a team working on personalization algorithms and service-oriented refactoring.\n\nAdrian was a founding member of eBay Research Labs, developing advanced mobile applications and even building his own homebrew phone, years before iPhone and Android launched. As a distinguished engineer at Sun Microsystems he wrote the best-selling “Sun Performance and Tuning” book and was chief architect for High Performance Technical Computing.\n\nHe graduated from The City University, London with a Bsc in Applied Physics and Electronics, and was named one of the top leaders in Cloud Computing in 2011 and 2012 by SearchCloudComputing magazine. He can usually be found on Twitter @adrianco.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
