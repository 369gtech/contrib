language: English
recordingDate: 1590700654
description: "AskTOM Office Hours offers free, open Q&A sessions with Oracle Database experts. Explore the Database In-Memory option with Andy Rivenes (@TheInMemoryGuy) and Maria Colgan (@SQLMaria). \n\nIn this session we took another look at RAC with an emphasis on how population works, how objects get placed on nodes or across nodes and how queries work with multiple nodes. We also showed some demos on a 19c RAC cluster of populating with distribution across the three nodes, serial vs. parallel queries, and using the FOR SERVICE sub-clause to populate on specific nodes.\n\nHighlights:\n7:06   - In-Memory Area\n9:13    - IMCUs\n18:22  - RAC population demo\n22:34 - RAC distribution\n28:02 - RAC queries\n36:11  - Serial and parallel query demo\n42:57 - DISTRIBUTE FOR SERVICE"
