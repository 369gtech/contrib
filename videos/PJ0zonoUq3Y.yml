description: "by Cornelius Kölbel\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/owncloud_2fa.webm\n\n\nYou are running an ownCloud or Nextcloud installation and are sick of lazy users choosen week passwords?\nYou want to add two factor authentication to secure the login at ownCloud. But users refuse to enroll the internal TOTP app?\nIn this talk we will show you how to protect the ownCloud login with a 2nd factor, that is centrally managed and forces the user to login in a secure way. privacyIDEA is a central two factor authentication system, where administrators can manage the 2nd factors of the users.\nYou can run privacyIDEA in your network and connect several applications to privacyIDEA for authentication.\nThis way users only need to have one 2nd factor for all applications and services. \n\nIn this talk we will start with a standard ownCloud setup with simple password authentication. We will install a privacyIDEA machine and configure ownCloud to authenticate against privacyIDEA.\nWe will enroll tokens like a Smartphone Authenticator, an OTP Keyfob token and a Yubikey to users and use these 2nd factors to login to ownCloud. \n\nprivacyIDEA and all necessary components are open source and available via github. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:00:00+01"
