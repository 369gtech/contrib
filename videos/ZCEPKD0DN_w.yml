description: "#nocode\n\nFor beginning programmers, coding is a superpower. But as we gain experience, code-centric thinking can become a trap. Prepare to have your conception of what it means to be a programmer challenged, as we explore how to increase your leverage by choosing NOT to write code.\n\nAIn his 20-year software development career, Avdi Grimm has worked on everything from aerospace embedded systems to enterprise web applications. Heâ€™s a consulting pair-programmer, the author of several popular Ruby programming books, and a recipient of the Ruby Hero award for service to the Ruby community. Since 2011 he has been teaching developers how to work more effectively (and have fun doing) it at RubyTapas.com.\n\nHe spends his theoretical spare time hanging out with his kids, hiking the Smoky Mountains, and dancing to oontz-oontz music.\n\nFor more on YOW!
