title: 'Testing App Cloud Readiness for Failover Resiliency with SQL Managed Instance | Data Exposed'
language: English
recordingDate: 1612458005
description: "In this episode with Dani Ljepava, we will show you how to manually trigger a planned failover on SQL Managed Instance to test your applications for fault tolerance and will talk about best practices for your applications to achieve tolerance to transient faults typical for the cloud environments. Transient faults in the cloud (for example software patching, security updates, failover, and similar) include a momentary loss of network connectivity, temporary unavailability of a service, or timeouts when service is busy. These faults are often self-correcting due to which your applications need to be able to handle such occurrences with the appropriate retry logic. While migrating legacy apps to the cloud or developing new cloud-born apps, it is strongly advised to ensure that your applications follow the best practices disclosed in this episode helping you build cloud-ready apps. \n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:46 About Dani Ljepava\n1:30 Transient errors in the cloud\n2:50 Cloud Ready Apps\n4:07 Understanding failover as part of HA on SQL MI\n6:00 Demo: User-initiated failover on SQL Managed Instance\n11:35 How to check if failovers occurred\n12:35 Best practices\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Resources:\nUser-initiated manual failover on SQL Managed Instance: https://aka.ms/mifailover-techblog \n\nüìå Let's connect:\nTwitter: Dani Ljepava, https://twitter.com/danimir\nTwitter: Anna Hoffman, https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna\nTwitter: AzureSQL, https://aka.ms/azuresqltw\n\nüî¥ To check out even more Data Exposed episodes, see our playlist: https://aka.ms/dataexposedyt\n\nüîî Subscribe to our channels for even more SQL tips:\nMicrosoft Azure SQL: https://aka.ms/msazuresqlyt\nMicrosoft SQL Server: https://aka.ms/mssqlserveryt\nMicrosoft Developer:  https://aka.ms/microsoftdeveloperyt\n\n#AzureSQLManagedInstance #AzureSQLMI #AzureSQL"
