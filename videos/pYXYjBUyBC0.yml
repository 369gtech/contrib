description: "If you like making things, then you will love .NET Gadgeteer. You can create many interesting projects by just plugging together components and writing a few lines of programming code.\n\nIn this hands-on webcast presented by Simon Monk, author of 'Getting Started with .NET Gadgeteer', he'll do a live demonstration of the Web Messenger project from the book. In this project, the web server constantly serves the contents of the Gadgeteer screen. You can draw sketches on the screen with your finger or a stylus and leave messages for the world to see. This is an interesting project. Join us for the live event.\n\nAbout Simon Monk\n\nDr. Simon Monk has a degree in Cybernetics and Computer Science and a PhD in Software Engineering.
