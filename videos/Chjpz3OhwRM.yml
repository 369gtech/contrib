description: "Diversity Luncheon: Chasing Grace Project Screening & Discussion - Jennifer Cloer, Executive Director, The Chasing Grace Project\n\nEighty Twenty: The Gender Pay Gap Exposed\n\nThe gender pay gap can lead to $1 million in lost wages over the course of a womanâ€™s career, not to mention a profound emotional deficit brought on by the feeling one is always chasing something she cannot attain. Join us at the Diversity Luncheon to watch Episode One of The Chasing Grace Project, written and directed by Jennifer Cloer, co-founder of Wicked Flicks Productions, over a delicious meal. Episode One: Eighty Twenty explores the impact of the gender pay gap on women in tech, and documents how women find ways to charge ahead in order to sustain successful careers. Following the episode will be a panel moderated by Jennifer Cloer with women in the community. The audience will be given the opportunity to participate as well.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/Fwua/diversity-luncheon-chasing-grace-project-screening-discussion-jennifer-cloer-executive-director-the-chasing-grace-project"
