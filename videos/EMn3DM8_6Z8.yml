description: "A truly powerful conversational AI needs to do more than deeply understand language. To be contextual, flexible, and robust, the AI must also deeply understand actions â€“ most goals involve multiple steps and multiple sources of information. Representing goals, actions, and dialogue states is one of the central challenges in conversational AI systems.\n\nJoin Dan Klein, as he goes over how the Semantic Machines group is building out conversational AI experiences that allow you to harness a greater potential of existing technology through language.\n\nTo learn more about the latest Dev breakthroughs, visit the Innovation Tech Hub: https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/developer\n\nSemantic Machines Research Page: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/semantic-machines/ \n\nSMCalFlow Dataset and Leaderboard: https://microsoft.github.io/task_oriented_dialogue_as_dataflow_synthesis/ \n\nTechnical Publications: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/semantic-machines/#!publications \n\nDiscover all the Innovation Tech Minutes for Developers: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHjNJcVCIktce-wSFZ5svwA3"
