description: "TypeScript is quickly becoming the dominant way to write maintainable self documenting JavaScript.\n\nThis session will demonstrate some of the reasons why you should consider adding TypeScript to your JavaScript toolset.

Since TypeScript is fast evolving (just like JavaScript) we will also cover how to keep up with the changes."
