description: "Update on the OSBAPI Specification – Doug Davis, IBM\n\nSince the Open Service Broker API left the confines of Cloud Foundry, and is now a cross platform specification that is now supported on platforms such as Kubernetes, its importance in the community has skyrocketed. In this session we're review what's been going on with the OSBAPI specification and working group. We'll highlight the new features of the spec and some of the potential future work items the group is considering.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FW1v/update-on-the-osbapi-specification-doug-davis-ibm"
