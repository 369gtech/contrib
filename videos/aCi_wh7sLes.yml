description: "Most software engineers don't realize that an outage is more than keeping the TTR low (yes, TTR is very important); it's also about managing the expectations of your customers. After all, your customers don't care about five-nines reliability; they care about five-nines customer service.\n\nThe best engineers are focused on making the lives of their customers better. They have inner peace; they are mindful, self-aware and don't indulge in mindless work. They take steps --without being asked-- to prevent a defect from ever reaching production again. \"DevOps\" --despite all the buzz-- is table stakes these days; the strategic differentiator is how obsessed you are with your customers.\n\nCome find out how the right mindset, soft skills & inner peace can help you become a better engineer - one your customers actually love."
