description: "Brian Fanzo: A Millennial Mindset: Embracing Digital Change, Collaboration and Community\n\nIn this keynote Brian will walk the audience through the workforce changes that have drastically shifted the mindsets of both the digital dinosaurs and the digital natives as employees and customers.\n\nThe audience will learn:\n\nMillennials make up over 50% of today’s workforce. Creating persona’s in marketing around those born during certain years can be valuable but with a multi-generational workforce it’s essential to understand that a Millennial Mindset is not restricted to employees of a certain age. Collaboration isn’t about everyone having a task. Successful collaboration enables everyone to focus on what they do the best. Not every employee needs to be a social employee but every employee plays an important role in a brand’s storytelling efforts. 3 T’s: Trust, Training, Tools. Social business tools enable scale, management, and reporting. Too often tools are thrown at people problems. The order of the 3T’s is even more important than the implementation of each - address human needs before technology.\n\nThe speech was given on 2018-05-22 at infoShare 2018 (Marketing Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
