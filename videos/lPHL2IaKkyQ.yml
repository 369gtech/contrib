title: 'High Performance PWAs with Hasan Ahmad'

recordingDate: 1559582026
description: "PWAs are a newly emerging delivery format for web, desktop apps. The fact that they can be installed on a client device and behave like natively installed apps means that special care should be taken when designing and building these types of apps, above and beyond a typical browser-only web application. One of the most important (potential) differentiators in the user experience of a PWA app vs a traditional web app is the ability to provide a high-performance UI because of their ability to do things like cache resources offline, including entire pieces of Web UI code, and the use of background services. In this talk we are going to do an exhaustive overview of the entire landscape of building PWAs from a performance-first perspective.\n\nHasan Ahmad\nPrincipal Consultant, Aquent DEV6\nhttps://twitter.com/has_ibr_ahm\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
