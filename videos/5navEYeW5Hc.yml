language: English
recordingDate: 1523478641
description: "Ever since the threat of an npm worm became public we've been thinking about how to detect malicious modules in our ecosystem and how to provide security teams auditing modules with tooling and intel to make informed decisions about module risk. We've built a system to analyze modules based on their installation behavior. This talk will discuss the results of this endeavor and share the interesting findings from this new and previously unexplored dataset and try to answer the question if a npm worm is lurking in the shadows.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAdam Baldwin\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNode Summit 2018 registration: http://www.nodesummit.com/registration/"
