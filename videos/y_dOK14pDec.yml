description: "We hear from Alberto Brandolini at SC London 2019. His session was called, \"The Gordian Knot.\" The inspiration for his talk was actually out of frustration that some of his colleagues weren't happy in their working life. His talk focuses on the idea of, what if we were able to spot those bad projects or scenarios and change them for the better. \n\nFor more information on SC London or to find out how you can participate, please visit https://sc-london.com/.\n\nRelated Content:\nThe Gordian Knot https://youtu.be/WcOONURucj4"
