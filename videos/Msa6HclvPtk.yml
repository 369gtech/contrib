title: 'DrupalCon New Orleans 2016: Using Paragraphs to Weave a Beautiful Content Tapestry'
recordingDate: 1463082201
description: "We’ve all been there. You’re a site builder, and you were just shown a new design for article nodes. Within the post you see a visually compelling tapestry of mixed media: text, photo slideshows, columns, dynamic lists, and even full width photos.\n\nThe client will love it, but how do you give so much editing power to the end-user without writing custom code for each new post? The answer, my friends, is Paragraphs.\n\nInstead of creating ugly blobs of content within a WYSIWYG body field, end-users can now choose (on-the-fly) between predefined Paragraph Types independent from one another. Paragraph Types can be anything you want, from simple text, or image, or a complex and configurable slideshow.\n\nIn this session we’ll be:\n\nidentifying the pros and cons of using this technique\n\ncontrasting this technique with others (including panels)\n\nshowcasing some case studies with interesting examples\n\ndescribing the various contrib modules for Paragraphs\n\nwalking through the steps to add and extend your first Paragraph\n\n\n\nThis session is perfect for:\n\nSite builders who want to give more power to the end-user.\n\nEditors and content creators who are fed up with Drupal’s rigid and inflexible content creation process.\n\nTotal beginners who want to be inspired and see what you can do with a fully configured Drupal site using Paragraphs."
