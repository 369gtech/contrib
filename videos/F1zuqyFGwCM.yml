description: "Philipp is a Developer Advocate at Elastic, spreading the love and knowledge of full-text search, analytics, and real-time data. He is a frequent speaker at conferences and meetups about all things search & analytics, databases, cloud computing, and DevOps. Philipp lives in Vienna where he enjoys experimenting with software, organizing meetups, and sports.\n\n\nTalk summary \n\nIn this talk, we’ll go through our deployment sins and how to avoid them:\n\nLust: Of course I’m using Docker, microservices, and every latest trend for each and every project!\nGluttony: I absolutely need this monolithic, 500MB archive file.\nGreed: I’m not kidding when I’m saying that this app will be at least 150MB and only works with JBoss AS 6.0.\nSloth: Continuous Deployment or Delivery — who would need that?!\nWrath: Graceful error handling, reporting, and monitoring are for the faint of heart!\nEnvy: Why would I rely on an external system to do the whole configuration for me, when I can lovingly handcraft it all myself?\nPride: Checking our app’s status after the deployment? That’s only for people who break stuff."
