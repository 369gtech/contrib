description: "Blockchain as a Service: Building Blocks of Blockchain [B] - Gary White Jr., Dell EMC    \n\nBlockchain is among the hottest technologies in the market place today. Blockchain has the potential to change how we transact business on the internet, empowering users to make secure transactions online without the need to have a third party oversight. For all its benefits Blockchain is still a relatively new technology and most people donâ€™t know how they would practically use it. In this talk we will deep dive Blockchain implementations; explaining how they work and demonstrate how we have integrated these with Cloud Foundry. At the end of this talk you will have a clear understanding of the Blockchain technology and how your Cloud Foundry applications can take advantage of it.\n\nGary White Jr.\nDell EMC\nSoftware Engineer II\nI work for DellEMC on the Dojo team in Cambridge, MA. We have been working on open-source projects like the Bosh-RackHD-CPI since our team's beginning, and also worked with Persistence in Cloud Foundry for the better part of last year. One of our more recent projects was a POC for storing data into a Blockchain using Cloud Foundry."
