title: 'C++20 An [Almost] Complete Overview'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601242577
description: "The technical work on C++20 was finished in January 2020, and is now being pushed through ISO certification.\n\nThis presentation gives an overview of (almost) all new features in both the language and the Standard Library. Some more exotic features will be left out. New language features include modules, coroutines, concepts, templated lambdas, constexpr changes, designated initializers, the spaceship operator, string literals as template parameters, feature test macros, conditional explicit, immediate functions, and more.\n\nThe second part of the session discusses the changes to the Standard Library. This includes topics such as ranges, atomic smart pointers, cancellable threads, a synchronization library, calendars, time zones, span, a formatting library, features test macros, and more.\n\n\nThe material is mostly the same as the \"C++20: What's in it for you?\" session from CppCon 2019, but it has been updated with the final standard. If you want a complete overview of all C++20 features, including references to other more deep-dive sessions at CppCon 2020 on certain topics, then this session is for you.\n\n\nEVENT:\nCppCon 2020\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nMarc Gregoire\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nCppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish CppCon tech talks.\n\n\nCREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRkJCvHWdwQ"
