language: English
recordingDate: 1574387596
description: "Security venders are struggling to keep up with the tactics used by adversaries. What happens when you use really old technology as a security strategy rather than bleeding edge tech? Can ransomware infect a Commodore 64 or Windows 3.0? What happens when malware attempts to compromise a Sega Genesis? Could an adversary successfully pivot and exfiltrate data from a network running CatOS? This talk will answer these and other questions regarding how modern threats react to really old technology. Research includes running various forms of modern malware on old technologies as well as permitting cybercriminals access to really old networks to see how they handle the situation. Speakers are authors of a handful of books including a recent title on digital forensics.\n\nJoseph Muniz (Twitter: @SecureBlogger) and Aamir Lakhani (Twitter: @aamirlakhani) together have spoken at various conferences including the infamous Social Media Deception RSA talk quoted by many sources found by searching \"Emily Williams Social Engineering\". Both speakers have written books together including a recent title \"Digital Forensics for Network Engineers\" released on Cisco Press late February 2018. They have been friends for years and continue to collaborate on research and other projects."
