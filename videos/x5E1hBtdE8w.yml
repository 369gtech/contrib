description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nA Hard Multi-tenancy Solution: Use Case, Challenges and Work - Xiaoning Ding & Qian Chen, Futurewei \n\nMulti-tenancy enables multiple organizations or teams to share the same cluster. There are different proposed multi-tenancy models in Kubernetes for different use cases, from soft-tenancy models where tenants trust each other to hard-tenancy models with no trust among tenants.  In this session, Xiaoning and Qian will share their use case of multi-tenant Kubernetes, where they share clusters with public cloud users. There is no trust among these users and a strong isolation among tenants is a must. They will talk about the use case, challenges, work, and also experience and lessons they learned from building such a hard multi-tenant cluster. And they will conclude the talk with a demo.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZemB"
