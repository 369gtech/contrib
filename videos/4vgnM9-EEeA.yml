description: "by Nikolai Kondrashov\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.401/microcontroller_firmware_from_scratch.webm\n\n\nFollow a journey of writing STM32 microcontroller firmware from scratch, using open-source tools. Follow Nikolay Kondrashov's journey of learning to write firmware for an STM32 microcontroller (the Blue Pill one) from scratch, using only open-source tools. From blinking LEDs, to controlling a toy car, without the complicated, and license-restricted manufacturer's libraries, or the comfortable crutches of the Arduino stack. Learn where to look for information, which tools you might need, and how to do it yourself with a similar or a different microcontroller. \n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:30:00+01"
