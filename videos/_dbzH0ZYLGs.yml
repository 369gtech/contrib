description: "by Robert Kaiser\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.126/geo_virtualreality.webm\n\n\nMixed Reality (XR), i.e. Virtual and Augmented Reality, opens up new possibilities for 3D visualizations of OpenStreetMap data (OSM). With WebXR and Mozilla's A-Frame library, it's really simple to create cross-device XR experiences running right in the browser with very little code. VR Map brings all that together and allows you to walk or \"fly\" through a virtual model of the real world courtesy of live OSM data. The talk will describe WebXR as Mixed Reality APIs for the browser and A-Frame as Mozilla's library to make it really simple to build WebXR scenes. Then, it will dive into how those technologies were used together with live OSM data to create the VR Map demo and show how it enables people to move through virtual models built from that real-world data to give an interesting new perspective on OpenStreetMap - and hopefully inspire developers to build similar experiences. \n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 16:30:00+01"
