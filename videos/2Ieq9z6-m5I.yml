description: "What Happens When You Type en.wikipedia.org?\n\nEffie Mouzeli and Alexandros Kosiaris, Wikimedia Foundation\n\nWhat happens when you type en.wikipedia.org? One of the most popular interview questions we have been asked quite a few times. But what about what happens on the server side? What happens on our end?\n\nAt Wikimedia, we run the world’s favourite encyclopædia and one of the top 5 websites of the Internet! In our talk, we will describe the architecture of Wikipedia, how routers, load balancers, caching, a bit more caching, message queues, databases, microservices, and containers are pieced together to serve you, and how open source plays a master role in it.\n\nFurthermore, we will briefly talk about our transition from a monolith, to service-oriented architecture and microservices, to migrating them to Kubernetes.\n\nWikipedia is a very good example of a complex system; joining this talk will help you demystify one in an understandable way.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
