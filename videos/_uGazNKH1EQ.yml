title: '#HITBLockdown D1 - Analyzing Recent Evolutions In Malware Loaders - H. Unterbrink & E. Brumaghin'
language: English
recordingDate: 1590639379
description: "Over the past year we have observed a significant increase in the volume and variety of malware loaders being distributed worldwide. Rather than leveraging malvertising and extensive TDS infrastructure, adversaries are now distributing loaders and creating new botnets that can be monetized to perform the spread of malware payloads for criminals seeking to deploy RATs, stealers, and banking trojans. This new generation of malware loaders features increased obfuscation, modularization, and maximum flexibility for the operators of these botnets. This talk will describe this recent shift in malware distribution, how these loaders are being leveraged, and how obfuscation and multi-stage delivery is being used to maximize efficiency and evade detection. We will also cover techniques for hunting these loaders in corporate environment and ways to more easily analyze them.\n\n=== \n\nComing from the German hacking scene, I am now working for Talos, the threat research organization of Cisco. Our goal is to find and reverse engineer new unknown malware campaigns. My team uncovered attacks like NotPetya, WannaCry, DNSpionage, SeaTurtle and many more. I am frequently presenting on internal and external conferences, for example: Microsoft Digital Crime Consortium (DCC), Google Annual RE Meeting, FIRST, ISC, 4th International Conference on Cybersecurity and Privacy Balkan, BSIDES Munich, Digital Voodoo, SecIT Germany, CiscoLive.\n\n--- \n\nEdmund Brumaghin is a threat researcher with Cisco Talos. He has spent the past several years protecting environments across a number of different industries including nuclear energy, financial services, etc. He currently spends his days hunting malware and analyzing various threats as they emerge and continue to evolve. In his time with Talos he has researched ransomware and other threats being distributed using various attack vectors. He has also worked to expose large scale malware campaigns and raise awareness of security threats observed across the threat landscape."
