description: "This week in our Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database Lee Sacco, Senior Director Depot Repair Development will present the current integrations and usage of Machine Learning from OML in the EBS Depot Repair Application.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks offers an easy-to-use, interactive, multi-user, collaborative interface based on Apache Zeppelin notebook technology, and support SQL, PL/SQL, Python and Markdown interpreters. It is available on all Autonomous Database versions and Tiers, including the always-free editions.\n\nOML includes AutoML, which provides automated machine learning algorithm features for algorithm selection, feature selection and model tuning, in addition to a specialized AutoML UI exclusive to the Autonomous Database.\n\nOML Services is also included in Autonomous Database, where you can deploy and manage native in-database OML models as well as ONNX ML models (for classification and regression) built using third-party engines, and can also invoke cognitive text analytics.\n\n01:38 Why NOT start with the Data in Machine Learning\n03:55 Starting with the Business Understanding\n05:08 What is Oracle EBS Depot Repair?\n08:38 User Schema for Repairs\n12:18 Structured Data of EBS Depot Repairs\n16:40 EBS Depot Repair - Technician Portal\n18:42 Oracle Machine Learning recommendations for the Technician\n20:53 Automatic Updates to the Technician Portal\n21:38 Architecture for ML recommendations - what happens in the back-end?\n26:27 Q&A\n38:50 Link to a Live Demo"
