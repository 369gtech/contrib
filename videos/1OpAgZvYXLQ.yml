description: 'The first thing visible in Java 8 is the lambdas, but the real power is in Streams. If you''re interested in immersing into lambdas and streams, this is the session for you. We will start with lambda expressions, learn about how to use them and how they get implemented under the hood. Then we will swiftly move into learning about streams, the abstractions they provide, and a variety of operations we can do with them. We will conclude with a discussion about lazy evaluations, infinite streams, and parallel collections.'
