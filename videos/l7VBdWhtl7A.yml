description: "Spring Framework 5.0 is here! One of the most exciting introductions in this release is support for reactive programming, building on the Pivotal Reactor project to support message-driven, elastic, resilient and responsive services. Spring Framework 5 integrates an MVC-like component model adapted to support reactive processing and a new type of web endpoint, functional reactive endpoints. In this talk, we'll look at the net-new Netty-based web runtime, how existing Servlet code can run on the new world, and how to integrate it with existing Spring-stack technologies.\n\nJosh Long, Spring Developer Advocate, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017\nMark Heckler, Developer Advocate, Pivotal"
