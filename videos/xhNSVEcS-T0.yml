title: 'Mindaugas Moz?ras - Frequent Releases & Major Changes'
recordingDate: 1471847874
description: "At Vinted, we’re big fans of continuous deployment. Our code is deployed hundreds of times per day into production. While offering a lot of advantages, continuous deployment also introduces its own set of challenges. Release of major changes, like big features or considerable refactorings, is one of them. How to release a sizeable improvement without stopping deploying continuously? Mindaugas will answer that in this talk. He’ll talk about Vinted experiences with tools/practices like feature flags, AB testing, scientist and more.\nDevOps Pro Vilnius 2016 - http://goo.gl/D9eDT7"
