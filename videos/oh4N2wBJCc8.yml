language: English
recordingDate: 1602874293
description: "werf is a CLI tool that glues well-established software (Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, a variety of container registries & CI systems) to facilitate applications' delivery. In this webinar, developers, release engineers & SREs will learn how they can benefit from werf in their infrastructure, release management & CI/CD pipelines. Using Git as a single source of truth, we will build images of a simple Node.js application, push them into registry, deploy to Kubernetes and integrate with GitLab CI. You will also see how actual Kubernetes deployments are kept always in sync with your defined state via GitOps push-based approach.\n\nPresenter:\nDmitry Stolyarov CTO, @Flant"
