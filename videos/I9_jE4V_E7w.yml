recordingDate: 1415013066
description: "Google I/O 2014 featured an amazing experiment exploring the microscopic and macroscopic breakthroughs in technology, with the experiment itself being a CSS marvel. Built with CSS and CSS3DRenderer instead of WebGL or canvas, the complex 3D world works on mobile just as well as desktop, making it an experience anyone can enjoy. In his talk John Brown will tell you about how he and his team at Instrument built a framework to make SVGs move like origami, how they overcame 3D z-index issues (both in spec and out of spec), and show you the pitfalls and triumphs of working with CSS3D, Three.js, and motion.\n\nJohn Brown is the initiator of Uncontext, creator of hhhhold, and he loves programming. He works at Instrument and was their Lead Developer on the Google I/O 2014 experiment.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/thisisjohnbrown\nhttp://thisisjohnbrown.com/"
