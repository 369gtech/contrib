We developed an open-source platform (called εxodus) in order to analyze Android applications from the Google Play Store and their respect of privacy, through the static analysis of APK files. This platform provides the public with reports presenting, among other things, trackers embedded in Android applications. \n\nDuring this talk, we will present in details how we are analyzing Android applications on the εxodus platform and its results, as well as the impact on our privacy that represent trackers which have invaded our smartphones. \n\nRoom: UD2.218A\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 11:30:00+01"
