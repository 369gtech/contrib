description: "In this episode of the Armchair Architect series of the Azure Enablement Show, David Blank-Edelman is joined by Uli Homann, Microsoft Corporative Vice President and Distinguished Architect, and Eric Charran, Chief Architect at Microsoft in a deep-dive conversation into observability of hybrid and multi-cloud applications.\n\nâœ…Resources:\n\nManagement and Monitoring patterns - Cloud Design Patterns \nhttps://aka.ms/azenable/66/01\nSidecar pattern - Cloud Design Patterns https://aka.ms/azenable/66/02\nObservability patterns https://aka.ms/azenable/66/03\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:22 From an architectural perspective, what do we need to do to build and run resilient, self-healing applications?\n4:22 Is monitoring from within the app itself an anti-pattern? Should sidecar patterns be used instead?\n6:21 What's the best method for Observability? Push or Pull?\n9:16 Can you use AI to monitor logs and report anomalies?\n10:19 Azure uses ML to predict host failure, then proactively removes VMs and takes the host out of the cluster\n12:15 Apps and microservices create so many logs; how can you tie them all together to track and understand an event?\n\nðŸ“º Related Episodes:\nArmchair Architects: Resiliency in the Cloud: an Introduction https://aka.ms/azenable/62\nArmchair Architects: Resiliency in the Cloud â€“ Core Patterns https://aka.ms/azenable/63 \nArmchair Architects: Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Architectures an Introduction https://aka.ms/azenable/64 \nArmchair Architects: Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Architectures - Feasibility\nhttps://aka.ms/azenable/65\n\nðŸ”´ To watch more episodes in the Well-Architected Series, check out our playlist: https://aka.ms/azenable/yt/wa-playlist\n\nðŸ”´ Explore more cloud enablement resources! \nhttps://www.azure.com/enablement?WT.mc_id=azureenablement-ch9-cxa&WT.mc_id=azenable-66\n\nðŸ“² Connect:  David Blank-Edelman @otterbook \nhttps://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fchannel9.msdn.com%2F&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&region=follow_link&screen_name=otterbook\n\nðŸ“² Connect: Eric Charran @mougue\nhttps://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fchannel9.msdn.com%2F&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&region=follow_link&screen_name=mougue\n\n#Azure #AzureEnablementShow #WellArchitected"
