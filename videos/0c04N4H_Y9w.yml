New JavaScript libraries appear all the time. How do you choose which JavaScript libraries to incorporate into your enterprise application architecture? Is it always the right approach to adopt the latest and newest solutions, and what are the criteria to use when evaluating new tools and technologies? This session attempts to make sense of the JavaScript ecosystem. Libraries and frameworks such as Angular, Backbone, Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (Oracle JET), and many more are included, and you will also see a range of demos and live coding.
