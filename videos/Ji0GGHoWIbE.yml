Even before the stable version, big companies like Alibaba decided to move their applications to Flutter. Sfter it became stable, it got even more attention.\n\nOne of the biggest advertisements for the Flutter is \"You won't say no to your UI/UX designer anymore\" and one of the biggest reason for this is: Animations. \n\nFlutter comes with a lot of out of the box tools for creating fancy animations. Its Skia Engine is also helping the developers to render the graphics faster so users can have a better experience with the animations. At FlutterLive, a tool called Flare is announced. It helps developers to create 2D animations faster and efficient.\n\nIn this talk, we will go through, how you can create the widely used animations in Flutter by explaining the key concepts of it by starting from very beginner level and going to the advanced level. And of course, we will see some code :)\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2019/it\nhttps://twitter.com/droidconit\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
