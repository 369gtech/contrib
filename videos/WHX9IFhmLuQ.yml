description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - Using restful APIs can be hard on your React applications. Before you know it, you are doing lots of parallel queries to the server. Using GraphQL instead of REST might help a lot. Instead of downloading many complete resources each component declares its own needs. Then the GraphQL client library then combines these requirements. The result is a single optimized query for the server. In this session, Maurice de Beijer is going to show you how to get started with GraphQL in you React applications.'
