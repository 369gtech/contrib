description: 'Java EE 7 introduced a new batch processing API. This session will go over how to use the batch processing API introduced with Java EE 7. This API is makes it easy to implement long running data/compute intensive jobs which need to be scheduled or initiated on-demand. Basics of the API will be demonstrated via code samples. The API will also be compared to Spring Batching and Hadoop to provide context and guidance on when these technologies are appropriate.'
