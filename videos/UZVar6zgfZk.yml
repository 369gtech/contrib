language: English
recordingDate: 1632327349
description: "Is there a best way to do a task? It's certainly a story we want to believe; but of course, the truth is more complicated than that. \n \n Instead of trying to determine and fix the best way of doing something, it is our responsibility to keep doing better. \n \n This talk is a historical overview of industrial psychology and the lessons we can take from history and apply to our forward motion. How have physical factories affected the metaphors we use for software, and how do they continue to do so? This talk is for people interested in cross-pollination, enduring metaphors, and continual improvement.\n\nHeidi Waterhouse, Transformation Advocate at LaunchDarkly\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/the-one-best-way-is-continual-improvement"
