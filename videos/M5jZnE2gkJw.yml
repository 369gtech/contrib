description: "Distributed Tracing of Microservices - Neil Stevenson, Hazelcast\n\nMicroservices are generally perceived as a better application style than monolithic code, and\ncertainly this is a style that sits nicely within Cloud Foundry.\n\nHowever, it’s not all good news. One of the drawbacks to such decomposition is it can be\nvery difficult to identify bottlenecks.\n\nIn this presentation, Neil will show how it’s easy this can solved for Spring Boot users. A few\nbeans and dependencies can activate tracing, and with Hazelcast as a service, trace information\ncan be centrally captured from to a fault-tolerant scalable in-memory repository.\n\nTrace analysis can then be distributed across multiple service instances, without the performance bottleneck of a unclustered disk based resource."
