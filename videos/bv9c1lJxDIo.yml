description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSIG Multicluster Intro - Jeremy Olmsted-Thompson, Google & Paul Morie, Red Hat\n \nSIG-Multicluster is focused on solving common challenges related to the management of many Kubernetes clusters, across multiple cloud providers (so-called hybrid cloud) and applications deployed across many clusters.  In the introduction, we'll give attendees an overview of the current status of the multicluster problem space in Kubernetes and of the SIG. Beyond the technical details, we'll also cover the results of an on-going survey to gather feedback relevant to and assess adoption of the current SIG subprojects.  Finally, we'll also be soliciting additional feedback from the community about the SIG's current efforts and future direction. This session will mostly be an open dialog; attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions in person as well as leave survey responses that the SIG will use to plan next steps.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zew0"
