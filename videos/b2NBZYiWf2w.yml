description: "Rebecca Vickery\n\nIt's not about what you know it's about what you can do\n\nOver the last few years, I have changed career from a data analyst to a data scientist primarily working in Python. Having limited time for study I needed to develop some techniques to enable me to learn in the most efficient way possible. In this talk, I will be sharing the techniques that I used to accelerate, not only my technical python skills but also my own personal growth in confidence, resilience and communication that have helped me to become both a better learner and a better data scientist. I will explain why when developing a career as a data scientist in business, it is not so much about what you know but about what you can do."
