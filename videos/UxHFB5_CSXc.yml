description: "Heeeey, ninjas! So in this CSS tutorial for beginners I'll be going through what exactly the first and last child pseudo classes are, and how they can help you target elements you wouldn't think possible without using a class or ID! \n\nLast and first child are both STRUCTURAL pseudo classes, that is, they help to select very specific elements within the HTML structure, or DOM (document object model). Keep coding and have fun.\n\nMC Ninja, signing out.\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n========== HTML Basics Course ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
