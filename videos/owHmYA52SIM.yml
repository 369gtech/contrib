Generating data allows finding bugs that would be impossible to catch by regular unit tests: e.g. too big to encode by hand. I'd like to present why is it worth getting into PBT by introducing successful usages of PBT for testing AUTOSAR, LevelDB and Dropbox. All those examples use stateful testing, so the next part of the talk describes steps to create a stateful test for a simple key-value store.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/tomasz-kowal\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - TOMASZ KOWAL\nSoftware Developer @ ClubCollect\n\nTomasz works with functional languages for over 8 years and loves learning and teaching about concepts and techinques.\n\nMore on Tomasz Kowal: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/tomasz-kowal\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
