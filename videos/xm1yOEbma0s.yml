title: 'Steps to high-load infrastructure on the AWS and Kubernetes (Ievgen Demchenko, Germany) [RU]'
recordingDate: 1577305959
description: 'How to move to the scalable and high-load tolerant architecture from the almost monolithic based environment. For the past almost 2 years I have been working as a head of engineering and during this time my company attracted 2 rounds of investments, grew from 30 to 150+ employees, our product covered most of the EU and the infrastructure of course changed a lot too. I want to share a practical experience how to build reliable, scalable and what is even more important â€“ manageable cloud based infrastructure. Ansible, terraform, kubernetes and many of the AWS services are our current reality. This topic is really huge and I think that it may take much more than one conference session to uncover it, but even the concept can be very helpful to those who are at the beginning of their journey.'
