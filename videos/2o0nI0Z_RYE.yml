recordingDate: 1541516951
description: 'An application can only be tested successfully using test automation and executable specifications if the architecture is testable. The tests must be fast, reliable, and offer good diagnosis precision. They must also be easy to write, maintain, and execute. Tests without these properties will be abandoned after a while and the effort creating them will be lost. You will learn about a proven architecture style that offers testability and fast feedback in this session. We will examine an example using well known tools to achieve the goal of working software in production.'
