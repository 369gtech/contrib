language: English
recordingDate: 1453114269
description: "Java Virtual Machine can handle a wide range of coding errors by throwing an exception with a readable stack trace. But what to do if JVM crashes on its own? What is hs_err.log, the only postmortem message with mysterious contents?\n\nThis talk will shed light on the information encoded in crash dumps. We will see how this data is useful in problem investigation. The live demo will review the real cases of JVM crash and postmortem analysis."
