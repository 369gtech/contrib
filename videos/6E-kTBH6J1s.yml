description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nEver since we broke apart the front and back-end of our systems, we've longed to partially reunite them with a shared language. The benefits of code reuse and shared tooling are compelling but is this nirvana possible? In this session we will explore building both the front (mobile and web) and back-end of an application with a shared Kotlin codebase. You will learn how to setup the build, share code, and deploy the back-end as a serverless app.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenters:\nJames Ward is a Developer Advocate for Google Cloud Platform. He tweets as @_JamesWard and blogs on jamesward.com.\n\nChet has been on the Android team since 2010, mostly working on and leading the UI Toolkit team, but recently as a part of the Developer Relations team. He enjoys hacking code for graphics, UI, performance, and then talking to developers about it at conferences like this."
