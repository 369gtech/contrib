recordingDate: 1579063471
description: "Sae Ra Germaine, Hugh Rundle\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/201/\n\nGLAM and cultural are great at making APIs accessible. But are they consistent between institutions? These institutions are great at creating rules but maybe it's time we need to create some with how APIs are created. This is a workshop to come up with some recommended standards for API creation.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nTue Jan 14 15:45:00 2020 at Room 5"
