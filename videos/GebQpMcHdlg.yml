description: "Deep Dive: Azure SIG – Khaled (Kal) Henidak , Microsoft & Stephen Augustus, Red Hat \n\nIn the SIG Azure Deep Dive, we’re going to tell you all about why SIG Azure exists and the team behind managing it. From there, we’ll talk about what’s happened over the last few releases, Kubernetes 1.11 and Kubernetes 1.12, as well as some of what’s planned for Kubernetes 1.13. Additionally, we’ll glimpse into Azure support of multiple extension points e.g., CSI, CNI, CRI. Afterwards, we’ll have a quick demo of provisioning Kubernetes on Azure as well as a secret demo from our mad scientist and SIG Azure Technical Lead, Kal! Finally, and most importantly, we’ll talk all about some of the best ways to get involved with SIG Azure and all of the forums that we’re communicating on! \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Gret"
