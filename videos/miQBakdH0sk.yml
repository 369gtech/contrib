description: "Information is everywhere and for many people, especially in the connected world, it is accessible freely or at a minimal cost. News outlets rely on social media to broadcast breaking news. Social media in turn relies on us to feed it with information, be it of our surroundings or our personal information. It’s become somewhat of a self-sustaining self-serving machine in which we’re all part of. It’s big data and we’re a cog in the wheel. For now of course, because with big data and cheap yet powerful hardware, AI also wants to play the game.\n\n\n\nAbout:\nHadi Harir, Developer Advocacy, JetBrains\n\n\nDeveloper and creator of many things OSS, he has been programming in one way, shape or form since the age of 12. Author of various publications and courses, Hadi has been speaking at industry events for nearly two decades. Host to Talking Kotlin, he works at JetBrains leading the Developer Advocacy team, and spends as much time as he can writing code."
