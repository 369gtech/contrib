title: 'Continuous Profiling Go Application Running in Kubernetes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1585338911
description: 'Microservices and Kubernetes help our architecture to scale and to be independent at the price of running many more applications. Golang provides a powerful profiling tool called pprof, it is useful to collect information from a running binary for future investigation. The problem is that you are not always there to take a profile when needed, sometimes you do not even know when you need to one, thatâ€™s how a continuous profiling strategy helps. Profefe is an open-source project that collect and organizes profiles. Gianluca wrote a project called kube-profefe to integrate Kubernetes with Profefe. Kube-profefe contains a kubectl plugin to capture locally or on profefe profiles from running pods in Kubernetes. It also provides an operator to discover and continuously profile applications running inside Pods.'
