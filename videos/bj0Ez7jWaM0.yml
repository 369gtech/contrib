title: 'CONTEXTVS, STVLTE! Context, stupid! - Piotr Przybył'
language: English
recordingDate: 1633338023
description: "\"The best sorting algorithm is quick sort.\" \"Indexes make DB faster.\" \"Data should be sorted using ORDER BY.\" \"Composition - good; inheritance - not good.\" \"Windows is an operating system.\" \"You must have transactions in your DB.\" \"Java is slow.\" \"Don't eat yellow snow.\" \"You shall not self-sign your certificates.\" \"Interrupt in Java is broken.\"\n\nThe IT world is full of mantras/revealed truth, passed (often in oral tradition) among developer tribes. Mindlessly repeated from generation to generation, they cause a reckless usage. At best this results in more harm than good, in the worst case: a total disaster worth whole train of money. The context is indispensable part of each mantra. Right context can help to distinguish proper usage from incoming disaster.\n\nDo you believe in a mantra by any chance? How to find out the context? Can one eat a yellow snow? Come and see.\n\nPresented by Piotr Przybył\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
