It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.\nJSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.\n\nJSON is built on two structures:\n\nA collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.\nAn ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.\nThese are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.\n\n\nJSON Syntax : \n---------------------- \n\n*Data is in name/value pairs\n*Data is separated by comma\n*Curly brackets holds objects\n*Square brackets holds arrays\n\nObjects can contain multiple name/values pairs:\n\n{ \"name\":\"Edureka\" , \"course\":\"Android\" }\n\nArrays can contain multiple objects: \n\n{ \n    \"company \": [\n\n    {\"name\":\"Edureka\" , \"course\":\"Android\" }, {\"name\":\"Edureka\" , \"course\":\"iOS\" }\n\n                     ]\n}\n\nWatch all videos of this series - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOGxsVIvgqd_TkPgDKQzhhO4\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.co or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information.\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co\n\nVisit - http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course"
