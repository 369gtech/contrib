From Jails to LXC to Zones to systemd-nspawn Docker to rkt - there's an assortment of different tools on different platforms that call themselves containers, and no clear consensus what it means when it comes to distributing containers or implementing the underlying technical details. The Open Container Initiative was formed in 2015 to try to remedy this situation by establishing a shared set of container standards for different implementers to agree on. With representatives from all major server operating system platforms, the Initiative has made great strides towards specifying a truly interoperable container. The two key OCI projects recently hit their canonical 1.0 version; this talk will explain what OCI is and what that milestone means for the container ecosystem.\n\n\n\nJon Boulle"
