description: "Kumar Srinivasamurthy, Microsoft Corp\n\nIt's very easy to launch a debugger on your dev box, attach to the right process and step through code. However, things are different when you need to debug an issue in production that's getting tens of thousands of requests per second. What if the issue reproduces only in production? How do you debug without affecting production traffic? What techniques can you use in your development to make it easier to debug issues? Does your application use tracing? What debug logs are written out to aid in analysis?\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\nChallenges with debugging in production\nVarious approaches that are used in the industry\nExamples from Bing & Cortana incidents and steady state problems to illustrate the techniques\nHow do you design services that make them easier to debug\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
