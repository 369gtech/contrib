description: "Feedback Loops: How SREs Benefit and What Is Needed to Realize Their Potential\n\nPooja Tangi, LinkedIn\n\nThe problem:\nAlmost every SRE has felt the pain of using an ineffective tool or a top-down initiative requiring mass adoption of a beta product, however very few of these pain points are actually brought to the attention of upper management and are resolved in a timely manner. What is missing? A feedback loop, perhaps, or a systematic bottom-up approach for surfacing the problem areas? \n\nThe solution: \nAs a Technical Program Manager and a former SRE, I have questioned the validity of a proposed value of a given platform. Over a few different initiatives, I have realized that inserting bottom-up communication techniques and cross-team collaboration transforms discontent and toxic communication into supportive engagement that facilitates development of a better product that the SREs appreciate and are excited about onboarding. \n\nI am not talking about a magical tool that will fix all of the issues above but small process tweaks which a project lead or a program manager could easily adapt and help for the betterment of the organization.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
