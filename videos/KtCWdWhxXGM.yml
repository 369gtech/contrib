Watson, Vulk Coop & Denver Williams, Vulk Coop \n\nThe CNCF CI status dashboard -- cncf.ci -- provides a third party validation of builds, deployments and end-to-end testing for CNCF’s Graduated and Incubating projects. The newest iteration of the cncf.ci status dashboard focuses on supporting a sustainable and scalable project ecosystem. To accelerate adding & maintaining projects on cncf.ci, the status dashboard can integrate with a project’s existing CI System and accept contributions from CNCF project maintainers. This Deep Dive session will include a walk-through of integrating a CNCF project with Travis CI to utilize the Travis CI build status and artifacts in the cncf.ci dashboard and allow time for Q&A. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UahV"
