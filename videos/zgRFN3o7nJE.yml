title: 'Intro: Falco - Loris Degioanni, Sysdig'

description: "Intro: Falco - Loris Degioanni, Sysdig \n\nHost intrusion detection (HID) has been around for some time. What if we rethought the problems HID solves in the context of Cloud Native platforms? What if we can detect abnormal behavior in the application, container runtime, & cluster environment as well? In this talk, we’ll present Falco, a CNCF Sandbox project for runtime security. We will show how Falco taps Linux system calls & the Kubernetes API to provide low level insight into application behavior, & how to write Falco rules to detect abnormal behavior. We’ll show how to collect & aggregate alerts using an EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana). Finally we will show how Falco can trigger functions to stop abnormal behavior, & isolate the compromised Pod or Node for forensics. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of what problems runtime security solves, & how Falco can provide runtime security & incident response. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/I1Xv"
