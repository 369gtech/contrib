description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary, 25 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) image capture and display has become an\nimportant engineering topic. The discipline of reproducing scenes with\na high range of luminances has a five-century history that includes\npainting, photography, electronic imaging and image processing. HDR\nimages are superior to conventional images. There are two fundamental\nscientific issues that control HDR image capture and reproduction. The\nfirst is the range of information that can be measured using different\ntechniques. The second is the range of image information that can be\nutilized by humans. Optical veiling glare severely limits the range of\nluminance that can be captured and seen.\n\nIn recent experiments, we measured camera and human responses to\ncalibrated HDR test targets. We calibrated a 4.3-log-unit test target,\nwith minimal and maximal glare from a changeable surround. Glare is an\nuncontrolled spread of an image-dependent fraction of scene luminance\nin cameras and in the eye. We use this standard test target to measure\nthe range of luminances that can be captured on a camera's image\nplane. Further, we measure the appearance of these test luminance\npatches. It is the improved quantization of digital data and the\npreservation of the scene's spatial information that cause the\nimprovement in quality in HDR reproductions. HDR is better than\nconventional imaging, despite the fact the multiple- exposure-HDR\nreproduction of luminance is inaccurate. This talk describes the\nhistory of HDR image processing techniques including painting,\nphotography, and electronic image processing (analog and digital) over\nthe past 40 years. It reviews the development of Retinex theory, and\nother spatial-image- processing algorithms, that calculate appearance\nin images from arrays of radiances.\n\nSpeaker: John McCann\nJohn McCann received a B.A. degree in Biology from Harvard University\nin 1964.
