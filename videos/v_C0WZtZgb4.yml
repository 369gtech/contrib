Zero Touch Prod (ZTP) mitigates those risks by providing principles and tooling to make all production changes via automation, safe proxies, or audited break-glass.\n\n\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
