description: "Ewan Slater\nMaster Principal Sales Consultant, Cloud Platform Solutions - EMEA\nOracle\n\nContainers are increasingly the standard mechanism for packaging, delivering and deploying software. They provide a simpler, more lightweight architecturally significant form of virtualization than VMs. They are a natural candidate for running microservices. But can we do better? If we can simplify our containers, we can shrink them further, improving: - performance - security - management In this talk I'll be discussing: - advantages of microcontainers over containers - how to build and use microcontainers - open source tools (donated by Oracle) that can help."
