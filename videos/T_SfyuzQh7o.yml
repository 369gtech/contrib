language: German

description: "Further information: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/session/handling-billions-edges-graph-database\n\nThe complexity and amount of data rises. Modern graph databases are designed to handle the complexity but still not for the amount of data. When hitting a certain size of a graph, many dedicated graph databases reach their limits in vertical or, most common, horizontal scalability.\n\nIn this talk I'll provide a brief overview about current approaches and their limits towards scalability. Dealing with complex data in a complex system doesn't make things easier... but more fun finding a solution. Join me on my journey to handle billions of edges in a graph database.\n\nSpeaker:\nMichael Hackstein\nhttps://twitter.com/mchacki"
