language: English
recordingDate: 1555263232
description: 'The 12-factor app methodology (12factor.net) represents a best practice when comes to cloud application development and for the past years many developers employ it in order to facilitate both their current and future work. Kubernetes, with its cloud-agnostic container deployments, complements the 12 factors apps with their flavors across frameworks and cloud providers. This presentation is intended for all those curious on how to manipulate their code and Kubernetes as well in its use as a developer but also as operational. Each of the principles will be illustrated by a demo.'
