description: "JavaFX 3D usage has already begun to find a home within the Java ecosystem. In this session, a panel of JavaFX 3D experts provides live demonstrations of software tools that leverage JavaFX 3D effectively in industry and the community. The demonstrations include NASA applications for asteroid rendezvous and space telescope missions, leap motion devices, and third-party libraries such as F(X)yz. The moderator will lead in-depth questioning of the panel members, ranging from specific feature implementations to technical limitations and the justification behind decisions to use JavaFX 3D. If you are a JavaFX developer, you will learn how to accomplish the art of the possible with novel 3-D visualizations using JavaFX 8.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJames Weaver\nJames L. (Jim) Weaver is a Java and JavaFX developer, author, and speaker with a passion for helping rich-client Java and JavaFX become preferred technologies for new application development. Books that Jim has authored include Inside Java, Beginning J2EE, and Pro JavaFX 2.  His professional background includes 15 years as a systems architect at EDS, and the same number of years as an independent developer. As an Oracle Java Evangelist, Jim speaks internationally at software technology conferences.
