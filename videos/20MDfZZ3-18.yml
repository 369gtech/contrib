description: "A trending game called 2048 has gotten a lot of attention this year, with several implementations for mobile smartphones and tablets as well as online JavaScript versions. The new release of Java SE and JavaFX 8.0 comes with amazingly new features that enabled the developers to implement it very quickly and a Java version that could be run in any environment supported by Java SE 8, including a Raspberry Pi. In this session, the developers share with you everything they learned while developing this little game and introduce you to basic UI concepts for gaming development in JavaFX, animations, and CSS styling and show you how and when to apply lambda expressions and make good use of the Stream API.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBruno Borges\nundefined\nView more trainings by Bruno Borges at https://www.parleys.com/author/bruno-borges-8\n\n Jose?
