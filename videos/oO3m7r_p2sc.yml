description: "The expected massive growth of connected device, appliance and sensor markets in the coming years -- often called 'The Internet of Things' -- will need a more rich concept of 'open data' than is currently common. When data is generated through activities of people doing things inside their homes and outside in public in their cities, the question of who owns the data becomes almost irrelevant next to the questions of who has access to the data, what do they do with it, and how do citizens manage and make sense of their data while retaining the 'openness' that we've seen drive creativity and business on the web over the last few years.\n\nUsman Haque\n\nPachube.com\n\nUsman Haque is the founder of Pachube.com, a real-time data infrastructure for the Internet of Things used by tens of thousands of people around the world (acquired by LogMeIn Inc in 2011). Trained as an architect, he has created responsive environments, interactive installations, digital interface devices and dozens of mass-participation initiatives. His skills include the design and engineering of both physical spaces and the software and systems that bring them to life. He received the 2008 Design of the Year Award (interactive) from the Design Museum, UK, a 2009 World Technology Award (art), a Wellcome Trust Sciart Award, a grant from the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science and Technology, the Swiss Creation Prize, Belluard Bollwerk International, the Japan Media Arts Festival Excellence prize and the Asia Digital Art Award Grand Prize."
