language: English
recordingDate: 1600177299
description: 'Ever run code in CI/CD and builds pass only to fail during deployment? This presentation will discuss the advantages of Smoke Test patterns in CI/CD pipelines using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Learn how teams can leverage automation to ensure apps are tested live in target environments which provide valuable insights pre-deployment. Angel will demonstrate how to leverage IaC to provision infrastructure, deploy apps, test then destroy all the resources created in a single CI/CD pipeline run.'
