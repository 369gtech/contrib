recordingDate: 1557218621
description: "Have you ever run code quality analysis on a legacy code base?\n\nHow much technical debt did you have?\n\nSonarQube can be an invaluable tool for providing visibility on the quality of your code base. But when it reports 6 years of technical debt, where do you start? Often issues are tucked away in seldom visited corners of the code base, hiding real bugs.\n\nHow do you know which issues to fix? How do you get time to fix code that isnâ€™t necessarily broken? How do you motivate developers to work on messy code?\n\nIn Murex, we created Sonar Smash: A competition to crack the mountain of technical debt, thus motivating developers to fix these issues and to write new tests WITHOUT taking away from their day to day work.\n\nCome and learn how to run it yourself!\n\nWhether you have 2 days or 20 years of technical debt; Sonar Smash will\n* Get rid of the bed bugs in your code\n* Raise awareness of code quality\n* Help you identify and pitch larger refactoring projects\n* Get a grip on legacy code in a meaningful way\n* Be Fun!"
