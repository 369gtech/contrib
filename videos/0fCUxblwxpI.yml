description: "These past few weeks have been quite a learning experience and I'll be detailing everything here. I'm going to first share the work of 3 incredible entrepreneurs in Tanzania who are using AI to provide low-cost healthcare services to underserved people in their region. Then, I'm going to reflect on not just the Tanzania trip, but the past few weeks in general and what I've learned, including an apology. I feel so lucky to have gotten the chance to talk to these inspiring technologists, and I hope that they inspire you to create massive positive changes in your community too.
