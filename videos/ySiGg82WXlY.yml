description: "Speakers: RESHMI KRISHNA SENIOR CLOUD APPLICATION & PLATFORM ARCHITECT, PIVOTAL \nVINAY UPADHYA ADVISORY PLATFORM ARCHITECT, PIVOTAL\n\nTDD introduced many improvements into the development process with the biggest advantage relating to code design. As we move to a microservices based architecture, TDD becomes hard to implement across teams building different codebases. Consumer driven contracts (CDC) is like TDD but applied at the API level and is becoming more relevant in the world of microservices. It is a pattern for specifying and verifying interactions between different modules of an application. Spring Cloud Contract provides support for Consumer Driven Contracts and service schemas in Spring applications, covering a range of options for writing tests, publishing them as assets, asserting that a contract is kept by producers and consumers, for HTTP and message-based interactions. In this session, you will learn how we can implement TDD in microservices based architecture using Spring Cloud Contracts."
