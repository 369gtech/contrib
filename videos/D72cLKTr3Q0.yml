recordingDate: 1520945284
description: "Back in the day, large-scale monolithic systems ruled the world. While these systems worked well in their time, we saw them quickly fall apart in the 2000s. Architecture of large scale, distributed systems today is completely different from the old monolith and includes enchanting buzzwords like microservices, serverless, infra as a service & more.\nSo when I come to build my next system, even if I’m not yet sure it’ll server millions of users - should I go with the state of the art large scale solution or start with a simple monolith like architecture?\n\nIn this talk, Moran answers this question, by walking you through the evolution of such a system, from day 1 onwards - what patterns and tools should be there from day 1, the type of challenges you might face along the way when scaling up and best architecture practices to resolve them.\n\nMoran Zabatani - https://www.linkedin.com/in/moran-zabatani-683b6053/"
