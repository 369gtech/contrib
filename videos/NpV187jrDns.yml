description: "Introduction to BOSH-Deployed Service Instances on Cloud Foundry - Zoe Vance & Denise Yu, Pivotal\n\nThis talk will introduce at a high level how Pivotal leverages BOSH and Cloud Foundry using an Open Source project called the On-Demand Service Broker (ODB) to deliver single-tenant, isolated service instances for RabbitMQ, Redis, Pivotal Container Service (PKS), and many other products. This talk will introduce the basics of service adapter design and highlight use cases where the ODB may provide a helpful abstraction.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyX/introduction-to-bosh-deployed-service-instances-on-cloud-foundry-zoe-vance-denise-yu-pivotal"
