title: 'Patrick Baumgartner - The Power of Graph Databases'
recordingDate: 1445386078
description: 'We are surrounded by graphs: the social graph as well as the knowledge graph are just two common use cases, we face daily in our digital lives. Graph databases provide a modern and efficient solution to store graph-oriented data structures naturally. Many structured and associated data are stored schema free in vertices (nodes) and edges (relations) without using an index to query. With the known algorithms from graph theory, we can succeed to answer our questions on the connected data. This talk is an introduction to the topic of graph databases and compares them with relational databases. Other topics such as data modelling, querying, data import, typical use cases and experiences from the field are also discussed.'
