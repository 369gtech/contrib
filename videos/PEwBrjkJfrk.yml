title: 'How Multidimensional Search Trees Speed Up a Java Connection Pool'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474476711
description: 'What do geology, astrophysics, or graphical processing and a connection pool have in common? They all use advanced data structures and search algorithms known as kd-trees. Finding a specific database connection with several properties (p1, P2, P3) such as “give me a connection with any P1 value, a RANGE of P2 values, and a specific P3 value” is tricky and cannot be easily implemented with the standard/usual Java APIs and data structrures. This session explains approaches to optimizing connection pools with multidimensional searches in kd-trees and provides comparative performance benchmark results showing dramatic performance improvements.'
