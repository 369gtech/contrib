description: "It was 9 pm on a Friday and I was at work, my spouse called asking when I’d be home, my boss was all over me.\r\nI had been working on a proposal for 5 months and couldn’t get  team, vendor and client’s buy in!\r\nI became insufferable, even Ron, my best friend, declined our traditional Wednesday beer date.\r\nI changed jobs frequently, feeling disengaged (my ‘record’ was 4 hours) until I became physically ill.\r\nAfter a third round of antibiotics,\r\nI decided to quit another position and start working for myself. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/5NYvjSCMHMD"
