description: "I’m in the cloud—now what? Getting your Java application into the cloud is challenging, but keeping your application running smoothly can be just as hard. Once in the cloud, you need to answer questions such as  How many servers are running right now?   What are my slowest services?   What servers are having problems?   If I add more servers, will my performance increase?   Is my Java application running smoothly?  Monitoring and notifications are key to keeping your app running smoothly in the cloud. In this session, Java Champion and three-time JavaOne Rockstar Kevin Nilson covers tools such as Nagios, Graphite, Cloud Watch, Cubism, and Yammer Metrics for achieving real-time monitoring and notifications for your Java application that’s in the cloud.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nKevin Nilson\nKevin Nilson is currently a Principal Software Architect for a Large Financial Firm in Silicon Valley.
