title: 'Cloud Ready: Introduction to Distributed Streams'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502024411
description: "This talk interactively introduces the concept of Distributed Stream processing using the standard Java 8 Streams API, allowing what would traditionally be in-process streams to be processed across multiple Java processes, potentially deployed in a Cloud. We thus investigate how the regular Java Stream API may be utilized to process large data-sets and respond to streams of events, highlighting the challenges for developers, those providing support for distributed streams and the operational challenges faced using such techniques in production.\n\nBrian Oliver\nArchitect\nOracle"
