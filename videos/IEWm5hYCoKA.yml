description: "A creative mind can be a turbulent place. An unpredictable place. Wondrous at times, but mostly just a mix or nebulous neuroses and half-baked hypotheticals. This is the story of what happens when an idea sets forth upon these mercurial internal seas. Weâ€™ll explore its lifecycle: from the initial invincible conception, through to its inevitable demise at the hands of rationale and time.\n\nThis talk is designed to inspire you through confusion, motivate you through madness, and mostly just keep you off your phone for more than 30sec at a time.\n\nAlex Cornell\nProduct Designer\nhttps://twitter.com/alexcornell\nhttps://instagram.com/alexcornell\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
