description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nScaling ML pipelines with KALE — the Kubeflow Automated Pipeline Engine - Salman Iqbal, Learnk8s\n\nOne of the most common hurdles with developing AI and deep learning models is to design data pipelines that can operate at scale and in real-time. Data scientists and engineers are often expected to learn, develop and maintain the infrastructure for their experiments. What's the best setup and what's involved in getting models being production-ready? Where do you start? In this talk, you will learn about KALE — the Kubeflow Automated Pipeline Engine. With KALE you can finally link the work done by data scientists in Jupyter Notebooks to a production-grade pipeline that trains the models at scale and serves them in real-time."
