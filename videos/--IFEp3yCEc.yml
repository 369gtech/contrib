title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Lessons from Open-Source Journalism'
recordingDate: 1523549486
description: "Journalists and news organizations need powerful, accessible tools to do their work. Unfortunately, the open source development teams who want to help them are often divorced from the newsroom environment their software would live in. Bridging that gap requires cross-disciplinary collaboration\_and\_learning by both teams.\n\nThis session will explore lessons learned by one team of developers and editors as they worked to build powerful, reusable journalism tools for the next generation of reporters."
