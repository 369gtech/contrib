title: 'GeeCON Prague 2019: Vladimir Orany - Reflection-Free Applications with Micronaut'
recordingDate: 1574262662
description: 'Micronaut is a new framework designed for creating lightweight microservices with focus on the minimal memory footprint and deployment size. It is probably the only framework where GraalVM is a first-class citizen from day zero. Micronaut dependency injection mechanism is a reflection-free and proxy-free alternative to Spring. Let''s take a look on new addition into the Micronaut''s reflection-free ecosystem - Micronaut Data, native bean validation, bean introspection, new Jackson deserialization module. Micronaut provides compile-time dependency injection to minimize the memory overhead known from Spring. As it was created by the Grails team, Micronaut comes with easy to use the command-line interface. Java, Groovy and Kotlin languages are supported. Thanks to minimal startup time, you can deploy new instance in less than a second and you don''t need any special infrastructure for you integration tests - you just spin up an embedded server and you are ready to go. Micronaut is a perfect fit for serverless functions such as AWS Lambda.'
