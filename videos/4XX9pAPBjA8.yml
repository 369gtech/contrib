title: 'John Hann: Introducing RaveJS - Zero-config JavaScript applications [JSConf2014]'
recordingDate: 1405692235
description: 'Introducing RaveJS. Rave eliminates configuration, machinery, and complexity. Stop configuring and tweaking file watchers, minifiers, and transpilers just to get to a runnable app. Instead, go from zero to "hello world" in 30 seconds. In the next 30 seconds, easily add capabilities and frameworks to your application simply by installing *Rave Extensions* and *Rave Starter* packages from npm and Bower, the leading JavaScript package managers. Finally, install additional *Rave Extension* packages to apply your favorite build, deploy, and testing patterns.'
