But an emerging collection of open technologies aim to help bridge these social islands, allowing users to seamlessly move between sites and have unified conversations that span multiple web sites. Learn how OpenID, OAuth, Portable Contacts, ActivityStrea.ms, and Salmon can help you connect to the rest of the Social Web.\r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
