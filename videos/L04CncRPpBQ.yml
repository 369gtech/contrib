description: "Everyone is talking about event-driven architectures and streaming data. But you may not be using them successfully. If you haven’t started yet, you must learn to leverage the power of this approach. And even if you’ve already achieved a measure of success, you still want to ensure your business’s viability and long-term flexibility in design that responds well to the inevitable ongoing change. And why stop at event driven when your entire system can be reactive through message-driven architectures, both inside single services and across many collaborating services?\n\nSPEAKER: Vaughn Vernon –\_https://twitter.com/vaughnvernon\n\nDomain Model Whisperer & Author of DDD Books\n \nVaughn Vernon is a software developer and architect with more than 35 years of experience in a broad range of business domains. Vaughn is a leading expert in Domain-Driven Design, champion of simplicity and reactive systems, and the founder of the open source, DDD-friendly, reactive, vlingo/platform. He consults and teaches around Domain-Driven Design and reactive software development, helping teams and organizations realize the potential of business driven and reactive systems as they transition from technology driven legacy web implementation approaches. As he does so, he puts strong emphasis on embracing simplicity whenever possible. Vaughn is the author of three books: Implementing Domain-Driven Design, Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model, and Domain-Driven Design Distilled, all published by Addison-Wesley."
