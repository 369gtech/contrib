recordingDate: 1481037763
description: 'There are many tools, libraries and frameworks available for Android developers to test their applications. The jungle is huge and it''s not easy to find the right ones. Some frameworks are good for unit testing, some are good for instrumentation testing, and some can be used for both. Some have great capabilities but annoying weaknesses. Some are good for testing UI, other allow you to make good mocks. We will look at many frameworks, the popular ones like Mockito, Robolectric, Espresso, and some other.'
