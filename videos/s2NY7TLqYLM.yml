description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nPolicy Management in Kubernetes - Moving to a Centralised Management Model - Olive Power & Rachel Leekin, VMware \n\nPolicy management of enterprise resources is hard. The scope and the vast number of resources to which policy should be applied makes it so.   Current technologies in this area include OPA and OPA Gatekeeper, which bring to table the ability to discreetly define policies around workflows such as access, security, licensing and auditing.  We are seeing more offerings around central policy management that allow creation and management of policies spanning multiple Kubernetes clusters and namespaces    In this talk we will review the current offering in this space, and how these are being applied in production. We will discuss current development and where the future development areas will need to be.  We hope to provide a comprehensive outlook on how to deal with Policy management for your Kubernetes estate, that will satisfy the current policy requirements of current and future workloads. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp9a"
