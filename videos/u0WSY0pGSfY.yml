recordingDate: 1553179606
description: "Designing a user interface for a website or an application can be cumbersome and time consuming. In this talk, Salman will present a deep learning algorithm that creates the front-end code for a website based on a given mock-up.\n\nA brief introduction to deep learning will be given and a look at the details of the algorithm that is based on a paper by Tony Beltramelli titled pix2code. The algorithm has been implemented in ML.NET, an open source, cross-platform Machine Learning framework for C# & F#. Some good, bad and ugly results of the algorithm will also be shown.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
