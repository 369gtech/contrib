description: "“Attack is a technical problem. Defence is a politcal problem.” — Halvar Flake, keynote Blackhat Asia 2017.\n\nDefending an enterprise is a balancing act. I have worked as an offensive testing vendor to several global organisations over 18 years. This talk explores the challenges that today’s CISOs face – the threat landscape, overall shortage of infosec expertise, the ever evaporating shelf life of infosec products and an increased burden of compliance requirements. I will share my experiences from working with highly effective CISOs and internal infosec teams and what it takes to function on the razor’s edge.\n\n=== \n\nSaumil Shah is the founder and CEO of Net-Square, providing cutting edge information security services to clients around the globe.
