description: "Felix Dossmann\nDirector of Products and Innovation, Circlong Group\n\n\nCHANCES AND CHALLENGES OF THE ENTERPRISE MOBILITY MARKET\nBuilding apps for the enterprise market is something completely different than for end users. Customer processes, security demands, app distribution, testing, definition of done â€“ and a very different revenue model. \nThis talk will give you an introduction into why you should definitely get into coding enterprise apps, what to expect in the enterprise market and how to survive all this with a small team.\nExamples from successful (and not so successful) projects will be provided as well, a live demo will hopefully run flawlessly and enough time for Q&A will be provided."
