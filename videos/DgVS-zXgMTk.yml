description: "Announcement of the React Chrome Developer Tools http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/01/02/react-chrome-developer-tools.html\n\n\"React, the new open-source JS library from Facebook and Instagram, is a different way to write JavaScript apps. When it was introduced at JSConf US in May, the audience was shocked by some of its design principles. One sarcastic tweet from an audience member ended up describing React's philosophy quite accurately: https://twitter.com/cowboy/status/339858717451362304\nAt Facebook and Instagram, we're trying to push the limits of what's possible on the web with React. My talk will start with a brief introduction to the framework, and then dive into three controversial topics: Throwing out the notion of templates and building views with JavaScript, 're-rendering' your entire application when your data changes, and a lightweight implementation of the DOM and events.\"\n\nPete is a member of the React core team at Facebook and also the sole engineer on Instagram.com. He has also designed and implemented the video encode backend infrastructure for Facebook and Instagram and computer vision infrastructure and general front-end web engineering for Facebook photos. Pete likes to play guitar and rock climbing when he is not hacking.\n\nJSConf.Asia is the JavaScript, web and mobile developer conference for Asia. Hotel H2O and Manila Ocean Park, Philippines - 28 + 29 November 2013.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.asia/blog/2013/10/31/jsconfasia-2013-pete-hunt-react-rethinking-best-practices\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/floydophone/react-preso-v2\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
