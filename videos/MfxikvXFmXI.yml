description: "Object Oriented programming has many real benefits but one of its worst influences on User Interfaces is obscuring Data. Yet, dozens of MVC frameworks continue to grow and introduce leaky abstractions with middlemen like Models, Views, Controllers and Directives. React is simple. React, and their interfaces like Om and Reagent in Clojurescript, allow us to view the world of UIs\nin small, composable blocks. In this talk Priyatam will focus on React’s core principles—not the tools ,its ecosystem, and Clojure- script’s abstractions on ‘React as a Platform’: Data, Composition, and State Transitions.\n\nForward 4 kicks off in Feb 2015!
