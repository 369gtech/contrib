description: 'Java is a good all-purpose programming language, but does that mean it’s the best tool for all jobs? In this talk, you’ll see how Groovy is a serious language that can help solve a lot of problems. From scripts, to writing unit tests, to building projects, we’ll take you through use cases that highlight the advantages of having a second language in your toolbox. All of this through live coding.'
