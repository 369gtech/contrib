description: "?- predictable(reality).\nfalse.\n\n?- theory = practice.\nfalse.\n\nMost of us already owe prolog a debt indirectly via erlang.\n\nHowever, logic programming in and of itself has much to teach us about\napproaches to systems - taking declarative system descriptions to a new\nlevel of abstraction, and finding ways to integrate these ideas back into\nmore common workflows.\n\nFrom prolog to erlang to haskell to lisp to tcl and then back to prolog I\nhave journeyed, and I'd like to share some of the beautiful and brilliant\nthings I've discovered along the way and why I think they might make us\nbetter operations geeks.\n\nAnd when approaching new languages, always remember: You can't scare us,\nwe've used m4."
