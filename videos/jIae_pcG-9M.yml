description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012 \nPresenters: Mark Pollack, Jon Brisbin, Michael Hunger (Neo4j)\n\nThe Spring Data project is an umbrella project that provides a familiar and consistent Spring-based programming model for a wide range of data access technologies. Motivated by the rise of new NoSQL databases and Big Data solutions, there is support for Redis, MongoDB, HBase, Neo4j, Gemfire, Hadoop and Splunk. There is also a \"refresh\" of Spring's traditional support for JDBC and JPA. In this session, we will provide a guided tour of the Spring Data feature set, showing how you can quickly increase your productivity when creating applications that use these new data access technologies. Use cases unique to each technology will be discussed and demonstrated as well as where Spring Data provides some level of portability between different databases."
