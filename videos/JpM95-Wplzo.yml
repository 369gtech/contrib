title: 'gRPC for ASP.NET Core, a new framework for high performance APIs - James Newton-King'
recordingDate: 1573135405
description: "gRPC is a modern high performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that can run in any environment. gRPC is based on HTTP/2, Protocol Buffers and other modern standard-based technologies. Together with excellent tooling, it helps you create high throughput, low latency, real-time services.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce gRPC for ASP.NET Core, a new gRPC framework that Microsoft is contributing to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. I will compare gRPC with familiar REST-based JSON APIs, and recommend scenarios for using gRPC over other technologies. You will see how to integrate gRPC services with existing ASP.NET Core technologies like dependency injection, logging, and authentication, as we use gRPC to create lightning fast microservices and frontend applications.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
