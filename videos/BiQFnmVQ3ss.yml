description: "For teams familiar with traditional project phases, a common question when considering using an agile methodology is: Where does the creative team and its phases fit into an agile process?\n\nWhen,\_you never get a second chance to make a first impression, how do you design iteratively and \"fail fast\"?\n\nDesigners instinctively understand the importance of the initial encounter, uniquely rife with potential, between their work and the affected viewer.\_\n\nGiven this, one can understand the desire to work a design to perfection for the sake of a maximally effective experience event.\_\n\nThis can conflict with iterative\_“fail fast” agile concepts, resulting in Minimum Viable Products shipping with designs,\_wrangled away from designers, in a “less than” state.\n\nHow can we reconcile this for iterative, maximally effective, experience events?\n\nUsing mini case study examples, this talk further discusses substantial design projects which were built using agile methodologies and how the design team fit into the process.\n\nAn iteration of the slides can be found here.\n\n--\_\nKelly Albrecht is a Certified ScrumMaster, Product Owner, Agile Coach, and\_Senior Digital Producer\_at Last Call Media."
