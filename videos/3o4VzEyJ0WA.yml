description: "Machine learning and neural networks change how computers and humans interact, but they can be complicated to understand. In this episode of Coffee with a Googler, Laurence Moroney (@lmoroney) sits down with Christoper Olah (@ch402) from the Google Brain team to chat about Distill. Distill is a platform for interactive research, peer review, and community to make machine learning and neural networks more interpretable and accessible. Watch to get a deep dive into some of the research Distill focuses on, Lucid, Deep Dream, and more!\n\nVisit the site to start diving into research → https://distill.pub\n\nRead more about Feature Visualization → http://bit.ly/2JxzzBB\nRead more about Interpretability → http://bit.ly/2LNs1HB\n\nWatch more Coffee with a Googler → http://bit.ly/CoffeeWithAGoogler\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel → http://bit.ly/googledevs"
