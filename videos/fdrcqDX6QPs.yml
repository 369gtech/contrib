title: 'YOW! 2019 - Scott Shaw - Sensible Multicloud - An Enterprise Perspective'
recordingDate: 1582056006
description: "We've reached a turning point in public cloud adoption where established businesses, even in highly regulated industries, are going cloud-first and making plans to eliminate their fixed, on-premise hosting environments entirely. But this wholehearted embrace of cloud hosting also brings risk. It's easy to ignore how deeply entangled and interdependent you might be with your chosen cloud vendor. This works to the vendor's advantage and the steady adoption of ever-more-attractive, higher-order services only deepens the entanglement. For some businesses this may be entirely appropriate, but for others, it poses a difficult question; how do you take advantage of the amazing delivery acceleration and developer experience offered by cloud vendors while retaining control over your IT assets and choice of hosting vendor? The answer is developing a sensible, pragmatic multicloud strategy for your business.\n\nThis talk will summarise some of my experience consulting to enterprises in Australia. I’ll first review the state of public cloud adoption and examine why some businesses are falling short of their cloud expectations. Then I'll introduce a risk-based methodology for assessing the appropriate level of lock-in. Achieving cloud vendor portability introduces costs over the entire application lifecycle so I will show how to understand and balance those costs appropriately. Finally, I'll discuss some pragmatic architectural approaches to multicloud that avoid entanglement while minimising the amount of duplicated effort across vendors.\n\nAs the Head of Technology for ThoughtWorks in Australia, Scott divides his time between professional services leadership and consulting.
