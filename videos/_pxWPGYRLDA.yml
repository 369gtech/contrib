title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Estimates are dead, long live forecasting!'
recordingDate: 1506423024
description: "In May 2013 at Drupal Camp Dublin I gave a presentation titled \"The lost art of estimation\" it outlined some approaches\_and methods which I hoped would aid in everyone getting better, more accurate estimates. You could be forgiven for thinking that the naming of this\_session means I've changed my mind about estimates but, I still believe\_they're\_valid... in the right situation.\_The trouble tends to be with how\_estimates are used and as the figures we produce will always be used in a particular way, we should make sure to provide sufficient supporting information whenever figures are in the wild.\n\nIn this session, I'll outline the issues with using estimates, averages and other single-figure predictions and then walk-through an alternative approach using probabilities\_and Monte Carlo Simulations.\n\nYou do not need to be a mathematician to attend this session, everyone will come away with an understanding of:\n\nHow estimates can give a false picture for a project.\nThe cognitive bias involved during an estimation process.\nWhat data, at minimum, should be captured.\nWhen to run forecasts.\nHow to communicate probabilities.\nWhilst this session will show the benefits and potential\_of forecasting, a subsequent BoF/Workshop has been proposed to allow everyone to be guided through their first use of the available Open Source tools.\n\nhttps://events.drupal.org/vienna2017/bofs/forecasting-tools-project-teams"
