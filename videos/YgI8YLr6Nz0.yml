recordingDate: 1552996752
description: "By 2020, there will be 4 times more devices connected to the Internet around the world than today. While technology impacts our everyday life in almost every possible way, the solutions we create fail to reflect our society or the world we live in. Instead, they often reinforce stereotypes, prejudice, and differences.\nIn this talk, we will look into the lack of diversity and how diversity will make us more suited to solve problems and meet the needs of our society. We will address the culture in our communities, the reasons why minorities quit, and the importance of diversity in tech.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
