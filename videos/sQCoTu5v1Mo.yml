title: 'Antonio Andrade - Building a Data Platform with Datomic'
recordingDate: 1388413428
description: "All databases have schemas, and while Datomic provides a very flexible one, the need for working with higher-level data models, versioning them, evolving them, migrating their data from one version to another and enforcing arbitrary data constraints, often arise.\n\nWe'll discuss some of these challenges and describe how Datomic can be used to build a platform that addresses those needs, how its EAVT schema can be used as the building block of much richer data models, how to take advantage of reified transactions and why data immutability is often at the center of all of it.\n\nAntonio is a software engineer with a background in object-oriented, functional and array-based programming. He's deeply familiar with the challenges of building a cloud-based, enterprise data platform (he currently works at Appian Corporation, in the DC area, doing exactly that). In his free time, he's been figuring out how to solve some of those challenges using Clojure & Datomic."
