description: "Under a Microscope: Exploring Fast and Safe Rust for Biology by Samuel Lim\n\nEver wondered what goes on behind the scenes of breakthroughs in understanding proteins, viruses, our own bodies, and more?\n\nTake a deep dive as we journey through some of the workings of computational biology at large, along with its advantages and pitfalls. In this talk, we will see how Rust bridges the biological sciences with safe, performant, and scalable systems, and discuss how you can play a role even as a fresh Rustacean."
