description: "Intro: Scheduling SIG - Da Ma & Shivram Srivastava, Huawei \n\nA novel Flow Network Graph based Scheduling approach in Kubernetes: Todayâ€™s Kubernetes clusters can comprise of 5,000-10,000 nodes, increase by an order of magnitude from original design specs. The default Kubernetes scheduler dates back from earlier more modest deployments. It is queue-based, processing unscheduled pods in sequential fashion. For a large Kubernetes clusters, such scheduler processing logic can introduce long, even unbounded scheduling latencies, negatively affecting overall throughput for workload deployments. This talk outlines how Kubernetes is a victim of its own success, scheduling-wise. It lays out the current pod queuing challenges and describes a novel scheduling approach based on Flow Network Graph technique, enabling low workload scheduling latencies at scale. The presentation details the resulting extreme efficiencies and high quality placement decisions of such an approach and the accompanying pluggable scheduling policies. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPiV"
