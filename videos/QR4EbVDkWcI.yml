description: "Design can feel super intimidating when you feel more comfortable with code and don’t have a background in design. Knowing design basics and shortcuts can help your career in measurable ways: by helping you work more effectively with your coworkers as well as making it easier and faster for you to launch new projects from scratch without hiring a designer. This presentation will go over design for non-designers, skipping the university-level concepts and jumping right to shortcuts and easy-to-remember principles. Recommended for those who want to learn just enough design to be dangerous (or for designers who’d like to better teach their coworkers and colleagues); featuring quick hits, easy to understand and utilize principles that anyone can use to improve their design skills.\n\nEVENT:\n\nbtconfDUS2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nTracy Osborn\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nbeyond tellerrand Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nbeyond tellerrand YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/btconf"
