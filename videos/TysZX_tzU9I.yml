title: 'DEF CON 29 Cloud Village - Rami McCarthy - Cloud Security Orienteering'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631397890
description: 'Most of us are not lucky enough to have architected the perfect cloud environment, according to this month''s best practices, and without any legacy elements or ""surprise"" assets. Over the course of a career in cloud security, you''ll likely find yourself walking into a new environment and needing to rapidly orient yourself to both mitigate the biggest risks and also develop a roadmap towards a sustainable, secure future. As a security consultant, I had the challenge and opportunity to enter blind into a variety of cloud environments. They were across Azure, GCP, and AWS, some well-architected and others organically sprawling, containing a single account/project and hundreds. This gave me a rapid education in how to find the information necessary to familiarize myself with the environment, dig in to identify the risks that matter, and put together remediation plans that address short, medium, and long term goals. This talk will present a cloud and environment agnostic methodology for getting your bearings if tasked with securing a novel cloud environment.'
