description: 'Graphs are everywhere. Friended someone on Facebook? Graphs. Checked the best route to avoid traffic on Google Maps? Graphs. Those recruiters that keep spamming you with job offers on LinkedIn? They find you through graphs. We’re surrounded by problems that can be best represented and solved through graphs, and yet graph databases and processing frameworks remain an obscure niche accessible mainly to data scientists and academics. It’s time to right the injustice and bring graphs to the masses! This session is an introdution to Neo4j, OrientDB, GraphX, Giraph, and others.'
