description: "Cloud Foundry and ODPi Working Towards Enabling Cloud-Native, Data-Driven Applications - Roman Shaposhnik, Pivotal and Richard Pelavin, Reactor8 Inc.\n\nWhile Cloud Foundry Foundation drives global awareness, adoption and development of the de-facto open source, industry standard platform for cloud applications, ODPi is an open source foundation focusing on promoting and advancing the state of Apache HadoopÂ® and Big Data technologies for the enterprise. We believe that working together these two major open source efforts could accelerate the arrival of true cloud-native, data-driven applications for the enterprise. \n\nIn this talk we will describe how BOSH is shaping up to be a universal cloud abstraction layer allowing any ODPi certified product to achieve cloud portability and thus replacing a plethora of ad-hoc and single vendor tools. We will talk about how ODPi hopes to champion stateful use cases for BOSH allowing any data base-live service to benefit from CFF technology. Finally, we will spend time exploring options around standardizing data services and service brokers enabling application developers to start focusing on the holy grail of not only cloud-native, but cloud-native AND data-driven applications. \n\nRichard Pelavin \nRichard is a Co-Founder and CTO of Reactor 8, the company developing The DevOps Toolkit (DTK). DTK is a framework for Infrastructure and Application Developers working together to deliver Services to their perspective users/customers. The framework was born out of 3+ years of consulting/services work in the area of automation, application/service architecture and deployment, with a particular focus on distributed Services and related tooling which typically feature complex topologies and cross node dependencies.\n\nRoman Shaposhnik\nPivotal Inc.\nDirector of Open Source\nPalo Alto, CA\nRoman Shaposhnik is a Director of Open Source @Pivotal. He is a member of Apache Software Foundation, committer on Apache Hadoop, founder of Apache Bigtop and, as of late, a man behind ODPi curtain. Roman has been involved in Open Source software for more than a decade and has hacked projects ranging from Linux kernel to the flagship multimedia library FFmpeg. He grew up in Sun microsystems where he had an opportunity to learn from the best software engineers in the industry. At Pivotal, among other things, he was leading an overall open source effort of Pivotal Data products in 2015."
