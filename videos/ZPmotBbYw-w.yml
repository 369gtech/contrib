description: "Presented by Steve Souders at Fluent Conference 2012.\n\nAds, buttons, widgets - third party content is popular on today's websites. JavaScript provides a great way to mashup content from different sources. Unfortunately, in most cases each JavaScript snippet is capable of bringing down the entire site. Wha?! That's right - site outages aren't restricted to the backend, they happen on the frontend, too. Join Steve Souders as he talks about the prevalence of frontend SPOF, ways to avoid it, and a deep dive into snippet performance analysis.\n\nAbout Steve Souders\n\nSteve works at Google on web performance and open source initiatives.
