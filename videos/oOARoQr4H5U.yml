description: "Vasiliy Zukanov, Blogger, TechYourChance\n\nACTIVITIES AND FRAGMENTS ARE NOT MVX VIEWS\nIntermediate / Android Architecture / Talk\n\nInterest to MVC, MVP and MVVM architectural patterns among Android developers is at all-time high. Many different implementations for each of the MVx patterns have already been proposed, and it looks like there are more to come. In this session we will take a step back from specific implementations, and review a widespread assumption that Activities and Fragments should take on “view” responsibility in MVx architectural patterns."
