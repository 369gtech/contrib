language: English
recordingDate: 1433261836
description: "Recently there’s been a lot of buzz about replacing thin-client-based server-side web frameworks such as JSF with JavaScript-powered next-generation rich clients. Java EE—with its strong support for REST, WebSocket, and JSON—is well positioned to provide the back end for these kinds of applications. In this code-driven session, you will be introduced to tools and methodologies for benefiting from and simplifying the integration between the Java EE platform and the JavaScript platform. By the end of the session, you will understand the benefits of leveraging these platforms as well as the tools that have been created for this purpose.\n\n\nAuthors:\nGeertjan Wielenga\none of the Oracle product managers on the NetBeans Team\nView more trainings by Geertjan Wielenga at https://www.parleys.com/author/geertjan-wielenga-1\n\n Johannes Weigend\nJohannes Weigend works as a Java Developer and Architect since 1996.
