description: "Learning is a part of our survival and key to professional success. Understanding its nature helps us to become better learners. In our industry, where technologies and practices evolve so fast, effective learning is an absolute necessity. I will explore the nature of learning from learning styles to the tools that we use to learn. I will discuss our motivation for learning and the importance of active learning. It is too important for us to simply stumble through, our approach to learning must be deliberate.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2018, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
