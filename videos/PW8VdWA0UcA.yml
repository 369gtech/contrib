Under BP, complex systems are composed of many simple threads of behavior, called b-threads. B-threads communicate with each other using a synchronized, event-based protocol. BP has many traits interesting for software engineers: it is highly modular, concurrent, and (after a while) intuitive. Unlike objects or functions, b-threads align well with business requirements. But most importantly, systems written in BP are verifiable. That is - it is possible to formally prove they contain no bugs.\n\nThe ability to formally verify critical parts of a system, rather than merely testing them, can transform the way we create software. Even a programs written in \"scripting\" languages, such as Javascript, can be proven reliable and be used in mission critical systems. In fact, we are currently building a satellite controller prototype using this paradigm. In Javascript.\n\nThis talk will introduce the principles of BP, and BPjs - an open-source toolset for running and verifying behavioral programs written in Javascript. Participants will learn about one possible future of Software Engineering, and how they can start using it today.\n\n \nMichael Bar-Sinai From BGU/Harvard IQSS/Freelance\nFather of 3. Trained as a Software Engineer (Technion, Israel), completed Master's degree in CS, currently working on my PhD (CS too). Both advanced degrees are centered around the Behavioral Programming paradigm. Worked as a software engineer in companies big and small, and in some startups. Maintains a software consultancy focused on systems with positive social impact. A fellow at Harvard Institute of Quantitative Social Science, working on data science tools, privacy, and security."
