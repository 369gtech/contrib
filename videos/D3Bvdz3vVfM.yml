title: 'The Internet Isn’t What We Fight FOR, It’s What We Fight WITH, with Cory Doctorow'
language: English
recordingDate: 1563551025
description: "The world has problems that are much more urgent than internet policy: climate change, inequality, issues of race, gender and gender identity, and more. The internet is less important than all of these battles! But the internet is where we will have these battles – it’s the terrain on which we fight. It’s not what we fight FOR, but it’s what we fight WITH.\n\nThat is why it’s crucial to keep the internet free, fair and open, and to claw back the reversals we’ve faced on all three of these fronts. As the internet permeates more and more fields of endeavour, more and more power blocs see some advantage in selectively breaking the internet to make their jobs easier. Whether it’s copyright, national security, law enforcement, or policing hate speech, there’s an ever-expanding constellation of people who are indifferent to the impact on all the other uses of the internet and myopically focused on solving the problems the internet creates in their parochial corner of the world.\n\nCory Doctorow\nAuthor/Activist/Journalist/Blogger, craphound.com\nhttps://twitter.com/doctorow\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
