language: English
recordingDate: 1447405789
description: "At the Devoxx Steering comity we like to get our hands dirty each year. This year we wanted to go back to basics. Back are the conference badges, but we listened to our attendees and sponsors, so we want to give you a personalised badge, printed directly from our mobile scanner.\n\nBecause our printers we choose don't have a printer driver we decided to create our own. This quickie will go over the steps we took, from reverse engineering with WireShark till writing our own printer driver. You will learn some reverse engineering skills and gain some insights into the Android Printer framework."
