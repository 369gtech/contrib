title: 'Petitboot: Linux in the Bootloader'
recordingDate: 1548398288
description: "Sam Mendoza-Jonas\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/158/\n\nBack in 2014 Jeremy Kerr gave a talk at LCA Perth about a new Linux based bootloader and its potential for server applications.  A few years later and that potential has now become a reality as Petitboot is the primary bootloader for every OpenPOWER computer sold today, from the first POWER8 S812L server in 2014 to the POWER9 AC922 server that makes up the \"Summit\" and \"Sierra\" supercomputers that took out 1st and 3rd place in the Top500 last June.\r\n\r\nBased on popular open source tools like Buildroot and Busybox and using kexec as its booting mechanism gives Petitboot flexibility not only among OpenPOWER vendors and interested developers but makes it just as relevant on x86 and ARM, and has even found adoption outside of the POWER architecture.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will cover the Petitboot bootloader; what it is, how it works, the positives and the challenges of delivering an open source bootloader, how it fits in with the current bootloader ecosystem, and where we see Petitboot going in the future.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
