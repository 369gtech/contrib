description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nSince 2011, C++ has been on a massive roll. New C++ standards in 2011, 2014 and 2017. A growing number of new TSes and proposals for new features to be standardized. Following even just a few C++ luminaries on Twitter feels like drinking from a firehose: blog posts galore, radical new ideas, new techniques, new libraries, new conference videos, new open source projects... Does anyone else feel overwhelmed? \n\nIn this talk I will show you some techniques and tools to stay on top of modern C++ development and still keep your sanity. \n\nI'll show you how to use various simple forms of testing to get acquainted with new and unfamilar C++ techniques, how to write your own Clang-based tools to explore new libraries and code bases, how to use simple Python scripts that make it easier to reason about some of the more opaque corners of C++ (e.g. the preprocessor and error messages), and more.\n— \nIngve Vormestrand: IncludeOS\n\nIngve is a developer at IncludeOS, where he works on the implementation of a new unikernel operating system. His professional experience includes web and mobile app development, and he is very enthusiastic about open source.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
