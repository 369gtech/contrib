description: "Erlang has been around for nearly 30 years, and even though it essentially runs European telecom, many programmers are just starting to hear about it. In our fourth episode of Breaking Open, Joe Armstrong sits down for a frank discussion on the language he co-invented.\n\nJoe and our host, Marakana CEO Marko Gargenta, discuss the provenance and motivations of the language, where it exists in the open source landscape, and how the tasks it was designed to handle three decades ago are especially relevant today, such as concurrency.\n\n\"It wasn't designed for big data, but it was designed for massive concurrency. If you go to planetary-scale computations, or very, very large-scale computations, you have to make these things self-repairing and self-configuring.\"\n\n** Interested in Erlang training?
