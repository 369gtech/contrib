description: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is one of the most popular protocols nowadays. Itâ€™s the language most servers, clients, and even teapots can speak. Learn how and why it became such an ubiquitous part of the web by following the evolution of HTTP.\n\nIn regards to web performance, have you ever wondered why are we using minimization, concatenation, image spriting, resource inlining and other little hacks? Befriend the browser and help it to help you deliver the best user experience possible. Find out how TLS and HTTPS affect performance and what to look forward in HTTP/2.\n\nThis talk will contain references to archaic RFCs, lots of diagrams and long lists of best practices."
