description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nWith the rise in momentum and adoption of Command and Query Responsibility Segregation and Event Sourcing, so has the importance of projections. Yet, information on the role they play and what are useful approaches is spread thin. This talk is an attempt to cover that gap. We'll look at the various ways to go about designing, authoring, and testing projections, keeping it practical along the way.\n\nYves Reynhout is a Belgian software developer with a keen interest in the technical, people and functional aspects required to deliver value in the form of working software."
