Storing them in database is important because it enables end user to configure it by themselves rather than depending on the developers to manage them. Learn how you can effectively store and manage authorization rules on database, effectively utilize policy-based authorization system such as Pundit for this purpose and learn about database design that can handle authorization better.\n\nSpeaker's Bio\nGio is software developer from Jakarta, Indonesia whom currently works for two startups; Starqle and Virkea that mostly do enterprise software developments.
