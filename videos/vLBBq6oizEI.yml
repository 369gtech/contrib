description: "Preprocessors, Components, and CSS in JS or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Website\n\nBehance’s codebase has existed in various states for over 7 continuous years – which includes multiple major redesigns, brand overhauls, backend framework changes, JavaScript frameworks, CSS preprocessors, templating languages, feature births and deaths, product integrations, and more.\n\nAnd now, we are working on our latest project: moving our JavaScript and Sass to Vue.js and CSS Modules.\n\nIn her talk at CSSconf EU 2018, Jackie Balzer explores her journey over the years, from how to choose which technologies to implement, how to piecemeal large rewrites while maintaining developer sanity and website integrity (and how to cut corners gracefully), how to manage technical debt, and finally, how to be at peace with the reality of a fragmented codebase.\n\nCSSconf EU will be back on May 31st 2019: https://2019.cssconf.eu/"
