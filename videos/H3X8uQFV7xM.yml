title: 'Kevin Goldsmith: Leading Distributed Teams at Stretch Conference 2020'
recordingDate: 1582182003
description: "In this talk, Kevin Goldsmith discusses four main challenges to leading distributed teams: Conway’s Law, Amdahl’s Law (as applied to organizations), Empathy, and Communication. He gives examples of these problems and solutions from his experience leading distributed teams over the last 25 years.\n\nDistributed teams can either be very powerful, finding the best developers wherever they are, or it can be a nightmare of bad video meetings and flame wars.\n\nWhat makes distributed teams especially challenging? How can we address these challenges to make our distributed organizations more effective?\n\nStretch is a non-profit leadership and management conference that brings 500 attendees and 16 speakers from all around the world who want to build effective organizations since 2013. An international platform and community for leaders and managers to share stories, hands-on solutions and explore new trends and ideas to lead, fail, learn and stretch.
