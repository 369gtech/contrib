title: 'Jesper de Jong. Modern microservices with Scala, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud'
recordingDate: 1470989705
description: 'Microservices is a style of software architecture in which complex applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate with each other over the network and that can be deployed and maintained independently. The microservices architecture style is becoming more and more popular since companies such as Netflix, Amazon and eBay have shown how this is useful for building and operating large, cloud-scale software systems. Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are part of the well-known Spring Framework which help you design, build and run systems composed out of microservices. Scala is one of the most popular programming languages for the JVM besides Java which brings a lot of powerful features that make you a more productive and better overall software developer. In this talk we will take a look at using the Scala programming language with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud to build microservices. The following questions will be answered: - What are microservices and what are the advantages and disadvantages of a microservices architecture? - What are Spring Boot and Spring Cloud and how are these useful for building microservices? - What are the advantages of using Scala instead of Java and how do you practically use Scala for building microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud?'
