title: 'Corniel Nobel - Single Value Objects: where DDD and Functional Programming Share Forces'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620208514
description: "Most developers have the habit of reusing primitives for everything. This phenomenon, known as primitive obsession, leads to unclear code and (API) contracts, and eventually to bugs.\n\nBy creating single value objects (value objects that are a subset of one primitive) we can overcome that, and by doing so, we apply the lessons learned from Domain-Driven Design and Functional programming."
