description: "Keynote: The Shift to a New Digital Allianz Germany - Dr. Daniel Poelchau, Allianz\n\nThe fast progress of digitalization is a challenge for Allianz Germany. Customers compare the value of products and services of their insurance companies to the intuitive offerings they are used to from other industries. Additionally, there is a growing number of Startups and InsurTechs shaping the market with innovative ideas and their aim to take possession of the customer interface. This means: in order to be still market leader in ten years, Allianz Germany needs to get digital by default and to be fully geared to customersâ€™ needs and expectations of the digital age.\n\nWe recognized the necessity for a wide-ranging digital transformation at Allianz Germany and translated the key factors into our corporate strategy. Of course, two decisive factors are the shift towards a co-located and agile software development together with the implementation of an elastic Cloud Foundry infrastructure which offers easy scalability of successful products.\n\nAbout Dr. Daniel Poelchau\nDaniel Poelchau is currently Head of Digital Factory @ Allianz Germany, after having held various positons at Allianz Group since 2010. Before that Daniel spent 8 years with McKinsey."
