title: 'FP & DDD - Functional Programming and Domain-driven Design - a match in heaven! (Marco Emrich)'
language: German
recordingDate: 1589289779
description: "Many concepts that play a role in DDD / domain-driven design can be implemented very easily with functional programming (FP) like ReasonML. These include \n• Hexagonal Architecture\n• Describing invariants\n• Stateless Services \n\nThis talk demonstrates how to implement many concepts of Domain-driven Design elegantly and effectively using examples of functional languages (e.g. ReasonML) as well as classic languages - used functionally (e.g. TypeScript). A look at the integration into classical languages and architectures provide the opportunity to actually use these techniques in practice.\n\nSLIDES: https://marcoemrich.github.io/fp_ddd/#/\n\nSPEAKER: Marco Emrich – https://twitter.com/marcoemrich\n\nSoftware Crafter at codecentric\n\nMarco is a Senior Consultant at codecentric. As a passionate advocate of software crafting and code quality, Marco has many years of experience in architecture and development. He regularly lectures at well-known conferences and is author of several programming books. When he is not organizing the Softwerkskammer Nuremberg (developer meetup), he is probably explaining to his son how to program robotic turtles."
