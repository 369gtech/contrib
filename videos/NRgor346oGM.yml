description: "Dylan Beattie started building data-driven web applications on Microsoft Windows way back in 1997, when best practice meant COM objects and stored procedures, and dial-up modems were still a pretty neat idea. Two decades later, the web has transformed the world we live in, and the software industry has changed almost beyond recognition. Weâ€™ve gone from ASP and stored procedures to agile, devops, virtualization, JSON, cloud, NoSQL, mobile apps - and yet we still find ourselves facing a lot of the same challenges we had back in the days of the dot-com bubble and the Y2K bug. How do you focus on solving the important problems when there's so many exciting new patterns and frameworks you should be investigating? How do you decide when to adopt new technologies? How do you hire good people? How do you manage legacy systems?\n\nIn this talk Dylan will share lessons and experience from two decades of managing software teams and building web apps on Microsoft platforms. As each new generation of developers enters our industry, they're starting out a journey of their own - and maybe there's some insight from the last two decades that we can share to make their journeys easier."
