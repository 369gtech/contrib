recordingDate: 1475913107
description: "Computers once filled up entire rooms and were programmed by punching holes in cards. Today, the phones we carry in our pockets are more powerful than those computers and we can program them using their touch screens in expressive, powerful, even visual programming languages.\n\nOur tools evolve at the exponential rate of technology and we must invest in constantly improving our knowledge if we are to keep up.\n\nIt is, however, too easy to get caught up in this “race for the latest” and to see every new technology as an inevitable step in a ladder that spans objectively from the past to the future. It’s important that we don’t get lost in such a shallow, technologically-deterministic view of the world.\n\nWhile learning to use the latest and greatest tools is important, we must also develop a critical reading of technology and its place in society. When constantly getting faster and faster engines for your car, it’s good sometimes to make sure that the breaks and steering still work and that you’re heading in the direction that you really want to be going.\n\nSpeaker\nAral Balkan is a designer with over three decades of coding experience. He’s one-third of Ind.ie, a tiny two-person-and-one-husky social enterprise working for social justice in the digital age.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
