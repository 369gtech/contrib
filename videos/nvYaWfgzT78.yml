Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nIntro: Brigade - Matt Butcher & Radu Matei, Microsoft \n\nBrigade is a lightweight, Kubernetes-native framework which allows the creation of event-driven workflows. Using JavaScript, Brigade chains together containers and controls their execution in an in-cluster scripting environment that enables easy error handling and data sharing. In this session, you will learn how to get started with Brigade, how to use the existing GitHub, CloudEvents and generic event support and integrate them in your workflow, and how different companies are using Brigade to automate their internal workflows (from code quality assessment and security scanning, to automatically generating preview environments for each pull request), and ultimately allow teams to build massively distributed workflows using a few lines of JavaScript. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uahq"
