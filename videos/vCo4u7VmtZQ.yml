title: 'Effective Java with Groovy'
recordingDate: 1586856919
description: '''Effective Java'' is probably the best book ever written for Java programmers. It presents the most effective ways of using the language. Since Groovy is a JVM language, most of the suggestions from Effective Java are equally relevant for Groovy developers. But one has to take caution before using their Java implementations. Also, Groovy provides out of the box constructs for many of such good practices. In this talk, I will walk you through code examples that follow these good practices, highlighting the Groovier way of implementing the ''Effective Java'' suggestions. As a participant, you will walk away appreciating the simplicity with which Groovy empowers the developers. The talk will also provide food for thought - how a language can influence its users to adopt right practices.'
