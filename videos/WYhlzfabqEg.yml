description: "Everyone can probably tell a story of a last-minute situation that jeopardizes an entire project and months of hard work. Building interactive installations means mixing and matching technologies, bridging physical and digital, and connecting people with machines. Every new setup and location is different — while you can plan and prepare for a lot of things back in the office — there’s always something on location that will keep you on edge until the end.\n\nWe’ll show you concrete examples of how to prepare for the worst — how we break down big projects into small pieces, pick the right code languages, create prototypes, work in parallel with designers, prepare for different environments and create apps to monitor our installations.\n\nDaniel Scheibel\nCo-Founder / Technical Director, Red Paper Heart\nhttp://www.twitter.com/dscheibel\n\nAdrià Navarro\nLead Creative Coder, Red Paper Heart\nhttps://twitter.com/navadria\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
