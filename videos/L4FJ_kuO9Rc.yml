recordingDate: 1389911969
description: "www.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a two day, single track conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 500 to 700 Developers from across the country will converge on beautiful Salt Lake City, UT to participate in training sessions by the Google Angular team, and other Angular experts. In addition to the invaluable training, ng-conf will deliver a premier conference experience for attendees, providing opportunities to network with other developers, relax at social events, and engage in some of the unique entertainment opportunities available in Utah.\n\nSharon DiOrio\nTopic: Filters: Beyond OrderBy and LimitTo\n\nWhat happens when your data comes back from your service but it isn't exactly formatted or ordered the way you want? Or if your users want more control over how the data is displayed? No need to make another service call or invoke some intermediate service to format the data, filters do the work for you. Directives get all all the praise, but filters are fantastic tools for data transformations big and small. They are lightning fast, almost unlimited in flexibility, and in many cases can even make directives unnecessary. Tied to user-interactions, you can thrill and delight your users by handing them back exactly the data they wanted in a way that makes the most sense to them. I'll explain how filters actually work behind the scenes and show a few useful examples of built-in and custom filters beyond the usual \"filter\" and \"orderBy\" examples commonly found in tutorials."
