recordingDate: 1413784029
description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl)\n26th of September 2014\n\nEnrico Campidoglio - \"Why No Code Reviews\" \n\n\"It’s undisputed that regular peer reviews are one of the most effective ways to maintain high quality in a code base. Yet, so many development teams choose not to adopt them for their software project. In the publishing industry, no written word ever sees the light of day before it has gone through an extensive period of critical review. This applies to books, scientific papers and newspaper articles alike. Why not software?\n\nIn this session we’ll explore the social and practical reasons why code reviews aren’t as widely adopted in modern software development shops as they should be. We’ll also look at a few concrete tools and techniques that teams can put in place to help them overcome the most common road blocks. In the end, we’ll see how code reviews help peers leverage each other’s knowledge and skills to ensure their work is as good as it can possibly be.\""
