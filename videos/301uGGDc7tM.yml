title: 'Miniconf Keynote: The Who of CSIRAC'
recordingDate: 1580301558
description: "Roland Gesthuizen, Gillian Kidman, Hazel Tan, Caroline Pham\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/181/\n\nThis is the incredible human story of the creators of CSIRAC Australia's first digital computer, and the fifth stored program computer in the world. We trace the story of the men and women behind its creation, use and decommission. Whilst we acknowledge that there is a strong documented history of CSIRAC itself, we wish to illuminate the human story of this open-source creation to reveal the creators and makers of the code that contributed to some fascinating ‘firsts’. Who were these people and what inspired them to imagine, tinker, and create? These and many other questions will be considered as we take you on the journey of CSIRAC and from its legacy, reveal a message about our digital world today.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 10:45:00 2020 at Room 9"
