Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\ngRPC Deep Dive: Prevent Your Service From Overtaking Itself - Lidi Zheng, Google \n\nIn any distributed system, it is very common to have mismatched processing power on sending (client) and receiving (server) side. This can result in failures or excessive buffering of messages on either side leading to out-of-memory situation. Fortunately, gRPC has a flow control mechanism that transparently throttles the traffic to protect both services. In this presentation, we will dive into how does networking protocols (like TCP, HTTP, gRPC) control traffic, and how gRPC flow control facilitate your usage of the bandwidth between your services. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uafi"
