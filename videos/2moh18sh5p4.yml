title: 'C# Async / Await - Make your app more responsive and faster with asynchronous programming'
language: English
recordingDate: 1516981586
description: "Asynchronous programming can be intimidating. What's even worse is when you think you learned how to do something and then you try it in your application and it doesn't work. This video is an attempt to fix all of that. In it,  you will see how to use the async and await keywords to make your user interface more responsive and to speed up your code's operation. You will also see how to turn an existing method from being synchronous to asynchronous. Along the way, we will cover best practices and how to make sure our application behaves like we expect after we make a part of it asynchronous.\n\nNewsletter signup (with exclusive discounts):  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/ (your email will be kept safe and you will not be spammed).\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=AsyncAwaitInCSharp"
