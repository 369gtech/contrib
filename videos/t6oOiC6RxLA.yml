description: "*SORRY FOR THE SOUND ISSUE. IT ENDS AT 1:23 MIN.*\n\nFlink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nDominik Bruhn,  Director of Platform Engineering at Relayr \n\nThis talk will focus on how to package, distribute and deploy Flink Jobs by leveraging existing docker technology: Previously deploying of Flink Jobs has been a manual job which leads into errors. In this talk, we present an approach which works well in an CI/CD environment by automating most steps: From the code of a Flink Job in a repository to a running Job on an YARN cluster.\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/FlinkForward/flink-forward-berlin-2017-dominik-bruhn-deploying-flink-jobs-as-docker-containers\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
