title: 'Mariah Hay - The PM Misconception: Why Everyone and No One is Prepared to Manage Product'
recordingDate: 1518001331
description: "It’s an exciting time to be in tech, but the pathway to a product management position remains shrouded in a fog of mystery. Job descriptions are unclear, roles vary from company to company, and there are few educational programs available to shed some light on what set of skills are needed. So what is someone looking to make a transition to a job like this to do? Today Mariah will tackle pinning down what knowledge is needed for a role that is “ambiguous by nature,” and talk about why many people and companies lack understanding of the true scope of the role.\n\nUsing case studies, Mariah will illustrate the true value a PM brings to both would-be practitioners and team leaders who are interested in learning more about the skills and knowledge needed to be a successful product manager.\n\nMariah Hay\nhttps://twitter.com/mariahhay\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
