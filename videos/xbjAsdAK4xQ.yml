description: "Get the Code Here: http://goo.gl/AZU3C\n\nBest Design Patterns Book : http://goo.gl/W0wyie\n\nHere is my Abstract Factory design pattern tutorial. I also take a second look at the Factory design pattern here as well.\n\nThis is considered a hard pattern to understand, but I consider it to be a combination of all you have learned previously. You just need to understand that each step is separated by either a abstract class or an interface. This makes it possible to make extremely flexible objects."
