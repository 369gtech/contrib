title: 'Better performance with HTTP/2 by Julien Viet'
language: English
recordingDate: 1478765795
description: "The HTTP/2 protocol is the latest evolution of the HTTP protocol addressing the issue of HTTP/TCP impedance mismatch. Web applications have been working around this problem for years employing techniques like concatenation or css spriting to reduce page load time and improve user experience. HTTP/2 is also a game changer on the server enabling increased concurrency. This talk will focus on the impact HTTP/2 will have on the server and examine how particularly well adapted the Vert.x concurrency model is to serve HTTP/2 applications.\n\nJulien Viet is the Vert.x project lead and works at Red Hat. Julien has been developing open source software since 2002. Julien holds an engineering degree from Institut National des Télécommunications.\n\n[BED-6160]"
