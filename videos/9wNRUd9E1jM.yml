description: "Following up last week's App Engine GDL event (https://developers.google.com/live/shows/76184973/), in this hangout we'll showcase the Cloud Endpoints Proto Datastore library (http://endpoints-proto-datastore.appspot.com/), which allows ProtoRPC message classes to be directly tied to the models used to persist objects. In addition, rather than interacting with ProtoRPC messages in our API methods, we'll show how to directly interact with the entities that live in the datastore.\n\nCode sample available for download at:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/endpoints-proto-datastore/downloads/detail?name=cloud_endpoints_tasks_sample.zip"
