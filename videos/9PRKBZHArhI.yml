title: 'LISA18 - Unikraft: Unikernels Made Easy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1542323935
description: "Simon Kuenzer, NEC Laboratories Europe GmbH\n\nAbstract: \nUnikernels are still terrible to develop and maintain. Applications have to be ported manually to non-standard OSes before gaining from impressive benefits, like superb performance, great isolation, and a small trusted compute. Unikernels can be instantiated in tens of milliseconds or less. They are tiny with low memory footprints of a few MBs or even KBs. They can achieve high network throughput of 10-40 Gb/s with a single CPU core and they enable running thousands of concurrent instances.\n\nWe are going to present the Xen/Linux Foundation's open source Unikraft project. Its high level goal is to provide an automated tool to build unikernels without requiring the time-consuming, expert work as today. In addition, Unikraft targets support for multiple \"platforms\": Xen, KVM, containers and bare-metal. Images are automatically produced for multiple of these platforms without requiring any additional time from users.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
