recordingDate: 1535355086
description: "Video recording of a presentation given at JDK IO conference in Copenhagen in June 2018 at the IT-University organized by the Danish Java User Group - Javagruppen.\n\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/220-kenneth-finnigan\n\nServiceMesh with Istio and Eclipse MicroProfile\n\nSpeaker: Kenneth Finnigan\n\nEven though ServiceMesh has not been around for long, you are probably hearing a lot about it. It’s gained a lot of steam with respect to Cloud Native development, Linux Containers, and Kubernetes. This session will introduce the attendee to the ServiceMesh concept, what it is, how they work, and why we should use them. We follow that up with an introduction to Istio before delving into how we can combine Istio and WildFly Swarm (Red Hat’s MicroProfile implementation) on OpenShift to reduce the amount of boilerplate we need when developing Cloud Native applications to utilize circuit breakers, tracing, etc. Come in curious (or even skeptical) and leave pumped to go home and get going with the awesomeness."
