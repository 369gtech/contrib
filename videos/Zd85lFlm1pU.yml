This interactive session involves using kubectl, curl, and common command-line tools to interact with Kubernetes APIs. \n\nBy the end of this lab, you’ll be deploying, scaling, and automating JS-based distributed solutions using containers, Kubernetes, and other popular open source tools for distributed computing. These examples are designed to show JS developers how to maintain speed and productivity with a container-based development workflow.\n\n\n***\n\nZeet helps anyone deploy and scale like the top tech companies, without the work.
