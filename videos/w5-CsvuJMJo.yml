description: "Which ASP.NET Core project type is the best? Is MVC dead or is that the way to go? How about Blazor? Which one should I use? Is Blazor ready for production?\n\nCourse with Coupon: https://www.udemy.com/course/which-aspnet-core/?couponCode=MAY2020\n\nI get questions like these daily and I'm sure there are even more of you who haven't asked me yet but who are wondering about the answers. The problem is that there is not one right answer. As with most software development questions, the answer is that it depends. It depends on what your specific circumstances and needs are. It also depends on which ones you actually know how to use.\n\nThat is why I decided to create a course titled Which ASP.NET Core. Not only do we answer all of these questions, we also get a much deeper understanding of which types are best in which situations, what each type is designed to do, what the weaknesses are of each, and how they can all work together.\n\nBut there is a lot more than that, including five full projects, so let's take a look at the course and see all that it has to offer."
