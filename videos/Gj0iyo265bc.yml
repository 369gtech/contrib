description: "Last time we wrote an image classifier using TensorFlow for Poets. This time, we’ll write a basic one using TF.Learn. To make it easier for you to try this out, I wrote a Jupyter Notebook for this episode -- https://goo.gl/NNlMNu -- and I’ll start with a quick screencast of installing TensorFlow using Docker, and serving the notebook. This is a great way to get all the dependencies installed and properly configured. I've linked some additional notebooks below you can try out, too. Next, I’ll start introducing a linear classifier. My goal here is just to get us started. I’d like to spend a lot more time on this next episode, if there’s interest? I have a couple alternate ways of introducing them that I think would be helpful (and I put some exceptional links below for you to check out to learn more, esp. Colah's blog and CS231n - wow!). Finally, I’ll show you how to reproduce those nifty images of weights from TensorFlow.org's Basic MNIST’s tutorial.\n\nJupyter Notebook: https://goo.gl/NNlMNu\n\nDocker images: https://goo.gl/8fmqVW\n\nMNIST tutorial: https://goo.gl/GQ3t7n\n\nVisualizing MNIST: http://goo.gl/ROcwpR (this blog is outstanding)\n\nMore notebooks: https://goo.gl/GgLIh7\n\nMore about linear classifiers: https://goo.gl/u2f2NE\n\nMuch more about linear classifiers: http://goo.gl/au1PdG (this course is outstanding, highly recommended)\n\nMore TF.Learn examples: https://goo.gl/szki63\n\nThanks for watching, and have fun!
