description: "\"Twitter: From Ruby on Rails to the JVM\"\n\nRaffi Krikorian\n\nTwitter\n\nAt Twitter, @raffi leads the Applications Services group, the custodians of Twitter's core logic -- his teams manage, amongst other things, the business logic, scalable delivery, APIs, and authentication of Twitter's application. Previously, he was the lead of the public APIs as well as being the one of those behind Twitter's Geospatial APIs.\n\nBefore Twitter he used to create technologies to help people frame their personal energy consumption against global energy production (Wattzon -- Business Week's \"Best Idea\" 2008), and also ran a consulting company building off-the-wall projects. At one point, he used to teach at NYU's ITP (created the class \"Every Bit You Make\") and spent way too much time as a student at MIT and the MIT Media Lab (Internet 0 -- Scientific American September 2004)."
