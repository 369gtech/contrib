description: "When a team moves into real-time big data, they tend to focus on the technical challenges ahead of them. Teams should know that there are both technical and management challenges that they will face during this journey. This talk covers the balancing act that data team managers and members deal with. I share some of the shared experiences that every manager and member of a data team should know. However, these issues aren’t well known or talked about. This makes managers or team members think they’re alone or unique in facing these issues. The reality is that these are common issues and they should be addressed. These common issues include:\n\n- Batch to real-time. How does goes from batch to real-time affect the team?\n\n- Data product usage. How can management ensure that real-time data products are used by the rest of the organization?\n\n- Dealing with the politics of the organization. How do you get data from people siloed due to politics?\n\n- High bandwidth connections in data teams. How do you create high bandwidth connections between the teams to allow for the fastest help and least friction?\n\n- Communicating the value of data teams to the rest of the organization. How do managers educate the rest organization on what they do and the value each data team creates?\n\n- Getting credit to data engineering and operations. How do managers make sure that all credit for the work doesn’t just go to the data scientists?\n\n- Creating the right ratio of data scientists to data engineers. What should the right ratio of data engineers to data scientists be?\n\nThis talk is based on the Working as a Data Team chapter of my forthcoming Data Teams book from O’Reilly. Main Takeaways: There are common, real-world issues that every data team manager and team member should know. Managers need to know and understand the balancing act they need to deal with in order to create data products. Managers should know and address the common issues in working together as a data team."
