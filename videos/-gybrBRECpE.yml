description: "In microservices architectures, it is difficult to understand how services use resources across shared infrastructure. In monolithic systems, we depend on traditional tools that report per-process resource usage and latency characteristics that are limited to a single process. In order to be able to collect and analyze resource utilization and performance characteristics of distributed systems, OpenCensus tracks resource utilization through the chain of services processing a user request.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n    Provide an overview of distributed tracing;\n    Provide an overview of metrics collection;\n    Introduce OpenCensus and why choose it over competitors ;\n    Have audience members coming away knowing how to get started tracing, instrumenting and reporting from their Erlang applications.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/iliia-khaprov/"
