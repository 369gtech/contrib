recordingDate: 1510512576
description: "Monica Beckwith has worked with the Java Virtual Machine for more than a decade not just optimizing the JVM heuristics, but also improving the Just-in-time (JIT) code quality for various processor architectures as well as working with the garbage collectors and improving garbage collection for server systems.\n\nDuring this talk, Monica will cover a how the performance trifecta drives innovations in the OpenJDK HotSpot Java Virtual Machine. Monica will talk about these optimizations based on the performance drivers. She will cover 3 of the garbage collectors - Parallel, CMS and G1 and a few JIT and Runtime optimizations."
