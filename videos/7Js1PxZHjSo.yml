description: "Paris Buttfield-Addison, Jon Manning, Tim Nugent\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/84/\nOpen data, such as that provided by many governments around the world is cool. It’s fantastic to see countries around the world opening as much as they can, allowing citizens and interested parties to build upon and enhance the myriad of interesting information collected by countries. There’s a lot of people doing great work with this sort of data, but they have to be extremely passionate, engaged, and motivated in order to want to get involved.\r\n\r\nWe found another way. For the last three years we’ve been participating in government-data-focused hackathons, and turning them into game jams.\r\n\r\nThis session explores why this is a good idea, and how you might want to do it to. We cover:\r\n\r\n* conceiving of game ideas based on normally dry open data sets (we once made a Pokemon-style battle game based on the energy efficiency data provided by the government energy regulator, it helped you figure out if your fridge was efficient by letting you battle it against other people’s fridges);\r\n\r\n* preserving the spirit and meaning of the data in games you make with it;\r\ntools for parsing and interpreting the data, and making it usable for your games (we’re very good at Perl, Awk, Sed, and R now);\r\n\r\n* getting out and engaging people with your data-based games, and making sure people don’t draw the wrong conclusions from what your game shows them (while still having fun – it is a game after all!)\r\n\r\nWe’ve built games –– often at GovHack in Australia that do everything from turn your local politician’s parliamentary voting history into a party game, to parsing and interpreting a giant database incorporating all the functional roles in a government, and turning it into a SpaceTeam style party game. We’ll tell you how you can do the same thing in your community, how to make it engaging and meaningful, why you might want to do this, and how to get started."
