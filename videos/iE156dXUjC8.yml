title: 'YOW! 2019 - Todd L  Montgomery - Level Up: Quality, Security, and Safety'
recordingDate: 1582142411
description: "Increasingly our software systems have to be right the first time. The costs of software failures can devastate companies and hinder governments. Security breaches can have societal impacts that can last years. Software is hard to design and implement. Let alone design and implement well. What can we do to be better at designing and delivering better, safer, and more secure software and systems? Does language choice, such as Java vs. C++ vs. C vs. Erlang matter in terms of producing better software? When does security become a quality concern? Will AI lead to better or worse software and systems? In this session, we will discuss lessons learned from, among other things, almost a decade of working on NASA software projects that had to work correctly or people could die. And how these lessons continue to impact the speaker's mindset and outlook daily.\n\nTodd Montgomery is a networking hacker who has researched, designed, and built numerous protocols, messaging-oriented middleware systems, and real-time data systems, done research for NASA, contributed to the IETF and IEEE, and co-founded two startups. He currently works as an independent consultant on high-performance systems and is active in several open-source projects, including Agrona, Aeron, ReactiveSocket, and the FIX Simple Binary Encoding (SBE).\n\nFor more on YOW!
