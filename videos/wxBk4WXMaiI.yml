description: "Elon Musk's newer company \"Neuralink\" just demoed the brain device they've been working on the past 2 years during a live stream event. I've been waiting a long time to get a glimpse of the hardware, software, and intentions they have as they build this technology and the event was satisfying, thought provoking, and humbling. I'm going to review my impressions of the event, explain how the device works in technical detail, then make a few predictions of what it's going to be used for in the future. It's an exciting time to be alive, and although there are dangers involved, I have faith that we can learn from our mistakes and avoid having this tool be used for exploitation like social networks have been used for. \n\nIt would mean so much to me if you subscribe to my YouTube Channel! https://bit.ly/2SvhG7v\n\nWant more education?
