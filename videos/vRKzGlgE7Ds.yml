description: "Users are complex creatures, surprising, irrational, but to the Jedi among you, predictably so. This session will introduce you to the incredible field of behavioural economics, and how it is profoundly impacting our understanding of what motivates people.\n\nYou can sell more products, be more successful dating, understand how to make resolutions stick, wow clients with your incredible insights, and understand how interfaces need to be reimagined for motivation.\n\nOf course, if you turn to the dark side like Frank Underwood, you can wield a powerful weapon of influence and possibly even become the next Prime Minister. I couldnâ€™t possibly comment.\n\nLanny Geffen\nDirector of User Experience and Strategy, OneMethod\nhttps://twitter.com/lgeffen\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
