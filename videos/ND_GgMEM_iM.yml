description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nProviding Identities to Serverless Workloads - Agustín Martínez Fayó & Marcos Yacob, Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nThere are many situations where installing SPIRE Agent is either not possible or not desirable. One of the most common situations is workloads running on serverless computing architectures offered by the cloud providers like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions or Azure Functions. This talk presents how SPIRE could solve the challenges associated with this, through the introduction of the SVIDStore plugin type, enabling SPIRE Agent to store identities in external stores in a secure way, so they are available for consumption by workloads running in an environment where installing an agent is not possible."
