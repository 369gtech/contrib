description: 'Diversity is a problem in tech. Minority groups are underrepresented, and once hired, they are often either assimilated or excluded. We''ve been spending a lot of time arguing about diversity, lately. It''s time we took a closer look at the dialectic in the diversity debate – and see what’s helpful, and what isn’t. This talk* will help you understand and begin to fix the diversity issue in technology and beyond. It''ll help you contribute to our community becoming more accessible, inclusive, and welcoming for everyone. * contains aspects of graph theory and plenty of awesome GIFs'
