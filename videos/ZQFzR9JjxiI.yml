While there is an included proxy, that's only for the getting started experience.\"\n\nMitchell Hashimoto\nFounder of @HashiCorp. Creator of Vagrant, Packer, Serf, Consul, Terraform, Vault, and Nomad. Lover of open source\n\nListen to the entire playlist: 5 essential software architecture podcasts to listen to in 2019 https://www.infoq.com/5-software-architecture-podcasts-2019/\n\nWes and Mitchell discuss Consul in detail. The two discuss Consul’s design decisions around focusing on user-space networking, layer 4 routing, Go, Windows’ performance characteristics, the roadmap for eBPF on Linux, and an interesting feature that Consul implements called Network Tomography.
