description: "AI for healthcare: Scaling Access and Quality of Care for Everyone\nAnitha Kannan and Xavier Amatriain, Curai\nPresented at MLconf San Francisco 2019\n\nAbstract: Half of the world’s population lack access to healthcare services. Just in the US alone, 30% of the working-age adult population have inadequate health insurance coverage to get even basic access to services. Meanwhile, the healthcare system is known to have large inefficiencies that current technology hasn’t been able to address. In this talk, we will describe how our work on combining latest AI advances with medical experts and online access has the huge potential to change the landscape in healthcare access and provide 24/7 quality healthcare.\n\nWe will show how combining areas such as NLP, vision, and automatic diagnosis we can augment and scale doctors. We will describe our recent work on combining expert systems with deep learning to build state-of-the-art medical diagnosis models that are also able to model the unknowns using open set approaches. We will also show some of our recent work applying latest NLP advances to the medical domain, and our novel approach to image classification for dermatology applications.\n\nSee Anitha's presentation slides on our slideshare page here:\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/anitha-kannan-and-xavier-amatriain-ai-for-healthcare/SessionsEvents/anitha-kannan-and-xavier-amatriain-ai-for-healthcare"
