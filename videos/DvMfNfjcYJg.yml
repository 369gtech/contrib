description: "In this talk, Charles will cover analyzing objects within the git repo, rewriting history, and tools & techniques for migrating your team to a healthier repository. \n\nHe'll show how to use a new option to 'git cat-file' to analyse what is taking up the space in your repository and how effective Git's delta compression is in your repository. Charles will also demonstrate one way to rewrite history, and talk about the merits of a number of the other options, including migrating to a solution such as git-lfs. He'll also cover techniques and tools for letting all team members easily migrate their work in progress to the new history.\n\nCharles Bailey is a programmer and Git advocate. He is at home in C++, Bourne shell, Perl, Sinclair BASIC, Python, C, and various assembly languages.
