recordingDate: 1634735269
description: "Android Heroes Live is a live-streamed show focused on important Android topics, with guest speakers from all over the world. \n\n15 October, Clean Architecture with Jetpack Compose\n\nWe hosted the Android Heroes show with guest speaker, Divya Jain, Lead Android Developer, Blueowl LLC. \n\nDivya's detailed talk covered:\nJetpack compose brings about the declarative way of building UI, which means you describe what it should look like and the toolkit will build it for you. But for building efficient & user-friendly mobile apps, it’s still absolutely necessary to incorporate the separation of concerns principle. A clean architected app not only allows for developer sanity but also ensures the app is scalable & easily testable.\nThis talk dives into how some of the common architecture patterns in Android like MVI, MVP, or MVVM can be transferred into the compose paradigm. At the end of it, you’ll walk away on how to best abstract logic from the compose UI to build clean testable apps, with a demo app.\n\nhttps://community.androidheroes.com/feed\nhttps://twitter.com/heroes_android"
