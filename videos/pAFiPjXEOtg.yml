title: 'SC London 2017 (Day 2) The Importance Of Syntax In Clean Code by Hadi Hariri'
language: English
recordingDate: 1508257005
description: "We speak about clean code so often, focusing on things such as Single Responsibility Principle, Separation of Concerns, and all the other TLA's we can think of. We talk about clean code in both Object Orientation and Functional paradigms. We show examples of clean code in a variety of programming languages, and we say it doesn't matter what language you use, clean code is essential.\n\nBut the truth of the matter is, language plays a bigger role in clean code than we might think, if by clean we understand code that is concise, comprehensible, readable and does not have a lot in the ways of redundancy and noise.\n\nIn this talk, we're going to look at the case for Kotlin, a language that in appearance is very similar to Java and C#, and only adds what some consider a few dashes of \"syntactic sugar\" here and there. We'll see whether combining these small nuggets, it adds value to what we could consider more concise, readable, and consequently maintainable code.\n\n// This talk was given by Hadi Hariri at SC London 2017, a conference dedicated to Craftsmanship values, XP practices & clean code.
