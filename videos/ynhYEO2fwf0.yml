description: "Everyone's talking about CSS-in-JS. It's the Kim Kardashian of web development. And, as with Kimmie, opinions are polarised. To some, CSS in JS just makes sense: it's local to your component, it can't leak and, hey, I know how to write JavaScript and CSS is weird.\n\nTo others, CSS-in-JS is an abomination that makes them want to emulate Kimmie and \"release a fragrance\" in disdain. Why are scripters so afraid of the cascade? Why the hesitance about inheritance?\n\nLet's look at what CSS seems to lack, what the CSS-in-JS libraries can teach us, so we don't do as Kim's buttocks did and \"Break the Internet\".\n\nSlides: https://noti.st/brucelawson/5O0d81/css-in-js-ftw-wtf\nAbout Bruce: https://www.brucelawson.co.uk\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
