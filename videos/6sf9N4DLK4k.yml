description: "Video recording of a presentation given at JDK IO conference in Copenhagen in June 2018 at the IT-University organized by the Danish Java User Group - Javagruppen.\n\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/203-martin-skarsaune\n\nHawt and spicy Java monitoring\n\nSpeaker: Martin Skarsaune\n\nDo you have a good way to see how your Java application is doing? Or are you just about to implement an application specific system monitoring interface?\n\nYou will find that good old JMX in combination with Jolokia and hawt.io offers well defined solutions to these problems. This is also a good match in todays world of elastically scaled microservices, that are not easily accessed from traditional management consoles.\n\nYou get great insight into any Java VM out of the box, and in addition excellent support and visualisations of many common Java technologies.\n\nIf you know the power of these tools already, you will also benefit from demonstration of some significant recent features, as well as in depth coverage, such as application specific plugins and monitoring."
