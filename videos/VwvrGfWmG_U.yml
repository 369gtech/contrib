description: "In the past couple of years, lots of software teams have been using a simple collaborative technique called Example Mapping to break down user stories. It was conceived co-founder of Cucumber, Matt Wynne, who wrote the seminal post introducing the practice.\n\nIn this recorded webinar, the creator of Cucumber, Aslak Hellesøy, introduces Example Mapping and Aslak and Steve Tooke take questions from attendees. \n\nAs Matt puts it, \"Example Mapping helps you zoom in and focus on the smallest pieces of behaviour inside your story. By mapping it out you can tease apart the rules, find the core of the behaviour you want, and defer the rest until later. With this level of scrutiny, example mapping acts like a filter, preventing big fat stories from getting into your sprint and exploding.\"\n\nShownotes:\n\nSign up to our Cucumber newsletter - cucumber.io/signup\nThe train booking system is from Emily Bache -\n https://github.com/emilybache/KataTrainReservation\nJoin us on our Slack channel - https://cucumber.io/support#slack\nTweet us at @cucumberbdd - https://twitter.com/cucumberbdd\nRead Matt's Example Mapping introduction - https://cucumber.io/blog/2015/12/08/example-mapping-introduction\nOur training offering - https://cucumber.io/training"
