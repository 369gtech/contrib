title: 'Nerd sniping myself into a rabbit hole. Streaming online audio to a Sonos speaker - Maarten Balliauw'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620664529
description: "After buying a set of Sonos-compatible speakers at IKEA, I was disappointed there's no support for playing audio from a popular video streaming service. They stream Internet radio, podcasts and what not. Well, not that service I want it to play! Determined - and not knowing how deep the rabbit hole would be - I ventured on a trip that included network sniffing on my access point, learning about UPnP and running a web server on my phone (without knowing how to write anything Android), learning how MP4 audio is packaged (and has to be re-packaged). This ultimately resulted in an Android app for personal use, which does what I initially wanted: play audio from that popular video streaming service on Sonos. Join me for this story about an adventure that has no practical use, probably violates Terms of Service, but was fun to build!\n\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
