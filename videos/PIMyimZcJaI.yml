recordingDate: 1623638834
description: "Our new HITB Studio track where we’ll keep you updated on what’s happening throughout the event including pre and post interviews with speakers and friends of HITB\n\n=== \n\nDr. Bramwell Brizendine completed his PhD in Cyber Operations recently, where he did his dissertation on Jump-Oriented Programming, a hitherto, seldom-studied and poorly understood subset of code-reused attacks. Bramwell developed a fully-featured tool that helps facilitate JOP exploit development, the JOP ROCKET. Bramwell is the Director of the Vulnerability and Exploitation Research for Offensive and Novel Attacks (VERONA Lab), specializing in vulnerability research, software exploitation, software security assessments, and the development of new, cutting-edge tools and techniques with respect to software exploitation. Bramwell also teaches undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral level courses in software exploitation, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and offensive security at Dakota State University.\n\n--- \n\nAustin Babcock is pursuing his Master’s in Computer Science at Dakota State University, where he works as a security researcher at VERONA Lab under Dr. Bramwell Brizendine. Austin has extensively studied code-reuse attacks, doing research into the fundamentals of Jump-oriented Programming (JOP) in the Windows environment, in addition to developing JOP exploits. Austin also currently works at VERONA Lab with Dr. Brizendine on developing a shellcode analysis framework that is supported by an NSA grant."
