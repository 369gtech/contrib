description: "This talk was recorded at Scala Days New York, 2016. Follow along on Twitter @scaladays and on the website for more information http://scaladays.org/.\n\nAbstract:\nWe are all familiar with the standard-library's data structures. However, there are some unfamiliar (to most) data structures that can be useful (especially in functional programming). In this session, we'll discuss DList (Difference List) and Zippers, their use-cases, advantages and disadvantages. We'll also cover implementation and related topics (e.g., Anamorpishms, Trampolines, the Writer monad and Co-Monads)."
