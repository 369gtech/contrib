description: "Adrian Cockcroft, Formerly with Battery Ventures, Technology Fellow\n\nAdrian recently left Battery Ventures and joined Amazon Web Services as VP Cloud Architecture Strategy, but is not representing AWS in this talk.\n\nIn the journey to DevOps many organizations complain that they don't have the right technical talent, and it;s clear that \"getting out of the way of innovation\" is necessary but not sufficient to hire and retain key people. Compensation and career path are also big factors.\nMany large organizations have some kind of Distinguished Engineer or Technical Fellow program, they take many forms, but their primary purpose is to provide a career path to help leverage and retain top technical talent as individual contributors. In this talk we will compare and contrast several example programs, and attempt to answer questions such as, \"Should we do this too?\", \"What unintended consequences might occur?\", \"How many people should be in the program?\", \"How does this relate to DevOps?\". In my own career I have been a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems and eBay, and a Technology Fellow at Battery Ventures. I've also reached out to people in similar positions elsewhere to gather more examples.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
