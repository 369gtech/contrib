description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nAdopting JavaScript on WebAssembly at Shopify - Saúl Cabrera, Shopify\n\nServer-side WebAssembly is at the core of platform extensibility at Shopify. It enables third-party developers to extend the platform with synchronous custom business logic. Programming language support is one of the fundamental pieces to get right for a platform that is built on top of WebAssembly. The programming language options available are constrained by the use-case requirements. In Shopify's case, developers should be able to write programs using familiar tooling (Node and TypeScript), programs should be safe and their execution should be extremely fast: merchant's complex code needs to be able to run in 5ms or less. In this talk, Saúl will share Shopify's language support journey and showcase how they used Wizer (https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wizer) and QuickJS (https://bellard.org/quickjs/) to make it possible to run JavaScript on WebAssembly while meeting Shopify's performance requirements."
