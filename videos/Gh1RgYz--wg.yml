More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nThe open source release of Swift was much more than we might have hoped for, enabling an unprecedentel level of dialogue with Apple. TJ discusses the stated goals of the upcoming 2.2 and 3.0 releases, what will not be included and how we can take this information to foster the most fruitful discussion."
