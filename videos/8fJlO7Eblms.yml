description: "Upcoming DevOps Conference:\nDevOps Fest 2020 - 20-21st of March, Kiev, Ukraine\nDetails and tickets: http://bit.ly/360lOkY\n\nThe talk from DevOps Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: will be added soon \nFb: https://www.facebook.com/DevOpsFest/\nWebsite: http://www.devopsfest.com.ua/\n\nYour system is composed of highly decoupled, independent, fast, and modular microservices. But how can they share common configurations, dynamic endpoints, database references, and properly rotate secrets? Based on the size and complexity of your serverless system, you may simply use environment variables or eventually opt for some sort of centralized store. And then how do integrate all of this with monitoring and automation tooling? During this session, I will present the ideal solutions and some of the alternatives available on AWS (such as AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and AWS Secrets Manager). I will also discuss the best use cases for each solution and the corresponding best practices to achieve the highest standards for security and performance."
