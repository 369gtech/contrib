description: "Learn about relational and non-relational database management systems in this course. \n\nThis course was created by Professor Immanuel Trummer, PhD. He is an assistant professor for computer science at Cornell University.\nüê¶ Follow Professor Trummer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ImmanuelTrummer\n\nüé• Watch part 2 of this course here (8 more hours): https://youtu.be/lxEdaElkQhQ\n\nYou will learn how to query database systems via languages such as SQL (the structured query language). Then, you will see how database systems work internally, how they store and index data, how they process and optimize queries, and how they process transactions while providing guarantees such as isolation, atomicity, and durability (ACID guarantees).\n\nThe course addresses questions of database design and discusses novel approaches to data management via NoSQL or NewSQL systems. Finally, the course will discuss about graph, stream, and spatial data, and about systems that are specialized for those data types. The lectures are from the Fall 2020 online lecture at Cornell by Prof. Trummer (www.itrummer.org).\n\nüîó Slides: http://cdn.freecodecamp.org/youtube/database-course-slides/database_course_slides.zip\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Course Contents ‚≠êÔ∏è\n‚å®Ô∏è (0:00:00) The Structured Query Language (SQL)\n‚å®Ô∏è (3:04:52) Storing and Indexing Data\n‚å®Ô∏è (5:52:44) Relational Data Processing\n‚å®Ô∏è (10:40:23) Transaction Processing\n‚å®Ô∏è (https://youtu.be/lxEdaElkQhQ) Database Design\n‚å®Ô∏è (https://youtu.be/lxEdaElkQhQ) Beyond Relational Data\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Additional Reading ‚≠êÔ∏è\nAbout the first two thirds of the course are based on the textbook \"Database Management Systems\" by Raghu Ramakrishnan and Johannes Gehrke.
