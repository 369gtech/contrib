description: "“Serverless architecture is the future” is written in many Medium blog posts. But is it ready for production now? In this talk I’d like to share our experiences of building complex mobile-first Platform by only two developers and going to production in just few months.\n\nI’m planning to cover various aspects of the Platform – from content management and backend logic to real time search, data warehouse and BI dashboards.\nYou will also learn about the impact on processes and how to combine architecture evolution with ongoing operations."
