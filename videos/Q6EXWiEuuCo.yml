description: "Since JavaFX was reborn as a pure Java library, it has become much easier to use. The proof is that a new generation of tools and libraries has appeared that can make creating, building, and deploying JavaFX-enabled applications as easy as clicking a few buttons and/or editing a few files. Popular build tools such as Maven and Gradle can be used during the development cycle, as can file format converters, alternative JVM languages, an application framework, and more. Come see these new tools in action.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAndres Almiray\nAndres is a Java/Groovy developer and a Java Champion with more than 12 years of experience in software design and development.
