description: "\"Opening Open-Source with DevOps\"\n\nDevOps techniques and tools have made great strides across the software world. There’s more gains to be had though, and that’s most obvious in the open-source world. Open-source has never been the most accessible part of software development to jump into, but with DevOps we can fix that.\n\nIn this talk we’ll look at how DevOps can be used to improve development in open-source. We’ll see real-world examples of how tools like Vagrant, Ansible and Docker have been used to simplify setup, development and deployment processes on a selection of open-source projects, and learn how you too can help make open-source more open, for everybody."
