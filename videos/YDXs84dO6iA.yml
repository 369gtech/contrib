description: "Google Tech Talks\nMay 25, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn April, we covered the fundamentals of the Guice dependency injection framework, to help you make the first baby steps into the world of DI. After this talk, you'll be able to take larger strides. Come hear some or all of: an in-depth treatment of scopes; understanding the relative benefits of field, method, and constructor injection; how Guice performs injection resolution; how Guice helps with your \"larger\" tests as well as your unit tests; method interception; static injection; and a tour of some features planned for the next few releases.
