title: 'A New Configuration Standard for Java EE'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433516343
description: "A recurring problem that developers and DevOps personnel face is having to deploy an existing Java EE application in a different environment. The dream is to be able to configure it for the new environment without having to crack open the archive. This session introduces a new standardization effort that is tasked with solving this problem by defining a Java EE configuration service. Such a service would provide the ability to create one or more configurations that are independent of and decoupled from the applications that use them. The session describes how such a service will fit into Java EE and discusses some of the other features it could provide, such as tenant-based configuration, configuration change notification, and versioned profiles.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMichael Keith\nMike Keith has been an enterprise, distributed systems and persistence expert for over 20 years.
