title: 'Deconstructing REST Security by David Blevins'
language: English
recordingDate: 1491895794
description: "The learning curve for security is severe and unforgiving. Specifications promise infinite flexibility, habitually give old concepts new names, are riddled with extensions, and almost seem designed to deliberately confuse. For a back-end REST developer, choking all this down for the first time is mission impossible. With an aggressive distaste for fancy terminology, this session delves into OAuth 2.0 as it pertains to REST and shows how it falls into two camps: stateful and stateless. The presentation also details a competing Amazon-style approach called HTTP Signatures and digs into the architectural differences of all three, with a heavy focus on the wire, showing actual HTTP messages and enough detail to have you thinking, “I could write this myself.”\n\nFounder of Tomitribe, veteran of Open Source Java EE in both implementing and defining JavaEE specifications for over 10 years with a strong drive to see JavaEE simple, testable and as light as Java SE. Co-Founder of OpenEJB (1999), Geronimo (2003), TomEE (2011). Member of the Java EE 7 and EJB 3.2 Expert Groups, past member of the Java EE 6, EJB 3.1, and EJB 3.0 Expert Groups.
