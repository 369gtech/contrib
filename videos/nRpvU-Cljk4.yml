description: "How to get the best from developers when you haven’t got a clue \nby Ali Clabburn\nt: @AliClabburn\n\n“If only I could code then…” went through my mind so many times since founding Liftshare.com. But sadly my brain just fuzzes over when I see just a couple of lines of code. Like many businesses’ Liftshare needs ongoing programming to survive and thrive. For people like me with code dyslexia it can be hard to a) find someone to help b) have a clue if they are doing a good job and c) to not get carried away by what is possible instead of focussing on what is necessary.\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/nordevcon2015/\n\nhttps://liftshare.com/uk"
