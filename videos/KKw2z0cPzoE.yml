description: "Our current CI ecosystem suffers from scale issues which slow down development and make life frustrating.\nFrom 45-minute local builds to 3-hour deployment cycles, that startup-like spring in our step seems nothing more than a distant memory.\nWhat if we could have a trusty build that will take, 10% or even 5% of the time?\nBazel is a new build tool which promises to restore that quick and fresh feedback cycle you need in order to focus on your real work, even in our ever growing codebase.\nIn this talk, Or explores what the future of our CI ecosystem looks like with Bazel at the core."
