description: "Kafka on Kubernetes - From Evaluation to Production at Intuit - Shrinand Javadekar, Intuit \n\nKubernetes is fast becoming the platform of choice for running distributed, containerized applications in the cloud. However, running stateful applications such as Kafka on Kubernetes is not a common practice today. At Intuit, we took an experimentation and data driven approach for evaluating Kafka on Kubernetes in AWS. In this talk, we will provide details of our requirements, the configuration, and the details of the evaluation. The evaluation process included functional tests, network isolation tests, cross-region tests as well as performance and stress tests. We will focus on the problems we ran into and how we addressed them.  This talk will demonstrate a K8S cluster running Kafka and it's configuration using Kubernetes native components (statefulsets, configmaps, etc.). We will also show Splunk and Wavefront integrations for logging and monitoring respectively. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrW5"
