description: "Sascha has been working for 2 years + on a project with microservices and Cucumber. In this webinar, he explains a bit about what microservices are and the benefits and the downsides of them in general. He'll move on to the impact of using microservices on testing, especially when youâ€™re using cucumber.\n \nSascha will demonstrate how you can continuously test and release your services isolated from each other and how to make sure that all the independent services still work together.\n\nSascha Bartels (@bartels_sascha)\n\nSlides can be found here - https://speakerdeck.com/saschaba/cucumber-in-a-microservices-environment"
