recordingDate: 1433233670
description: "JDK 8 introduced 11 new security features spanning a wide range of security technologies, from cryptography to PKI, TLS, Kerberos, access control, and more. The features provide many security benefits, including support for new standards, stronger algorithms, and more secure out-of-the-box defaults. This session describes each of the new features in detail and explains how they improve security or otherwise satisfy an important requirement. It also includes a deeper dive into a few of the features, including code examples.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSean Mullan\nSean Mullan is the technical lead of the Java Security Libraries team at Oracle.
