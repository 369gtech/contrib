Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt\n\nMany projects start thinking about UAT at the last minute and just tell the business users that “you need to test this and sign it off”. This presentation demonstrates why this isn’t the right way and looks at how the test team should engage with the business community and use their expertise to design, develop and execute UAT."
