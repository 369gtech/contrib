recordingDate: 1338311241
description: "By Chris Beams, Spring Framework committer and VMware Senior Technical Staff\n\nIn this talk we will provide a tour of modern dependency injection and Spring container configuration styles, including those delivered in the recently-released Spring 3.1. We will show by example the use of XML, Annotated POJOs, and Java @Configuration classes to wire up your application. Just as important to knowing how to configure the container, we will also discuss why you would choose one method over another, as well as how they can be mixed and matched."
