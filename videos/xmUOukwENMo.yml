description: "Psychotronica: Abusing and Leveraging Intelligence from Social Networking\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we go beyond discussing the obvious security and privacy implications of social media.\r\n\r\nTopics of discussion include:\r\n\r\nHacking the Psyche: Remote behavior analysis that can be used to construct personality profiles to predict current and future psychological states of targeted individuals, including discussions on how emotional and subconscious states can be discovered even before the target is consciously aware.\r\n\r\nTechniques on how individuals may be remotely influenced by messaging tactics, and how criminal groups and governments may use this capability, including a case study of Twitter and the recent terror attacks in Bombay.\r\n\r\nReconnaissance and pillage of private information, including subliminal data that can be measured by way of influence, link, and sentiment analysis that the victim may not be aware of revealing."
