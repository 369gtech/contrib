language: English
recordingDate: 1543279267
description: "While many newcomers to Rust come from a systems background, a significant number of them adopt Rust as their first ever systems programming language. Why is this so? In this talk, Arshia explores the components of the Rust community and ecosystem that encourage participation, the implications of a rapidly growing Rust community, and how we can continue to maintain our accessibility and inclusivity in the face of this growth.\n\n---\n\nArshia is a wary engineer, an excited conference organizer, a tired student, an enthusiastic Rust community leader, a cautious baker, an avid reader, an erstwhile writer, and a frequent tweeter."
