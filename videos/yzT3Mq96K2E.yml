description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nData analytics was considered to be a time and resource consuming job and it was executed offline and usually on previously acquired data. Then came the lambda architecture that brought a lot of new concepts on how data is stored and analyzed in near-real-time. Todays standards require us to analyze data in real-time so that we can react accordingly and gain insights as the data is streamed into our system."
