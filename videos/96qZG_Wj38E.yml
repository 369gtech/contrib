description: "From the 2015 Velocity Conference in New York: What actually happens as we provision a fleet of containers, chat with our remote colleagues, and let the operating system update itself? At the lowest physical layer, billions of photons need to fly around inside the fiber optic cables carrying terabytes of information.\n\nThis talk explores the historic journey of modern communication technologies, highlighting a series of scientific milestones in recent human history, from trapping photons inside a hair-thin strand of glass, modulating them on 40 different wavelengths, forcing the photons to travel thousands of miles, and finally stitching back the bits and pieces for full reassembly. The talk will be entertaining and useful, yet the material will be technical enough to tickle the geeky side of the audience and inspire further exploration.\n\nAbout Ariya Hidayat (Shape Security):\nAriya Hidayat is the author of Esprima and PhantomJS. These days, his activities are mostly on software craftsmanship around HTML5, JavaScript, and other web technologies. Ariya is currently running the engineering team at Shape Security.\n\nWatch more from Velocity NYC 2015: https://goo.gl/PZAqiY\nVisit the Velocity website: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
