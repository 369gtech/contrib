title: 'Jon Jandoc - How I learned to stop worrying and love atomic CSS | August 2021'
language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1632784015
description: 'One of front-end development''s biggest challenges has always been creating scalable, reusable CSS patterns. The abundance of preprocessors (SCSS, LESS, Stylus) and methodologies (BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS, etc) are all a testament to the complexity of the problem and the many ways to approach it. In this talk I go into my own journey of styling the web over the last twenty-six years and how I''ve settled on what I think is the ideal solution of atomic, utility first CSS - at least for now.'
