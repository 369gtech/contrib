description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nSpeakers: Simon Baslé, Laurent Doguin\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/practical-rxjava\nWeb / JavaScript Track\nRxJava is an awesome library for async data streams. It is both expressive and powerful but the learning curve can be quite steep at first. So we want to quickstart developers into the world of Reactive eXtensions with more context than just listing operators!\nAdapted from a hands-on workshop, this talk will describe how one can migrate code into a fully async and RxJava-based application, built upon Spring Boot and Java 8.\nWhat kind of changes does this require? What shifts in thinking? What are the traps and pitfalls to avoid? Hopefully you'll learn the answers to these questions in this talk!"
