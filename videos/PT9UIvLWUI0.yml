description: "JupyterLab is the next evolution of the Jupyter Notebook UI, allowing data scientists to interact with their notebooks, python script and data files in a single environment. JupyterLab extensions enable developers to create new functionality and features that data scientists can easily include in their JupyterLab environment. In this talk I will discuss my experiences creating JupyterLab extensions, ranging from adding features to built-in functionality to creating new UIs for previously unsupported features. Attendees will get an overview of what extensions are capable of and how they can leverage them in their own JupyterLab environment.\n\nJupyterLab provides data scientists a singular work environment for notebooks, file editing, and more. Designed to be extendable, JupyterLab allows developers to create new features and improve upon built-in functionality. In this session we will go over JupyterLab extensions and how they can be used to customize JupyterLab for your use case.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
