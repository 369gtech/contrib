Octant, ytt, kapp.  it's all in there!\n\n---\n\nLetâ€™s take a look at configuring your Kubernetes workloads. How do we go from YAML to something that is consumable by mere mortals?\n\nFrom there, is it possible to go back to YAML?\n\nIn this session, Bryan will walk through ways to manage your YAML and present what may be an easier method for configuration and keeping your clusters up to date.\n\n---\n\nBryan Liles is a Senior Staff Engineer at VMware where he writes software and leads teams."
