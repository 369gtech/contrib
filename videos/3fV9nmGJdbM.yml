description: "Slides and more info: http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015/radoslaw-gruchalski\n\nIn computer science, gossip is a communication mechanism in which computers form groups and exchange the distributed state information amongst each other. Some of most common use cases are: distributed databases, distributed configuration systems and data distribution services. This talk will take you to the world of gossip and its application to real-world problems. We will discover what makes gossip work, how to build a gossip system and discuss gossiperl - an Erlang implementation of a gossip message bus for distributed applications. The talk will be followed with a demo of zero-configuration gossip application running on a cluster of Raspberry Pi.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nAfter this talk the attendee will have an overview of what gossip communication is, what makes gossip communication work, where and how to apply it.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nSoftware engineers interested in building scalable, multi-technology systems.\n\n\n\nRadoslaw Gruchalski is a software engineer with 15 years of experience under his belt. He is a computer polyglot: JavaScript, ActionScript, Java, C#, F#, Ruby, Python, Erlang, C, C++, are only few languages he had the opportunity to work with. He has personal preferences regarding languages and methodologies, but he uses the best tool for the job. Radoslaw is currently specialising in distributed programming. He spent last 3 years working with, so called, big data and applying gossip communication protocols to some of the problems arising when developing big data systems."
