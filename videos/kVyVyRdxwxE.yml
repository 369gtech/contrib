description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeakers: Topher Bullock, Will Tran \nWeb / JavaScript Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/serverside-javascript-with-nashorn-and-spring\nTo stay competitive, enterprises are scrambling to find ways to rapidly deliver applications that are a pleasure to use on a wide range of devices. Microservice architectures, continuous delivery and the cloud can give businesses the agility to transform into great software businesses, but how do you actually turn those buzzwords into reality?\n\nHere we present our take on a solution. Using Spring Boot, Java 8’s Nashorn JavaScript engine, and Cloud Foundry, we’ve created a framework that makes it really easy to deliver API’s to support the rich and highly contextualized experiences that users expect in world class applications. We’d like to share with you what we’ve built, and what we’ve learned along the way."
