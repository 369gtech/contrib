recordingDate: 1538586334
description: "RabbitMQ has always been a first-class citizen in the Spring ecosystem and integration has been even faster and deeper in the last few years. Spring AMQP always comes first in mind when writing a Spring application using RabbitMQ, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. Do you know RabbitMQ can power up Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Data Flow? Do you know you can use RabbitMQ with the Project Reactor API? Do you know how the Spring Cloud stack benefits from RabbitMQ? Come to this talk to discover all the places where RabbitMQ can be useful in Spring applications and to learn about cool tips and useful tools for the Spring-on-RabbitMQ developer. This talk features several live demos: Spring applications where RabbitMQ is the key element, a performance testing toolkit and setup of a proper RabbitMQ development environment for Spring applications. After attending this talk, you'll be able to leverage RabbitMQ and its client libraries to implement fast, reliable, and robust applications. Code used in this talk will be made available for download.\n\nSpeaker: Arnaud Cogoluègnes\nRabbitMQ Team Member, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
