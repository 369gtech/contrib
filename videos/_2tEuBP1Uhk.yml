description: "Emmanuel Bakare is a DevOps Engineer with effective skills in Containers, Virtualisation and Linux administration. \nHe also stands as an effective community manager having put together communities like GDG UNILAG and currently manages the Google Cloud Community in Lagos which facilitates the first ever recurring Linux meetup in Nigeria.\nAsides code, community and work, he is also an avid traveller who enjoys every bit of a new experience. From paragliding off the mountains of CapeTown to future skydiving attempts off the altitudes of this planet, he also speaks French (kinda, vous comprends?!) and enjoys visiting countries and conferences, like the ones he is speaking at when you accept his talk."
