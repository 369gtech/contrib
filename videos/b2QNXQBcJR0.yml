recordingDate: 1532330827
description: 'Pig, Hive, Flink, Kafka, Zeppelin... if you now wonder if someone just tried to offend you or are those just Pokemon names, then this talk is just for you! Big Data is everywhere and new tools for it are released almost at the speed of new JavaScript frameworks. During this entry level presentation we will walk though the challenges which Big Data presents, reflect how big is big and introduce currently most fancy and popular (mostly open source) tools. We''ll try to spark off interest in Big Data by showing application areas and by throwing ideas where you can later dive into.'
