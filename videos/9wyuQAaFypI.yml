title: 'Measure Twice, Cut Once: Using Team Operation Metrics to Optimize a Scaling Software Shop'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327250
description: "Maintaining an efficient and productive software org is hard enough when it’s just a few teams—how do you keep it delivering high-priority value when it’s growing rapidly, without continuously hiring new practice coaches? Even if you’ve got a great program doing awesome work, how do you effectively communicate to decision makers how your strategy for improvements is paying off, or when and why you need to hire?\n \nMeasuring things, that’s how! Join us to find out which metrics tell the story of how your teams are doing, how you can help them improve, and how to forecast future delivery in terms that can directly inform decision-making on prioritization and program growth.\n \nYou’ll leave the session knowing why certain team and program metrics matter, how to measure them, and what tactics help teams who aren’t “in the green.” We’ll also show you how to quantitatively forecast your software org and why optimization produces more precise forecasts.\n\nDaniel Witenberg, Senior Product Manager at VMware\nKrista Luna, Product Manager at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/measure-twice-cut-once-using-team-operation-metrics-to-optimize-a-scaling-software-shop"
