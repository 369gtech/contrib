language: English
recordingDate: 1609246335
description: "In this talk Piotr shares his experiences when building, maintaining, and growing an entire ecosystem of open source libraries.\n\nFrom small building blocks, through high-level abstractions, ending with feature-rich frameworks. How this type of work can be organized? How do you manage contributions? What about documentation? Versioning? Release process? And the most important question: is it worth the extra effort?"
