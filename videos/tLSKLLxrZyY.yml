description: "Programmers use coding katas to kick the tyres of their programming languages, paradigms and practices. Typically anchored in a TDD cycle, katas are simple problems that give programmers the opportunity to exercise deliberate practice and explore different approaches, whether programming style, pair programming or test-first programming. \n\nBut the simplicity can be deceptive, with many programmers tiring of these katas too soon, missing out on some of the more mind-bending and paradigm-expanding opportunities on offer.\n\nThis session will pick on a couple of katas and dig deeper into TDD, lambdas, language(s), (dys)functional programming and Alcubierre drive. It will present code in a variety of languages, highlight the weaknesses of some common mantras, play around with ideas - and blend code, humour and general nerdiness to be both an enjoyable and educational session.\n\nKevlin's slides: https://www.slideshare.net/Kevlin/get-kata\n\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT.\_\n\n\n\n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence.\_\n\n\n\n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
