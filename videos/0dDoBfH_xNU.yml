title: 'Real-time Experiment Analytics at Pinterest with Apache Flink - Parag Kesar & Ben Liu'
recordingDate: 1571145753
description: "At Pinterest, over 250M monthly users all over the world come for inspiration and to discover and do what they love. Our experimentation platform processes petabytes of data and we run thousands of experiments every day. In order to accelerate decision making, feature iteration and failure monitoring, we built a real-time experiment analytics pipeline with Flink that computes experiment metrics and does statistical tests in real-time. This helps reduce the delay of our most import experiment metrics from 1 day to 15 minutes.\n\nWith various powerful low level operators like KeyedProcessFunction, KeyedBroadcastProcessFunction, IntervalJoin and CoProcessFunction, we have been able to implement complex business logic and perform stateful operations based on experiment user activation and event streams. In this talk we will share our development experience and learnings on dealing with message out-of-orderness, state management, fault tolerance, checkpoint failure, back-pressure and job monitoring in a large scale real-time experiment analytics environment."
