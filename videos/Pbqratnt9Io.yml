title: 'Functional UIs and Unidirectional Dataflow by Mikael Brevik at JSConf Budapest 2015'

description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/mikaelbr/budapest-49024114\n\nhttp://2015.jsconfbp.com/#mikaelbrevik\n\nLet us bring back the days where we could write declarative representations of how we want our UI components to work. We should be able to read our code from top to bottom and intuitively know what the output will be, just like the good old HTML, but with the power of functional programming. \n\nIn this talk we'll explore bringing functional programming into views. Instead of moving logic to markup through weird DSLs we bring expressive views into the programming language. We'll see how to create a UI where we have composable, pure and referentially transparent components; components with no side-effects and predictable output. We couple this with immutable data and components with single responsibilities, and we can get a fast and smart way to build UIs with a unidirectional flow and a simpler static mental model."
