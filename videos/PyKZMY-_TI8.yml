description: "Functional Programming is available in many programming languages today. You probably know that FP is possible in JavaScript - but did you know that writing FP style JavaScript will lead to cleaner, more maintainable code? In this session, we'll explore writing FP style JavaScript and cover the basics, and intermediate techniques. We'll do a functional refactor and explain the reasoning along the way.\n\nWe'll use mostly basic JavaScript and the underscore library for code examples to demonstrate Functional Programming in a simple to understand, and more practical, way.\n\nKey takeaways\nHow to write idiomatic Functional JavaScript\nHow to write clean JS for better testing\nTechniques for understanding how to write maintainable Functional JavaScript\n\nEVENT:\n\nØredev 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPratik Patel\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nØredev Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
