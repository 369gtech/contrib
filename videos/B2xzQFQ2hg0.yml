title: 'Building reproducible computing environments: a workshop for non-experts'

description: "Aleksandra Pawlik\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/185/\n\nDependency hell is ubiquitous in the world of software for research. This affects research transparency and reproducibility. As a part of Stencila project we are developing a tool, Dockter, which makes it easier for researchers to create Docker images for their research projects. Dockter also generates a JSON file with information about the software environment (based on CodeMeta and Schema.org) allowing for further processing and enabling interoperability with other tools.  \r\nDuring this hands-on (bring your laptops!) tutorial you will work through generating a sample interactive and reproducible research report.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource"
