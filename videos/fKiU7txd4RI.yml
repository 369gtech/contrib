description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nHow to Multiply the Power of Argo Projects By Using Them Together - Hong Wang & Alexander Matyushentsev, Intuit \n\nThe Argo Project contains three big software components: a GitOps continuous application delivery platform, a cloud-native workflow engine and an advanced deployment controller. All projects are evolving rapidly and have received a lot of new features in recent months. In this session, we are going to provide an update about project progression and demonstrate how to get even more out of Argo by using the projects together. You will see how Argo CD can declaratively define and manage powerful batch processing pipe powered by Argo Workflows and Argo Events. At the end of the session, we are going to talk about where we think GitOps future is heading and demonstrate how GitOps engine is leveraged outside of Argo CD. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekGL"
