description: "Speaker: Emily Stolfo, MongoDB Inc and maintainer of Mongoid gem\r\n\r\nAs the maintainer of Mongoid, the ActiveRecord replacement for using MongoDB with Rails, I'm aware that MongoDB isn't the first database choice of Rails users. I'd like to find out what I can do to help developers more often choose to use MongoDB with Rails. Can I build tools to help you migrate data? Can I provide a connector that allows you to convert SQL queries to MongoDB queries? Should I make the query DSL totally different from that of ActiveRecord and more similar to MongoDB's JSON-like query language? I invite you to openly confess your MongoDB opinions to help me provide better support for the Rails community in this brief two-way presentation.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Ruby-Group/events/239950314/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/7yIt/"
