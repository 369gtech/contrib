description: "CppCon 2019: Zola Bridges, Devin Jeanpierre “Preventing Spectre One Branch at a Time: The Design and Implementation of Fine Grained Spectre v1 Mitigation APIs”\n\nhttp://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nSpectre is the first in a new class of security vulnerabilities which require programmers and the compiler to deal with microarchitectural details made visible during speculative execution. There are several API options which allow programmers to mitigate specific branches or pointers that are vulnerable to Spectre v1 in order to limit the performance impact of mitigation. In this talk, Devin and Zola will describe the unusual challenges in designing and implementing fine-grained Spectre (variant 1) mitigations, give an overview and demo of the APIs that exist today, and discuss the future of the APIs including the standardization proposal that is in progress.\n\nRecommended background:\nCppCon 2018: Chandler Carruth “Spectre: Secrets, Side-Channels, Sandboxes, and Security” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f7O3IfIR2k\n— \nZola Bridges\nSoftware Engineer, Google\nZola Bridges works on the C++ Security team at Google.
