description: "Google Tech Talks\nApril 4, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nDesign Patterns must be studied in the context on the language in which they'll get implemented (the Gang of Four made that point very strongly in their book, though almost everybody else seems not to have noticed:-). This talk explores several categories of classic \"elementary\" DPs in a Python context -- Creational, Masquerading, Adaptation, and Template.  Credits: Speaker:Alex Martelli"
