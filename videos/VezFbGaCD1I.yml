description: "How many times have you been told how functional programming is so much better than imperative and then been presented with a functional approach to calculating a Fibonacci sequence, leaving you wondering how that can be even remotely useful for working in real-world applications? Yep, weâ€™ve all been there. It seems that every time someone wants to explain functional programming to us, it involves how to solve some mathematical problem. But how does that provide us value? How do we deal with loose coupling or dependency injection, for instance? Join the journey of this session, which examines code we usually write when developing and how to refactor it with functional paradigms, and more importantly, see if these provide us with any value.\n\nSpeaker:\nHadi Hariri, Team Lead, JetBrains\nDeveloper and creator of many things OSS, his passions includes Web Development and Software Architecture. Has authored a couple of books, a few courses and has been speaking at industry events for nearly 15 years. Currently at JetBrains leading the Developer Advocacy team. Spends as much time as he can writing code."
