description: "MobileOptimized 2019\nAndroid track\n\nWhy we failed at modularizing our app. An honest retrospective. - Marcos Holgado @Sky\n\nModularization is the new trend, almost everybody in the Android ecosystem is refactoring their apps to use a modularized approach. This talk is an honest retrospective of everything that went wrong, the bad decisions made, the approach that was initially taken and how re-building a maintainable, sustainable and extensible modularized codebase started.\nYou will learn from mistakes and struggles, like defining what is a module and its responsibilities, how to integrate Dagger in a multi-module environment, set some rules and best practices and much more but, more importantly, you will learn what not to do when modularizing your codebase.\n\nGeneral Partner - Apalon https://www.apalon.com/\nVideo Partner - Flo https://flo.health/"
