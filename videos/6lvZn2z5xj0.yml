description: "MobDevCon Lite 9th July 2014\n\nGoogle Cast\nPaul Lammertsma \n(@officesunshine)\n\nPaul is CTO and co-founder of Pixplicity, Holland’s leading Android- specific consulting and app-building company. He applies his knowledge of Java, Android and Linux in Pixplicity to develop high-quality apps and provide technical solutions for customers such as Mercedes-Benz, Parkmobile, Nestlé, De Telegraaf and De Consumentenbond. \n\nGoogle recently launched Google Cast, a technology that enables devices to control content over multiple screens. This simple principle enables small, handheld devices to send and control media on larger devices, such as a television. The platform is easy to get started with and is a delight to play with! I’ll demonstrate creating our very MobDevCon Android and Google Cast app and getting content to display on a $35 Chromecast dongle! \n\nI’ll expand on the extensibility of the platform and show ways in which you can enhance your existing apps to benefit from the Big Screen.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/191805352/"
