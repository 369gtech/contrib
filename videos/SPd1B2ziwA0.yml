title: 'Truly Native Java Apps on iOS with RoboVM'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784724
description: "RoboVM is a new open source project whose goal is to bring Java and other JVM languages to iOS devices. The RoboVM ahead-of-time compiler translates Java bytecode into native code that runs directly on the CPU, without the overhead of an interpreter. Access to the iOS Cocoa Touch APIs will be provided through a Java-to-Objective-C bridge, enabling the development of apps with truly native UIs and full hardware access. This session introduces you to RoboVM and demonstrates how to create a simple app from start to finish, including packaging for the App Store. It also demonstrates JavaFX on iOS and shows some libgdx-based games that have already been ported to RoboVM and iOS.\n\n\nAuthor:\nNiklas Therning\n-0\nView more trainings by Niklas Therning at https://www.parleys.com/author/niklas-therning\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
