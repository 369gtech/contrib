title: 'Simplifying App Migration to Kubernetes with an App-centric Abstraction'
language: English
recordingDate: 1581707992
description: 'Migrating microservices applications to Kubernetes especially one that involves things like stateful services and load balancers can be a daunting task. In this webinar, we talk about our experience of migrating a microservices-based platform to Kubernetes. The migration journey brought to fore the complexities of K8s and led the team to explore ways to simplify and streamline efforts. This resulted in an app-centric approach that abstracts K8s, accelerates migration and makes possible self-service delivery for application teams.'
