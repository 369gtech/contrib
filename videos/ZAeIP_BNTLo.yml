description: "Stop sacrificing comprehensive testing to save time\n\nSoftware testers and quality assurance engineers are often pressured to cut testing time to ensure products are released on time. Usually this means running fewer tests, thus reducing software quality. This pressure is exacerbated as companies embrace a continuous integration (CI) approach which involves frequent build and test cycles, but has the side effect of further limiting the time allocated to test and analysis.  Instead of reducing the number of tests in a CI cycle to reduce test time, Tanay Nagjee will discuss how entire test suites can be broken down and parallelized, reducing the time to run them by 80% or more.  By leveraging a cluster of computing horsepower (either on-premise physical machines or in the cloud), large test suites can execute in a fraction of the time it takes by smartly parallelizing their individual tests.  Tanay will outline a 3-step approach to achieve these results with different test frameworks.  He will discuss the tools used, and will present real example data and a live demonstration."
