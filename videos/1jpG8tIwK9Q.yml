description: "Fritzing - the past, the present and the future Restarting with 1100 technical issues, and a few legal ones\nby Kjell Morgenstern\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2213/fritzing.webm\n\nMaking electronics accessible to the broad public was mainly made possible by Arduino, Raspberry PI and last but not least Fritzing. Back in 2009, it was a pain to get from a loose wiring on a breadboard to a PCB. Fritzing came up first with a unique breadboard view and a simple to use PCB layout. Fast forward 10 years to Fosdem 2019, Fritzing was in a major crisis. Despite well over 200.000 users, thousands of downloads per day and an enthusiastic community, development had stalled. It has now been rebooted, and the project is back to gaining momentum. So what has happened between last year and this year?\nThis talk will give a rough introduction to Fritzing and its ecosystem, including how we overcame the problems, learned from our mistakes and how we plan to keep improving Fritzing in the future.\n\nRoom: H.2213\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 13:25:00"
