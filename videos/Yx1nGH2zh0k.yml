Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nPainless Serverless Function Development In Kubernetes - Ramiro Berrelleza, OktetoSDCC \n\nDeveloping serveless functions is a pain. You either develop and test locally, and then run into a lot of integration issues, or you develop and test in production, and you end up with a workflow where most of the time you're waiting for builds or deploys to happen. Not great.\n\nUsing open source tools I will show attendees how they can launch a replicable development environment directly in Kubernetes, and use it to hot reload and connect their debugger to their OpenFaaS functions.No commits , build or deploys required. The goal of this is to reduce friction, eliminate integration issues between development and production environments, and make for a happier and faster development experience."
