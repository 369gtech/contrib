recordingDate: 1557110999
description: "\"Speaker: Jes Ford\n\n*How do you know if your data science results are correct?* Robust software usually has tests asserting that certain conditions hold, but as a data scientist itâ€™s often not straightforward or obvious how to integrate these best practices. Our workflow includes exploration, statistical models, and one-off analysis. This talk will give concrete examples of when and how testing should play a role, and provide you with enough introduction to get started writing your first data science tests using `pytest` & `hypothesis`.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
