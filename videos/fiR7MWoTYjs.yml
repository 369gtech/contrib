description: "You have streaming data and want to expose it as reactive streams with Spring Boot. Great! Spring WebFlux makes that pretty easy. But what about the UI? Can you stream that data to the UI and have it be reactive and constantly updating too? This session explores techniques for making your app fully reactive with Spring WebFlux and React.
