title: '[DevFest Nantes 2018] The next big thing in (client side) templating'

description: "Speaker : Filip Bruun Bech-Larsen\n\nIn this talk we will talk about the evolution of client-side templating, and where the platform is taking us next. Maybe you thought ES6 template literals were just multi-line strings - but they are so much more. Your browser now has a native way of handling templating, that is both scalable and extensible - and really performant. We will take the time to dive into the individual parts and understand how combining the template element with template literals might be the next big thing in templating. Finally I will share my thoughts on how and why, combining this with webcomponents, could be the future of frameworks."
