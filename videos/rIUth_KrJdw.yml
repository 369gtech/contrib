description: "Monolith to Microservice: Pitchforks Not Included - Jason Plum, GitLab \n\nLearn how GitLab turned it’s omnibus into cloud native Helm charts by way of containerization and orchestration. This talk aims to help practitioners already running large scale, successful products make decisions on how to move to microservices while maintaining product development cadence and serving customers on legacy software everyday. It’s like driving a race car and fixing it as you are competing in a race, without pit stops.    We will cover:  - How we made the application stack capable of scaling via containerization, through many changes to stateful behaviors.  - Why we made the changes from an architectural view.  - How on earth we accrued the technical debts we had to fix in the first place.  - Most importantly, we’ll demonstrate why the monolith concept was the right place to start, but Kubernetes is our future. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrSP"
