language: English
recordingDate: 1527171854
description: "Hear the story of how we used Python and machine learning to build an artificial intelligence that plays Super StreetFighter II on the Super NES. We'll cover how Python provided the key glue between the SNES emulator and AI, and how the AI was built with gym, keras-rl and tensorflow. We'll show examples of game play and training, and talk about which bot beat which bot in the bot-v-bot tournament we ran.\n\nTalk given by Adam Fletcher and Jonathan Mortensen at PyCon 2018.\n\nThanks to PyCon for giving us permission to post this talk. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk. We're just excited to bring more exposure to to it!\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.com\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://medium.freecodecamp.com\n\nAnd subscribe for new videos on technology every day: https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=freecodecamp"
