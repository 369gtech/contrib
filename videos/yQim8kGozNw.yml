description: "Paweł Węglewski (Jeppesen): Git - lessons learned\n\nSo you know Git, do You?\n\nWe all know and use GIT. It has become almost a default selection for a version control system in the current market. However, the fact that we use GIT does not imply that we use it correctly. The bigger the project and more complex use case the more problems we encounter. If you want to know the most common GIT sins and possible ways of mitigating and/or fixing these issues on real world examples, this session is for You.\n\nThe speech was given on 2018-05-23 at infoShare 2018 (Tech Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
