title: 'Ananth Packkildurai: Operating data pipeline using Airflow @ Slack'
recordingDate: 1542733768
description: 'Slack is a communication and collaboration platform for teams. Our millions of users spend 10+ hrs connected to the service on a typical working day. The Slack data engineering team goal is simple: Drive up speed, efficiency, and reliability of making data-informed decisions. For engineers, For people managers, For salespeople, For every slack customer. Airflow is the core system in our data infrastructure to orchestrate our data pipeline. We use Airflow to schedule Hive/ Tez, spark, Flink and TensorFlow applications. Airflow helps us to manage our stream processing, statistical analytics, machine learning, and deep learning pipelines. About six months back, we started on-call rotation for our data pipeline to adopt what we learned from devops paradigm. We found out several airflow performance bottleneck and operational inefficiency that siloed with ad-hoc pipeline management. In this talk, I will speak about how we identified Airflow performance issues and fixed it. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/crunch'
