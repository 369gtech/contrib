title: 'Java After Eight by Nicolai Parlog'
recordingDate: 1581886597
description: "Many projects are still on Java 8 and yet, in just a few weeks, Java 14 will be out! The small releases after 9 created the illusion of nothing much happening, but nothing could be further from the truth - a lot changes since then that shapes the look of everyday Java code:\n\nnew language features like switch expressions, var, and text blocks\nnew APIs like stack walking and the reactive HTTP/2 client\nadditions to existing APIs, like Stream and Optional\nIn this talk, we'll take a simple Java 8 code base, update it to 14, and refactor it to use the new language features and APIs. You'll be surprised how much the code changes!\n\nNicolai Parlog\nCodeFX\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
