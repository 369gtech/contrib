description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nEnvoy Mobile in Depth: From Server to Multi-platform Library - Jose Nino & Michael Schore, Lyft \n\n99.999% reliability on the server is meaningless if mobile apps are only able to complete the desired product flows a fraction of the time. Learn how Lyft built, and deployed Envoy Mobile (envoy-mobile.github.io) in their Swift/Kotlin apps and the motivation behind deploying a single, consistent Envoy-based network stack across every platform.\n\nEnvoy Mobile was created to provide apps with the same network configurability, observability, and transport technologies that Envoy Proxy enables for the server - as if apps were simply another node on the service mesh. This talk will dive deep into the technical aspects of using the Envoy codebase as the core foundation of a mobile networking library. We will cover the challenges we encountered and solutions we built in packaging Envoy and developing a direct HTTP API into its core, supporting an ergonomic interface for both iOS and Android."
