recordingDate: 1498502625
description: "Matt Stratton, Customer Architect at Chef - ChefConf 2017\n\nChef is a vibrant, welcoming open source community, but it can seem intimidating to contribute to any open source project when you don't have \"engineer\" in your title. This talk is for the hand-wavers amongst us—the architects, the planners, the visionaries—who might not be intimately familiar with registers, slices vs arrays, or what the heck a \"constructor\" is, but still have great ideas. I'll gently guide you through ways to help improve your favorite open source projects, give direction on how to submit a pull request that won't get immediately rejected, and how to prioritize which mountains to tackle first. We'll also explore some of my own journey in \"leveling up\" in languages, and how to get help turning your ugly, but special to you, code into something that will delight the true code wranglers out there."
