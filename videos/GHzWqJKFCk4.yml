description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Berlin 2016\nfollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nAfter a fairly quiet 2015, things are heating up this year. To name\njust three major developments among many: A major new release, Scala\n2.12, is about to be completed. The Scala Center provides a new focus\npoint for community collaboration. And there's a new experimental\nplatform, dotty, which lets us prototype designs for the next\ngeneration of the language.\n\nIn my talk I'd like to look a bit further ahead and focus on where I\nsee Scala in the next 5 years, touching topics like: What is Scala's\nunique identity as a programming language? How should it evolve? What\nexciting new technologies are on the horizon?"
