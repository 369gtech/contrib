description: "Salim Virji and Carlos Villavieja, Google LLC\n \nArtificial intelligence is all around us, from the digitals assistants in our microwaves to the apps we rely on every day. Many of these systems build on APIs and services that use machine learning to provide key features. This talk will describe techniques for building predictable, reliable ML-based services as well as ways to sustain these services through social and technical change. We discuss challenges unique to the reliability of these systems and relate our experiences with ML in our production systems to illustrate our techniques.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
