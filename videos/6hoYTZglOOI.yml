description: 'Joshua Bloch just gifted us with the 3rd edition of ''Effective Java'', but almost 10 years have been past since the last edition. Now we have a whole generation of Java developers that could benefit from this knowledge - but lost the past wave. It''s about time to revisit all of this wonderful content, and upgrade your skills to the latest versions of the Java platform. Join us on this deep dive session to check what is the updated Effective Java, and even add some more tips not included in the book!'
