description: "Please note - this presentation is in swedish.\n\nWhat standard should we use to be able to share clinical data between systems? And why do we need a standard? \n\nIt is the same question as what language to use when in a meeting with people from all over the world. In some cases, German, in other cases French and in a third case English may be the best option. In these cases, one tend to use the language spoken by the majority, and then translate to the remaining of the group. \n\nBig Data or Small Data – in both cases, we are dependent of a structure making it possible to share and re-use clinical data. Innovative companies need structured platforms, researchers and scientists need better data, and GPs and health care professionals need relevant information about their patient. Structured data makes it possible to share data between health providers, regions, and even across borders. \n\nPutting together a standard to describe the extreme complexity of a human being is a challenge. Not just from a clinical perspective but from a technical perspective. How to relate a patient, to a body part, to a treatment to a specific point of time? And technically, how do we store, retrieve, and visualize this in electronic health records? \n\nCome and listen to Anna Adelöf describe how it is all connected and why SNOMED CT has become a global standard. \n\nAnna Adelof, Customer Relations Executive. Anna has been associated with the IHTSDO since 2007, representing Sweden in a number of groups including the General Assembly and Member Forum.
