title: 'Is Quantum Computing Really a Thing? - James Birnie'
language: English
recordingDate: 1638810041
description: "Quantum computing has existed as a theoretical concept for some time. I recently saw some talks on quantum computing and I’ve been inspired to start researching the field myself. There are now a handful of (known) quantum computers in existence, some of which, such as the “IBM Q Experience” allow you to execute real quantum programs. I’ll give an overview of the state of the art, what the potential of quantum computing is, what its limitations might be and a small dose of speculation on what applications could be suited to to quantum computers and when they might start to be really useful.\n\nI’ve also designed a demonstration of Quantum Computing, using Microsoft’s Q# (not a real quantum computer, it is a simulator designed to run on a traditional digital computer) called “Clementine’s Cat”. I was inspired to make Clementine’s Cat when I described Shrodinger’s Cat to my daughter and she was horified that anybody would do such a thing to their cat. So Clementine’s Cat is a humane modern spin on the traditional quantum thought experiment in which no cats are harmed, either theoretically or in reality.\n\nPresented by James Birnie\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
