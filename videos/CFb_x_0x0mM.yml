description: "We laugh at people that tell us that Java is slow, heavyweight and cumbersome. Sure, the dark days of EJB2 weren’t dreamy, but times have changed. Let us show you how to develop Enterprise Applications, with just a few lines of code that can even run on a Raspberry PI. And if your code runs on a PI, it’s pretty safe to say it can run anywhere!\n\nJoin us and dive into the Microprofile platform.\n\nMicroProfile optimizes Enterprise Java for a Microservices Architecture and delivers application portability across multiple runtimes. You can use a subset of the Jakarta EE specifications to develop MicroProfile applications, with JAX-RS, CDI, and JSON-P.\n\nAfter introducing the basics, we’ll build on this by adding monitoring with Health and Metrics, security with JWT, custom configuration with Config, provide documentation with OpenAPI, track your calls with OpenTracing and provide resilience to your APIs with Fault Tolerance.\n\nJoin us for this session where, by live-coding examples, we show you how to get hands-on with this great tool. We hope you’ll leave not just with a theory that Java with MicroProfile is actually great for the Enterprise, but having seen firsthand exactly why."
