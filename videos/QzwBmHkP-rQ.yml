title: 'GopherCon UK 2021: Alex Ellis - Zero to Open'
recordingDate: 1637596084
description: "Every once in a while someone comes into your life who makes a lasting impression. For OpenFaaS, there’ve now been 350 of those people, from all around the world each with individual stories and achievements to share. They all had a common interest: they wrote Go and believed that functions should be easy to use and portable. This is their story 5 years after it started.\n\nAlex shares why he started the project, the highs and lows along the way from quitting his job, to going toe-to-toe with corporate giants. He’ll tell the story through the contributors, and community that helped build and shape the project which now has 28k GitHub Stars and dozens of end-user companies in production."
