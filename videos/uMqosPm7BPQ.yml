language: English
recordingDate: 1608667737
description: 'How does Go as a programming language succeed and thrive? We can highlight technical merits, but humans make emotional decisions. Most statistics show Go''s global developer population has reached an estimated 2 million. This is almost double in the last 24 months.  What does Go''s growth mean for us individually and collectively? What calls to action must we take for everyone to be brought forward?  What are the most pressing needs of our industry and our world, and how can we meet them, with open source and with Go? Carmen explores how programming languages crossed their chasms, how open source amplifies that, the Go ecosystem, and 2020 developer landscape in context, and the new challenges for tech ecosystems in the decade ahead.  Youâ€™ll walk away from this talk with an understanding of where we are, how we got here, and how to support and grow Go for the next 2 million users.'
