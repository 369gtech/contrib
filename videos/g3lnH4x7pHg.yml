description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nRuss Olsen - Author of \"Design Patterns in Ruby\" and \"Eloquent Ruby\"\n\nABSTRACT\nIt was not so long ago that most developers had a very limited palette of programming languages to choose from. There was Java and perhaps C# and maybe one or two others. But the past decade has seen a dizzying array of programming languages emerge from the shadows. First there was Ruby and then Groovy and then Clojure and Scala and Go. And while all of this was going on we had a resurgence of JavaScript and Erlang and Python, not to mention Objective C. What’s a programmer to do? \n\nIn this talk Russ Olsen will explore the reasons that this is all happening *now*, at why some programming languages become popular and others remain minor footnotes and at what all of this means to a developer who is just trying to deploy the next version of the system before \n\nPlease find slides here: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
