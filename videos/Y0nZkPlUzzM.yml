description: "Reject.JS 2014 – Berlin, September 11, 2014\nSlides: http://felixpalmer.github.io/safari-webgl/presentation.html\nBlog post: http://www.pheelicks.com/2014/09/immersive-presentations\n\nApple have recently given the green light to WebGL in iOS8 Safari, which will enable rich 3D in-browser content for half a billion devices later this year. What better way to celebrate, than to create the Safari logo in 3D (http://felixpalmer.github.io/safari-webgl)?\n\nMy talk will cover the technical details on how something like can be built using nothing but JavaScript. Using the THREE.js library, I’ll show you how you can build up your own scenes from geometric primitives, apply materials, lighting and more to create compelling 3D experiences.\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
