description: "Yan Cui\nFunctional programmer in gaming\n\nYan works as a server side developer at Gamesys where he develops scalable backend services for Gamesys's social games on mobile and Facebook. He's a co-author of the upcoming book F# Deep Dives for Manning Publishing.\n\nHe's a regular speaker on topics such as Aspect-Oriented Programming, F# and NoSQL, and he keeps an active blog at theburningmonk.com\n\nMy adventure with Elm\n\nReactive Extensions (Rx) has brought reactive programming to the mainstream in recent years with successful adoption in languages such as C#, Java and JavaScript. But have you ever wondered what Rx will look like as a language?\n\n\nElm is a new programming language based on the idea of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). Elm lets you create highly interactive web applications without all the messy callbacks tangling around shared states.\n\nIn this talk Yan Cui will give a gentle introduction to Elm and share his experience learning Elm and recreating Missile Command in Elm with less than 250 LOC. You will leave this session with a handle on the Functional Reactive Programming paradigm and a basic understanding of the Elm language."
