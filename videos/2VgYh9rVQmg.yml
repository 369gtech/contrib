description: "Have a great idea for an iPhone app, but don't have the time or inclination to learn Objective-C?\r\n\r\nCreated at iPhoneDevCamp 2008 and winner of the Launch Pad competition at Web 2.0 Expo 2009, PhoneGap is an open source initiative for building mobile applications with JavaScript. Using the PhoneGap framework, web developers can author apps in HTML and JavaScript and still take advantage of native mobile device capabilities like geo location, camera, vibration and sound. PhoneGap makes it easy to build apps for iPhone, Android, Nokia S60 and Blackberry.\r\n\r\nLearn how to get started building a PhoneGap application that's app store ready and learn how to contribute back to the open source PhoneGap project."
