recordingDate: 1447316765
description: "Normally people like to talk, or rather argue, about how to manage remote development teams. The first mistake in this discussion is the focus on the word 'management'. The mere fact that they are remote already implies a certain loss of control. Successful companies these days usually have successful managers who focus both on removing barriers to performance in their direct reports, as well as giving their own managers the illusion that they have the control they desire.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
