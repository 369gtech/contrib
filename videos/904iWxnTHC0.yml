title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2011: Alvaro Videla - Messaging Patterns with RabbitMQ'
recordingDate: 1545060707
description: "RabbitMQ is emerging as good solution for open source messaging in modern architectures. This opens new challenges on how to implement integration patterns in order to go beyond simple produce/consume applications. In this presentation we will show how to implement several messaging patterns using RabbitMQ as backend technology such as:\n\n- Competing consumers\n- RPC\n- Parallel RPC\n- Smart Proxy\n- Publish/Subscribe\n\nThe examples will be give using standard AMQP commands so the attendee can translate them later to her favorite RabbitMQ/AMQP client.\n\nMore Info: http://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/messaging-patterns-rabbitmq\n\nDescription of Alvaro Videla:\nhttp://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/alvaro-videla"
