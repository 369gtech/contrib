title: 'Rein Remmel - Strangling the Legacy with Kubernetes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1580295609
description: 'In this presentation, Rein leans on the research behind the State of DevOps report to demonstrate why patterns like Infrastructure as Code and Immutable Infrastructure are essential for software delivery performance. Using the example of Fleet Complete, he will explain how Kubernetes can be used to implement these patterns for traditional applications. It is common to think that legacy and monolith applications need to be refactored as microservices before moving to the cloud or containers. This goal is not easy to achieve. In this presentation, you will learn how cloud and containers can be used to speed up your monolith or legacy application development iterations.'
