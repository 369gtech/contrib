description: "Many application bugs and performance problems can be resolved or avoided through a deeper understanding of how the JVM works. This session identifies the major subsystems in Oracle’s HotSpot JVM and presents an overview of how they work and interact. It also examines how HotSpot handles several common application patterns that can cause unexpected behavior, poor performance, or unnecessarily high resource consumption.\n\n\nAuthor:\nPaul Nauman\nPaul is a member of the JVM Sustaining Engineering organization at Oracle Corp.
