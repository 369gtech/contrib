title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Don’t trust your gut: agency operations metrics'
recordingDate: 1523512566
description: "I’ll admit it, I love spreadsheets. \_So when I attended a session by Sean Larkin* called, “Scaling your business starts with the right spreadsheets: performance metrics” at Drupalcon LA, I was excited to take what I had learned and apply it to my own agency. \_\_I was inspired. \_\_I immediately adopted these same spreadsheets and started adapting them to fit my needs as Chief Operating Officer. \_\_\n\nOver the years I have expanded upon these spreadsheets and evolved them into operations tools that I use on a daily basis. \_Now, it’s my turn to pay it forward and share these tools with others. \_\_This session will build off of the LA presentation, taking a closer look at operations specific metrics. \_\_I will walk attendees through the tools I use to help answer questions like:\n\n\n\nWill my current team configuration be able to complete the work we have lined up?\n\nHow many people do I need to assign to this project to complete it on time? \_\n\nDo I need to hire? \_\n\nHow much available capacity does my team have?\n\nHow utilized is my team?\n\nHow did my team perform last month compared to projections?\n\nHow much revenue will my company bring in in future quarters with current signed portfolio?\n\nHow much additional sales do I need to close to bill at capacity in future quarters?\n\n\n\nIf you find yourself asking these or similar questions and without existing tools to help you make data-driven decisions, then this session is for you. \_\_\n\n\n\n\n\n*Permission has been granted by Sean Larkin for use of his original material"
