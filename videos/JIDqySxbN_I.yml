description: "SREcon16 Europe - Government Needs SRE\n\nMikey Dickerson, U.S. Digital Service\n\nIn 2013, Mikey Dickerson joined what became known as the “ad hoc” team, tasked with rescuing HealthCare.gov after its failed launch on October 1. In August 2014, President Obama established the United States Digital Service and appointed Mikey to serve as the Administrator to see if the strategy that succeeded at pulling Healthcare.gov out of the fire could be applied to other government problems. Now nearly 2 years old and about 150 people spanning a network of federal agencies, the U.S. Digital Service has taken on immigration, education, veterans benefits, and health data interoperability. The U.S. Digital Service is helping agencies build effective government services and improve IT procurements by focusing on industry best practices and agile methodology, ultimately driving change in the largest institution in history. Prior to joining the U.S. Digital Service, Mikey worked as a Site Reliability Manager at Google.\n\nView the full SREcon16 Europe Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program"
