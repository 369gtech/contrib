description: "Delivery on Steroids - 3 Magic Pills for Fast Uncompromising Development\n\nHow many of you have felt the tension between product and software engineering? With product pushing many features, we are often forced to leave software engineering behind. But what if we could push forward features without sacrificing our engineering values? In this talk, Netta takes you through her own personal experience of developing a product using Kent Beck’s 3X model. Netta talks about some of the challenges and rewards of working this way. Hopefully, by the end, you’ll learn the secret of the ever so sensitive balance between product and engineering and the compromises it brings with it."
