recordingDate: 1598238076
description: 'With the advent of autonomous cyber-physical systems such as self-driving cars and unmanned aerial vehicles, the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) for positioning and navigation has become ubiquitous. In recent years we have seen a lot of GPS "incidents" which involve either denial of services or spoofing to mislead the receiver. This workshop will include the basics of GPS spoofing with a hands-on exercise and a discussion of state-of-the-art spoofing mitigation techniques'
