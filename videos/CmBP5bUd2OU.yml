recordingDate: 1563541818
description: "Flink Forward San Francisco, April 2018 #flinkforward\n\nPowering Yelp’s Data Pipeline Infrastructure with Apache Flink - Enrico Canzonieri\n\nLast year, during the Flink Forward conference, a group of Yelp engineers saw in Apache Flink a perfect candidate to solve many of the pressing challenges that the Yelp’s fast growing data pipeline was encountering. One year later, Yelp is running hundreds of streaming Flink jobs. These provide everything from simple data transformation, to complex stateful stream join and stream SQL queries. In this talk, I’ll introduce the challenges that the Yelp data pipeline was facing and how Flink tackled them. I’ll then focus on the integration of Apache Flink into an existing multi-regional Kafka based streaming ecosystem at scale. I’ll discuss the challenges that we encountered during our journey and some of the best practices we learned while building and scaling the infrastructure for Flink.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
