recordingDate: 1607378107
description: "In this demo, you will see one method for how VMware Tanzu Build Service and VMware Tanzu Application Catalog can be used together to build a functional application stack. Each layer within these stacks will be automatically monitored for any patches or upgrades, and automatically rebuilt and ready to deploy.\n\nNot only will these systems keep all your containerized applications up to date, but further tools are provided to automatically scan all contained code for vulnerabilities, report on what is included in each container, and hashed to ensure a secure application dependency supply chain.\n\nAn introductory video for Tanzu Build Service can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMmUjUjBzes&feature=youtu.be\n\nAn introductory video for Tanzu Application Catalog can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRd3_2TyFbQ&feature=youtu.be"
