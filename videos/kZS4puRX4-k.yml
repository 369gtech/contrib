title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: Flexible Scaling with CouchDB Replication'
recordingDate: 1279770260
description: 'CouchDB is known for having a flexible schemaless JSON storage API. But that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to flexibility. In this webcast we learn how replication can be used to share data securely, build offline-capable applications, provide redundancy, and manage large-scale clusters. We start with replication basics, then cover offline replication, filtered replication, and replication in a cluster.'
