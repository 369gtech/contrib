recordingDate: 1502110706
description: "Cloud infrastructure services provide networking, compute, and storage resources via an API, and offer the flexibility to change our operating model so we can use these resources on demand and reduce our spend. To take advantage of these capabilities we need a way to manage our infrastructure and application configurations in a predictable and repeatable fashion. In this session learn about the building block technologies that enable us to deliver on this promise including Terraform, CloudInit, and Chef. The focus of this session is on standardizing our infrastructure definition in code using Terraform, standardizing our server and application configuration in Chef, and automating the setup of our servers through CloudInit.\n\nSpeaker: James Calise"
