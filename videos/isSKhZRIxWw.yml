Now you're curious, but don't know where to start. It is worth switching?\n\nThe objective of this session is to give you a strong introduction to Gradle, demonstrating that it's both a modern and mature build tool.\n\nFirst and foremost: user interactions: any developer will have interaction with the build tool. We will show how to take advantage of the task based model of Gradle and how to get feedback from your builds as fast as possible.\n\nWe will then demonstrate the major advantages of Gradle:\n\nConventions and base plugins\nIncrementality (tasks, builds)\nAdvanced configuration\nDependency management\nIDE integration\nLast but not least, we will show how to setup a distributed cache, which allows to dramatically reduce build durations, both on CI and locally!\n\nAfter this session, you will have all the prerequisites to understand what Gradle can provide to you, how its model differs from other build tool, how to improve your build times, or simply improve the quality of your software by defining a build and release process with high quality standards.\n\nCédric Champeau \nFrom Gradle, Inc\nCédric Champeau is a software engineer at Gradle, Inc. , where he is currently focused on implementing next generation dependency management features. He also worked on improving the performance of the build tool. He is committer of Apache Groovy and spent more than 3 years developing full time the language at Pivotal, where he implemented features like the static compiler, traits, Android support, AST transformations or type checking extensions.\n\nPrior to that, he spent several years in the industry as a user, where he used Groovy in multiple industrial contexts including DSLs for natural language processing, scripting or even workflows.\n\nLouis Jacomet \nFrom Gradle, Inc.\nLouis Jacomet has been perfecting his knowledge of Java for more than 15 years. Always a developer at heart, his role evolved over the last years to include technical team leading, coaching and some management. In addition to the bits and bytes, Louis is interested in people management skills mandatory to create a productive project team. To complete the buzzword bingo, Louis is interested in agile practices for the visibility, communication and result orientation it promotes. After working remotely from Belgium for Terracotta, with a focus on Ehcache, Louis is now part of the Gradle build tool team."
