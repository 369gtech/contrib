description: "Connected devices are becoming ubiquitous. To enable users to quickly and easily communicate with them, we've designed the Physical Web, an open-source system that uses beacons to enable lightweight interactions with nearby devices and locations. Ani Mohan talks about how the Physical Web uses the latest beacon and web technologies to offer a range of ways to bring interactivity to everyday scenarios. We also describe how developers can get started today to build Physical Web experiences.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
