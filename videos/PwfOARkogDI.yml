description: "This video was recorded at Code Elixir LDN 19\nGet involved in Code Syncâ€™s next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\nError-free Elixir\nby Maciej Kaszubowski\n\nError-free Elixir\nError handling can greatly increase the complexity of the system. In Elixir, the default way of reducing the error-handling code is to use the \"Let it crash!\" approach. But there's another way.\nIn this talk, you'll learn how to eliminate errors by redefining the operation semantics, all supported by real-life examples. By doing so, you'll be able to not only reduce the need for error handling, but also simplify the entire codebase, make it smaller, more testable and easier to understand.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTeach how we can reduce the amount of error-handling code.\n\nAUDIENCE\nAll Elixir developers - because we're way too used to using error tuples and this should change.\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nError handling code\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Maciej Kaszubowski\nSoftware Developer at AppUnite, Computer Science student\n\nMaciej is a backend developer at AppUnite, where he's been using Elixir for almost 3 years now. Currently, he's mainly interested in broadly defined complexity theory and general systems thinking, which he tries to apply to both developing software and creating better teams. \n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE ELIXIR LDN 19\nCODE ELIXIR LDN is powered by Code Sync.
