description: "One of the key components of the infrastructure architecture at Issuu is the Thin Layer. The little piece of Erlang code allowed us complete freedom in creating a microservice-oriented architecture. By converting HTTP requests to AMQP messages it allows anyone to create a microservice at any moment and not worry about routing or load balancing. We believe others would benefit from such architecture and would like to present it to the BEAM community.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nPresent the Thin Layer to the community as we are planning to open source it. Gather feedback and ideas for possible improvements.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/pawel-antemijczuk/"
