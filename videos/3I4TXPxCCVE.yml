description: "Learn how to integrate Keycloak with your Spring Boot projects from Scratch.\n\nKeycloak is an open source Identity and Access Management solution aimed at modern applications and services. It makes it easy to secure applications and services with little to no code.\n\nIn this full live coding session we will build from scratch a complete Spring Boot app, secure it with Keycloak and then decompose it to show how to secure microservices.\n\nSébastien Blanc is Java EE engineer with 10 years of experience. He works at Red Hat and focus on Open Source libraries for Mobile in the Enterprise Besides his “heavy” JEE profile (middleware, banking and insurance products) Sébastien spends a lot of time in Groovy and Grails. He is the author of several Grails plugins such as Spring Mobile, Jquery Mobile Scaffolding or Geolocation. He believes that Mobile Web/Hybrid Apps are the future and tries to evangelize this through different conferences (Devoxx, JUDCon, JavaOne, SpringOne)."
