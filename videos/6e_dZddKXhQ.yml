title: 'The Anatomy of an Exploit - Patricia Aas'
recordingDate: 1569846731
description: "Security vulnerabilities and secure coding is often talked about in the abstract by programmers, but rarely understood. In this talk we will walk through simple exploit attempts, and finally a simple stack buffer overflow exploit, how it’s developed and how it’s used.\n\nThe goal is to try to get a feeling for the point of view of an \"attacker\", and to slowly start looking at exploitation as just another programming practice. We will mainly be looking at C and x86_64 assembly, so bring snacks.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
