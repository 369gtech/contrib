description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nWriting correct C++ is hard. Period. Full stop. Even if a small change to a simple 2,000-line program compiles, has tests, and passes the tests, the code might still be broken. When the code spans hundreds of thousands of files across many different projects, making sure your change is safe is orders of magnitude harder. This talk is about all of the things that make that problem manageable for a Facebook engineer to tackle.\n— \nMark Isaacson\nFacebook\nSoftware Engineer\nMark Isaacson is a Software Engineer at Facebook, where he works on improving the developer experience for all C++ programmers at Facebook.
