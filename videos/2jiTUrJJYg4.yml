recordingDate: 1523570682
description: "Ken and I talk about how we approach learning in today fast paced tech industry. Reading isnâ€™t enough, do. Watch it, read it, but for sure code it. Learn that why!\n\nKen has been developing software for over 20 years. In that time, I have worked on a large varienty of systems: embedded avionic systems, Windows desktop applications, large Oracle based ERP systems running on Unix/Linux, .NET back-end services, and front end web and hybrid mobile applications. I also developed a couple of my own Linux based open source programs. One was a ticketing system used by a small city outside of Tampa. The other was a flash cards game for kids.\n\nI am currently employed as the Senior Enterprise Support Engineer at Ionic, which means that I spend my time helping our enterprise customers take better advantage of the Ionic Framework as well as our other offerings to solve their problems and develop their products.\n\nWhen not working, I enjoy cooking, biking, working out, reading, helping my dad work on cars, and (of course) exploring various aspects of technology that are either directly or tangentally relted to my work (or, when I have time, stuff I just find interesting).\n\nTwitter: @KenSodemann\nGitHub: https://github.com/kensodemann\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ken.sodemann"
