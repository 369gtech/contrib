description: "Your users shouldn't be waiting months to access new features. Your development team shouldn't be stuck chasing for infrastructure or databases to be created. How can platforms and pipelines help keep you focused on the needs of people first? Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), built on the leading open source cloud application runtime Cloud Foundry, frees your developers to focus on delivering value to your users in an innovative self-service model. Part of that speed and freedom comes from good CI/CD practices, and Concourse (https://concourse.ci), delivers an open source, pipeline based CI/CD system that focuses on simplicity, usability and reproducibility by isolating builds, and declarative tools that avoid snowflakes of hard-to-maintain plugin code.\n\nAlex Ley is a Product Manger for the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform and is focused on data service automation for multi-cloud using Cloud Foundry and BOSH. Previously, Alex was a committer to the container engine Garden Linux, used by Cloud Foundry, and worked in London's FinTech startup scene.\n\n[AXR-1221]"
