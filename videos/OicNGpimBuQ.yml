language: English
recordingDate: 1632327220
description: "As Product Managers, we have a love-hate relationship with product roadmaps. \n \n For example, in the past, we've struggled to answer questions such as: \n \n - How to create a roadmap that communicates the product direction? \n - How to answer my management team when they want \"something big\" in the roadmap?\n - How to align with the rest of the team on why we have such features in the roadmap?\n \n In this session, we want to share our experiences on how we shifted roadmap creation from feature-oriented to outcomes-oriented. We believe an outcomes-oriented roadmap would improve your communication with your stakeholders and gain their support. Moreover, articulate better why we are building this, to your team.\n\nFani Bahar, Senior Product Manager at VMware Tanzu Labs\nJulia Keis, Product Manager at AUDI AG\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/outcomesoriented-roadmap-from-vision-to-reality"
