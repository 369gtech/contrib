description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nFinally a good real-life use case for Reinforcement Learning (RL): traffic control! In this talk I will show you how we hooked up traffic simulation software to Python and how we built our own custom gym environment to run RL experiments with keras-rl for a simple 4-way intersection.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
