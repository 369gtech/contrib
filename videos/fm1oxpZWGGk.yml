description: "The world of ARM devices is booming. The major players like RaspberryPi2 and Odroid C1, priced at just $35 are getting more and more popular. Besides their possibility to act like full-fledged PCs, the ability to extend them with other modules makes the world of possible solutions tremendous.\nAs of Java8, the JDK comes alongside with official supported binaries for Linux OSs running on v6/v7 hardfloat ARM devices. The possibility to code in Java and to extend the solutions with libraries that offer pure hardware input/output access like pi4j, give us the opportunity to make actual devices fully coded in our favorite language.\nThis talk will cover the basics of the hardware and software needed to make your own devices with RaspberryPi, Java, pi4j, electronic components and third party add-on devices. Several examples will be covered, out of which: basic I/O, NFC readout, touchscreen and JavaFX interfaces, home automation center, etc... Also, the attendees will have the opportunity to learn the basics behind the GPIO interface and how to communicate via I2C, SPI and UART."
