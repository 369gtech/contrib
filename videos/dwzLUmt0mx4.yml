description: 'Community Connections experience - Q&A session hosted by the Industry and Customer Success Engineering Team. Every industry is innovating to provide differentiated and personalized experiences especially given the current world climate.  At their core of this transformation is the ability to tap into the volumes of available data and use it in meaningful ways to help customers.  At Microsoft, this is at the core of our approach to Industry Accelerators that drive out of the box functionality through industry common data models, sample apps, data standards, and templates for partners and customers.  This allows you to more easily develop business applications and a faster time to marketing, with the ability to extend Dynamics 365 and make it relevant for your industry and build new and innovative applications on the Power Platform.  Join our team for a Q&A on all of the Industry Accelerators we have built to date and learn more about what is coming.'
