title: 'Going Reactive with Spring 5 & Project Reactor by Mark Heckler, Josh Long'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510303650
description: "Spring 5 is here! One of the most exciting introductions in this release is support for reactive programming, building on Project Reactor to support message-driven, elastic, resilient, and responsive services. Spring 5 integrates an MVC-like component model adapted to support reactive processing and a new type of web endpoint, functional reactive endpoints. In this talk, we'll dive into the net-new Netty-based web runtime and see how to integrate it with existing Spring-stack technologies, learn how to leverage powerful new testing mechanisms to make code better and life easier, and tie it all together with a live coding demo. If there's more to your life than CRUD, you need to be there!\n\n# Mark Heckler\nMark Heckler is a Pivotal Principal Technologist & Developer Advocate, conference speaker, published author, & Java Champion focusing upon developing quality production software at velocity for the Internet of Things and the Cloud.
