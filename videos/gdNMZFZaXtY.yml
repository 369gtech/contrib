description: "About the topic: Everybody heard about Agile as the best approach for startups and software companies, even for big banks and telcos.  For many Public Sector seems to be immune to Agility and incompatible with modern LEAN processes due to legal regulations, bureaucratic constraints and public procurement inflexibility.

We will share our practical experience of the 1st year Agile adoption and building the new PMO, preparing and running public procurement tenders for Agile projects, multiple release staged delivery of the Mobile Postman project. Painful and joyful cases. Ready to use templates.
