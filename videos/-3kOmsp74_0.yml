description: "https://media.ccc.de/c/asg2017/ASG2017-128-tango_with_systemd\n\n\n\nUsed by many major distributions, systemd is widely known in the desktop and\nserver world. But it is not so common to find it in embedded product.\nIn this talk, we will show how systemd can be a real benefit for the embedded\nworld; for both your sanity and your time.\nWe will discuss how systemd was integrated into Phantom, a speaker from\nDevialet, and what was the pro and cons of using it.\n\n\n\nMaxime Hadjinlian"
