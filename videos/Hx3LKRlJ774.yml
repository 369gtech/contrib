description: "RubyConf 2018 - Sweat the Small Stuff by Aaron Harpole\n\nThere is nothing quite like the excitement of leading a team of engineers while your company is in the middle of a growth spurt. Before you know it you start to notice that the work habits that used to work great just donâ€™t seem to be that effective anymore.\n\nIn much the way that cooking for two is quite different from cooking for two hundred, building your systems for scale requires a different approach to your work.\n\nIn this talk we will explore antipatterns that start to show up during growth and some techniques that you can use to address them."
