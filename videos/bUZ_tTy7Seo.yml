language: English
recordingDate: 1635790154
description: 'Rendering for virtual reality can prove challenging as not doing it correctly can make users feel ill. Qt 6 and the rendering hardware interface (RHI) makes it easier than ever to integrate efficiently with tools like OpenXR to interface with Head Mounted Displays for Virtual Reality. This talk is will dive into what it took to add support for Virtual Reality into Qt Quick 3D. Some challenging include rendering to native graphics surfaces, 3D input, and physics engine integration. This is an ongoing research project, and should be an exciting view into what is possible with Qt Quick 3D.'
