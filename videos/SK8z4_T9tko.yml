description: "At SafetyCulture, our culture is foundational to everything we do.\n\nOur engineering team has doubled to 60 in the space of 6 months and continues to grow. Not having a good handle on our culture we’re trying to build or preserve would be like driving a formula one car blindfolded and without a steering wheel. We'd crash and burn.\n\nThis talk moves beyond ping-pong tables and catered lunches to get to the core of what makes up a healthy engineering culture, where everyone gets out of bed each day to be a part of something they find meaningful, and accomplish big things as part of a team.\n\nIn the talk, we’ll cover what ingredients are essential to a healthy culture, and what that means to the team. Culture doesn’t stand still, so we’ll also cover how to maintain what’s important as the team grows or changes, and how to keep it fresh over the course of time.\n\nLUKE:\nAn engineer and leader with over 17 years experience in UK and Australia. Currently looking after Engineering at one of Australia's fastest growing start-ups, SafetyCulture.\n\nBRETT:\nI'm an open source software developer from Sydney, Australia with a passion for development tooling, automation, and the ASF.\n\nSeeking a more standardized and reproducible solution to organize, build and deploy a number of software projects across teams, I discovered an early beta of Maven 1.0 in 2003, and have been heavily involved in the development of the project since, and have conducted presentations and training on Maven and related tooling at several conferences and events. I founded the Apache Archiva project in 2005.\n\nI am currently Chairman of the Apache Software Foundation, and have served on the Board of Directors in 2009-10, and 2011-present.\n\nI am the co-author of Apache Maven 2: Effective Implementation (2009), and Better Builds with Maven (2005), the first book to be written about the Maven 2.0 release, as well as serving as a reviewer on several other titles.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
