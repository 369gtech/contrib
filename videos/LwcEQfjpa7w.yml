title: 'ASP.NET Core – OWIN in disguise - Chris Klug'
recordingDate: 1473417823
description: "4 years ago, Microsoft decided to embrace the OWIN specification by creating the Katana Project, and a short while later, it became the standard way to implement authentication ASP.NET.\nAnd now it has had its coffee and it is the base for the entire framework. So it might be time to learn it, embrace it, and start loving it.\n\nIn this talk, Chris will take you on a speed date with OWIN and ASP.NET Core, get you introduced, find out each other’s interests and get you to stare lovingly into each other’s eyes. If that doesn’t work, there is always a code demo or two to show off and explain what this is all about."
