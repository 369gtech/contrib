title: 'Introduction to JavaScript for APEX Developers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1591730368
description: "JavaScript continues to play an increasingly important role with each release of APEX. This is because APEX creates web apps, and it's JavaScript that programs the web. But for developers coming from a background in SQL and PL/SQL, JavaScript can be a little intimidating.\n \nLuckily, APEX developers only need to know a little JavaScript to impact their applications significantly. In this Office Hours session, attendees will learn how to write essential JavaScript code, add it to APEX apps, and work with jQuery and the DOM.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/ \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
