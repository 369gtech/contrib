description: "Jeremy Davis, Principal Solution Architect, Red Hat\n\nFacebook has more than two billion active users per month, more than the number of active users of the internet in 2000. Humans create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day. Massively scalable systems and massive amounts of data are part of every developerâ€™s life. Reactive approaches are critical pieces in scaling modern systems and are particularly important in microservices architectures. This session addresses why reactive development is essential for scaling microservices architectures in general and greenfield microservices applications in particular. It covers the origins of reactive Java at Netflix with ReactiveX; reactive systems with Eclipse Vert.x, Akka, and Spring Reactor; and a bit of Reactive JavaScript while playing with marbles."
