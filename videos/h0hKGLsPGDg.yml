description: "Serverless is seeing explosive growth, and is being used in all sorts of places, with many applications. The one thing we can’t always solve is latency– how do we get the data to users faster? Computing on the edge is a fancy term for putting your serverless function (your compute) as geographically close to the user as possible. This doesn’t just help with the latency issue– there are a few tricks up my sleeve for how computing on the edge is a fun idea: including that most mythical of unicorns; a/b testing of serverless functions! Come watch as we de-mystify the arcane vocabulary around computing on the edge and talk about the when, and whys of this style of serverless.\n\nWebsite: https://boston.serverlessdays.io"
