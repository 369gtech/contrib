description: "This video was recorded at virtual Code BEAM V America conference, which took place on 10-12th March 2021 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v-america-2021/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global​ \n\n---\n\nPanel Discussion around Startups, Venture Capital in the Erlang Ecosystem\nby Rob Mee, Jane Walerud, William King\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this Panel, we bring together angel and VC investors and founders to discuss the main drivers behind startups, investment and the BEAM. The panel features angel investor Jane Walerud, who not only got Erlang open sourced at Ericsson, but has invested and been CEO of multiple companies using the BEAM. Rob Mee is the founder of Pivotal labs, and is currently running an incubator which makes heavy use of Elixir. William King is the co-founder of Subspace, a company building the world’s (and space’s) fastest internet. Subspace has successfully raised over $100m over multiple rounds of funding. Together, we will discuss what really matters when raising funds. Was it the technology stack, the passion, the idea, the track record, or a mixture of all of them? What do VCs look for, and what do founders have to do to succeed?\n\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Rob Mee\nFounder/CEO\nRob entered the workforce as a dishwasher, a job he clung to for several years until the flashing LED lights of an IBM PC AT lured him into the world of programming. He clung to his next job for three decades: founding Pivotal in 1989, selling it to EMC in 2012, taking it public on the NYSE in 2018, and finally selling it again to VMware in 2019. Now in his third real job, he has started a new incubator called Geometer. Geometer relies on an evolved software development method, extraordinary engineering and product talent, and a killer technology (guess which one) to build businesses that innovate on highly concurrent, large scale services and platforms. \n\nSPEAKER - William King \nCo-founder & CTO\nWhen not collecting really hard puzzles and dying often in his favorite first person shooters William is a real-time communications expert and a core developer of the Freeswitch project, William led the development of Flowroute’s core tech, Portugal Telecom next generation network, and the Silent Circle network.
