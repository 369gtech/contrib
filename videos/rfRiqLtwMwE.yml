description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nBuilding the Multi-Cluster Data Layer - Chirag Narang, Yugabyte\n\nGetting the data layer right is critical to building a cloud-native application. The global accessibility of persistent data across multi-cluster Kubernetes environments is the biggest challenge for building stateful workloads. As organizations rush to scale their infrastructure on multi-cluster Kubernetes, they often struggle with database deployments. Many traditional databases have not worked at the scale needed; either they are not horizontally scalable or highly available and do not provide strong consistency across multiple clusters. We’re here to show you that it’s easy to deploy a distributed database across multiple clusters. In this talk, join Chirag Narang, Product Manager from YugabyteDB to learn: Cross cluster deployment challenges in distributed databases How practitioners can adopt a service mesh to run a distributed SQL database across clusters How to solve global consistency, scalability, high availability, and geo-distribution challenges with YugabyteDB"
