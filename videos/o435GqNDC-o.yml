title: 'YOW! 2019 - Cat Swetel - 193 Easy Steps to DevOpsing Your Monolith'
language: English
recordingDate: 1582056010
description: "Is it possible to enable the evolution of a monolith? After a hugely expensive (financially and culturally) failed attempt at a complete rewrite, Ticketmaster is attempting to do just that, bounce back and evolve the monolith that is Ticketmaster’s core ticketing platform. This multi-year effort requires striking a delicate balance between showing appropriate respect for the platform’s highly profitable 40 plus year history while not allowing past success to blind us to demands of a highly dynamic market of fans, artists, venues, and more. This is not a session about best practices for developing your monolith; this session is the true (and at times ugly) story of one company’s journey towards a more flexible, adaptable, and easily maintainable architecture supported by a culture that prizes learning and respect above all else.\n\nCat is a consultant specializing in lean inspired, data informed coaching for technology organizations. She is passionate about increasing diversity in STEAM as a means of creating the possibility of a more equitable human future based on generative institutions. In her leisure time, Cat enjoys making jokes about Bitcoin, hiking, and reading feminist literature.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
