description: "Audit in Kubernetes, the Future is Here - Stefan Schimanski & Maciej Szulik, Red Hat \n\nAdvanced Auditing is now available, and you should learn how to use it. Last year, we proposed a list of improvements to Kubernetes auditing, and this year we are happy to report that we have delivered them! Join us for this session to learn what Advanced Auditing does, how to adapt it to your own requirements, and how to integrate it into your infrastructure.  Topics to be covered include: 1. From basic audit to advanced audit 2. Defining a policy (examples) * Deep object logging * Excluding secrets * Logging different objects at different levels 3. Integrating with your infrastructure 4. Performance impact vs. consistency 5. Writing an audit webhook server 6. Which future improvements are planned   We are hoping to demystify the complexity of the policy configuration by showing a handful of example rules that will allow attendees to better understand the mechanism. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrXd"
