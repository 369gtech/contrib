description: "With Twilio, building telecom applications has become a task that engineers do with any language. Applications can be built for things as simple as texting the weather to your phone each morning or as complex as running a call center. Elixir, built on Erlang OTP, is a perfect language for building modern telecom applications. With the easy to use concurrency model and hot code swapping you can build applications that don’t get bogged down by data processing and don’t drop calls when you’re pushing new code. This talk will answer such questions as “how do we alert everyone that there’s a zombie invasion?”, “which world leaders can make the call that the invasion is happening?”, and “what kind of zombies do I need to prepare for?”\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl) \n13-15 September 2017"
