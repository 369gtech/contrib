title: 'The secret weapon for developers, Notebooks. - Cristian Prieto'
recordingDate: 1499244239
description: "No, we are not talking about paper notebooks, or moleskines, or any of that hipster stuff, we are talking about electronic notebooks, like Jupyter and IPython notebooks. For years they have been in use by data scientists and data engineers but I haven't seen them permeate into the developer community yet, why?\n\nIf you want to take a page from the data scientist's (note)book, come along to my talk and learn about how you can use notebooks to speed up your learning, do some spike and prototyping or have a new tool in your toolbelt. In this talk, I will share a developer's perspective of this amazing tool for almost everything.\n\nNo knowledge of astronomy required."
