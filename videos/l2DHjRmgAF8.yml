language: English
recordingDate: 1544608487
description: "With the rise of web-to-native cross-platform solutions like React Native and Electron we got to witness not only their potential but also their shortcomings. Thanks to WebAssembly we now have an alternative that uses a different approach but promises the same results.\nIn my talk, I’ll share the lessons the join.me team learned over the last few years while creating and maintaining a cross-platform (web included!) C++ codebase, with special attention to management and team-dynamic aspects. You’ll also see how WebAssembly changes the game and, through a bit of live-coding, how easy it is to get started with it.\n\n\nBenedek Gagyi\nDeveloper, teacher, sports-fanatic. As a developer, he's working on simplifying online collaboration at join.me by LogMeIn. As a teacher, he's training people in various frontend related fields at Training360. In his free time, he's researching the patterns and algorithms connecting basketball, trail running, and drums. His devotion to impeccable user interfaces is rivaled only by his constant search for the perfect brew of Chinese tea.\n\n\nNordic.js is a single track conference with talks by internationally renowned speakers and rising stars in the JavaScript community.
