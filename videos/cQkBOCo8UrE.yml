description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nWalter Bright - Develops Compilers and Programming Languages\n\nABSTRACT\nArchitecting a complex program out of simpler, independent building blocks has long been recognized as a means to higher programmer productivity and programs that work better.\n\nBut creating independent, robust, high performance, reusable software components turns out to be remarkably difficult.\n\nMost schemes fall well short. I will show how a combination of features of the D programming language enables the creation of best-of-breed components that 'snap together' with ease, with plenty of headroom for user customization and compiler optimization.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
