description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n— \nSoftware development of automotive control units has long been in the hands of hardcore C developers. With the increasing need for high-performing, multi-core processors and for applications that can be updated over the Internet, this has changed. \n\nThe recently released Adaptive AUTOSAR standard fully embraces C++11/14 as its language of choice. This leverages new opportunities for AUTOSAR applications, but also poses new challenges to ensure functional safety and to train developers. \n\nLet’s have a look at some Adaptive AUTOSAR APIs and at the AUTOSAR “Guidelines for the use of the C++14 language in critical and safety-related systems” and see how they fit into the bigger picture.\n—\nJan Babst: Elektrobit Automotive GmbH. Expert\n\nJan has been programming C++since the late 1990’s when the ink on the C++98 standard was still wet. He once submitted a naïve implementation of \nstd::valarray using expression templates to libstdc++, which actually made it into a review but is now long forgotten. \n\nSince 2003 he is working at Elektrobit (then named 3Soft) which over the years turned from a software development service provider to a major player in the automotive software business. \nFor a long time he has been working in various roles for customer navigation projects. \nAt the beginning of 2017 he took on a new challenge in the development of software and people for the new Adaptive AUTOSAR standard in Elektobit’s car infrastructure domain. \n\nJan is regularly training colleagues in C++ and coordinates the in-house training program for C++ at Elektrobit. \nHe also contributes to the C++ Coding Guidelines within the Functional Safety feature team of the AUTOSAR consortium. \n\nEB is a wholly owned, independent subsidiary of Continental AG. \n_\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
