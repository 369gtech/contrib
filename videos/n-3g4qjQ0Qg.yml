recordingDate: 1553676854
description: "Dashboarding, also known as visualisation, is a difficult thing to do. First, there is a vast choice of tooling and setup. Then, figuring out what information should be displayed, where and why can be confusing.\nTogether we will journey through a practical tour of dashboarding. Focusing on metrics, we will cover how to get information out of your applications using telemetry. I will show you how you might set up your monitoring infrastructure with a demo powered by Docker. Finally we will cover some of the common patterns that can ensure your visualisations and dashboards are useful, and anti-patterns to avoid.\n\nThis will be a whirlwind tour from start to finish on how to get started making impactful dashboards.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndcporto.com"
