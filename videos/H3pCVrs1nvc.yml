title: 'YOW! Perth 2018 - Gregor Hohpe - Enterprise Architecture = Architecting the Enterprise?'
recordingDate: 1538620641
description: "Architects in the enterprise are often regarded as ivory tower residents who bestow their utopian plans upon project teams in the form of colorful diagrams that bear little to no resemblance to reality. The most suspicious in this group are often the “Enterprise Architects” who are perceived as being furthest from actual technical problems.\nHowever, large-scale IT operation and transformation require transparency across hundreds or thousands of applications running on all sorts of middleware in data centers around the globe. The very enterprise architects are likely the only ones who stand a chance to bring transparency into such an environment and who can direct IT investments in the hundreds of millions of Euros towards modernization and run-cost reduction. This sounds a lot more exciting and valuable than drawing pictures!\nThis session takes a serious but light-hearted look at the role of enterprise architects in modern IT organisations.\n\nGregor is a recognized thought leader on asynchronous messaging and service-oriented architectures. He is widely known as co-author of the seminal book “Enterprise Integration Patterns” and as frequent speaker at conferences around the world. He is an active member of the IEEE Software editorial advisory board.\n\nHe has documented his experience as an architect driving IT transformation in the eBook \"37 Things One Architect Knows\".\nFor more on YOW!
