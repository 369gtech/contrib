title: 'DevOps for Your Relational Database Foundations - Brian Randell - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624007870
description: "Real applications persist data. From small departmental apps to large scale enterprises, right or wrong, the data is stored in a relational database like Microsoft SQL Server. How do you manage the necessary changes to the database (structure, programmable objects) to support your applications? How do you track these changes and follow a change from development to test to production? To be successful, you need an effective plan.\n\nIn this session, you'll learn where the SQL Server database fits in to DevOps, and how you can use tools to extend your infrastructure to make the database a first-class citizen, just like your source code. You'll see how to track changes with version control; create update packages; and deploy to multiple environments with complete automation like development, test, UAT, and production."
