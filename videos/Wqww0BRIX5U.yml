description: "Embracing the \"Hack.\" A Better Strategy for Team-Defense\n\nHaroon Meer, Founder of Thinkst Applied Research\n\nThis talk suggests that custom detection and response capabilities are a key component for enterprise defense. It posits that maybe, defense needs to take a step back and embrace \"hackyness\" to prevail.\n\nHistorically, offense has embraced \"hacky solutions\" while team-Defense has often shied away from them. We argue that this delta, on a fluid battlefield, gives attackers a distinct advantage and we suggest it is time for this to change.\n\nUsing the free Canarytokens service as a lens, we will step through several examples of these \"hacks\" and will explain how they (and the thinking behind them) can lead to safer enterprises and networks. We also hope to identify areas we believe are ripe for deeper technical dives and ongoing research efforts.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '19 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/technical-sessions"
