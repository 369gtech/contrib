description: "Check out the latest from The Lead Developer at theleaddeveloper.com.\n\nWARNING: Making the transition from developer to lead is not without risks. Side effects include (but are not limited to): diminished sense of purpose, constant lingering doubt and feelings of inadequacy. These symptoms may disappear over time. If not, consult a professional or watch this talk.\n\nI was excited to become a lead developer when the chance presented itself but that excitement quickly faded when confronted with reality. Nobody told me what to do and as a result, I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. I was unproductive as a developer, ineffective as a leader and considered giving up many times. In this talk, I will discuss how I overcame this situation and found what makes this job at least as rewarding as being a developer."
