title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: Community Clouds for Cancer Genomics - Lessons Learned from Bionimbus'
language: English
recordingDate: 1384798084
description: "Bionimbus is an open source petabyte scale community cloud based upon OpenStack for managing, analyzing and sharing large genomics datasets that is operated by the not-for-profit Open Cloud Consortium.\n\nIt contains a variety of public datasets, including ENCODE and the 1000 Genomes dataset.\n\nIn this webcast talk by Robert Grossman, he shares how his organization recently expanded Bionimbus so that researchers can analyze data from controlled datasets, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in a secure and compliant fashion. TCGA contains data from over 6,000 cancer patients, spanning 20 different types of cancer. Tissues samples from both cancerous and normal tissue are collected and sequenced.\n\nIn this webcast we will discuss:\n\n    - The role of private, community and public clouds in bioinformatics\n    - The Bionimbus architecture\n    - The Bionimbus security and compliance framework\n    - How Bionimbus interoperates with Amazon Web Services\n    - How to interoperate your own resources with Bionimbus\n    - Adding data to Bionimbus\n    - How Bionimbus allocates computing resources to the community\n    - How to get involved with Bionimbus\n\nAbout Robert Grossman\n\nRobert Grossman is a faculty member and the Chief Research Informatics Officer in the Biological Sciences Division of the University of Chicago. He is a Senior Fellow in the Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology (IGSB) and the Computation Institute (CI). He is also the Founder and a Partner of Open Data Group, which specializes in building predictive models over big data. His areas of research include: big data, predictive analytics, bioinformatics, data intensive computing and analytic infrastructure. He has led the development of open source software tools for analyzing big data (Augustus), cloud computing (Sector), and high performance networking (UDT). In 1996 he founded Magnify, Inc., which provides data mining solutions to the insurance industry. Grossman was Magnify's Chairman until it was sold to ChoicePoint in 2005. He is also the Chair of the Open Cloud Consortium, which is a not-for-profit that supports the cloud community by operating cloud infrastructure, such as the Open Science Data Cloud. He blogs about big data, data science, and data engineering at rgrossman.com\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
