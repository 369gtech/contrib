description: "There's no rest for the wicked!  With SWIFT users having to migrate their funds messages from MT to MX and SWIFT pushing FpML over their network for derivatives. Dodd Frank now live in the US and going live in EMEA in 2013 and ISO-20022 really starting to be taken up by the DTCC and T2S, integration is more key to tomorrow's banks than any time over the last few decades.
