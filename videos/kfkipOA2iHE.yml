description: 'If you’re using Angular2+ and building forms the way you’ve always built them, you’re missing out on an amazingly powerful feature of the framework. Reactive forms (aka model-driven forms) allow you to build forms in the Javascript (or Typescript) file, making complex validation and error-handling a breeze. In this talk, we’ll build a standard-but-tricky form from scratch in less than 10 minutes!'
