description: "\"The cloud is for many scenarios the way to process data and apply business logic. But processing data in the cloud is not always the way to go, because of connectivity, legal issues, or because you need to respond in near-real-time.\n\nIn this session, we dive into how Azure Machine learning and Azure IoT Edge can help in this scenario. \n\nUsing Azure Machine Learning service, a cloud service to track as you build, train, deploy, and manage models, we train a custom model. \n\nWhen the model is ready we use Azure IoT Edge to deploy the model to an Edge device and find out how it can operate by itself.\n\nAt the end of the session, you have learned how to train a model using Azure Machine Learning and use IoT Edge to deploy this model to an IoT Edge device.\""
