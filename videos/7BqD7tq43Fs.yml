description: "The new world of voice-driven products is exciting and the opportunities are many. Voice is not web or mobile, though, so some of the the considerations and steps are quite different. This talk will introduce you to the key questions you need to answer and concepts you need to know, and then help you get started on crafting a good offering. Weâ€™ll work through what you can and should offer now, why and how, and what you will be able to offer in the future.\nwww.blendwebmix.com"
