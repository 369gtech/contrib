description: "In this presentation at the 2012 Northeast Scala Symposium in Boston, Peter Hausel, Senior Software Engineer at Typesafe, will introduce Play 2.0, a Scala (and Java) Web application framework and its core concepts.\r\n\r\nThe Play framework revolutionized the Java Web application development by bringing back simplicity and agility, contrasting the so-called standard way of writing enterprise applications. The whole Web architecture is fast moving towards real-time and new emerging requirements have put into question classic assumptions like SQL as the exclusive datastore technology, or the MVC application design.\r\n\r\n** Videos sponsored by Typesafe (http://typesafe.com) and Marakana."
