recordingDate: 1486571074
description: "Alan Smithson is an entrepreneur and investor who has always been on the cutting edge of emerging technologies. After graduating from University of Guelph with a Molecular Biology degree, Alan realized technology and music were his passions. He pursued a career in the DJ industry which developed into an AV Production & DJ Company, Star Productions Inc; leading to the creation of the EMULATOR, the world’s first touchscreen DJ System. His latest endeavor as Co-Founder & CEO of MetaVRse has entered him into the world of virtual and augmented reality experiences, becoming a leader in business applications for AR/VR and providing insight into this exploding field of technologies. Alan has been recognized as an industry pioneer, and was recently mentioned in an article on “10 Virtual Reality Leaders you should follow in 2016”. Equally comfortable behind a turntable or a group of Fortune 500 executives, Alan continues to evolve MetaVRse and its innovations, and is working on his third book, “Virtual and Augmented Reality for Marketing”.\n\nFITC produces events for digital creators in Toronto, Amsterdam, NYC and beyond\nSave 10% off any of our events with discount code 'youtube'\n\nCheck out our events at http://fitc.ca\nor follow us at https://twitter.com/fitc"
