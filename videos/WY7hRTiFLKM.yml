title: 'SREcon20 Americas - Capacity Planning and Performance Enhancement with Page Reference Sampling'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608746569
description: "Capacity Planning and Performance Enhancement with Page Reference Sampling\n\nDanny Chen, Bloomberg LP\n\nPage reference sampling provides an important view into the intersection of an operating system's memory management subsystem and program behavior. Historically, page reference sampling has involved modifications to kernel code. Solaris provides a little known/advertised interface for doing page reference sampling without kernel changes.\n\nWe will show how to use this interface to get data that can be useful for capacity planning and for tweaking some of the memory management knobs that the system provides. We'll also compare this with what we can get on Linux systems.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
