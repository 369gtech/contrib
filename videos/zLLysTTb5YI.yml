description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - Web Components are here, the v1 of the standard is ready, a new world of componentalized web is ahead us. But when you look at it, there are many ways to write them, lots of libs. And you ask yourself if that web component interoperability really works in real life. Does all those different components, work seamless together? We are going to introduce several ways to build your web components (vanilla components, Polymer, Stencil, SkateJS...) and write a component with each one. Then we will put all those components together in a web app showing you that the interoperability is a reality.'
