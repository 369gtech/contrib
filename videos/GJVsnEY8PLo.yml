title: 'How to build enterprise ready scalable AI solutions using Azure Cognitive Services - BRK3004'
recordingDate: 1557271222
description: 'Leading enterprises are using AI to power innovation across industries, including healthcare, automotive, and finance. In this session, gain insight into how these enterprise AI solutions are implemented using Azure Cognitive Services on Spark and Azure CosmosDB. Cognitive Services on Spark enable working with Azureâ€™s Intelligent Services at massive scales with the Apache Spark distributed computing ecosystem. We will demonstrate how customers like SAP, NASCAR, MediaValet and OpenText are using Custom vision service, Video Indexer, Text analytics, Bing and speech services at cloud scale and how customers like Kroger are able to mitigate privacy and security concerns by deploying cognitive services on-premise as containers.'
