description: "The role of software architects changed significantly over the last years. The agile transformation in IT companies demands a different skill set from architects. In the past it was about package structures of monoliths and class diagrams. Today you have to deal with team structures, agile methodologies and developer enablement to be successful as an architect. You have to take the architect elevator.\n\nIn this talk I speak about my experiences as an architect made in three different sized agile companies, one of them Zalando. All of them were in a microservice transition which resulted in a set of similar challenges you had to deal with as an architect. Furthermore, I show solutions we designed and implement in these companies to succeed with our microservice transition."
