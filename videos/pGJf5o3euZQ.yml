description: "DOES19 Las Vegas - Through the adoption of DevOps principles, businesses continue to yield positive outcomes and deliver value faster to their customers.  Trends indicate that these principles are being adopted quickly across the software industry.  What happens when software is only one part of your value stream? What about environments that include software, embedded software, and hardware? The ability to iterate and deploy faster allows companies to adapt to changing needs, reduce cycle time for delivery, increase delivery of value, improve transparency, and leverage innovations.  An often misconception is that this form of rapid iteration and flow of value is only for software or small applications.  In our presentation, we share our lessons learned from the aerospace defense industry using a specific, hypothetical scenario. The scenario provides the context as we highlight the challenges of building large complex systems and how the principles of Industrial DevOps can be applied to solutions that include software and hardware.  Our intent is to broaden the concept and success of DevOps to understand its applicability in difÂ­ferent contexts specifically in those that extend beyond software.  We also invite feedback as we continue to build and expand the story and the experiences of Industrial DevOps.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
