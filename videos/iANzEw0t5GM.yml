description: "Your team needs data so they can make the right decisions. Unless they have the right data in the right place, they're left to act on intuition, opinions and hunches. With a modicum of data infrastructure, you can give them what they need. Join us and learn how to build the foundations of your analytical data systems.\n\nWe'll discuss data collection: identifying what you can measure that will deliver the most value. We'll explore the minimum viable data toolkit, and how managed hosted solutions can save you time and effort. We'll dissect stream processing, batch processing and several different types of databases to demonstrate what you should focus on in this rapidly changing ecosystem. See how - with the cost and effort of running data systems dropping every day - it's easier than ever to give your team the data it needs."
