description: "Speaker: Sharon Woo\r\n\r\nData science has been called “the sexiest job of the 21st century”, and EDB estimates the data analytics industry contributes about S$1b annually to the Singapore economy. But ask 10 people what a data science job is and how to break in, and you're likely to get more than 10 job titles and pathways because the field is rapidly evolving. How do we as junior developers then \r\n\r\n1) decide if it's for us, whatever *it* is, \r\n2) plan out some routes to break in, and \r\n3) look out for some green/red flags in the interviewing process?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore what \"data science\" roles can mean, how-to-ing the job interview process, and how to vet roles to determine if they're right for you. \r\n\r\nSharon is currently working in the Singapore Government as a data scientist, and is finishing up a Masters at SMU's School of Information Systems. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-woo/\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/266152374/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Ying Ka Ho\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/CQTFx/"
