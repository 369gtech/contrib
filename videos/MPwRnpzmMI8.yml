title: 'Infrastructure as Code: Manage your Architecture with Git, Danilo Poccia - Git Merge 2015'
recordingDate: 1431452505
description: 'With the AWS Cloud you have an on-demand, programmable infrastructure that you can manage using tools and practices from software development. You can create resources when you need and dispose of them when you donâ€™t. Using Amazon CloudFormation you can describe your architecture in text files. To change your infrastructure, you edit those files. Having application and infrastructure code together in a single, robust, versioned repository like Git gives a lot of advantages. Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk you can link your Git branches to different infrastructure environments (e.g. test, production) and automate deployments. You can create test environments on-demand, even for a short time. Instead of continuously update your resources, you can recreate them quickly from scratch, simplifying lifecycle management and making deployments immutable. As a result, you have more time to focus on the unique features of your application.'
