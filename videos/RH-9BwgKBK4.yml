title: 'Petabytes Data Migration and Load Balancing with Football+MARS'
recordingDate: 1549727249
description: "Thomas Schoebel-Theuer\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/222/\n\nMARS is used at 1&1 IONOS for hardware lifecycle and load balancing of a few thousands of stateful LXC containers, in addition to its traditional long-distance data replication capabilities through network bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nThe talk explains some background, the Football toolset, and discusses experiences gained from a major migration project to newer hardware, increasing density, thus saving power costs of some millions of â‚¬ per year, while improving customer performance.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
