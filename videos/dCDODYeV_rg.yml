description: 'Conflicts are destructive. They destroy relationships & teams. They are the cause of up to 20% of every companies spendings and result in lost jobs, lost reputations and lost credibility. Everyone most likely has a negative image of being in a conflict. The seemingly easiest way out is to avoid conflict - and end up in a lose-lose situation. In this talk we will look at conflict''s triggers and mechanisms to understand how they emerge and how they are resolved. We change perspectives to take a closer look at the positive aspects of conflicts and how to use them to make them work for us.'
