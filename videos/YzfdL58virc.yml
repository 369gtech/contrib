description: "Whether you're interested in AI or you just want to do some real engineering work, you’re going to need to brush up on your math skills. In this video, I’ll describe my strategy to learn mathematics as fast as possible. Math is a specific, powerful vocabulary for ideas and giving a structure to the way you learn it will empower you to absorb much more of it much faster. I'll go over my strategies in order. \n\nMath resources:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/learn_math_fast\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment.
