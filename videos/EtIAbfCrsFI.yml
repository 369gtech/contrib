description: "Speaker: Andrew Knight\n\nBehavior-Driven Development (BDD) is gaining popularity as an improved way to collaborate over product features and tests. In Python, **behave** is one of the leading BDD test frameworks. Using **behave**, teams write Gherkin behavior scenarios (e.g., tests) in plain language, and then programmers write Python code to automate the steps. BDD testing is great because tests are self-documenting and steps abide by the DRY principle. An example test could be:\n\n- Given the DuckDuckGo home page is displayed\n- When the user searches the phrase \"Python\"\n- Then search results for \"Python\" are shown\n\nThis talk will teach how to use **behave** to develop well-designed test scenarios and a robust automation framework. It will focus on the layers of the behave framework: feature files, step definitions, support classes, and config files. A full example project will be hosted on GitHub for audience members to reference after the talk.\n\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
