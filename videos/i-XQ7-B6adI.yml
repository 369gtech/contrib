description: "Speaker: Wei Gao\r\n\r\nA True Gem in My Learning Folio as a Work in\r\nProgress Web Developer How much do you think you will learn by writing docs? You\r\npick up a topic, read the relevant code, blog posts, answered questions, and\r\norganize them into the context of official docs. The magic lies in the role\r\nshift from a developer to an explainer, and an end user to a maintainer. The\r\nmission to explain things to others makes your learning more interactive, and\r\nthe top-down approach to the subject matter nurtures your curiosity to go\r\ndeeper. What's more, the collective knowledge on the internet becomes your\r\nknowledge, the answers to questions no longer scattered everywhere but live\r\norganized in the official docs, thanks to your contribution. It's probably the\r\nbest #learnInPublic habit that too few people know about. It's a true gem I keep\r\nin my learning folio, would you like to carve yours as well? About Wei Gao Wei\r\nis a work in progress React web developer. Runs React Knowledgeable with a few\r\nother cool kids in town, also on the pirate ship of SingaporeCSS. Wei's recently\r\nstruggling with coding but is trying very hard to get better. When she's not\r\ncoding, she's probably in a climbing gym.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-gao-2b618717/\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/264959348/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/B8Jri/"
