description: "Chris Richardson, founder of the original CloudFoundry.com, is a server-side Java developer who wasn't too thrilled about JavaScript in the browser, let alone on the server. In fact, he might even suggest that we are slaves to JavaScript because people have simply started to accept its weirdness and flaws, much like a Stockholm Syndrome phenomenon.\n\nDespite his misgivings, Chris has discovered an appreciation for Node.JS. In this talk from JAXConf 2013, Chris will walk you through the consequences of combining the event-driven programming model with a prototype-based, weakly typed, dynamic language. Ultimately, however, you will learn how to effectively use Node in modern, polyglot applications.\n\n** Watch this video and follow along with the slides at http://mrkn.co/pguht"
