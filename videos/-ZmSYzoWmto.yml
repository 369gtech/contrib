description: "Keynote: CF Application Runtime Demo: Weighted Routing (Istio/Envoy), Multiple Custom App Ports, and App Revisions - Dieu Cao, Director of Product Management, Pivotal\n\nHave you ever wanted to route traffic for a url to multiple applications in proportions that you can specify?  \nHow about specifying multiple custom application ports for an application to listen on? Perhaps for a hard-coded listening port? Or for exposing a management endpoint on a different route?\nWhat about tracking changes to your application and being able to easily rollback to a previous version?\n\nIn this demo, I'll show how some of the latest features in CF Application Runtime work together to achieve all of the above, making application developer lives easier so they can focus on delivering business value.\n\nAbout Dieu Cao\nDieu Cao is Director of Product Management at Pivotal, where she works on the product strategy for Pivotal Application Service.  She is also currently serving as the Cloud Foundry Foundation PMC Council Chair. She has been with Pivotal since 2010 and a core contributor to Cloud Foundry since 2014.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
