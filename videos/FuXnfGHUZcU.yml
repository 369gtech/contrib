description: "gRPC load balancing and Service Mesh - Vishal Powar, Google \n\nService mesh architecture proposes a unique approach for control plane management (including load balancing). This talk goes over the options available for gRPC load-balancing in the context of a gRPC integration in a service mesh.  In this talk, we will cover:   various load balancing options available for gRPC and the tradeoff associated with each one of them.   load balancing at scale with and without gRPC lookaside load balancing.   proxy based load balancing and Service Mesh along with considerations when using them as an alternative to lookaside gRPC load balancing.   how unified endpoint management can be achieved for Health check and load metric reporting for both gRPC load balancing and Service Mesh.    \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPbI"
