description: "Google Tech Talk\nOctober 8, 2015\n(click \"show more\" for more info)\nPresented by Bill Hoffman\n\nABSTRACT\nSince 1998 Kitware has been developing scientific computing software with a strong focus on reproducibility and testability. Kitware was initially founded to grow and support the open source Visualization Toolkit (VTK). Over the past 17 years developers at Kitware have played a role in important scientific research in HPC & visualization, medical computing, data & analytics and computer vision. Behind all of this work has been an evolving set of tools to build, test, verify and deploy software. The cross-platform build tool CMake originally created for the Insight Toolkit (ITK) has become the most popular build tool for C/C++ in the world. In this talk I will describe the new innovations in the CMake family and give several examples of tools and techniques successfully deployed to advance a wide range of scientific and commercial activities such as Google Project Tango, ParaView, Slicer, VeloView, Netflix, and others. In particular the talk will describe how these tools are used to facilitate continuous testing and tracking of both code quality and algorithm performance in a world of distributed software teams and ever-growing datasets.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\nBill Hoffman is a founder of Kitware and currently serves as Vice President and Chief Technical Officer. He is the original author and lead architect of CMake, an open-source, cross-platform build and configuration tool that is used by hundreds of projects around the world and the co-author of the accompanying text, Mastering CMake. Using his 20+ years of experience with large software systems development, Mr. Hoffman is also a major technical contributor to Kitware's Visualization Toolkit, Insight Toolkit and ParaView projects."
