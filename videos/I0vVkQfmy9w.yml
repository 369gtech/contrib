description: "GraphQL is Facebook’s approach for building scalable, maintainable, efficient, and self-describing web-based APIs. It combines a simple, self-describing type system with a declarative query language that puts the client in control over exactly what data is provided in the response. GraphQL is a departure from prior systems, such as REST and SOAP: it abandons the veneer of object orientation, and instead keeps data, and operations on the data, entirely separate: a functional approach that’s a great fit for Clojure. We’ll discuss the essentials of the GraphQL specification, and how to use Lacinia, Walmart’s open source Clojure GraphQL library.\n\nHoward Lewis Ship has been active in the Java, open source, and Clojure communities for many years; he’s the creator of Apache Tapestry, but has left his “big framework” days behind to focus on Clojure."
