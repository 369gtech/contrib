description: 'There’s been a predictable pattern in AI news: machine beats human—a computer demonstrating a skill that was once thought to be impossible for an AI. In IBM Watson’s case, it was first a game of chess, then Jeopardy. Since then, Watson has turned to more prosaic pursuits: helping doctors with diagnoses, insurance companies with customer service, accountants with auditing, and lawyers with legal research. And in each of these cases, it is an assistant—a powerful assistant, but an assistant nonetheless—not an opponent.'
