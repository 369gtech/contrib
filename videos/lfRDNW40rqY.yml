description: "Streaming Analytics (or Fast Data) is becoming an increasingly popular subject in enterprise organizations. The reason for this is that customers want to have real-time experiences, such as notifications and advise based on their online behavior and other users’ actions.\n\nA typical streaming analytics solution consists of three steps: reading event data, evaluating the events with the aid of business rules and machine learning alogithms, and producing meaningful output. All three steps will be covered with an example use case. The streaming analytics engine is powered by Flink. I’ll use Kafka for the message bus and Cassandra for the state management. The machine learning models are made with Knime and Spark, exported to PMML formant, and evaluated using the Openscoring.io library.\n\nAfter this session, the attendees will have a good overview of a typical streaming analytics solution and have a better understanding of Apache Flink as a key data streaming technology."
