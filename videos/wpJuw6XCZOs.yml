recordingDate: 1471439679
description: "DevOps has made great strides across the software world, but not yet in open-source. Open-source has never been the most accessible part of software development to jump into, but we can help fix that. In this talk we’ll look at real-world examples of how DevOps tools and techniques have been used to simplify setup, development and deployment in a selection of open-source projects, and learn how you too can help make open-source more open, for everybody.\nDevOps Pro Vilnius 2016 - http://goo.gl/D9eDT7"
