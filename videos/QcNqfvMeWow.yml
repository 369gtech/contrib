description: "Traditionally, a tug of war has existed between service reliability (availability, consistency, and fault tolerance), and engineering velocity. Increasing speed to fuel product innovation has meant making reliability tradeoffs. In this talk Yunong will describe how abstracting away the infrastructure and common platform components by using a Platform as a Service (PaaS) model can enable service owners to increase both velocity and reliability.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nYunong Xiao\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nNode Summit: http://www.nodesummit.com/\n\n2018 Node Summit registration: http://www.nodesummit.com/registration/"
