title: 'Understanding Why The New V8 Is So Fast, One Demo At A Time'
language: English
recordingDate: 1539107225
description: "The entire V8 compiler architecture as well as large parts of the Garbage Collector where updated recently. TurboFan replaced Crankshaft, Orinoco now collects garbage in parallel whenever possible. Node.js v8 shipped with this new and improved version of V8. As a result we can finally write idiomatic and declarative JavaScript without worrying about incurring performance overhead due to JavaScript compiler shortcomings. At least this is what the V8 team tells us. In this talk we will explore if and why this is true, one demo at a time.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nThorsten Lorenz, Senior Software Engineer, NodeSource\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video."
