title: 'Everything You Wanted to Know About Writing Async, Concurrent HTTP Apps in Java'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433261930
description: "Facing tens of millions of clients continuously downloading binaries from its repositories, JFrog decided to offer an OSS client that natively supports these downloads. This session shares the main challenges of developing a highly concurrent, resumable, async download library on top of an Apache HTTP client. It also covers other libraries JFrog tested and why it decided to reinvent the wheel. You will see important pitfalls it came across when working with HTTP and how using the right combination of techniques can improve performance by a magnitude. You will also see why your initial assumptions may completely change when youâ€™re faced with other players on the network. Consider yourself forewarned: lots of HTTP internals, NIO, and concurrency ahead!\n\n\nAuthors:\nBaruch Sadogursky\nBaruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate of JFrog, the creators of Artifactory Binary Repository, the home of Bintray, and JavaOne 2011 Duke Choice Awards winner.
