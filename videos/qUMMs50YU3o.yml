description: "Mikael Vidstedt, Director, Java Virtual Machine, Oracle\nBernard Traversat, Vice President of Software Development, Java SE Platform , Oracle\nBob Vandette, Consulting Engineer, Oracle\n\nIn a world of containers, we expect safety and security to become increasingly important. We also expect sprawl in the form of many instances, a mix of different applications, heterogeneous machines, and heterogeneous container configurations. And Java’s characteristics make it ideal for container deployment. Oracle is committed to having Java remain the first choice for deployments in the cloud, especially in containerized environments. In this session, hear from Oracle’s Java luminaries committed to keeping Java the first choice for container deployments."
