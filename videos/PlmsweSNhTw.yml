description: "From Fluent 2015. \"JavaScript is almost 20 years old, and moving faster than ever. ES6/2015 was voted through Ecma TC39 in Paris last month, ES7/2016 is being developed concurrently to prime the annual release pump, and use of compilers, notably Babel and Traceur, is on the rise. Low-level APIs such as SIMD, WebGL2, and 64-bit integer Math methods combine with higher-level facilities from generators and promises to async/await to cover the space of safely programmable hardware. Is there anything JS cannot do? I’ll give some answers.\n\nAbout Brendan Eich:\nBrendan Eich was founder and long-term CTO at Mozilla. He also served as SVP of Engineering and briefly as CEO. Eich is widely recognized for his enduring contributions to the Internet revolution. In 1995, Eich invented JavaScript (ECMAScript), the Internet’s most widely used programming language. He co-founded the mozilla.org project in 1998, serving as chief architect, and has been a board member of the Mozilla Foundation since its inception in 2003. Brendan helped launch the award-winning Firefox Web browser in November 2004 and Thunderbird e-mail client in December 2004.\n\nBrendan holds a bachelor of science in math and computer science from Santa Clara University and a master of science in computer science from the University of Illinois.\""
