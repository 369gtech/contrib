description: "If we want to make things work, we need to communicate with other people. We need to talk to our users, audiences, colleagues, clients or even our bosses. We want to share our ideas and make sure they get it, so we can produce work that we're proud of. And right now, in our world, we mainly communicate through text. We talk through 140 characters, chat messages, blog posts or even README documents. We write everyday. But how do you write better? How do you improve your communication so hopefully the other party listens (or reads) and performs the action you wish they do? \nIn this talk, I'd like to share with you what I learned from writing about code for four years – I'll share surprising things I discovered, and how you can improve your communication and get people to take action.\n\nZell is a freelance developer from Singapore. When he's not working on client projects, he digs deep into code and explains what he learned on his blog. He has written books and courses, which include Automate Your Workflow and Learn JavaScript.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 27 January 2018\n\nSource: https://2018.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
