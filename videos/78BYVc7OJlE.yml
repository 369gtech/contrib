title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Building "cooperative" APIs with HTTP/2'
recordingDate: 1523421485
description: "Much has been made of HTTP/2 and how it can improve\_frontend performance. It has challenged best-practices like JS minification and CSS aggregation. However,\_very little has been done to explore its impact on REST APIs. In this session, we're going to dive into HTTP/2 from a backend perspective and we'll see how its improved\_semantics and its expanded featureset\_enables a new way of thinking about\_RESTful APIs.\n\nWe'll see how client and server can work cooperatively to improve performance. We'll see how server push can solve tedious problems like paginated responses and eliminate requests entirely. Finally, we'll see how improvements borne out of HTTP/2 can still improve experiences for clients that don't yet support HTTP/2 or don't have the capability to take advantage of some of its features.\n\nAttendees need not have any PHP or Drupal experience. An understanding of\_REST ideas like using\_the HTTP methods GET, POST, PATCH, or\_DELETE to read, create, update or remove resources will make it easier to follow along.\n\n\n\nTruly sorry for cutting the session short; that's completely on me.\n\nHere are all the links for\_all the relevant code. A little background that I couldn't get to:\n\nHades is an HTTP/2 server written in Go which parses the X-Push-Please header and server pushes the requested resources. Juissy is a new JSON API client that requires no configuration and can cooperate with Hades or fall back to HTTP/1.1 with no change in code or configuration (it's all handled in the library). It automatically handles pagination for you too.\n\nThere's a lot more to explored with all these things.\_I regularly post about HTTP/2 on Twitter and will be writing a blog post about these ideas soon. Stay tuned!\n\nDemo: https://demo.sullice.com\n\nDemo Code:\_https://github.com/gabesullice/cooperative-api-demo\n\nHades:\_https://github.com/gabesullice/hades\_(Hades is an\_experimental\_HATEOAS-based HTTP/2 reverse proxy for JSON API backends)\n\nJuissy:\_https://github.com/gabesullice/juissy\_(Juissy is a minimal experimental JSON API client for Drupal)"
