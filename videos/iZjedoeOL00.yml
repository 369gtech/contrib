title: 'Scala Macros: What Are They, How Do They Work, and Who Uses Them?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433261466
description: "Macros are among the new features in Scala 2.10, further extended in 2.11. A macro is simply Scala code that is executed at compile time and that manipulates the AST of a program. Although we probably write macros mostly when creating a library of a framework rather than in day-to-day work, it is definitely good to know what the mechanisms behind them are. This presentation first shows step-by-step how to write a simple macro and how it works. The second part presents libraries that already use macros (but without implementation details), such as in Scala Async, Pickling, MacWire, and Akka.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAdam Warski\nI am one of the co-founders of SoftwareMill, a company specialising in delivering customised software solutions. I code mostly on the back-end using Scala, with an occasional foray into frontend/devops and other languages. I created a couple of open-source projects, such as Hibernate Envers, ElasticMQ, Veripacks and MacWire. I have been a speaker at major conferences, such as Devoxx, JavaZone, JFokus or Jazoon.\n\nApart from writing closed- and open-source software, I am interested in improving the way we use functional and object-oriented programming. When not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking in the mountains or playing tennis.\n\nI am also writing a technical blog (http://www.warski.org/blog) on a variety of interesting IT-related subjects.\nView more trainings by Adam Warski at https://www.parleys.com/author/adam-warski\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
