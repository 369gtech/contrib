description: "TensorFlow is all kinds of fancy, from helping startups raising their series A in Silicon Valley to detecting if something is a cat. However, when things start to get “real,” you may find yourself no longer just dealing with mnist.csv but instead needing do large-scale data prep as well as training.\n\nHolden Karau details how to use TensorFlow in conjunction with Apache Spark, Flink, and Beam to create a full machine learning pipeline—including the annoying feature engineering and data prep components that we like to pretend don’t exist. Holden also explains why these feature prep stages need to be integrated into the serving layer. She concludes by examining changing industry trends, like Apache Arrow, and how they impact cross-language development for things like deep learning. Even if you’re not trying to raise a round of funding in Silicon Valley, this talk will give you tools to do interesting machine learning problems at scale."
