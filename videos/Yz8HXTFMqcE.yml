title: 'YOW! Singapore 2017 Gregor Hohpe - Enterprise Integration Patterns 2'
recordingDate: 1507503602
description: "The book Enterprise Integration Patterns, published some 14 years ago, has become the common language for most open source ESBs. Still, integration is much more than just messaging, so there are bound to be many more integration patterns. The second volume of EIP will contain conversation patterns that describe interactions between systems over time. This talk reflects on EIP and gives a behind-the-scenes look at how this new pattern language evolves.\n\nGregor is a recognized thought leader on asynchronous messaging and service-oriented architectures. He is widely known as co-author of the seminal book “Enterprise Integration Patterns” and as frequent speaker at conferences around the world. He is an active member of the IEEE Software editorial advisory board.\n\nAs Chief IT Architect at Allianz, Gregor is responsible for driving the digital transformation of the insurance business. He documented his experience as an architect driving IT transformation in the eBook \"37 Things One Architect Knows\".\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference, visit,\nhttp://yowconference.sg"
