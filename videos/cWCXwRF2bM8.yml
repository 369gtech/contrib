Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nDeep DIve: Harbor - Enterprise Cloud Native Artifact Registry - Steven Zou & Daniel Jiang, VMware \n\nHarbor is an open-source trusted cloud-native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. It has been widely used by organizations large and small around the world to resolve both the container image and other OCI-compatible cloud-native artifacts management challenges. In this session, the speakers would like to talk more details about the evolution of making Harbor support managing kinds of cloud-native artifacts like Image, Helm Chart, CNAB and OPA bundle, etc. with simple and unified user experiences and promoting Harbor to be the best OCI compatible cloud-native artifact registry then. At the same time, they're going to share the future roadmap of Harbor project and community with the attendees, including but not limited to non-blocking online GC, Proxy cache, P2P distribution, and EDGE computing support, etc. Additionally, they'd like to update the current status of the Harbor community and encourage more participation in the Harbor community. Furthermore, the team would love to get feedback from users and contributors to the current features and future roadmap. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpAt"
