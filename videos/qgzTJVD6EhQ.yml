title: 'Reco4J: A Recommendation Engine Exploiting Collective Intelligence on Big Data'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433518590
description: "This session provides a close look at Reco4J, a Java graph-based recommendation engineâ€”that is, a software product suggesting items of relevance to users. Today the most advanced types of these functionalities are available only to internet giants. This open source project targets the implementation and improvement of state-of-the-art algorithms in this promising research field as well as their diffusion among a broader audience using an on-premises or cloud service solution. Reco4J leverages collaborative filtering techniques and supports composable models and algorithms, social recommendations, and multitenancy. The Neo4J graph database and Hadoop distributed processing system are integrated to guarantee big data support.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAlessandro Negro\nAlessandro Negro, CTO of Wirex and Founder and Project Leader of Reco4J, has been working with Data Management Technology since 2003 when he took part to the GRelC project, that aimed at providing a set of advanced data grid services to transparently, efficiently and securely manage databases on the Grid Environment. He started working on Big Data in 2008 when he worked for Euro Mediterranean Centre For Climate Change (CMCC), where he deployed a metadata handling system to handle the huge quantity of data produced by the centre and from other climate change related centres that took part to the ClimateG testbed. He has published widely on Grid Data Management and Metadata Management to conferences proceedings and journals. He holds a BSc in Computer Engineering, MSc in Computer Engineering, and a PhD in Interdisciplinary Science and Technology. He is a Member of IEEE, IEEE Computer Society and ACM since 2007. His interests range from the software architecture to Data Management, from programming languages to Linux and UNIX, from Cloud Computing to Machine Learning, from Data Warehouse and Data Mining to NoSQL database. \nView more trainings by Alessandro Negro at https://www.parleys.com/author/alessandro-negro\n\nLuigi Giuri\nLuigi Giuri is an entrepreneur, researcher, and professional in the computer science and information technology sector. He is currently Chairman and CEO at Wirex, a software development company based in Italy. \n\nSince 2000 he started taking an entrepreneurial approach to science and technology. After three years devoted to development of Internet portals and e-commerce solutions for customers like Telecom Italia, Wind, and Mastercard, in 2003 he co-founded Wirex to concentrate on the development of online gaming business solutions. Under his guide the company started with a state of the art sports betting software, and it has been grown up until today to be unique in its coverage of the whole range of gaming products, including live casino, RNG casino, poker, bingo, and affiliate marketing solutions. Although his executive position impels primary occupation on management activities, the agile Wirex development process he built allows him to direct research and development of innovative solutions, and to put hands into each and every line of code in an efficient and effective manner.\n\nIn the 1990s he was a researcher at Fondazione Ugo Bordoni, focusing his activity on computer security, particularly: role-based access control; SQL security; Java security; computer security evaluation criteria. He served as program committee member for ACM Workshop on Role-Based Access Control 1998, 1999, and 2000, and as a reviewer for 5th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS), 1998. He actively participated as Italian representative to ISO/IEC standardization committees, including: JTC1/SC32 Working Group 3 ?Database language - SQL?, 1997 and 1998, conceiving and writing the SQL:1999 standard new role-based security features; JTC1/SC27 Working Group 3 ?Evaluation Criteria for IT Security?, 1997, contributing with modularization of security criteria.\n\nLuigi Giuri graduated (summa cum laude) in Computer Science in 1991 at the University of Pisa (Italy).\nView more trainings by Luigi Giuri at https://www.parleys.com/author/luigi-giuri\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
