Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nReal-Time Application Maps for Proactive and Actionable Visibility - Aloke Guha, OpsCruise\n\nTodayâ€™s observability provides volumes of time-series data, statistical trends including anomaly detection and correlational analyses. We argue that operations teams need an integrated and cohesive understanding of the application that maps interdependencies across microservices and dependencies on the orchestration and infrastructure services. We show that beyond metrics, logs, and traces, capturing configuration information are necessary for creating a complete application maps for gaining deeper insights into the application behavior. In addition, establishing a standard approach capture the attributes of the complete application environment will enable automated detection and causal analysis of application problems. We will present some early findings on building real-time actionable application maps for cloud applications."
