description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nLive Migration of Production Workloads from Apache Mesos PaaS to Kubernetes - Maria Camacho & Gufran Lutful, Nokia \n\nIn 2018 we started the migration of production workloads on our cloud-native big data analytics platform (PaaS) from Apache Mesos and Marathon to K8s.  Nokia has multiple production PaaS instances in its datacenters across the globe with various production workloads, including a distributed analytics engine, production databases, data streams and ML applications. These workloads are critical to telecom data scientists requiring high performance, availability and reliability without disrupting continuous delivery of big data services.  We want to share the story and lessons learnt when migrating production workloads to K8s while maintaining performance and reliability, and at the same time delivering new services to our demanding users.  You will hear how we seamlessly shared cloud resources, network traffic, internal DNS and telemetry systems between two orchestrators in production.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zel1"
