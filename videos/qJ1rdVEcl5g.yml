description: "I ask 67 questions to Oxford Scholar and AI researcher Andrew Trask as we go for a walk through Granary Square in London, England. Trask is a PhD student at Oxford University where he researches Deep Learning approaches with special emphasis on human language. We worked together on my Udacity deep learning nanodegree and I have a great deal of respect for his technical storytelling ability. \n\nPlease hit that subscribe button if you liked this interview!\n\nAnd like.
