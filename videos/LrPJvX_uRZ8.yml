description: 'Serverless computing is often described as the interaction of functions with fully-managed services. In this way, you can build applications without having to think about servers. But how do functions and fully-managed services interact? Via events! Events are important for serverless. Event-driven architectures help you to adopt some of the best practices for distributed systems without even realizing it. Letâ€™s see what events and event-driven programming can bring to the table, what we can learn to build better and easier to manage serverless applications.'
