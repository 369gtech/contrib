title: 'Narendra Shetty - A/B testing with React Native'
recordingDate: 1536932541
description: "A/B testing is a common practice in web world. Should that button say \"click here\" or \"learn more\"? Will the layout of your homepage materially impact app downloads? Instead of going with your gut, let data drive your product development. I will be talking about how to do that in the app world using React Native, both for iOS and Android and the complexities around it. Also I plan to cover these aspects — \n– Why should you use A/B testing in your business?\n– What all can you test using A/B testing? \n– How can you do efficient A/B testing of change in your product?"
