description: "Undeniably, eye tracking can deliver interesting and attractive-looking results. However, we don't conduct UX research to be entertained. We conduct research to, first and foremost, inform design and business decisions. For this reason, we need findings that will allow us to form high-quality recommendations.\n\nThe focus of this webcast is on actionable insight that can be obtained by adding eye tracking to our more conventional UX research methods. Aga will discuss two types of insight: qualitative (when eye tracking helps explain the source of a usability problem) and quantitative (when eye tracking helps measure user experience), and illustrate them with examples. Using the \"To Track or Not to Track\" decision tree consisting of three simple yes/no questions, Aga will also demonstrate how to quickly decide whether or not eye tracking is suitable for your study.\n\nIf you'd like to know if you really need eye tracking, or have an eye tracker but are not sure when to use it, join us for this webcast.\n\nAbout Aga Bojko\n\nAga Bojko is a UX researcher with a passion for designing studies to answer difficult design- and business-related questions. Currently, she is a VP of User Experience at GfK Custom Research North America, where she leads the Bay Area UX team.\n\nAga's recently published book, Eye Tracking the User Experience: A Practical Guide to Research, is based on over ten years of experience with various types of eye trackers that she has used to study websites, software applications, instructional material, pharmaceutical labels, and consumer product packaging. She's tracked (for a good reason) a wide range of visuals, from butterflies flying across the screen to fresh meat in grocery stores.\n\n - Don't miss an upload!
