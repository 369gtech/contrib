title: 'Easily find your conference pictures using the power of the cloud by Tim van Eijndhoven'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573074703
description: "As regular conference speakers and attendees we appreciate the efforts from organizers to document the conference using photography. The only downside from this is that we often spend plenty of time clicking through many pages of pictures to find the ones which are relevant to us. So we did what all decent programmers do: automate this tedious task.\n\nIn this talk we will show you how we leveraged the power of the cloud using Quarkus and GraalVM to build AWS lambdas running native images, the AWS CDK to deploy infrastructure using actual code for our infrastructure and AWS Rekognition to do the heavy lifting in image analysis.\n\nWe will tell you about the cool parts of this tool and its cutting edge technologies, but will also be honest about the bleeding caused by that edge. Hopefully this talk makes it a bit less sharp...\n\nTim van Eijndhoven is a Software Craftsman at JPoint.
