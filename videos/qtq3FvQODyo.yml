title: 'Passive Fingerprinting of HTTP/2 Clients - Elad Shuster'

description: "OWASP AppSec EU 2018 Hacker Track - Day 1, talk 2\n\nHTTP/2 is the second major version of the HTTP protocol. It changes the way HTTP is transferred “on the wire” by introducing a full binary protocol that is made up of TCP connections, streams, and frames, rather than a plain-text protocol. Such a fundamental change from HTTP/1.x to HTTP/2, means that client-side and server-side implementations have to incorporate completely new code in order to support new HTTP/2 features. This introduces nuances in protocol implementations, which, in return, might be used to passively fingerprint web clients. \n\nOur research is based on more than 10 million HTTP/2 connections from which we extracted fingerprints for over 40,000 unique user agents across hundreds of implementations. \n\nIn the presentation, I intend to provide the following: \n\n•HTTP/2 Overview \n- Introduction into the basic elements of the protocol \n- a review the different components chosen for the fingerprint format (alongside a discussion on those left out) \n- Potential use cases of the proposed fingerprint \n- Usage Statistics - prevalence of HTTP/2 usage on Akamai’s platform \n\n•Examples of common HTTP/2 Implementations & Client fingerprints collected during the research \n\n•HTTP/2 support (or the lack of) among common web security tools (Burp suite, sqlmap, etc.) \n\n•Review of attacks over HTTP/2 observed on Akamai’s platform \n\nReferences \nttp://akamai.me/2qWIqON - whitepaper published by Akamai’s Threat-Research Team. \n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
