description: "Because Flux tells us to, many Angular developers put most (if not all) of our data inside of an Angular Redux store. The problem is, though, that nowadays even many of the authors of Redux libraries donâ€™t even recommend this practice. To say that the many different instructions from the Redux community are in conflict with each other is an understatement. Come watch the show and learn why so many people are pulling back on Redux and how to add some sanity into your Angular + Redux implementation.\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
