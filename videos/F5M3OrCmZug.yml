recordingDate: 1574262662
description: "The story is very common. When you are a good (or excellent) developer, sooner or later (you can bet sooner) someone comes and asks you to try a “better role” – a team leader. The logic is clear. If you can manage thousands of complicated lines of code, algorithms and insane tasks, how could ever two more people harm you, right? Things that seem challenging and interesting from the career perspective at first very often end with depressions, burnout, etc. In this speech, we would like to address ten key characteristics that make a good leader and also help to identify the bad ones. We will also provide basic tips and tricks on how to survive long enough to identify, whether the new role is the right one or it is time to become a good (or excellent) programmer again. \nAgenda of the speech:\n* Good programmer, bad leader – we all know the story, but…\n* How to identify a bad leader/manager\n* Ten key characteristics of a good leader\n* How to survive long enough\n* Discussion"
