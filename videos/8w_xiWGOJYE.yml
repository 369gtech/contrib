description: "Dynamic answer generation with Lua An exploration of the LUA record from the upcoming PowerDNS release\nby Pieter Lexis\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.601/dns_powerdns_lua_record.webm\n\n\nThis talk will focus on an in-zone way of generating dynamic answers to DNS queries using Lua. These LUA records look like TXT in the zone, but the authoritative server will run the code that is inside them to answer a query. This talk details the design, implementation and usecases of these records as implemented in the PowerDNS Authoritative Server 4.2 (unreleased as of talk submission). \n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 13:25:00+01"
