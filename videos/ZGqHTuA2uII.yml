title: 'How to Build 1000 Microservices with Kafka and Thrive - Natan Silnitsky'
recordingDate: 1584279259
description: "In today's environment of globally distributed large scale web applications, reactive, event-driven design is mandatory.\n\nIn this talk, Natan showcases how we implemented a reliable, scalable, event-driven, distributed Mega Microservices architecture on top of Kafka but without Kafka streams. We, at Wix Engineering, have built powerful (soon-to-be-os) libraries for data streaming and data storage using Kafka features like compacted logs and exactly once semantics.\n\nThese libraries offer low latency, high throughput event processing and also high volume data-storage with very simple and easy to understand APIs that work seamlessly together with other technologies such as gRPC. Natan presents the challenges faced while creating and fine-tuning such a system. An architecture that is comprised of a 1,000 micro-services that need to handle incoming traffic from multiple data centers while preserving eventual consistency and high throughput."
