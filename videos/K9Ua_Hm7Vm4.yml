description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nIntegrating SPIRE and Istio - Daniel Feldman & Glaucimar Aguiar, HPE\n\nThe popular Istio service mesh simplifies many aspects of microservices deployment in Kubernetes, including providing gateways, load balancing, fine-grained authorization, and end-to-end encryption. However, Istio is not natively compatible with SPIRE identities, instead using its own centralized certificate generator. At HPE we developed a modified Istio that uses SPIRE to provide all identities. We have demonstrated this in proof-of-concept environments and are working to deploy it in production, and we are working to upstream this feature into the Istio mainline with help from many key Istio contributors. In this talk we will discuss the motivation for the project, and where we are going with it in the future."
