title: 'Jacinda Shelly - But, Why is the (Django) Admin Slow? - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557110999
description: "\"Speaker: Jacinda Shelly\n\nThe admin interface that comes built-in with Django is one of the most-loved (and oft-abused) features.  However, early converts are often disappointed to find that the admin doesn't seem to be scaling as their database grows in size, forcing them (so they think) to switch to a custom interface much sooner than they would prefer.\n\nHowever, many common performance issues can be fixed with a few small configuration changes that are much easier than a rewrite!\n\nIn this talk, we'll use an example project to demonstrate the most common performance pitfalls encountered when using the Django admin, and fix them - live!  We'll use django-debug-toolbar, a powerful debugging interface that everyone who uses Django should be familiar with, to identify our issues and confirm that they are fixed.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
