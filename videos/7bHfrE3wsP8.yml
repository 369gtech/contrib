description: "Serverless platforms let us build fine-grained functions that are fully managed and naturally autoscale. Stream processors give us rich streaming primitives that can be stateful, stateless and scale to high throughputs. Both tie their roots back to streams of events, but are real-time event streams enough for contemporary applications?\n\nIn this talk weâ€™ll look at how functions and stream processors both compare and complement. We'll look at why stream processors like Kafka Streams provide both stateful and stateless operations. Finally we'll look at how emerging architectures for event-driven systems are quite different to the ones we are used to, whether they're based on microservices, functions or full-blown streaming systems."
