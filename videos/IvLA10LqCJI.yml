description: "Ближайшая конференция — HolyJS 2020 Moscow\n25-28 ноября, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://holyjs-moscow.ru/\n\n. In this talk we'll look under the hood of the Angular CLI. We'll start from scaffolding and go all the way to production build-time optimizations.\n\nAt the beginning of the presentation, we'd look at the in-memory transforms that we perform over the file structure of an Angular project. Next, we'll focus on the extensibility points of the CLI which allow developers to develop custom commands or extend the existing build process. Finally, we'd discuss ahead-of-time compilation, bundling, build optimization and dead-code-elimination that helps us shrink the bundle sizes of your Angular apps."
