description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - Writing a truly non-blocking, maintainable code shouldn’t be a giant headache. As developers we strive to write features bundled up into a single, readable and testable block of code and today’s technologies greatly help us. From .NET events to Task Parallel Library, we can craft complex features. But, unfortunately, having that many different technologies, we lack the possibility of composing (easily) between them. In this session, you will learn about the core fundamentals which construct the Rx API and how it provides a single, uniform language that abstracts away all sources of events.'
