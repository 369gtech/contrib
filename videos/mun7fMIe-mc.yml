recordingDate: 1628262533
description: "Array-based Reactive forms are great. However, what if your array item is itself a FormGroup? Now, add the requirement to sort that array of FormGroups. How do you keep track of the original data? What if you want to have an easy way to grab some piece of original data to display right along with one of the FormArray's control? What if you want to \"reset\" the original data with ease? Use this trick to always have the original data associated with the correct FormGroup or FormControl without having to introduce new structures into your code (like another associate array that you have to keep in sync with your FormArray).\n\nLearn the best ways to build reliable web applications, write quality code, choose scalable architectures, and create effective automated tests at the Reliable Web Summit this August 26-27, 2021.
