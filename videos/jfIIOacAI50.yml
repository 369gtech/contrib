description: "https://tanzu.tv/tt/0022\n\nYou may have seen it in your favorite streamers channel: A bot reminding \nyou of an upcoming event, showing their uptime, and offering unique features to improve the experience for the viewer. Behind the scenes you might assume code watching every line of code, ready to respond to pre-programmed commands. But what happens when the channel has 1k views? 10k? 100k? All chatting and interacting, exchanging thousands of messages a second.\n\nSpring Boot and Project Reactor to the rescue! This week on Tanzu Tuesday, we’ll build our very own chat bot. Started as a project inspired by episodes featuring Josh Long and Spencer Gibb, you’ll see how reactive programming helps tackle the massive volume of messages, how to package and deploy it to Kubernetes, gather metrics with Prometheus and visualize them in Grafana.\n\nDemo code is available on GitHub here - https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/reactive-bot-framework\n\n===\n\nBrian McClain\nBrian is a senior product marketing manager on the Developer Engineering team at VMware. Prior to VMware and Pivotal, Brian worked on both the development and operations of software in many industries, including finance, entertainment, and technology. He loves learning and experimenting with new technologies, and more importantly sharing the lessons learned along the way."
