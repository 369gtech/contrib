description: "A Google TechTalk, June 29, 2016, presented by Wolfgang Lechner (University of Innsbruck)\nABSTRACT:  In this talk I will present an overview of recent ideas on parity adiabatic quantum computing, a scheme which has been introduced [1] as an alternative to the spin glass paradigm of quantum annealing. In this architecture, a optimization problem is encoded in local fields that act on an extended set of qubits in a constraint subspace.\n\nThe constraints are problem independent 4-body interactions acting uniformly on all plaquettes of a square lattice. Using a general stabilizer formulation [2], the parity scheme can be implemented efficiently with odd parity constraints and may feature mixtures of differentlogical  k-local terms in a 2D setup. Classical error correction has been developed for uncorrelated noise [2] which is not applicable for other noise models [3].  The parity scheme allows one to implement quantum enhanced optimization protocols with the focus on coherent dynamics in various platforms, including Transmons [5], Rydberg atoms [6] and ions in surface traps. I will outline opportunities in applications such as training of a restricted Boltzmann machine.  \n\nPresented at the Adiabatic Quantum Computing Conference, June 26-29, 2016, at Google's Los Angeles office."
