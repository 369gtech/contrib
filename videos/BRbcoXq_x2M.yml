description: "After a local VanJS meetup, my friends and I were tossing around project ideas. Someone referenced a website that would procedurally generate terrible ideas for video games. “A tycoon game where you draw horses indefinitely”.\n\nWhat a wonderful, terrible, awful idea for a game.\n\nIn this presentation, we go through the 1000 lines of Javascript and two weeks of drunken after-work coding required to produce the world’s only horse drawing tycoon simulator, with Canvas, Twitter integration, the legendary HorseHash™ algorithm, HorseCurrency™, and HorseStamps®!\n\nYou’ll pay for the whole seat but you’ll only need the edge.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte"
