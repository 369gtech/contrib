description: "Google Gears and MySpace - an Exploration of Powering Search on the Client\r\nOwyn Richen (MySpace)\r\n\r\nMySpace does not have particular ceilings on how much data a user can accrue, including relational data linking that user with others. MySpace is exploring the use of Google Gears to provide features for users that have a considerable amount of data to churn through. Join us to see some areas we've explored and hear a detailed technical discussion about one particular feature--adding search to our mail system. We'll discuss the challenges we faced, including privacy, dealing with multiple users per client, synchronizing multiple clients, and scaling all these pieces in a heavy-usage environment."
