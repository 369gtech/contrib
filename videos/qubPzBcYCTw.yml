title: 'The AV1 Video Codec'
recordingDate: 1548365919
description: "Timothy B. Terriberry\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/136/\n\nLast year, the Alliance for Open Media released its next-generation video codec AV1. It achieves better compression than proprietary competitors, while its patents can be licensed via a royalty-free, open-source friendly license. With a broad array of industry support including all major browser vendors, many hardware partners, internet streaming video and conferencing providers, we think this is our best chance yet to create a successful video codec that achieves wide deployment.\r\n\r\nHowever, agreeing on the standard was just the first step. This talk will discuss the road from specification to production, the current state of AV1 deployment, and our own efforts to write an AV1 encoder in Rust, rav1e. It is intended for a technical audience, but does not require previous signal processing experience.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
