title: 'Trio: Structured Concurrency for Python (Alternative to Asyncio)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620401402
description: "Concurrency has a reputation for being complicated and hard to get right, even in Python. Fortunately, by using the \"structured concurrency\" programming model, it's possible to avoid many of the pitfalls inherent in more traditional thread-based and callback-based models.\n\nTrio is an async I/O framework that brings the\nbenefits of structured concurrency to Python. Built from the ground up to use\nasync/await natively, Trio makes it possible to write async software that is\nrobust and easy to reason about.\n\nIn this talk I'll explain how Trio differs from its predecessors (such as\nTwisted and asyncio), show that it leads to simpler code with fewer bugs, and hopefully convince you to give it try.\n\n***\n\nINTERESTED IN THE STOCK MARKET?\nI developed a profitable stock market trend following model.
