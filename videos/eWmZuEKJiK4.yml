description: 'Voice interaction is exploding in 2017 and beyond. 1 in 6 American homes have a voice-first device, and the number of people speaking to computers is only going to increase. If we take our web pages and put them on voice, we’ll have frustrated customers who are going to look elsewhere. What, then, are the principles of a good voice UI? In this talk we’ll examine how to build a voice UI that gets the conversation going.'
