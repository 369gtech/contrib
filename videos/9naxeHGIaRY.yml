description: 'We think that Glass could be an interesting new platform for gaming. A few of us recently hacked together five simple games that experiment with the unique features of Glass and demonstrate some of the possibilities for gaming. You can learn a bit more and get the games at: http://g.co/glassminigames. We hope they provide some inspiration for getting started with game design on Glass.'
