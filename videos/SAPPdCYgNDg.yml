In the case of supply chain products, the implications are more severe than monetary: counterfeit products might not have the right components, quality, and authenticity, so they might be useless and harmful. Blockchain technologies have emerged over the last years, and this use case has the potential to disrupt other markets. Blockchains remove the need for trusted intermediaries, can facilitate faster transactions, and add more transparency with tamper-proof packaging and IDs. This session showcases how Oracle blockchain technology can lead to an efficient and holistic approach to reducing counterfeiting."
