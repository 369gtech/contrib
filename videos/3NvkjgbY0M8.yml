description: "Companies today are starting to understand that diversity is crucial for building a strong culture. Diversity enhances creativity and induces better decision-making and problem-solving, which ultimately leads to better products.\n\nBut simply throwing a mix of diverse people together doesnâ€™t guarantee high performance; it requires inclusive leadership; leadership that assures that all team members feel they are treated respectfully and fairly, are valued and sense that they belong and fit in the organization, and because of this can contribute their share. \nProblem is, sometimes noticing these elusive dynamics is harder than you think.\n\nIn this talk, Moran gives practical advice on how to reveal unconscious biases that we all experience and how to address them in order to become more inclusive leaders.\n\nBio: Moran Weber is a Social Entrepreneur, currently working on her own Tech for Good initiative, formerly Tech Lead at Wix with 10 years of experience in software development.\nOther than that, she's also a Social Psychologist. That is she holds an MA in Social Psychology, along with a BSc in Computer Science and Psychology from Tel-Aviv University.\n\nMoran is deeply committed to promote and encourage women in the tech industry. She's the 'Women in Tech Forum' meetup series Co-Founder and the author of the viral essay \"How to attract more women\" which inspired many."
