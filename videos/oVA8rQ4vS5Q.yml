description: "BOSH 101 - A Beginners Guide - Patrick Hartz & Khaled Blah, anynines \n\n\"In an age of Kubernetes & Cloud Foundry, why is it worth learning BOSH and what do you need it for?  Unlike any other tool, BOSH can help developers to bring their software to any Infrastructure quickly, reliably and consistently with the most important rules of modern cloud native app development.  Find out what makes a good BOSH manifest and why it is important to separate infrastructure and deployment config. Get a top-down view of the most important BOSH components and learn why and when to use BOSH. See how you can manage and debug large scale deployments based on years of experience running BOSH in production systems.\n \nAfter the session, you will be ready to open your laptop and to ship your first deployment with BOSH!\"\n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
