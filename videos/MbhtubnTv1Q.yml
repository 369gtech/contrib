description: "Erlang has become a proven language for developing large, distributed systems. This talk will talk about the architecture and design for an Erlang system to power your web and mobile applications. It will focus on a RESTful backend that was written for a mobile application (http://wingmanap.com/) that facilitates orders and payments at bars. The talk will cover coding, hosting, and testing. In the end, I will announce the official open-sourcing of the platform code, so that others may adopt it for their own use.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n-The overall design of a large Erlang system that handles users and transactions\n\n-A high-level view of the code\n\n-Deploying the software to Heroku\n\n-Strategies for testing the software\n\n-How to take the open-sourced code and adopt it to your needs\n\nTarget audience:\n\n-Erlang developers\n\n-Startup founders/developers\n\n-High level architects\n\nThe talk will be structured to be interesting from everyone from CEOs to hackers.\""
