description: "There is no doubt that Web APIs have become a fundamental aspect of modern architectures. However how to distinct a “good” API from an “evil” one is a topic for debate and one that often ends up in a “religious” debate. However, the one thing that is clear to most people, is that it all starts with a design, and getting that design right up-front will likely result in less headaches down the line.\n\nSo how to avoid “evil” APIs?\n\nIn this presentation, I will talk about the 7 most common pitfalls I’ve come across when doing API design in large implementations. With real-life examples, I will describe why such pitfalls deserved to be called “evil” and how to remediate them with “good\" design practices.\n\nThe presentation will also touch upon how API-design first techniques can be applied to solve prevent some of the common issues.\n\nIt will be a highly interactive session with good balance of theory and practice."
