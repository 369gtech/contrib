title: 'An Introduction to Spring Data JPA'
recordingDate: 1316561943
description: "By Oliver Gierke\r\nEngineer, SpringSource, a division of VMware\r\n\r\nThis webinar introduces the JPA module of the Spring Data project that allows developers to easily implement JPA based repositories in a sophisticated way. We start with a brief analysis of a plain JPA based repository implementation and outline pain points especially regarding the domain driven approach (lack of abstraction, tediousness of executing queries, pagination and so on). The main part of the webinar then takes a look at how Spring Data JPA provides solutions to those problems."
