description: 'In data science, sometimes you stumble across an intriguing property in the data. I will tell you a story of a mysterious correlation - from StackOverflow survey it seems that developers who use spaces have higher salaries than those who use tabs. Correlation doesn’t mean causation: using spaces won’t suddenly increase your salary. But what does it all mean? Follow me into a detective investigation that will show you how to approach complex data science problems. I will show you some of the perils of correlation, model fitting and biases - how they can be dangerous and how to deal with them.'
