description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. GraphQL is a great way to expose your APIs and it has changed the way we think about consuming data over HTTP. Not only does GraphQL give us the power to ask for exactly what we want but it also exposes data in a way that is more aligned with the way we think about data.\n\nOver the last two years, GraphQL has become more and more mainstream. The ecosystem has grown phenomenally and major players like Amazon, Twitter, Facebook and more are all committed to GraphQL.\n\nBut what is GraphQL? What are the benefits of using GraphQL it instead of REST?\n\nTogether we will have a look at the core problems that we are facing with the traditional REST service layers, which still power most of the Web.\n\nAfter we have a better understanding of GraphQL, we will explore how we can build a GraphQL API with Hot Chocolate on ASP.Net Core. We will look at things like Prisma filters and how we can get your existing infrastructure under this new service layer. We will merge data from different sources like you did not think was possible by using the power of the GraphQL resolver concept."
