description: "Agile is a mainstream method used in IT project management. Yes, a method and no longer a philosophy. Everyone wants to “do” agile and thus want to “be” agile as well. What are the common mistakes in applying agile? To find out, attend this session, which covers the following topics:\n• The bitter truth about IT projects\n• Complex project nightmares\n• Are we agile?\n• Deadly sins\n• OK, what next? We know what is wrong; how do we fix it?\n\nSpeaker:\nKasia Mrowca, Consultant, Mrowca LTD\nI started my IT career from programming GPGPUs (Uni time) for econometrics purposes, my work was good enough to get the 'TechAward' for the most innovative scientific project in Poland, then I worked as a Network Admin, then I started working as a Product Owner. Currently I work on Analytics/Big Data project and in parallel try to finish my PhD thesis :) Beside being 'data' freak, I'm agile enthusiast and conference-junkie ;)"
