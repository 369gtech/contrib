description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl),\n20th of September 2013, Krak√≥w\n\nBen Hall - \"Building Startups and Minimum Viable Products\"\n\nDescription:\n\"Everyone has that one idea that could be the next big thing. However, starting is the hardest part. This session will help attendees overcome this by providing practical and real world advice on how they can take a high level idea and turn it into reality focusing at both the product and technical level. \n\nForming the presentation around Lean Startup techniques, Ben will initially cover how to test the concept with potential users to gauge interest based on well-known techniques and his experience of building products and startups. Covering wireframes, initial customer acquisition and how to ask the right questions, attendees will understand the most effective ways to test their ideas.\n\nOnce you've found the next big thing, you'll need to build it. Continuing the lean startup focus, Ben will describe the tools and techniques he has used to speed up time to market and identifying the right thing to build instead of just how to build it.\n\nOnce launched, it's down to improvements.  This section focuses on measuring users behaviour and engagement enabling you to identify areas that are working but more importantly the areas users are having problems.\n\nBy the end of the presentation, participants will have key insights into the startup world and how they can go from vision to reality. The aim is to give people the tools and techniques required to go off and implementing the ideas they already have at the back of their mind.\""
