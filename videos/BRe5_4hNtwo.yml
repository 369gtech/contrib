title: 'Simple Data Movement Patterns: Legacy Application to Cloud-Native Environment and Apache Geode'
language: English
recordingDate: 1571433731
description: "Within many enterprise companies, there are large legacy applications designed and implemented in the monolith but highly valuable to the business. As the business continues to grow, the availability, scalability, and performance of those applications become the concerns. The ideas of moving the assets to the cloud-native environment and Apache Geode start to emerge. However, rewriting, refactoring, or migrating those applications could be a daunting task, not only because of the complexities of the applications and data dependencies, but also because of the challenges associated with time to the market and budget. In this session, we'll show the audience why focusing on bounded domain contexts could simplify and streamline the overall process. In addition, we'll also illustrate a few simple data movement patterns that could be utilized to assist the effort.\n\nSpeaker: James Bedenbaugh, Advisory Data Solutions Architect, Pivotal; Zachary Hansen, Data Transformation Solutions Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: coming soon"
