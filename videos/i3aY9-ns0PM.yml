description: "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Machine Learning In Perl\n(But Were Afraid To Ask)\n\nWhat is Machine Learning?\nWhy is ML important?\nHow does ML work?\nHow is ML different from Artificial Intelligence?\nHow can ML benefit your Perl projects?\n\nLearn the answers to these questions, and more!\n\nIn this talk, we will learn the basics of Machine Learning in pure Perl, including concepts such as the following...\n\nThe 4 types of ML algorithms:\n- supervised\n- semi-supervised\n- unsupervised\n- reinforcement\n\nCommon ML algorithms:\n- K-Nearest Neighbor\n- Learning Vector Quantization\n- Self-Organizing Map\n- Locally Weighted Learning\n- Linear Regression\n- Logistic Regression\n- Decision Tree\n- Naive Bayes\n- K-Means Clustering\n- Support Vector Machine\n- Random Forest\n- Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms\n- Gradient Boosting algorithms\n\nWe will review Perl source code samples from select algorithms, run live demos, and analyze the results.\n\nIf you have always been curious about Machine Learning in Perl, or if you are already an ML programmer looking to expand your knowledge, then this talk is for you!"
