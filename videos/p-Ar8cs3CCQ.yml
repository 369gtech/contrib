description: "In this talk, John A. De Goes, CTO of Precog, presents the high-level architecture of PrecogDB, a data science platform written in 100% Scala that provides a robust implementation of the data analysis language Quirrel on top of a proprietary data store.\n\nJohn discusses the challenges the team has had building systems-level code in the presence of megamorphic functions, monadic recursion, boxing, and monad transformers, while also highlighting some of the strengths of Scala and the bright hope of inlining, TCO, specialization, and macros.\n\n** Visit our site for more content on Scala, including the rest of the presentations from NE Scala 2013: http://bit.ly/nescala13"
