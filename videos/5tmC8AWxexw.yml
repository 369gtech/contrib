description: "All members of free and open source communities can help create a safe and inclusive community. This talk will cover both common and complex issues around practical Code of Conduct enforcement. Weâ€™ll cover everything from dealing with microagressions in online spaces to dealing with conflicts of interest in your CoC enforcement team. How does a community deal with harassment that takes place between community members outside of community spaces? What if there's an NDA involved or people fear retribution for reporting someone? Enforcing a Code of Conduct is often complex and this talk will give lots of practical (anonymized) examples.\n\nThis session is open to anyone who is curious about how to improve diversity and inclusion in tech. There will be trigger warnings for particular parts of the talk for high-level discussion of domestic violence between open source community members, and the complexities in how communities handle that.\n\nAttendees will walk away with a broader understanding of some of the most complex Code of Conduct violations. The talk will provide a will provide a framework for evaluating the right level of response to a CoC violation."
