description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nDevelopers spend too much time maintaining servers, rather than writing software. Recently, new cloud solutions, known as 'serverless' platforms, allow developers to write microservices without servers. What does a 'serverless' application look like, how do you create one and what are the challenges?\nIn this session, we'll introduce the 'serverless' stack, showing developers how to write microservices using these platforms. We'll look at migrating existing applications over to this new stack, common issues and challenges that you need to consider and tools to support serverless development."
