description: "Baking Security into Your Pipeline: Start Here\n\nShozab Naqvi, Solutions Architect, Electric Cloud \n\nSecurity and compliance are critical to every software business – today more than ever, given recent increase in data breaches and looming cyber-security threats. Security is everyone’s responsibility: these days, if you build it, you run it – and you secure it! \n\nAlong with increased agility and velocity, DevOps also provides a HUGE opportunity for better security and reliability. DevSecOps patterns have emerged to “Shift-left” security, enabling both Dev and Ops to take an active - and proactive - role in securing our applications, environments, and data. By baking-in Security as an integral part of the delivery pipeline, organizations mitigate risk and achieve better security, auditory safeguards and improved efficiency.\n\nSo where to start? \n\nThis talk covers must-haves tips, easy to implement security checks and best practices for practical steps to incorporate security practices from the start. These enable you to create an effective and viable security layer for your code, infrastructure, and DevOps processes themselves – to serve as a solid foundation to ensure security and compliance in the long run, in a streamlined, efficient and proactive way.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
