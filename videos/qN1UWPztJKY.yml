description: "For three years, this session’s speaker left the Java world to work with C++ and Python on real-time music software. Coming back, he noticed that there are so many aspects of Java that we take for granted but that can’t be found elsewhere. Java can be summarized as being the most well-balanced compromise between writing productivity, reading intuitiveness, execution performance, project maintainability, technology evolution, application stability, and runtime visibility. His presentation highlights the 10 most important aspects of Java that he used to take for granted but now cherish dearly.\n\n\nAuthor:\nGeert Bevin\nGeert is a developer with a passion for programming. He has steadily contributed to many open-source projects over the years (Gentoo Linux, RIFE, Terracotta, Ehcache, OpenLaszlo, Juce to name a few). Geert has spoken at many developer conferences, mostly about Java byte-code manipulation, continuations, his framework RIFE and scalability; he was also selected as one of the Java Champions.
