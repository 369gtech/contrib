description: "The headless browser revolution has arrived! Headless browsers are powerful tools that all developers can adopt in their workflow. This session will showcase examples of the amazing things that Chrome can do without a UI: write programs to control the browser; test a site; automate UI tasks; integrate into a CI system; setup A/B perf monitoring; prerender a client-side app for SEO; and more. The focus will be on using Puppeteer, Google's Node library for controlling headless Chrome.\n\nRate this session by signing-in on the I/O website here → https://goo.gl/PEoVtB\n\nGetting Started with Headless Chrome → https://goo.gl/wg3u1W\nPuppeteer → https://goo.gl/YXrgqX\nExamples → https://goo.gl/G4QcBC\nDemo sites:\n→ https://pptraas.com\n→ https://try-puppeteer.appspot.com\n\nWatch more Chrome and Web sessions from I/O '18 here → https://goo.gl/5fgXhX \nSee all the sessions from Google I/O '18 here → https://goo.gl/q1Tr8x\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel → http://goo.gl/LLLNvf\n\n#io18"
