language: English
recordingDate: 1538643610
description: 'Beaker is a browser for exploring and building the peer-to-peer Web. With Beaker, you can build and host websites directly from your computer — no server required! But what’s the Web without apps? Is it really possible to build an app without managing a server or a database? This talk will explore the world of peer-to-peer apps, and take a look at how they use Beaker’s APIs to manage user data, create profiles, and connect users.'
