title: 'AWS Serverless with .NET Core - Norm Johanson'
recordingDate: 1499244177
description: "The AWS Lambda service launched in November 2014 and ignited the Serverless architecture movement. The Serverless architecture can be used for large variety of applications, from mobile backends to event processing to workflow systems to Alexa skills. Last year Lambda added support for .NET Core bringing C# to the AWS Serverless architecture.\n\nIn this demo heavy talk you will learn how .NET fits in with the AWS Serverless architecture. And since Lambda support is based on the cross platform .NET Core you will see how you can develop C# Lambda functions in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code on non-windows platforms."
