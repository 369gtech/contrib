description: "Speaker: Geoff Stearns\r\n\r\nThe YouTube player APIs allow you to take nearly full control over the YouTube embedded video players. Controls like play, pause, seeking, volume controls, and event updates are all possible and easy to set up. The Chromeless player allows you to build your own controls and interactions that play YouTube videos. Geoff will talk about how to use both the YouTube player APIs and the Chromeless player in your apps and on your site.\r\n\r\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/poweredbyyoutube"
