description: "The Service Score Card—Gamifying Operational Excellence\n\nDaniel Lawrence, LinkedIn\n\nWhat makes a “good” service is a moving target. Technologies and requirements change over time. It can be impossible to ensure that none of your services have been left behind. \n\nThe Service ScoreCard approach is to have a small check for each service initiative we have, this could be anything measurable; deployment frequency, the oncall team all have phone; ensuring the latest version of the JVM. \n\nThe Service ScoreCard, gives each service a grade from 'F' to 'A+', based on passing or failing the list of checks. As soon as anyone see the service grade’s slipping everyone rallies to improve the grades. \n\nWe can then set up rules based on the grades, “Only B and above services can deploy 24 / 7”, “moratorium on services without an A+” or “No SRE support until the services below C grade”.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
