description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2017 #flinkforward\n\nAljoscha Krettek, Software Engineer at data Artisans\n\nFlink is a great stream processor, Python is a great programming language, Apache Beam is a great programming model and portability layer. Using all three together is a great idea! We will demo and discuss writing Beam Python pipelines and running them on Flink. We will cover Beam's portability vision that led here, what you need to know about how Beam Python pipelines are executed on Flink, and where Beam's portability framework is headed next (hint: Python pipelines reading from non-Python connectors)\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
