title: 'Are we *actually* IDE yet? A look on the Rust IDE Story - Igor Matuszewski'
language: English
recordingDate: 1578505227
description: 'Ever since appearing on the Rust 2017 roadmap, IDE support has been and continues to be a highly-requested feature that should boost productivity when working with Rust code. Despite the landscape shifting a lot during these last 3 years, including a proliferation of new tools and improved integration between tools, it feels like the Rust IDE story is not yet complete. This talk will explore the current status of the official Rust Language Server (RLS) and Rust Analyzer, which is a main focus of the official RLS 2.0 compiler working group.'
