description: "At some point in your life, you start realizing that re-inventing the wheel isn't the best way to spend your time. Especially since Bob Wheel Sr. perfected that invention many, many years ago. And it's the same with software. Smart people have already encountered a lot of the problems that we face every day while building software. Some of them have even been nice enough to write down their solutions in so called \"patterns\". So why not stand on the shoulders of...well...maybe not giants...but at least very smart people who were born before you, and build on top of their hard-earned wisdom?\nThis session, will walk you through a bunch of really useful patterns, and you'll not only learn their names, but also why they are useful and how to implement them in .NET. And maybe, just maybe, you'll even see that one pattern that solves that problem you are working on at the moment. But even if you don't see that one pattern that you need, you will at least get a few that you can store in your toolbelt for future problems.\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
