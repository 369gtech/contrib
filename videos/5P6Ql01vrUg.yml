title: 'Testing the Enterprise Layers: The ABCs of Integration Testing'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433518283
description: "For years developers have been exploring how to layer and separate code to test it in isolation on the unit level. It has kept integration and functional testing as a big ball of mud, jumping straight from unit to full system testing. But could some of the same lessons learned from unit testing apply to integration testing? Is it possible to isolate and stay real at the same time? Do mocks, stubs, and test doubles have a place in the world of integration testing? Are there other lessons to be learned? This session explores the different technologies within the enterprise Java specification and shows how enterprise Java applications can be tested in isolationâ€”layer for layer, module for module, and component for component.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAndrew Rubinger\nAdvocate for and speaker on testable enterprise Java development, author of \"Enterprise JavaBeans 3.1\" from O'Reilly Media.
