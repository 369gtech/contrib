description: "SREcon16 Europe - Leading a Team with Values\n\nRich Archbold, Intercom\n\n\nAdding a small set of authentic, opinionated, collaboratively formed core values can be the magic ingredient to building a high performing, happy team.\n\nIn this talk you'll hear the story of how, through the introduction of four core values, the Intercom Infrastructure team achieved significant improvements in service reliability, cost effectiveness and dramatically reduced their interrupt driven workload. You will also hear how and why core values actually work and how to apply them in your own team environment.\n\nRich enjoys learning from interesting outages, loves hard infrastructure scaling challenges, and runs on Starbucks coffee. He is currently Director of Engineering @ Intercom and is an ex Facebooker and Amazonian. \n\nView the full SREcon16 Europe Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program"
