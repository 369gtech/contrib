description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune 14, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nJerry will talk about scaling Google Maps from the desktop down to mobile phones where usage is\ngrowing rapidly and will someday surpass desktop usage. He will discuss the approaches used in adapt-\ning the application to work in a low bandwidth, high latency environment with a wide variety of net-\nworks and devices. Mobile data rates currently range from 100 Kbps to 2 Mbps but more significantly,\nHTTP network request latency is measured in seconds. Mobile phone screens are very small compared\nto laptops, so we can't just shrink down the view. User input is often limited to 12-key keypads plus two\nsoft keys, sometimes augmented with an alpha keyboard and/or a touch screen.\n\nThe key adaptation was reimplementing the AJAX web site as a client-server application, ported to\nseveral mobile platforms. We redesigned the user interface for the narrow UI bottleneck and added cel-\nlular-based location detection so people don't have to type an address just to get the map open to the\nright page. An application-specific network protocol and tile cache help with the high latency network\nby multiplexing requests together into fewer round trips. A special \"mobile\" tile set helps with latency\nand bandwidth by downloading smaller map tiles while offering more frequent road labels to suit tiny\nscreens. Compression techniques such as a compact-header JPEG format for satellite images also help.\nThe server is stateless so scaling up capacity is mostly handled by adding more servers.\nPeople are unaccustomed to downloading applications to their phones, and the phones have download\nlimits, so it's important to keep the download package small. We also get the application preinstalled on\nsome phones.\n\nSpeaker: Jerry Morrison\nJerry Morrison is a tech lead on Google Maps for mobile. He programs the server and clients in\ncollaboration with teams in London, New York, Seattle, Tokyo, Beijing, and Cupertino. Jerry's career\ninterest is bringing new forms of media to many people."
