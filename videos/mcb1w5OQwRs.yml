title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Voting Village - Secure the Vote - Hack a Fax'
language: English
recordingDate: 1596959881
description: 'Millions of overseas voters must choose between the following ballot return methods: international mail, email or fax return as allowed by each respective state law. The insecurity of email and fax, arguably, creates a security gap in the overall elections infrastructure that undermines its integrity. The National Cybersecurity Center proposes to ‘hack a fax’ in order to demonstrate the lack of security, and create an opportunity to strengthen standards. The concern to the broader community is that as we continue to seek to make voting more accessible, it must also be secure. Policies that limit overseas voters to technology that may not have security standards in place, and therefore are insecure, reduces the integrity of the overall elections ecosystem.'
