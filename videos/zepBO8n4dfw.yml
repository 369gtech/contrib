description: "You’re tracking your Drupal development project with one or more spreadsheets. You know there’s a better way, and you’ve heard of other tools, but just have not had time to do some research. This session will help you get started: with a quick but thorough overview of popular tools and alternatives that are available to help you better manage your next Drupal project.\n\nDepending on the size and complexity of your project, you’ll walk away with a shorter list of tools to try, or\_maybe new options to explore as alternatives. .\n\nThis session is a follow-up and update from the session presented at DrupalCon New Orleans. We'll look at improvements and additions to projects plus some new ones!\n\nWe’ll review and highlight the key benefits and drawbacks of using tools including:\n\nTrello\nAsana/Instagantt\nAgantty\nWekan.io\nAgilePad\nTaiga.io\nTaskBoard\nAre there others you’ve tried and either hated or loved?
