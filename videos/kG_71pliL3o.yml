description: 'Loose coupling. Specialized services. High availability. Buzzword-compliant microservices seem to be taking the software development world by storm. But the explosion of configurations needed to keep up with even just a few (not to say hundreds) of services is a nightmare. Countless servers, multiple configurations and installs, not to mention rewriting applications to change the architecture. And then you need to scale the solution. Thatâ€™s why the real change you should be looking at is not microservices but containers. This session shows how to use Docker and Java EE to build environments with high availability and low complexity and apply them to your application on Oracle Cloud. For microservices and for your app too.'
