description: "In this video, I go over the history of reinforcement learning then talk about how a type of reinforcement learning called Q learning works. We'll then write a 10 line python script for a Q learning bot in a 5x5 grid that will help it go from point A to point B as fast as possible.\n\nThe coding challenge for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/q_learning_demo\n\nMore Learning resources:\nhttp://hunch.net/~jl/projects/RL/RLTheoryTutorial.pdf\nhttp://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/RLUsersGuide.ICAC2005.pdf\nhttps://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-tutorials-on-reinforcement-learning\nhttp://burlap.cs.brown.edu/tutorials/cpl/p3.html\nhttp://outlace.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Part-1/\nhttp://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2016/09/getting-ai-smarter-with-q-learning.html\n\nJoin us in our Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nIn the last live stream I said there would be a big reveal, that reveal is coming next Friday (1/13).\n\nPlease subscribe! and like.
