description: 'Year 2000 was the year of functions2.php. Today we write fully engineered Object Oriented software. All in the same language. PHP has grown and we as developers and people have grown with the new changes over the years. Let me show you what truly changed my life as I grew up being a 12 year old girl learning PHP 4 while women got treated like shit online to today making people''s lives better with PHP 7 and an amazing community where we grow further together, men, women and elePHPants alike.'
