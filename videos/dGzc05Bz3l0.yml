description: "Did you ever wonder why development in Python can be x10 faster than development in languages like c++?\n\nObserving my teams’ experimentations, the python community, and reading, I have adopted various habits, patterns, and tools. But most importantly I learned thinking in Python. I consider thinking in Python a key for rapid development and good engineering.\n\nThinking in a programming language affects the amount of information you need to keep in your working memory. It also affects the abstractions and tools that pop in your mind and then used in constructing solutions. \n\nLet’s explore what it means to think in Python. Why Python allows you to focus on problem solving, while languages like c++ often distract your attention from the problem at hand.\n\nIn this talk I will cover some good and bad practices by examples while trying to consider the amount of effort needed to write it, read it, and talk about it with other team members.\n\nKey Takeaways: Tips for speeding your work without compromising quality, and reasoning for using it.\n\nEVENT:\n\nEuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Boston\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJohnny Dude\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGseHScYdSg"
