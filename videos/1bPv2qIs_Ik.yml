description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nInside Every Calculus Is A Little Algebra Waiting To Get Out\nby\nErik Meijer\n\nABSTRACT\nBecause of deep learning, there has been a surge in interest in automatic differentiation, especially from the functional programming community. As a result there are many recent papers that look at automatic differentiation from a Category Theory perspective. However, Category Theorists have already been looking at differentiation and calculus in general since the late 60â€™s in the context of Synthetic Differential Geometry. In this talk, we will provide a gentle introduction to the ideas behind SDG, by relating them to dual numbers, and show how it provides a simple axiomatic and purely algebraic approach to (automatic) differentiation and integration. And no worries if you suffer from arithmophobia, there will be plenty of working Kotlin code that turns the math into something fun you can play with for real.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Erik Meijer\n\nErik Meijer has been trying to bridge the ridge between theory and practice for most of his career. He is perhaps best known for his work on, amongst others, Haskell, C#, Visual Basic, and Dart programming languages, as well as for his contributions to LINQ and the Reactive Framework (Rx). Most recently he is on a quest to make uncertainty a first-class citizen in mainstream programming languages.\n\n---\n\nCode Mesh V\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshio"
