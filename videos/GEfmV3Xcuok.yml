description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nCNL is a numerics library born out of efforts to standardize fixed-point arithmetic. \nIt provides number types which increase precision, enforce correctness and maintain efficiency. \nAnd by designing these types with composability in mind, the library aims to do for integers what the STL does for pointers. \n\nThis introductory talk will show potential users how they can benefit from using CNL in a wide variety of applications. Firstly, the individual components will be illustrated using straightforward examples. Then we'll see how these components slot together to produce powerful new types. Finally I'll detail the steps necessary to adapt existing types to work within the CNL framework. \n\nAlong the way, I hope to share some of the insights I've gained while learning about literal types including: why you shouldn't mess with `int` if you want zero-cost abstractions; how C++ is getting better at supporting new number types and my hopes for the forthcoming Numeric TS.\n— \nJohn McFarlane: A9.com, SDE\n\nJohn McFarlane has used C++ for twenty years, specializing in simulation, AI and interactivity. He is a contributor to Study Groups 6 and 14 and is involved in standardizing fixed-point arithmetic.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
