description: "Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms like riff enable users to deploy serverless applications. Serverless applications are event driven and are made up of small “functions” that are chained together. This lets users focus on their application logic and rely on the platform to take care of the rest.\n\nOr at least, that’s the promise. How well does it work in reality? In this talk, we will take an in-depth look at riff and discuss strategies to break an actual monolith into its component functions and deploy them.\n\nSpeakers: Swapnil Bawaskar, Software Engineer, Pivotal; Florent Biville, Developer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform \nSlideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/from-monolith-to-riff-functions"
