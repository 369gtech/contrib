description: "Full title: Itamar Turner-Trauring: Small Big Data: using NumPy and Pandas when your data doesn't fit in memory | PyData New York 2019\n\nYour data is too big to fit in memory—loading it crashes your program—but it's also too small for a complex Big Data cluster. How to process your data simply and quickly? In this talk you'll learn the basic techniques for dealing with Small Big Data: money, compression, batching and parallelization, and indexing. In particular, you'll learn how to apply these techniques to NumPy and Pandas.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
