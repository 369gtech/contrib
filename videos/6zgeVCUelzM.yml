description: "Enterprise adoption of DevOps is something that is already happening, but like with other trendy methodologies it happens quite differently with different level of success.\n\nThis presentation accumulates speaker's experience in helping different size organizations to implement DevOps initiatives and gives interesting real life examples: war stories, jokes, myths.\n\nDuring last years we accumulated a lot of experience helping our clients automating their JVM projects starting from automated deployments and ending with fully automated production infrastructure configuration."
