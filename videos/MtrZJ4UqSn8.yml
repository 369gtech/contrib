description: "Video with transcript included: http://bit.ly/2ZqB0ou \n\nBryan Cantrill talks about Moore's Law, which after years of defying predictions of its demise, is now indisputably dying. But what does the end of Moore's Law mean for practitioners of enterprise computing? He explores potential ramifications, including not only the exotic world of emerging substrates, but much more mundane notions of scale, durability, economics and (yes!) accounting.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon New York 2019: http://bit.ly/2KFk7SO\n\nThe next QCon is Qcon San Francisco 2019 – Nov 11-13, 2019: http://bit.ly/2ZFJW9S \n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQ’s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#SoftwareArchitecture #SoftwareEngineering #GordonMoore"
