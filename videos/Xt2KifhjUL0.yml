description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2018 Conference https://amsterdamjs.com\n\n# Building functional Front-ends with ClojureScript\n\nClojure came along into our lives in 2007 as one of the most concise and powerful Lisps, and since them it's been widely adopted by members of the community. Recently, Clojure got a new friend called ClojureScript, which allows us to use Clojure to build robust and reliable front ends. Ever wanted to use a rich data structure set, macros and take advantage of the great performance optimizations present on the JVM? You got it! In this talk I'll go through the super powers ClojureScript can add to the view layer and the benefits of functional programming."
