title: 'Jenn Turner: Lessons in Emotional Safety FTW [JSConf2014]'
recordingDate: 1403101284
description: "Emotional safety is the most important predictor of the health of an organization and a community. But more importantly, it has a enduring repercussions on our lives as individuals. Like, our real livesâ€”the ones we live for our whole lives.\n\nI've worked in intensely unsafe professional environments prior to joining the team at &yet.\n\nI'd like to candidly share some of the lessons I've learned from my unique perspective as a female who isn't a software developer but who spends much of her life around them (including co-organizing events like RealtimeConf, RedisConf, and TriConf).\n\nBeing \"in the developer world but not of it\" has given me perspective to identify blind spots within our culture as a company and a community. Traditionally copywriters on a software team are viewed as a supporting role: we help sell what gets made. But what if all contributors to a team were true equals capable of leading and shaping a continuously improving company culture? That's the foundation of emotional safety."
