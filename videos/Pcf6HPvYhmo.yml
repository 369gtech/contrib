title: 'Matthew Schumpert: “Open core” Platform product management'
recordingDate: 1542068208
description: "Buyers of high-priced enterprise software tend to be risk-averse and are classically used to proprietary, close-source and vendor-developed products that give them the maximum cover against the high risk of failure in a large IT project, and give them “one throat to choke” in case the product fails them.  But as the location of software innovation has shifted into the open source domain, even conservative customers must select an increasingly open-source stack to remain competitive in delivering applications to their business line customers.    - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/impact\n\nimpact-conf.com"
