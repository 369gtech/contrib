title: 'What''s new in control groups (cgroups) version 2?'
recordingDate: 1548367509
description: "Michael Kerrisk\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/124/\n\nControl groups (cgroups) version 1 was released in 2008, and within a short time people realized that there were a number of problems that resulted from its uncoordinated design and implementation. Soon afterwards, work began on fixing the problems--work that lasted around 4 years and resulted in the release of cgroups v2 in 2016. Even then, much work remained to be done, with the absence of some important features blocking widespread adoption of cgroups v2. One of the main logjams was finally broken at the beginning of 2018 with the merging of the cgroups v2 CPU controller, and it seems likely that the remaining missing pieces will be added in the next few kernel releases. It seems likely that cgroups v2 will become more widely used in the not too distant future. (One of the notable users of cgroups v1, systemd, is already migrating to cgroups v2.)\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll briefly consider some of the problems in cgroups v1 that motivated the cgroups v2 redesign, and then go on to look at the differences and new features in cgroups v2. I'll also look at what pieces are still missing in cgroups v2 and some other possible changes that come to cgroups v2 in the future. Some familiarity with the cgroups mechanism will be assumed.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
