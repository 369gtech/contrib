description: "React Native has come to stay. There is so much excitement about developing native mobile applications using JavaScript. React Native has made it possible for web developers to develop sophisticated native mobile apps.\n\nIn the last two years, after building our React Native Apps, there are many things that I have learned the hard way. Lessons learned in coding standards, state management, supporting multiple platforms, release management, just to name a few.\n\nIn this session, I would share my experiences building React Native Apps, and the 10 things that I wish I knew early on. By the end of this talk, you will be equipped with best practices to follow while building your React Native App. Make sure you donâ€™t repeat the same mistakes that I did.\n\nEVENT:\n\nChain React 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAdhithi Ravichandran\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nInfinite Red YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwpSzVt7QpLDbCnPXqR97-g"
