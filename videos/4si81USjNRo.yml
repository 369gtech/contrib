description: "What the F#nc? - Tim Hess, Pivotal\n\nLife is short, you've only got so many keystrokes left! Come see how you can get more done with fewer keystrokes and more fun(ctional programming) along the way. We'll provide a little background on F# before diving into to some demos on how to use Steeltoe and F# together in Cloud Foundry. \n\nAbout Tim Hess\nTim Hess is an engineer on the Steeltoe project. He's been slinging code professionally for over 10 years, with healthy doses of software architecture and system administration responsibilities along the way. In order to feed his expansive appetite for learning, Hess also runs the premier software developer group in Central Wisconsin."
