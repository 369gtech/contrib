description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nLife Outside the Cluster: Adding Virtual Machines to an Envoy Service Mesh - Megan O'Keefe & Ameer Abbas, Google  \n\nService mesh tools add lots of functionality for Kubernetes-based applications, including policy automation and telemetry. But what if you're halfway through a migration to Kubernetes, and you still have applications running in virtual machines? In this talk, Megan O'Keefe and Ameer Abbas will demonstrate how to use Istio, an Envoy-based service mesh, to connect Kubernetes services with applications running in VMs. Demos will include: encrypting gRPC traffic between Pods and VMs, using Prometheus to view application metrics across both environments, and load balancing traffic between Kubernetes and VM instances. You will leave this talk understanding exactly how to integrate virtual machines with an Envoy-based service mesh. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaap"
