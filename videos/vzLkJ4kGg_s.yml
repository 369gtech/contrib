description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIstio Simplified - Louis Ryan, Google & Steve Dake, IBM \n\nIstio has made great advances in taming its notorious user-facing complexity. We recently introduced Istio's new 'istiod' monolith to greatly reduce control plane complexity, protocol auto-detection for simplified routing rules, automatic mTLS for simpler graceful migration to mTLS from brownfield clusters, Operator-based installs and upgrades, and improved support for non-Kubernetes workloads. Our goal is to make Istio simple to understand, install and operate, and these changes go a long way towards achieving that goal. \n\nhttps://sched.co/abaT"
