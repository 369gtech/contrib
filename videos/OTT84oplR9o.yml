description: "Speaker: Christabel Neo\r\n\r\nChristabel Neo works as Associate Software Engineer for Open Government Products, GovTech Singapore\r\n\r\nVault.gov.sg is an internal repository for government datasets, that aims to provide public servants with quick and convenient access to confidential data by easing the process of data discovery and retrieval.\r\n\r\nThe need to protect the privacy of individuals whose data is recorded is an increasingly prominent consideration in the application development process, especially in light of recent data leaks. Authentication and authorization work hand in hand to ensure that only legitimate users can utilise the system, and that their actions are limited to their assigned scope. This talk will discuss how authorization was designed and implemented for Vault through the use of an open-source library Casbin.\r\n\r\nChristabel is a software engineer at Open Government Products, GovTech Singapore, where she builds tech for the public good.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/christabel-neo-321a7396/\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/269002731/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
