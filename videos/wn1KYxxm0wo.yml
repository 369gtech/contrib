description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeaker: Greg Turnquist\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/introduction-to-spring-data\n\n\nItâ€™s 2016. Are you still writing data queries by hand? Learn how Spring Data gives you the tools to leap over that hurdle and dive into solving problems. Feeling locked into your relational database due to having written gobs of SQL operations? In this live coding session, see how Spring Data provides the means to reduce that risk and give you the means to branch into other data stores. With a couple extra lines of code, you can even have a RESTful interface in no time flat."
