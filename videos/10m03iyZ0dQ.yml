recordingDate: 1368927573
description: "Josh Sassoon, Tom Broxton \n\nDesign is different from art. In fact, if you had to use math to validate it, then you are probably on the right track. In this product design-focused session, we will discuss what it means to be a designer at YouTube. We will cover the state and meaning of the multi-device world we live in. Finally, we will share a few best principles for both design and corresponding quantitative analysis in this new world.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
