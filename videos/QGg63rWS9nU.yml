description: "The ongoing digitization of the industrial-scale machines that power and enable human activity is itself a major global transformation. Joshua Bloom explains why the real revolution—in efficiencies and in improved and saved lives—will happen when machine learning automation and insights are properly coupled to the complex systems of industrial data. Leveraging a systems view of real-world use cases from aviation to transportation, Joshua contrasts the needs and approaches of consumer machine learning with industrial machine learning, focusing on three key areas: combining physics-based models with data-driven models, differential privacy and secure ML (including edge-to-cloud strategies), and interpretability of model predictions.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
