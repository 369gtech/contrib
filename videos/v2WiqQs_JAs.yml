description: "Have you ever wanted to get into blockchain development, but havenâ€™t found a good place to start? In this talk, we will explore a use case of blockchain and show you how it can be applied in a real-world scenario.\n\nFirst, we will cover the basics of blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric by building a simple blockchain application. We will explore Hyperledger Composer and use it to model a business network that we will then deploy onto a Hyperledger Fabric network.\n\nLastly, we will interact with the application and check the details of the transactions using the IBM Cloud blockchain service."
