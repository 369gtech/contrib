title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2020 - Saša Jurić - Simplifying Systems with Elixir'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609290499
description: "Simplifying systems with Elixir\nElixir is often described as a language which offers great support for massive concurrency. First-hand reports cite the ease of handling millions of connected users, sub-millisecond response times, and superb fault-tolerance. These are all great benefits, but we’re left wondering whether Elixir is useful only for large scale systems, or can it bring some benefits in the simpler cases too?\nThis talk aims to demonstrate that Elixir is also a great choice for building smaller systems. Through a very simple but still a real-life example, I’ll explain how using Elixir can help simplify the system architecture, and lead to a more homogeneous solution. The talk targets backend developers who are new to Elixir. After the talk, the audience will have a clearer idea about what makes Elixir attractive, and why should they consider using it to build their next backend system.\nSaša is an Elixir mentor helping companies with the adoption of Elixir. He has many years of experience building server systems, as well as desktop applications using various languages and technologies. For the past nine years, his focus has been on building backend systems using Elixir and Erlang. He is the author of \"Elixir in Action\", and an occasional blogger at\_theerlangelist.com.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit, www.yowconference.com.au"
