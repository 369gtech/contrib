description: "Jossi Wolf, Android Developer\n\nFROM 0 TO MATERIAL MOTION: CREATING ANIMATIONS AND TRANSITIONS\nIntermediate / Design / UI/UX / Talk\n\nImplementing animations and transitions can be tricky - but that shouldn't hold you back! Animations and transitions can help the user keep track of what is going on on the screen and determine context. As a developer, looking at the Material Design Guidelines, a mockup by your designer or other inspirations can sometimes leave you wondering how to actually implement an animation or transition and \"making it material\". In this session, you will learn how to get from a recording or a rough sketch of animation or transition to implementing it using the Android SDK, and finally some tips about tweaking animations and transitions."
