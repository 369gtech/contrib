language: English
recordingDate: 1521645569
description: "One of the things that make Node.js so efficient is its asynchronous nature. Unfortunately, newcomers to Node.js often fall victim to the “pyramid of doom,” as anonymous callback functions pile up. The resulting code is often hard to understand and even harder to debug. Is this just par for the course when working with Node.js? It doesn't have to be! In this session, attendees will learn how to tame the asynchronous nature of Node.js using several tools and techniques including, named functions, Promises, the Async library and more.\n\nDan McGhan is an Oracle Developer Advocate with a focus on JavaScript and Oracle Database.
