language: English
recordingDate: 1639438412
description: "Microservice applications are composed of small, independently versioned, and scalable customer-focused services that communicate with each other over standard protocols with well-defined interfaces. Each microservice typically encapsulates simple business logic, which you can scale out or in, test, deploy, and manage independently. Smaller teams develop a microservice based on a customer scenario and use any technologies that they want to use. This module will teach you how to build your first microservice with .NET. In this episode, you will:\r\n\r\n- Explain what microservices are.\r\n- Know how various technologies involved in microservices are and how they relate.\r\n- Build a microservice using .NET."
