title: 'Applying DDD - Oleg Kutyrin and Juergen Heymann - DDD Europe 2020'
language: English

description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nEnterprise scale IT landscapes typically consist of many applications that together implement a business process. These applications have specialized functionality and separate data / domain models. Integrating them requires high efforts for complex point-to-point mappings, yet the resulting landscape still does not appear as one coherent whole. APIs to the systems still expose the very different data models, conventions and protocols which makes consumption tedious. The same problem arises for product companies like SAP that sell business processes as a service on top of a combination of home-grown and acquired applications.\n\nSAP has started a project to define an overarching data / domain model as a foundation for process and data integration of our Intelligent Enterprise Suite.\n\nWe selected DDD as the fundamental methodology to design the 'One Domain Model' leveraging the concepts of domains, bounded contexts, aggregates and guide the model alignment discussions.\n\nThis talk shares our experience applying the DDD principles, our alignment process and some design heuristics that we discovered on the way.\n\nJuergen Heymann is a software developer, then architect with 30 years experience, the last 25 at SAP. His main interests are architecture, design and modeling topics of course including DDD. Currently he is in the central architecture group working company-wide architecture topics.\nOleg Kutyrin is an architect dealing with cloud-native application development at SAP."
