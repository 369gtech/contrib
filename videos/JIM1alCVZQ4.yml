description: "Leadership of Technical Teams\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Moorfoot]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Owen Campbell\n\nOver the years, I've led, and been a member of, numerous technical teams on a wide variety of projects. Based on that experience, this talk will describe my personal observations on the role of the leader in that sort of team.\n\nThe talk will be in 5 sections:\n\n\nIntroduction - A bit about my background so you can judge whether to bother staying for the rest.\n\nAuthority - Where it comes from and the challenges you might face depending on the answer.\nPriorities - What should you be focussing upon?\nStyle - There are many leadership styles, but what's yours and what's appropriate for technical teams?\nProcess - What's your role in defining and managing process?\n\n\n\nThere is no prior knowledge or experience required whatsoever. The talk is aimed equally at anyone  considering a leadership role for the first time or who has been doing so for many years.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
