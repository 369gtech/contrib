title: 'What Designing For Kids Can Teach Us About User Experience'
recordingDate: 1421884801
description: "Originally aired on July 22, 2014.  When designing digital experiences for adults, we focus on the \"destination,\" making sure our users can complete key tasks as quickly and efficiently as possible. When designing for kids, however, we get to focus on the \"journey\", and all the adventure and excitement that come from the experience itself.\n\nWhat if we were able to mix it up a little, and introduce some of these \"journey\" ideas into our designs for adults to create more interesting experiences? In this webcast presented by Deb Gelman author of Design for Kids, we will identify techniques from designing for kids that we can apply to adult audiences to increase satisfaction and engagement. Specifically, we'll talk about how kids and adults respond to the following:\n\n    Conflict\n    Response\n    Investment\n    Action\n    Flow\n\nParticipants will come away with an understanding of the principles of designing for kids, and techniques for incorporating these principles for adult audiences as well.\n\nAbout Debra Gelman\n\nDebra Gelman is a researcher, designer and strategist in the field of interactive children's media.
