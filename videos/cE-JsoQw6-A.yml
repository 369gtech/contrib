description: "Web content now lives on multiple devices and platforms. We are designing content that will live on evolving smart devices, smart TVs, dumb devices, and low res screen platforms. What are the design implications for multiscreen patterns such as coherence, device shifting and the growing trend of zero UI?\n\nDesigning digital products is about how people connect with content on the various ecosystems of screens. The nature of digital is changing and how we design and implement needs to rapidly evolve.\n\nAndrew Smyk\nEducator & UX Designer, Sheridan College\nhttps://twitter.com/andrewsmyk\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
