description: "Join me for a scenic adventure tour through the magical land of category theory, stopping off at all the major sights.\n\nWe'll learn the basic notions that form the conceptual backbone of category theory, and how they all fit together.\n\nCategory theory has made deep inroads into computer science theory, but in this talk we'll be focused on computer science practice. We'll explore the advantages category theory brings to programming in terms of\n\n1.providing alternate representations for types\n2.  classifying solutions, or\n3. simply providing a clarifying viewpoint and helping to organise our thinking.\n\nIn addition this should provide you with the right framework for further exploring category theory, should you so wish.\n\nMark has a PhD in algebra, writes Haskell at a bank, and loves functional programming.\n\nFor more on YOW!
