description: "Christopher Biggs\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/114/\n\nLearn how to design and deploy battery powered IoT sensors that can go years between charges.\r\n\r\nYou could be forgiven for thinking (as I did) that the proliferation of wireless IoT solutions means that implementing environmental monitoring is a simple process. Typically, everything goes swimmingly for the first two hours until your battery runs flat. Many wireless development boards (even the ones with built in battery chargers) are actually not well suited to ultra-low-power applications.\r\n\r\nBeing truly wireless means (shock) no wires, not even for power. So we rely on battery, and perhaps solar. This brings a host of challenges: selecting the right battery, avoiding power-hungry components, coping with the limitations of a low-power radio platform like LoRa, learning the intricacies of deep-sleep modes, and choosing and using solar cells.\r\n\r\nThis is a case-study and lessons-learned from a real project for IoT utility metering. What seemed like a simple problem led to a deep dive into ultra-low-power subsystems of modern IoT processors, and the practicalities of the LoRa radio platform.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
