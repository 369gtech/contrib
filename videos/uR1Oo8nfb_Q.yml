description: "Real-time data is an increasingly popular topic these days. The basic idea is simple: when data in the database changes, any clients viewing the data should see the changes immediately, in real-time. Gmail and Twitter are great examples of applications that make use of real-time data. Users don't need to refresh the page to see new emails or tweets. Instead, new data is pushed to the clients when it becomes available. In this session, attendees will learn about some of the tools that make real-time applications easier than ever before, including Node.js and Socket.IO. Of course, the data must be pushed from somewhere, so we will also explore the way that databases participate in this process.\n\nSpeaker: Dan Mcghan"
