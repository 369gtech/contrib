recordingDate: 1593760594
description: "How I read an article by one of the original signatories of the manifesto for agile software development, and accidentally ended up writing a version of Asteroids for my phone.\n\n## Agenda\n\n- The good old days\n- Linear algebra\n- A sidebar about static typing and why it helped in this particular case\n- Grainy sound effects in the magic of stereo\n- An exciting world premier\n\n## About Jez\n\nJez is a freelance software grandad. He mucks in with programming, lends a hand with build & deployment processes, provides a leg up with TDD practices, and keeps an eye on the young 'uns so they donâ€™t get trapped down the old mine shaft.\n\nRSVP on Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/271181133/\n\nGive us a Hola in the Live Chat!
