description: "When designing an API, how do you restrict your users to your public interface and keep their filthy hands off your internal implementation details? Sadly, the richness of Python's runtime makes this remarkably difficult. This talk investigates a number of ways to keep the riff-raff out and discusses the limitations of these techniques and how they can improve API designs.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData London 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJames Powell\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish PyData talks.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nPyData YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjD18EJYcsBog4IozkF_7w"
