description: "Everyone working in a team, knows this situation: you feel, there is something standing in the room, which stops the team from making a reasonable decision. But none wants to talk about it openly. This is beating around the bush is dangerous for the success of the project.\nThis talk explains the differences between Elephants and Mooses in the Room and how you can recognize them. You will learn about the importance to name those giants to get them out of the room and donÂ´t let them be a brain blocker to your success anymore. And it is a plea for a culture of transparency and openness to avoid these awkward, tough and sometimes really expensive situations."
