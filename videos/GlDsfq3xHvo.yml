description: "The Clean Architecture has been formalized by Robert C. Martin in 2012, it's quite new even if it's based on the SOLID principles (presented for the first time in early 2000). The biggest benefit that we get using this architecture is the code testability, indeed it separates the application code from the code connected to external factors (that usually is more difficult to test). \nIn this talk we'll see a practical example of how to apply the SOLID principle with particular attention to the D of the acronym: the dependency inversion.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2019/it\nhttps://twitter.com/droidconit\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
