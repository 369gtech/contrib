description: "This session examines how dynamic languages in general and Groovy in particular take us toward the goal of writing programs for a particular domain by using phrases that look familiar to subject matter experts in that domain. Groovy is a popular and successful dynamic language for the JVM. It offers many features that enable you to create embedded domain-specific languages (DSLs) including closures, compile-time and runtime metaprogramming, command chain expressions, operator overloading, named arguments, and other concise syntax conventions.\n\n\nAuthor:\nPaul King\nPaul King leads ASERT, an organization based in Brisbane, Australia which provides software development, training and mentoring services to customers wanting to embrace new technologies, harness best practices and innovate.
