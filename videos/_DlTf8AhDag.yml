description: "This video of Martin Rehfeld was shot at the Erlang User Conference 2012. More info and slides can be found here:  http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2012/speakers/MartinRehfeld\n\nIn the world of social gaming with massive amounts of users, the classic architecture of web application does not cut it anymore.\n\nWooga has already innovated quite a bit introducing stateful erlang-based game servers. Now it is time to push the limits even further.\n\nFollow along the evolution of game servers at Wooga and get an in-depth look into the next-generation backend putting the combined forces of erlang and Ruby to work. Learn how scalability, reliability, concurrency control and beautiful code do not need to be mutually exclusive.\n\nWooga is in the top three of the largest publishers of social games world-wide, right behind Zynga and competing with Electronic Arts for 2nd place with almost 50 million active users every month on facebook.  \n\nTalk objectives: Promote mixing and matching and generally using the best tool for a given job. \n\nTarget audience: When you are interested in the practical challenges arising from combining Erlang and Ruby, this talk is for you."
