description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nGabrielle Benefield - Agile Trainer\n\nABSTRACT\nIt's not about building the product right, it's about building the right product.\nScrum and Agile teams can go fast and deliver high quality code, yet the product still fails. When this happens people look around for a new framework, only to see that fail as well.\nRather than continue to build more code faster, we need to look at the systemic reasons for failure. These are tied to a lack of deep understanding of the causes and impacts of the problem to be solved or opportunity to be exploited, unclear and unquantified goals, and a lack of validated learning with rapid user testing.'\nIt doesn't matter if you use traditional methods, scrum or lean, if you don't set the right direction it won't matter which framework you use.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
