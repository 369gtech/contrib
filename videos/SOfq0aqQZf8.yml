description: "RustConf 2019 - Taking Constant Evaluation to the Limit by Oliver Schneider\n\nHave you ever wanted to write a static with a complex initial value? Are you programming microcontrollers? Do you want to run as little code as possible at runtime or are you trying to reduce your memory footprint? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you probably want to evaluate all-the-thingsâ„¢ at compile-time with a constant evaluator.\n\nThis talk will focus on explaining the inner workings of the new theoretically unrestricted constant evaluator in rustc (nicknamed Miri for \"MIR interpreter\") and give a short outlook on the future features Miri will enable in the Rust language."
