description: "Clojure is a dynamic and functional programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine. It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. This presentation shows how to use Clojure to work with cloud services, employing native Clojure interfaces to software as a service (SaaS) such as GitHub and Twitter and then using Apache jclouds, which provides a Clojure interface, to interact with infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud resources. Learn what it takes to work with Clojure in the cloud and how you can use it to deliver value to your customers.\n\n\nAuthor:\nEverett Toews\nI'm a Developer Advocate at Rackspace making OpenStack and the Rackspace Cloud easy to use for developers and operators. Sometimes developer, sometimes advocate, and sometimes operator. I'm a committer and PMC on Apache jclouds, and co-author of the OpenStack Operations Guide from O'Reilly. In the past I've developed web applications, taught workshops at conferences including SXSW and Gluecon, and presented at conferences including OSCON and the OpenStack Summits. I love spending time with my family. If it's calm outside, we launch rockets. If it's windy, we fly kites.\nView more trainings by Everett Toews at https://www.parleys.com/author/everett-toews-3\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
