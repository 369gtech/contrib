title: 'Adapting ASP.NET Core MVC to your needs - Filip W'
recordingDate: 1553595872
description: "One of the things we - as developers - always hate, is feeling constrained by a framework. Unfortunately, historically, this has been a huge problem for ASP.NET developers. We were forced to do things in a very specific way, in a one-size-fits-all context. This had a number of negative effects - for example poor code reusability or unnatural integration patterns.\nIn this talk, weâ€™ll look at the ASP.NET Core world, and see how it tries to address some of the deficiencies of its predecessor. We'll look at various MVC framework components and its extensibility points. We will explore its flexibility, and how you can bend the framework to your will. We will also look at how to facilitate building reusable features.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndcporto.com"
