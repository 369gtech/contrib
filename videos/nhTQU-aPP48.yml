description: 'Serverless computing is one of the hottest trends in computing right now due to its simplicity and cost efficiency. Oracle recently open sourced a new project that enables developers to run their own Serverless infrastructure anywhere. The platform is container-native, enabling users to write functions in any programming language with excellent support for local development and testing. Fn even allows devs to “bring their own Dockerfile” such that ANY containerized code can be used as a function. This talk will cover the project in detail including a live demo.'
