description: "Speed. It matters in software. Not going fast just for the sake of it. No, it's about learning quickly and delivering insight and capabilities that move you forward. How does event processing make this possible? What role does serverless technology play? In this talk, we will look at event-driven architectures, and how to realize it with a Java-centric solution. This solution collects data from around the world and reveals real-time insights. We will demonstrate using multiple components, including Spring Boot, Event Hubs, Cosmos DB, App Service, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Functions and Spring Cloud Functions. After this talk, attendees will have the knowledge they need to deliver modern, responsive systems.\n\nSpeakers:\nAsir Selvasingh\nPM Architect, Java on Azure, Microsoft\n\nRichard Seroter\nSenior Director of Product, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
