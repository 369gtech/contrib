description: "LISA16 - SRE at a StartUp: Lessons from LinkedIn\n\nCraig Sebenik, Matterport\n\nSRE works at Google. It works at many large companies. But, can it work at a small startup? Over the past two years, Matterport has continued to embrace SRE. (Even though we don't use that exact term). Many of the strategies I have used to move SRE forward I learned while at LinkedIn.\n\nIn this talk, I will give a quick overview of how SRE evolved at LinkedIn and then how I applied those lessons to a startup. Some worked well, others not as much. But, after just a couple of years, we are in a much better position to grow and offer a stable and reliable platform to our customers.\n\nYes, SRE works at Google. But, it can work for small companies as well.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
