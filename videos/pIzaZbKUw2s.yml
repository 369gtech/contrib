description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nMove semantics is one of the most complex topics in the world of C++, including many technical details that often confuse even experts. This interactive back-to-the-basics session is entirely focused on understanding the details behind move semantics. It explains the motivation behind move semantics, the need for rvalue references and std::move, the reason for forwarding references and std::forward, and how to properly apply move semantics. The many interactive questions and exercises will help to quickly adapt the newly gained knowledge.\n— \nKlaus Iglberger\nSiemens\nC++ Trainer/Consultant\nNürnberg Area, Germany\n\nKlaus Iglberger is a freelancing C++ trainer and consultant and is currently on the payroll of Siemens in Nuremberg, Germany.
