title: '"Authorship Environments: In search of the “personal” in personal computing" by Eric Gade'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634581980
description: "What if, instead of thinking of computing as technology for greater efficiency and convenience, we thought of it as a medium approaching that of conventional literacy? What might the environments be like, whom would they serve, and what can we imagine to be the artifacts of that interaction? By exploring big ideas from the last 70 years of computing and attempting to update them for the present, we will examine the implication of these questions in-depth, including potential approaches for thinking about them in the future. Along the way we will present an exploratory effort called Simpletalk, an authoring system built for today’s ubiquitous computing environment: the web.\n\nEric Gade\n\nEric is a historian, writer, and programmer. Along with long-time collaborators Daniel Krasner and Thomas Nyberg, he created Simpletalk while working at the computing research lab at UnitedLex. Previously he served as the Project Manager for Columbia’s Declassification Engine (now History Lab) project. His interests include malleable computing systems like Hypercard and Smalltalk.\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop 2021\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"
