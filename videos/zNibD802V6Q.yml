description: "Video with transcript included: https://bit.ly/3huAGyL\n\nRon Evans talks about TinyGo - a compiler for Go, written in Go itself, that uses LLVM to achieve very small, fast, and concurrent binaries that can also target devices where Go could never go before. The talk includes live coding of devices, RISC-V, WebAssembly, and a drone, to show some of what can be done today using TinyGo.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon London 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq \n\n#TinyGo #GoLanguage #Compilers"
