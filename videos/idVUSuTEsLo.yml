description: "Slides: http://www.quirksmode.org/presentations/Spring2011/mobilism.pdf\n\nCurrently there's a discussion raging about the advantages of the mobile web over native apps, and vice versa. Although native apps will not disappear, they'll gradually grow less important relative to the web.\n\nIn this session we'll take a look at the future of the mobile web, which will involve new ways to pay for content, new ways to distribute web apps, and further integration of web technologies with mobile technologies such as SMS.\n\nAbout Peter-Paul: https://quirksmode.org\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
