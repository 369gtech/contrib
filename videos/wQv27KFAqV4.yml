recordingDate: 1611776290
description: "In January, our #WednesdayStreams return with \"Let's Go Build a Bot\" and your host Dom Davis!\n\nWe'll be exploring the GoLang programming language and using it to build a Chat Bot.\n\n[...]\n\n---\n\n## About your Host\n\nDom Davis is a veteran of The City and a casualty of The Financial Crisis. Not content with bringing the world to its knees he then went off to help break the internet before winding up in Norfolk where he messes about doing development and devops. Dom has been writing code since his childhood sometime in the last millennium â€“ he hopes some day to become good at it.\n\nDom is an enthusiastic and impassioned speaker [read: he gabbles] who uses a blend of irreverent sarcasm and flippant humour to bring complex subjects to a broad audience. Whether or not they understand him is up for debate, but he likes to believe they do.\n\n---\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nYou might want to try something new or wish to take your software development up to the next level. We want to jump into the detail and bring you practical value. We want to make it easy for you to access knowledge, progress and prosper in the highly specialised and valuable field of software engineering.\n\nOur community goes beyond our regular events, we're a thriving support network. Our membership include those that are just starting out, juniors, seniors, and the curious.\n\nRead more at https://www.norfolkdevelopers.com/"
