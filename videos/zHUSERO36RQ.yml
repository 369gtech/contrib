description: "Further information: https://foss-backstage.de/session/managing-conflict-open-source-communities\n\nTechnology communities in general and open source projects in particular frequently suffer from a lack of diversity, with low participation rates by women, people of color, and other marginalized populations who are frequently targets of harassment and abuse.\n\nThis session will talk about the tools and techniques and approaches used by various open source communities to help support and maintain friendly environments for large and diverse groups of contributors from around the world.\n\nWe'll discuss how these communities manage conflicts and the various challenges they've faced while working to help keep their projects welcoming and inclusive places that support positive participation by all."
