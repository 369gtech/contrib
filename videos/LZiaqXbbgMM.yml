description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nLet's face it: You may be able to avoid using sbt to build your Scala projects, but you probably don't want to. It's the de-facto standard for Scala projects and is programmed and configured in Scala itself.\n\nWe'll develop a simple sbt plugin together and explore some of the concepts of an sbt build's architecture. The goal is to help you better automate your builds in a single environment rather than stringing together scripts and tools."
