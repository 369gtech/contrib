description: "Jakub Nabaglo\n\nPython has powerful tools that let our programs inspect and modify themselves. These can be used for good or evil. We study a few of these tools, and some examples of how not to use them.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/what-not-to-do-and-how-to-do-it\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nSun Aug  4 11:50:00 2019 at Cockle Bay"
