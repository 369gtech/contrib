recordingDate: 1574387596
description: "Ever inherited a security rule you were afraid to modify? Ever import a Yara rule only to have the alerts blow up in your face? Does your SEIM or security appliance keep you up at night with email alerts? The Art of Detection focuses on the methodology of writing and sharing accurate detections to make you a better detection author. Gain confidence in managing false positives, learn rule sharing best practices, tackle large monolithic detections, and write detections that feed other detections. Learn the importance of your intelligence test data, and if your intelligence streams could be causing bias.\n\nJay Dimartino is a Threat Researcher for Fidelis Cybersecurity and Head of Detections & Countermeasures. He has been doing Malware Reverse Engineering for over nine years and also has several industry certifications including the GREM and GCFA."
