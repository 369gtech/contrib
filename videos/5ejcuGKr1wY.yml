description: "Learning your 爱比西s: Translating Chinese into Morse code! by Franklin Hu\n\nHow do you translate Chinese into Morse code?\n\nIn the late 1800s, China was connected to the international telegraph network, and this was the big question! Morse code was originally conceived for transmitting English, and while it was extended to support other alphabetic languages, this didn’t work out of the box for character-based languages like Chinese.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll walk through the different encoding schemes used to convert characters to Morse code, their tradeoffs, and how some of the challenges are relevant to us still today!\n\nFranklin writes software for a living and enjoys taking pictures of birds in museums, practicing Danish and Chinese, and shaving yaks (not literally)."
