description: "Ben Rushlo's keynote from the 2014 O'Reilly Velocity conference in Santa Clara, CA, \"Performance in Context - Is 'Good' Good Enough?\"\n\nWatch our interview with Ben Rushlo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmgXHhwGBRU\n\nWhat does a high performing site look like? When we talk about page load time, is that really applicable to modern sites and pages -- that scroll endlessly or lazy load? Is it enough for each business and technology team to look at site performance and decide what is \"good for them\"? Or, shouldn't we be focused on performance calibrated by the circumstances of a customer's engagement with our technology? We'll talk about what tools, approaches, and frameworks can be used to think about site performance in the context of both the customer's expectations, the limitation of metrics available, and the competition.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Keynote Systems.\n\nAbout Ben Rushlo (Keynote Systems Inc.):\nBen Rushlo, Vice President of Analytics, leads a team of web and mobile performance experts working with some of the most recognized brands in the world to improve their site quality.
