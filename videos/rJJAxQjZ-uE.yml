description: "Let's face it: nobody is hired on at a company to actively break stuff.  Still, if youâ€™re supposed to be a 'fixer', you might run into tremendous obstacles while trying to do your job.  It might seem like some people want them to stay broken.  Tales about things that have happened to other people can help you realize that it's not just you, and it's really happening at your gig.  Those tales and others about things that have broken over the years will be told.\n\nSpeaker: Rachel Kroll"
