title: 'Eric Snow - to GIL or not to GIL: the Future of Multi-Core (C)Python - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: Eric Snow\n\nWhy come to yet another talk about CPython's GIL? [1]  Sure, we'll spend a little time on what it is, who it affects (and doesn't), and how to work around it.  However, what you want to come hear is what the future holds for the GIL.\n\nWe'll take most of the time talking about life *after* the GIL!  Come see what recent developments and ongoing work will allow us to either circumvent the GIL and get rid of it, unlocking true multi-core capability in Python code.\n\n[1] In case you don't know, the GIL is a global lock that prevents multi-core parallelism in pure Python code.  It has a controversial place in the community.  Look it up (or come to this talk)!\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
