description: "https://media.ccc.de/v/hd-134-keynote-writing-code-pfft-evolve-it-instead-\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re heading into a future of delivery drones, driverless cars and 3D-printed “hoverboards” …\n\nWith machines now able to perform many tasks better than humans, some people are going to be out of a job.\n\nBut not software developers, right?! Could a computer generate the code you currently write for a living?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll take a look at how technology is changing the work that people do, and think about the implications of that for our society. We'll then take a look at one of the many biologically inspired approaches to AI - Genetic Algorithms, and how they can be used to generate code given a description of the function that that code should perform, rather than having a software developer write it.\n\nSpoiler - you’re probably not out of a job, yet…\n\nEmma Gordon"
