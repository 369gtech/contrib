description: "Advanced Container Concepts for Java Applications - Julian Friedman, IBM\n\nThis talk is a deep dive including everything(-ish) you need to know about how containers interact with Java and JVM applications. From the container memory model (how to avoid getting OOMed!) to advanced JVM flags to take the best advantage of containers to how to set up and customise the java buildpacks available in cloud foundry to how to get the logs and trace from containers after they die and reproduce container issues locally. Come along to get your black belt in containerization for Java apps."
