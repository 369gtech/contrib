description: "Agile, going agile, agile organizations, etc. are terms that we see everywhere already for some time now. No wonder that bigger organizations & projects also wanted to jump on the bandwagon. However, going from running a 5-9 people team to having 100+ people working on the same initiative is not a trivial task. Among the methods of scaling agile practices, SAFe has emerged as the most widespread one. In this session, we are going to get to know SAFe and see what could we learn from it, regardless of the project size you are in.\n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on Fullstack Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n\n#ITmanagement #FullStack #Tech"
