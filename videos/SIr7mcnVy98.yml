description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nIn professional software development, we take for granted that code should be tested. If the topic comes up in conversation and your company doesn't have extensive test suites, it's usually a moment of shame. But from a behavioural economics perspective, if testing is a clear cut win, we'd assume rationally that everyone would have extensive tests. So what is it about testing makes it a socially accepted default but a practically implemented split? And what can this tell us about the way we test code in general? Indeed, what can it tell us about what it means to test code at all? In this talk, we'll test the theory of testing, and look at what testing can look like in a Kotlin world.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nChristina is an Android engineer and GDE at Pinterest, where she works on UI frameworks."
