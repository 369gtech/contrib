description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWhy Do My Logs Suck?! A Practical Guide to Improving Your Logs- Patrick Stephens, Couchbase\n\nFor the cloud-native transformation of Couchbase, we had to do something about our logs. We had various logs scattered around from different language binaries (Java, Erlang, C, etc.) and in different formats with none fit for “human consumption”.\n\nIf you’ve ever started tearing your hair out over differing log formats then this is the talk for you! If you have ever tried to understand what a developer was thinking when adding a log over multiple lines then this is also the talk for you! We include some specific examples of difficult logs and how we solved them with no change to the log itself.\n\nPragmatism was essential:\nWe did not have the resources to refactor every log statement across all these teams/codebases.\nWe needed to support an approach that allowed us to provide an out-of-the box solution but also easy integration with anything already deployed.\nWe had a desire to focus on CNCF or at least open source solutions that are loosely coupled to lower the limits for adoption.\n\nA blog post covering more in-depth examples to support this presentation can be found here."
