title: 'Lambda Jam 2014 - Gershom Bazerman - Homotopy Type Theory: What''s the Big Idea'
language: English
recordingDate: 1410616724
description: "Homotopy Type Theory (http://homotopytypetheory.org/) is a research program that brings together computer science (in the form of dependent type theory), logic, and algebraic topology in a single cohesive way. Its great insight is in systematizing the way in which these fields have all, in some sense been studying the “same” thing. From the standpoint of computer science, it consists of a new “geometric” interpretation of dependent type theory in which we think of types as topological spaces, and also the addition of a single axiom, univalence, which makes the initially confusing claim that “equivalence is equivalent to equality.” The implications of this work will take years before they affect the development of compilers and languages directly. However, the concepts and insights already can help us change the way in which we think about programming, and provide an avenue for programmers familiar with some type theory to discover that in some sense, they “already” knew more about homotopy theory than they imagined.\n\nThis talk will be very high level, spelling out the basic idea of the homotopy interpretation, as well as providing a way to concretely think about univalence in the context of Haskell. It will also spend some time discussing infinity-groupoids, why they are far more straightforward than their name implies, and why they turn out to be so important."
