description: "In this session I will explain how some simple Lean Software Development principles can be used as high level markers to help drive up quality, sustainability, motivation and success in all software projects.\nBased originally on Lean manufacturing processes, Lean software development can help any team re-focus on whats important.\nI will work through the high level principles of Lean software development, explaining how they help and how they can be applied.\nThe goal of this session is to help software developers be able to identify practical ways in which they can improve their software development process.\nIt sounds dry, but its incredibly self-reflective and fun.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
