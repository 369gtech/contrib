description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIntro: CNCF SIG-Runtime - Da Ma, Huawei & Ricardo Aravena, Rakuten \n\nThe CNCF SIG Runtime (https://github.com/cncf/sig-runtime) collaborates to explore how different runtime infrastructure technologies make it possible to run cloud-native workloads. Discussions are about generalized orchestration, autoscaling, scheduling, execution, container runtimes, sandboxing, virtualization, image packaging/distribution, and specialized architectures. Furthermore, technologies and projects, aimed specifically at Edge, IoT, Batch, Big Data, AI/ML, etc. and incorporating specialized computing elements beyond CPUs, including GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, ASICs, etc. In this session, we'll provide an overview of the current cloud-native projects and future technologies that fall within the SIG scope. You'll find out how to get involved and contribute, get to know some of the SIG members, and a showcase of the work thus far. The audience will come away with a basic understanding of the SIG and its place in the CNCF ecosystem. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpAV"
