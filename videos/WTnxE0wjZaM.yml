description: "Back-propagation is fundamental to deep learning. Hinton (the inventor) recently said we should \"throw it all away and start over\". What should we do? I'll describe how back-propagation works, how its used in deep learning, then give 7 interesting research directions that could overtake back-propagation in the near term. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/7_Research_Directions_Deep_Learning\n\nPlease Subscribe!
