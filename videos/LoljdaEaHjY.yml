title: 'This Week in Cloud Native: Demystifying Kubernetes Network Policy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614805923
description: 'Implementing Network Policy is a critical part of building a secure Kubernetes-based platform, but the learning curve from very basic examples to more complex real-world policies is steep. Not only can it be painful to get the YAML syntax and formatting just right, but there are many subtleties in the behavior of the network policy specification (e.g. default allow/deny, namespacing, wildcarding, rules combination, etc.). Even an experienced Kubernetes YAML-wrangler can still easily tie their brain in knots working through an advanced network policy use case. In this livestream, Thomas Graf will go over everything from the basics of Kubernetes Network Policy to more advanced concepts. He will walk us step by step from setting up simple policies to tackling trickier questions such as spotting and avoiding conflicting rules, looking at common mistakes, and examining some advanced real world policy examples similar to those implemented by major Kubernetes users.'
