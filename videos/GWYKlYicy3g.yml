In order to be able to answer this question properly, you first need to know your options.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore different career opportunities that see you either progressing as an Individual Contributor, or transitioning into people/tech management. You will learn to understand whether your current company can support your growth plans, or how to find (or create!) a more suitable one.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/droidcon-italy\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
