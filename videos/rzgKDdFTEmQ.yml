description: "Migrating Internet Archive to Kubernetes - Tracey Jaquith & David Van Duzer, Internet Archive \n\nThe Internet Archive has been on a mission to provide universal access to all knowledge for 22 years. While it continues to preserve the history of the web, the Archive must keep its infrastructure aligned with the present and future of the web. Tracey and David will review the Kubernetes migration: the 600,000 line PHP monolith powering core library operations, as well as a wide variety of auxiliary services (like web crawling) supported by many development teams. They will cover deploying Kubernetes at progressively larger scales in the Archive's own data centers, and integrating existing developer workflows with GitLab, Auto DevOps, Helm and Prometheus.  Tracey Jaquith has architected much of Internet Archive since 1996 (starting with founder Brewster Kahle) and focuses on DevOps, TV, audio/video, and AR/VR.  David Van Duzer manages web-wide crawl operations at Internet Archive. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrSG"
