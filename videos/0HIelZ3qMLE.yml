description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nHow to Use Kubernetes to Build a Data Lake for AI Workloads - Peter MacKinnon & Uday Boppana, Red Hat \n\nThe recent popularity of hybrid cloud architectures have left organizations with traditional data lakes behind. How do you build a data architecture that is cloud provider agnostic and is flexible enough to run in across public and private cloud data centers? How do you make this data available to data scientists and developers in a way that simplifies the creation of intelligent applications?  This talk will walk through a new way of building data lakes for the hybrid cloud using Rook and Ceph community projects running on Kubernetes. With a single data architecture deployment that can run in any cloud or across multiple clouds, IT and data engineers can use open source tools on Kubernetes such as Rook, Ceph, Hive metastore, Spark, and Presto to provide unified access to massive amounts of data across multiple data centers for data scientists and developers.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zenj"
