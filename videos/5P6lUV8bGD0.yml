description: "I will discuss the basic concepts of data workflows as well as practical use cases using python and Apache-Airflow.\n\nCurrently, work in the operations department of the Army Medical Department focused on improving operational efficiencies, marketing spends and retention of our workforce. Previousely I was a Reconisince Specialist deployed to various war zones around the world. During that time I gained a love and appreciation for how data and artificial intelligence can help solve complex problems. I enjoy working with text and image data to better understand how computers can leverage large amounts of data and compute to provide meaningful insights at scale.\n\nslides: https://github.com/indypy/IndyPy-Presentations/tree/master/2019/IndyPy%20Confs/10%20-%20October%20-%20PyData%20Indy%202019/10%20-%20October-%20Luther%20Hill%20-%20Use%20Apache%20-%20Airflow%20to%20Build%20Data%20Workflows\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
