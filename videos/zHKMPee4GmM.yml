description: "The challenges of managing many, smaller deployable services mean that what we need in terms of deployment platforms are very different to what was needed before. But few areas of software technology have been experiencing as much innovation and churn as the deployment options available for microservice architectures. From appication containers, to docker, to mesos and beyond, this talk will break apart the myriad challenges that can come from managing microservices at scale, and how to pick the right technologies for you.\n\nI’ve been working at ThoughtWorks for over a decade. I split my time between consulting for clients, speaking at conferences and helping build our own internal systems.\n\nMy book, Building Microservices, was published by O’Reilly earlier this year.\n\n\nFor more on YOW!
