Web Development has only grown in complexity from it's humble days of serving documents. Today, Modern Web Applications are quite complex. And if you don't want to build it in Javascript, you typically have to use two languages, One for the front end and the other for the backend.  \n\nSAFE Stack provides an alternative allowing you to build the entire application in F# with superb type safety and still keep the flexibility of a scripting language like Python.  \n\nIn my talk, I will show you how to get started building a web application using Safe Stack.\n\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/LambdaDays\n\n  LinkedIn: ttps://www.linkedin.com/company/lambda-days\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Lambda Days conference!\n  See what's coming up at: https://www.lambdadays.org\n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
