description: "In this video, we first go through the code for a simple handwritten character classifier in Python, then visualize it in Tensorboard. The point of this video was to showcase Tensorboard as a data visualization tool. We also use a more complex handwritten character classifier to further showcase all of Tensorboard's features. This was the hardest video I've ever had to make in terms of timing. It was really difficult to fit this many TB features into this time frame. \n\nThe code for this video is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Tensorboard_demo\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nChallenge: \n\nThe challenge for this video is to visualize some audio data in Tensorboard. To date, I haven't seen any repos on GitHub that do this. The audio feature seems relatively new in Tensorboard. The first person who does this and posts it in the comments by Sept 30 2016 gets a shoutout from me in my video release on that date!\n\nTensorboard tutorial:\n\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html\n\nAnother good TB tutorial:\n\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/how_tos/graph_viz/index.html\n\nAn unofficial tutorial:\n\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/hunkim/tensor-board\n\nA video i found on tensorboard:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp5EtBvwQbw\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos and if you've found any of them useful I'd love your support on Patreon:\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=3191693\n\nMuch more to come so please SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, and COMMENT! :)\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
