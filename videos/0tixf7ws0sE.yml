description: "We will be live demo’ing, the Istio Service Mesh on top of Kubernetes/OpenShift. Key use cases include easy distributed tracing via Jaeger, clever canary deployment scenarios, circuit breakers, network chaos injection and the beauty of the dark launch. How do you achieve the velocity of many deploys per day? Small batch sizes, well-architected Java apps and the capabilities of a service mesh, taking your Linux container, Kubernetes & microservice capabilities to the next level. In this session, you will witness several of the new superpowers of Istio on Kubernetes and OpenShift. Things like distributed tracing (Jaeger) and metrics, clever canary deployments, chaos injection, circuit breakers and the dark launch.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
