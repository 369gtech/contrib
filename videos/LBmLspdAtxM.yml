While it may be stylish to use subtle, low contrast colors in our designs, we should also avoid going too far and creating an experience that's difficult to read. It's a best practice to look over the colors you've used in your site and see if they meet recommended contrast minimums. Today on a11ycasts we'll cover some of the tools to help you identify possible problem areas and explain how you can tune them up so they're more distinct on the page.\n\nWatch all A11ycasts episodes: https://goo.gl/06qEUW\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers YouTube channel for updates on new episodes of A11ycasts: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
