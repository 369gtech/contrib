title: '#HITBGSEC D1: Advanced Mutation Fuzzing Method For Wireless Protocols - Lidong Li and Xianzi Kong'
language: English
recordingDate: 1569831684
description: "Many open source fuzzers for wireless that were already published are no longer sufficient to find new bugs. We have built a new fuzzer which allows us to find IoT wireless vulnerabilities and also use it in the search for car wireless module vulnerabilities. In this talk, we will cover:\n\n1.) Basics of wireless fuzzing technology and introduce the shortcomings of the common fuzzer programming library bugs we have found. We will also conduct code audits for open source fuzzers to show you how a traditional fuzzer works.\n\n2.) We will introduce our new fuzzer and how to quickly and effectively construct a fuzzing case and how to track the crash. Most importantly, we will explain how to perform Smart Mutation on the payload (fuzzing case) to make the payload more powerful! In terms of wireless fuzzing, we will analyze the three states of AP, client and WPA. We have prepared four video demos which will cover:\n\n    Attacks on mobile devices (smart phone wireless interface-WPA_supplicant component vulnerability)\n    Mediatek wifi chip remote kernel crash（Affects more than 100 models of routers and smart devices）and automotive (IVI) wireless modules as well\n    A classic Windows remote kernel overflow due to wireless network card driver vulnerability\n\n===\n\nLidong Li is a Communication protocol security research team Leader at Intelligent Connected Vehicle Cyber Security Attack&Defense Laboratory of China Automotive Technology & Research Center. Co., Ltd. His research work include wireless protocol analysis ,vulnerability discovery.; as well as study of fuzz mutation strategy， And responsible for the development of the wireless fuzzy framework of WIFI, Bluetooth and BLE protocol. He discovered and reported vulnerabilities such as Mediatek Wifi drivers, Qihoo IoT devices and many routers, as well as automotive wireless modules. He once showed his research results at the POC2018 hacking conference in Korea.\n\n--- \n\nXianzi Kong is a Security engineer at Intelligent Connected Vehicle Cyber Security Attack&Defense Laboratory of China Automotive Technology & Research Center. Co., Ltd. His research work include wireless security and Algorithm decryption and encryption，He discovered and reported the wireless vulnerability of geek router and MTK; he was also a CTFer and achieved good results in some competitions."
