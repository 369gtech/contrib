description: "This presentation will cover the 3 main areas of focus in the upcoming version 2.1 of JAX-RS. We shall start with an overview of the existing asynchronous processing support that should lead us to a better understanding of the need for Reactive programming. In particular, we shall discuss support for CompletionStage from JDK 8 as well as learn about an extension point to enable third-party libraries such as RxJava to be used together with JAX-RS. We would also introduce a new client/server API for Server-Sent Events that borrows certain concepts from Flows in JDK 9. Finally, we shall review a proposal to support Non-Blocking I/O in JAX-RS.\n\nDr. Santiago Pericas-Geertsen is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Sun Glassfish organization at Oracle. He is an architect and technical lead in the Avatar project at Oracle. Within the JCP program, Santiago is a Spec Lead for JSR 339, JAX-RS 2.0: The Java API for RESTful Web Services. While at Sun Microsystems, Santiago was a tech lead for the Glassfish Mobility Platform, a developer and lead in the Fast Web Services project, and a participant, and editor, in World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) initiatives including the XML Binary Characterization working group (WG) and the W3C Efficient XML Interchange WG."
