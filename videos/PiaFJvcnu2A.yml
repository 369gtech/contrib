description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nBrings Federated Learning to Kubeflow With FATE-Operator - Layne Peng & Jiahao Chen, VMware \n\nFederated Machine Learning (FML) is a one of the most promising machine learning technologies to solve data silos and strengthening of data privacy and security, which allows collaborating organizations to create models without leaking data privacy. FATE is an open source project providing a secure MPC framework to support FML architecture. The challenge of FML is how to coordinate different parties usually reside in different geographical location.    This talk will introduce how we do FML in Kubernetes by Kubeflow. The flexibility and scalability of Kubernetes helps a lot on customizing our platform requirements to fit FML. A FATE-Operator is designed to run FML jobs on Kubernetes, which fit FML into existed Kubeflow ecosystem.     In this session, audience will learning:  1. What is FML?   2. How to design a Kubernetes Operator;  3. The experience of running FML in Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp8Z"
