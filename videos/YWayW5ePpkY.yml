The work from ranges gives us three broad things in C++20: redefined algorithms, concepts to assist in these algorithm definitions, and a handful of range adaptors, which are an abstraction over iterators for convenient program composition.\n\nAs Alex Stepanov and Sean Parent have said, the algorithms from the STL are only a sample of the algorithms that exist, and you're able to write your own. Range adaptors are no different: just because the adaptor you need isn't in C++20, doesn't mean that you can't write (or propose) it.\n\nUsing custom range adaptors can help you express your intentions in a much clearer manner. We'll spend some time implementing a range adaptor that isn't in the pipeline for C++20, starting from a motivating use-case, then move to how we implement the range adaptor -- including design considerations -- and finally, we'll write up a few tests to wrap everything up.\n— \nChristopher Di Bella\nCodeplay Software\nStaff Software Engineer\nEdinburgh, UK\n\nChristopher Di Bella is a Staff Software Engineer for Codeplay’s ComputeCpp Runtime Technology.
