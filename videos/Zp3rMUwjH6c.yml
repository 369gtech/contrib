description: "Titel: Stop Juggling with Secrets. HashiCorp Vault for Secret Management\n\nDevelopers, Admins, and DevOps regularly face the same problems: \"Where can I store a secret in a secure way? How can I share it with others? How can I provision it to an application or another system? How can I revoke provided access or rotate secrets?\"\n \nHashiCorp Vault has received a lot of attention as a product for Secret Mangement. Over the last years we've built up our own Kubernetes Cluster in the cloud at DB Schenker. It hosts our migrated applications and newly developed \"microservices\" as well. Now we are aiming to add Vault as another key component to our core platform and establish it as a solution for our global Software Delivery Unit.\n\nIn this talk, we will outline the usual problems of managing secrets and why HashiCorp Vault provides a good solution with its core concepts. We will look at some authentication features for securely accessing secrets and we will play with examples of daily secret management tasks (demo). You will get an idea of how to\n- Manage secrets for applications / microservices / systems\n- Manage database access for applications / microservices, and users with password rotation\n- Manage secrets for provisioning of infrastructure using Ansible & Terraform\n- Enable audits of secret access and modification\n\nSpeaker: Thomas Störmer - Schenker AG - Solution Architect\n\nThomas Störmer is Solution Architect at Schenker AG and works in cloud projects for the development of new applications or the migration of existing applications. In addition, he participates in the development of enhancements to the internal AWS cloud infrastructure based on Kubernetes.\n\nSpeaker: Tilman Göhnert - Schenker AG - DevOps Specialist\n\nTilman Göhnert is a DevOps Specialist at Schenker AG. He works on Kubernetes based cloud environments and on supporting applications in using it."
