title: 'Reflections around SW obsolescence - Andreas Bredesen'
recordingDate: 1537872525
description: "The speed of developing SW and HW is continuously increasing. Continues Integration(CI) and Continues Delivery(CD) aims to help teams deliver products and functionality, with precision and predictability, at a tremendous speed. Cloud based solutions can offer new functionality and bug fixes several times a day.\nSW development for physical products, like missiles, has a different nature than developing for cloud. A typical Missile program can last a decade. During this period new operating systems has emerged, the toolchain might have been updated with new versions and new tools. HW obsolescence might lead to replacement of components that require new tools running on a different operating system to work. \n\nI will mention SW product lifecycle, security, modularization and componentization, Model based Systems Engineering (MBSE) / Digital Twin, Integrated Development environments and more.\n\nMy talk will be reflections around these topics and some thoughts around possible ways to address them. \n\nI would really like to hear your thoughts after the talk.SW development for physical products, like missiles, has a different nature than developing for cloud.
