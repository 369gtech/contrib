description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl)\n26th of September 2014\n\nRob Ashton - \"React + NPM for Great Good\" \n\n\"Frameworkless development with NPM is great - but patching together odd templating libraries and managing the DOM can end up causing performance issues if the team is not careful to batch updates across components. That's where React comes in - utilizing React as a view engine within a typical framework-less set-up can result in cheap performance gains and a sensible data management strategy throughout the app without any of that horrific two-way data binding found in other systems.\n\nSee now as Rob covers how he uses React within a typical application set-up, build tools, common patterns, common modules and patterns for easy wins for the entire team.\""
