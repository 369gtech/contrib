description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nNOTE: this project has been renamed Spring Cloud Connectors and is part of the larger spring cloud umbrella project.\nhttp://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/\n\nSpeaker: Scott Frederick, Ramnivas Laddad\nDeveloping for the Cloud Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/simplify-cloud-applicationsusingspringcloud\nDeveloping an application to a cloud platform involves working with deployed application's environment and connecting to services. Spring Cloud, a new project, simplifies these tasks in a variety of cloud platforms including Cloud Foundry and Heroku. Spring Cloud makes it possible to deploy the same artifact (a war or a jar) to multiple cloud environments. It supports multiple clouds through the concept of Cloud Connector and provides out of the box implementation for Cloud Foundry and Heroku. Spring Cloud is designed for extension, making it simple to create a cloud connector for other cloud platforms. Spring Cloud also supports connecting to multiple services through the concept of service connectors. Out of the box, it provides support for many common services, but also makes it easy to extend it to other services. While Spring Cloud can be used by applications using any JVM language and framework, it further simplifies Spring applications through Java and XML-based configuration. In this talk, we will introduce the Spring Cloud project, show how you can simplify configuring applications for cloud deployment, discuss its extensibility mechanism, and put it to good use by showing practical examples from the field."
