description: "The Road to Chaos\n\nNora Jones, Jet.com\n\nChaos Engineering is described as “the discipline of experimenting on a distributed system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.” \n\nIn this presentation I'll go into why we got started with Chaos Engineering, how we built it with a functional programming language, and the road to cultural acceptance. Surprisingly enough, social acceptance proved to be more difficult than actual implementation. There are several different \"levels\" of chaos that I recommend introducing before unleashing a full-blown chaos solution. I will go over each of the levels, evaluate how the chaos tool has influenced the process, and leave you with a game plan of how you can culturally and technically introduce fault injection in your organization.\n\nView the SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
