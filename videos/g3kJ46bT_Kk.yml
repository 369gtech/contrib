description: "A Google TechTalk, 2018-09-20 and 21, presented by Josh Lowe\nABSTRACT: An overview of EduBlocks (https://edublocks.org/), why it was built, and how it is used around the world.\n\nAbout the speaker: My name is Josh (@all_about_code) and I am a 14-year-old coder, passionate about sharing my skills with others. I am the creator of EduBlocks, a drag and drop version of Python 3 which allows students to learn the Python syntax with minimal errors, thus allowing younger children to access Python. This software is now being used in 95+ different countries around the world by students and teachers alike and has recently included a micro:bit editor. I deliver numerous workshops around the country sharing my passion for coding to people of all ages, including CPD sessions for teachers. In 2017 I was awarded a John Pinner Award at PyCon UK for my contribution to the coding community. This year I spoke at and ran workshops at MiXiT in Lyon as well as giving a Keynote to the Education Summit at PyCon USA. I am also proud to be a pi-top futureCHAMPION.\""
