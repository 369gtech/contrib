Apache Spark is a popular framework for data analytics. Its capabilities in the streaming domain are represented by two APIs: The low-level Spark Streaming and the more declarative Structured Streaming, which builds upon the recent advances in Spark SQL query optimization and code generation.\n\nAfter a quick introduction to both APIs, we will discuss their virtues, capabilities and key differences:\n\nHow to get started: ease of development.\nHow to deal with time: both at the processing and event level\nHow to deal with state: locally, distributed and its relation with time\nHow to migrate: functional coding strategies\nHow to do ML: machine learning capabilities\nUsing practical examples from actual applications, we will provide guidance on how to choose one or even combine both APIs to implement functional and resilient streaming pipelines.\n\nGerard Maas \nFrom Lightbend\nGerard Maas is a senior software engineer at Lightbend, where he contributes to the Fast Data Platform and focuses on the integration of stream processing technologies. Previously, he held leading roles at several startups and large enterprises, building data science governance, cloud-native IoT platforms, and scalable APIs. He is the coauthor of Stream Processing with Apache Spark from Oâ€™Reilly. Gerard is a frequent speaker and contributes to small and large open source projects. In his free time, he tinkers with drones and builds personal IoT projects."
