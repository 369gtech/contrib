recordingDate: 1526415130
description: "In this ver. @csell5 talks to @dahlbys about code and kids. We explore the current state of computer science in schools, the effects of code.org and just riff about kids.\n\nSamantha Dahlby is a recovering software engineer with passions for public transportation, kids, and STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math). She currently works at the New Bohemian Innovation Collaborative (NewBoCo), a nonprofit in Cedar Rapids, as the K-12 Education Coordinator. Samantha has two young daughters, and has learned to enjoy watching them tear apart *most* things in the name of curiosity. \n\nFind Samantha at:\n* https://twitter.com/dahlbys \n* https://newbo.co"
