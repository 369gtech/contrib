description: "Better Together - Kevin Rutten & J. Austin Hughey, Stark & Wayne\n\nYou donâ€™t have to toss out what works, you can take baby steps. We are going to talk about moving from Cloud Foundry to Cloud Foundry... ON Kubernetes! Yes! Keep the `cf push` workflow while leveraging the K8s ecosystem. Give your developers a choice (and time) to figure out what works best for them. In 2019, Dr Max and Dr Nic looked at CF vs Knative, in 2021 Kevin and J Austin Hughey will look at some of the other projects (like KubeCF, cf4k8s, Redhat Source2Image, and Epinio.io) and see how they compare.\n\nTo learn more about Cloud Foundry, The Proven Developer Experience For Kubernetes click here: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
