description: "Developing software is a risky endeavor full of unknowns. Is the product viable? Is it desirable? Is it feasible? How can we answer these questions without taking months or years to get something shipped? Enter the Balanced Team and the magic of interdisciplinary work. While developers, designers, and product managers can do great work alone, magic happens when these roles work together to break through constraints–or innovate around them.\n\nBecki Hyde, a Practice Lead on Pivotal's Agile Practice Leadership Enablement team, will share stories of how Balanced Teams deliver human-centered software in a world of ambiguity. From her experience as a practitioner and consultant, she’ll provide insights into how Balanced Teams work in practice, and the benefits of intentionally working at the intersection of roles.\n\nSpeaker: Becki Hyde, Practice Lead, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/making-magic-with-balanced-teams"
