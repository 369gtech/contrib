description: "Many developers have struggled with the burden of designing, building, and running large complex software systems, swearing that – next time, they’ll do it right. And yet, even with all the alternative frameworks, patterns, and cloud services that have become available over the years, even new systems can’t seem to escape their big ball of mud fate.\n\nBut, there is another option available – just as challenging, but with a much brighter future. Organizations that can transform their technology, teams, management, and business will be the ones that own that future. While there’s no “cookie-cutter” approach to this transformation, Udi has some do’s and don’ts that will keep you from going astray."
