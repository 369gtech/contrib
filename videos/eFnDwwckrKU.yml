This talk will go through how providers are utilizing virtual-kubelet to extend Kubernetes either for their customers, or for the benefit of their platform. The talk will also go through how Netflix is using virtual-kubelet to aid in integration with their existing architecture. Virtual-kubelet is able to give them the best of both worlds. Netflix has been able to leverage the Kubernetes API Server and the controllers as a mechanism to accelerate their control plane, whilst being able to use their existing containerization and isolation technology that’s been in development under the guise of the Titus (https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/the-evolution-of-container-usage-at-netflix-3abfc096781b) project since December 2015. The flexibility of the project, has allowed them to introduce new southbound, and northbound concepts to their product, which is enabling greater efficiency, and scalability. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uai8"
