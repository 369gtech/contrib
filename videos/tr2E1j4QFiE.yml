description: "Join https://micro.sphere.it/ - free online sessions for tech-enthusiasts\n\nAbstract:\nAs developers, we all want to be more productive. Serverless helps you do just that, by letting you focus on the business logic while shifting operations somewhere else. As more companies discover this emerging technology, we also discover drawbacks like state management. In this session, we’ll focus on what serverless is, how it helps developers, what potential drawbacks exist, and how we can add state management into serverless.\n\nBio:\nLeon Stigter is a Sr. Product Manager for Serverless at Lightbend, Leon’s focus is to help developers accelerate their serverless journey, leveraging both open source and commercial tools. He is very passionate and outspoken when it comes to the needs of developers because he believes developers can (help) transform their business by getting the right pieces of information to the right people at the right time in the right context."
