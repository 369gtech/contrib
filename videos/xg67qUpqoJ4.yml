description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nA Java Implementer's Guide to Better Apache Spark Performance\n\nApache Spark has rocked the big data landscape, becoming the largest open source big data community with over 750 contributors from more than 200 organizations. Spark's core tenants of speed, ease of use, and its unified programming model fit neatly with the high performance, scalable, and manageable characteristics of modern Java runtimes. In this talk we introduce the Spark programming model, and describe some of our unique Java 8 capabilities in the JIT, fast networking, serialization techniques, and GPU off-loading that deliver the ultimate big data platform for solving business problems. We will demonstrate how solutions, previously infeasible with regular Java programming, become possible with our high performance Spark core runtime, enabling you to solve problems smarter and faster.\n\nTim Ellison, IBM UK Ltd\n\nTim Ellison is currently a Senior Technical Staff Member with IBM's Java Technology Centre in the UK.
