description: "Making Every SRE Hire Count\n\nChris Stankaitis, The Pythian Group\n\nOur industry is changing rapidly to keep up with the demands of the business. This means that many of the tools, processes, and techniques that were perfectly valid only a few years ago are now antiquated and no longer meet our needs. The hiring process is not immune to this shift, and finding the right people to fill a 21st century SRE position is challenging.\n\nFrom designing and grading technical tests, to participating in technical interviewing / hiring manager \"FIT\" interviewing, making great people decisions is critical to the success of an SRE team and the pressure to get it right is high.\n\nWe will look at the process, how it has changed, and how we have had to evolve to find the people we are looking for.\n\nView the full SREcon15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon15/program"
