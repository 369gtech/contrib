description: "Hey all, so far we've looked at two data types in JavaScript - Boolean types (true or false) and number types. In this tutorial I want to talk about a third data type - strings. Strings are essentially a string of characters, be them numbers to make a phone number, or letters to make a word or phrase, or even a combo of both.\n\nStrings have a lot of methods (built in functions) you can call on them, and we'll look at a few of them in this tutorial too.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions, just fire away :).\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== JavaScript for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i9Ae2D9Ee1RvylH38dKuET\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n\n========== HTML for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
