description: "Thomas Kotzmann, Claudia  Ciorascu\n\nMore and more of consumers research online first before going to a local store to purchase a product and we can expect this trend to continue to rise. How can merchants and retailers take advantage of this trend? Local shopping enables merchants to declare product price and availability per local store. In this session, we will show you how to set up and manage local shopping accounts in the Google Merchant Center and how to use the Content API to upload local products and do live inventory updates.\n\nFor all I/O 2012 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/io/"
