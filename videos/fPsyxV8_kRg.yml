description: "by Tom Deseyn\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.201/dotnet_netcore_dbus.webm\n\n\nAccessing D-Bus services from .NET. D-Bus provides a bus for accessing system and desktop services. \n\nIn this talk we'll use Tmds.DBus to access those services from .NET Core. \n\nTmds.DBus is a fork of dbus-sharp, updated with asynchronous programming patterns introduced in .NET 4.5. \n\nThe library comes with a cli tool that generates a strongly-typed representation of a D-Bus service. \n\nWe'll build a small example application that consumes a D-Bus service. \n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:45:00+01"
