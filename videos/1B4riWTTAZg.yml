description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nTiKV: A Cloud Native Key-Value Database - Dongxu Huang & Nick Cameron, PingCAP \n\nTiKV is a distributed Key-Value database that features in geo-replication, horizontal scalability, consistent distributed transactions, and coprocessor support. As a CNCF incubating project, TiKV has been widely used in production by over 500 companies. An adopter has even stored over 1.3 trillion rows of in TiKV.  In this talk, Dongxu Huang and Nick Cameron will share the story of how they built TiKV from scratch, including how they decided the technical solutions, how they interacted with other CNCF projects, and also how to apply Chaos Engineering on TiKV to guarantee system safety and robustness. In the end, Dongxu Huang and Nick Cameron will show the approach to a self-driving database in TiKV 4.0, which leverages Kubernetes to make TiKV more elastic and scalable.\n\nhttps://sched.co/a3vq"
