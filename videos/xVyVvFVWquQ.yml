description: "MobileOptimized 2020, Online â€“ November 6-7, 2020\n\nFull Stack Swift with Arduino, Alex Roest\n\nThis talk will present a new way to interface sensors to the embedded Arduino platform using the Swift for Arduino IDE, then collect the data on a Raspberry-Pi and finally present it using Vapor, a server-side-swift framework.\nHence a complete iot solution, fully in swift!\n\nMicrocontrollers are traditionally programmed in C or C++. A new application, \"Swift for Arduino\" allows Atmel/Arduino controllers to be written using swift.\nTogether with a database inject and API in Vapor Server Side Swift on a raspberry-pi and an iOS app written in SwiftUI we have a full iot chain fully written in swift.\nThe use case is a plant watering app, with sensors measuring the temperature and moistness of the earth."
