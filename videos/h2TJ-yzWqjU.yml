description: "What does a grass-roots generated internship look like in a company dedicated to open source and contribution? Phase2 welcomed thirteen interns to our BuilDesign internship program this year: developers, designers, and the blossoming skills of product management, sales, and project management. For fourteen weeks, they learned together from our best talent, and the results were transformational. We believe in investing in junior talent because:\n\nAs members of the open source community, we believe in contributing to the people who will form the fabric of our industry.\nThe process gives us keen insight into the next generation of tech talent and how to find the best of them early.\nFinding talent in the wide variety of agency roles is hard: this helps us identify and guide those aptitudes early on.\nThe infusion of new ideas, fresh energy, passion, mentorship, and teaching is immeasurably valuable to our culture - as a company and as an open source community.\nDrupal is ideal for the basis of internship learning not because it is easy, but because it is vast and full-featured. To learn to build and develop in Drupal requires understanding and use of languages like PHP, CSS, and Javascript but also technologies at every step of the “webstack”: hosting, version control, deployment, caching, testing. Drupal’s community is also vital for new developers by offering guidance, support, and real humans to interact with while learning such a massive framework.\n\nAttendees of this session will learn from the program founders:\n\nThe business case for junior talent development to your company (and how to pitch it)\nHow to find and identify the best, most diverse junior talent\nOur proven playbook for curriculum development\nThe benefits to your existing staff: developing a culture of mentorship\nHow to start small and plan big for junior talent development"
