title: 'James Kennedy - Deploy a Serverless Language Model API (Abstractions II Raw Cuts)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1575916036
description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\n\nThis session will serve as an introduction to using GCP's Cloud Run as a service to deploy and host a serverless machine learning prediction API. Pythonâ€™s FastAI libraries will be used for natural language processing predictions which will be easily triggered using HTTPS requests. During a live demonstration, Docker images will be built to contain multiple exported models. Then the serverless application will be deployed based on this image. Prediction requests will then be made using Postman. Additional topics will include transfer learning and alternative natural language services. By seeing the workflow first hand, attendees will be able to build upon this example to deploy their own serverless applications and cost-effectively host custom trained machine learning models.\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#Deploy%20a%20Serverless%20Language%20Model%20API%20-James%20Kennedy"
