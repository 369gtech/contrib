description: "Speaker:   Yong Jun (Github:  @yongjun21)\r\n\r\nDescription:  Advent Of Code (AOC) is a series of small programming puzzles released released one per day over the Christmas period. I was introduced to AOC this year in 2017 and and was immediately hooked. I decided to challenged myself to complete not just this year's AOC but the two previous years all at one go. After spending 25 days of Christmas in programming hell, I emerged a true JavaScript Jedi. This talk shares my learning from this experience and tips for fellow JavaScript Jedi (and Ninja) to acing their next technical interview.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/245149764/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/eHXQ/"
