title: 'Rob Ashton - Zero Support in Production @ DevConf 2018'
recordingDate: 1539019344
description: "For the last several years, I have been working in a very small team, both building and deploying/supporting bespoke products that power upwards of half a million live video events a year, as well as forming the backbone of various television services across the UK. For some of our customers, it has been half a decade since we received a support call and indeed it is a virtual non-happening that anybody has to get out of bed to solve a problem in production. A lot of this results directly from our use of Erlang+OTP, and there are then wider patterns that have arisen across our code-bases and even the manner in which we provide support to our clients. \n\nIn this session, we will be using examples from our real-world projects to demonstrate how we build, deploy, and then support hundreds of services and hundreds of thousand of events a year in across both the cloud and our on-premise as well as also covering how our software stack ensures that on a bad day, our services carry on delivering content even when servers are catching fire or somebody has spilled coffee on the datacentre power supply.\n\nDevConf 2018 (http://devconf.pl)\n26-28 September 2018"
