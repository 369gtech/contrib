description: "Oracle DevOps service is a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform for developers to automate their software development lifecycle. The DevOps service includes deployment pipelines to automate software delivery and deployment to a range of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) environments.\n\nThe video demonstrates how easily and reliably we can deploy and manage Oracle Cloud resources with Terraform. It also showcases how we can leverage the OCI DevOps platform to configure the build pipeline, deploy a NodeJS application on the Kubernetes cluster and use API Gateway and Oracle Functions to send out emails using the Oracle Email Delivery Service.\n\n#oracle #cloud #oci"
