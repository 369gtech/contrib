Do you get large numbers of false positives, and wish you had fewer useless messages cluttering up your inbox? What if there were a better way to monitor your Rails applications that resulted in far more signal â€” and much less noise?\n\nIn this talk, we'll share an approach that's effective at measuring and monitoring distributed applications and systems. Through the application of a few simple core principles and a little bit of mathematical elbow grease, firms we've tried this with have seen significant results. By the end, you'll have the tools to ensure your applications will be healthier, more observable, and a lot less work to monitor."
