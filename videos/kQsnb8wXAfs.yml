title: 'Getting the Most from Modern Java by Simon Ritter'
recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "With the release of JDK 15, we have had seven (yes seven!) versions of Java in three years. Java developers are now being provided with new features at a faster pace than at any time in its 25-year history.\n\nWe still hear claims that Java is the new COBOL, and its popularity is in decline. The reality, however, is that Java developers are now being provided with new features at a faster pace than at any time in its 25-year history.\n\nIn this session, we’ll explore in detail what these changes are and how best to use them (as well as advice on when not to use them). We’ll also explain the significance of preview features and incubator modules.\n\nWe’ll cover the following new language features: · Local variable type inference (JDK 10) · Switch expressions (JDK 12) · Text blocks (JDK 13) · Records (JDK 14) · Pattern matching for instanceof (JDK 14) · Sealed classes and changes to Records (JDK 15)\n\nFor each of these JDKs, we’ll also highlight the most useful additions to the core class libraries. At the end of this session, you’ll be all set to write modern Java code!\n\nSimon Ritter, Azul Systems\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
