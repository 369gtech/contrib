description: "\"Writing a Python autoreloader\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Shanghai]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Tom Forbes\n\nReloading your code changes quickly is an integral part of the development experience in frameworks like Django and Flask that developers have come to rely on. But how do they work under the hood and what challenges do you face while writing one?\n\nIn this talk I will explore how I refactored the autoreload implementation in Django 2.2 and the lessons I learned along the way (hint: it's surprisingly complex!). I will also be introducing a library I've developed to simplify this if you ever find yourself writing your own.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
