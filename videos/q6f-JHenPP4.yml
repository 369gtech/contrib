title: 'YOW! Nights July 2013 Sam Newman - From Macro To Micro - How Big Should Your Services Be?'
recordingDate: 1380376037
description: "Lots of people are talking about Micro Services. But how micro is micro? And while we're at it, what is a micro service anyway? This session will briefly introduce the concept of microservices, and why they are important. But then we'll focus on the tough questions. If you're starting with a big, monolithic system, how should you split it up? When are microservices right for you? This talk looks at the competing forces from Conways Law to Operations, which can help you make the right decisions about service granularity and just how 'micro' you should go.\n\nSam Newman is a technical consultant at ThoughtWorks, where he has been for over nine years. He has worked with a variety of companies in multiple domains in the UK, Australia and the US. If you asked him what he does, he'd say 'I work with people to build better software systems'.\n\nHe has written articles of O'Reilly, presented at conferences, and sporadically commits to open source projects. While Java used to be his bread and butter, he also spends lots of time with Ruby, Python, Javascript, and Clojure, Infrastructure Automation and Cloud systems.\n\nFor more on YOW!
