description: "Most of the datasets you'll find will have more than 3 dimensions. How are you supposed to understand visualize n-dimensional data? Enter dimensionality reduction techniques. We'll go over the the math behind the most popular such technique called Principal Component Analysis.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Dimensionality_Reduction\n\nOng's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/jrios6/Math-of-Intelligence/tree/master/4-Self-Organizing-Maps\n\nHammad's Runner up Code:\nhttps://github.com/hammadshaikhha/Math-of-Machine-Learning-Course-by-Siraj/tree/master/Self%20Organizing%20Maps%20for%20Data%20Visualization\n\nPlease Subscribe!
