description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nThe State of Serverless - Jeremy Garcia, Datadog \n\nIn less than five years, AWS Lambda has been adopted by nearly half of companies with infrastructure in AWS. In this talk, we'll examine the serverless usage of thousands of Datadog customers to provide a look at how (and how much) serverless is being used in the real world.  You'll leave with a better understanding of how serverless technologies are being adopted, what other technologies are being adopted, as well as best practices and trends we've seen emerge. There are even some surprises along the way. \n\nhttps://sched.co/aYqC"
