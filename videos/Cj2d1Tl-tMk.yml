description: "If you're reading this, you're probably already familiar with the Jamstack. However, whether you're part of a digital agency, freelancer, or looking to switch out some legacy code, you probably have had to pitch the Jamstack and the ecosystem to non-devs.  I'm presenting this topic because I believe there's a lot to learn about how people market Jamstack and Headless CMS and it would be great to share real experiences and learnings from real users.\n\n\n\nNick DeJesus\nPitching the JAMStack and its ecosystem to your clients"
