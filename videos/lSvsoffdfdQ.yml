recordingDate: 1507689025
description: "Web developers are increasingly responsible for the performance of the sites they build, and there is now a plethora of advanced tools and services that allow developers to hone front end performance as never before. But the network can still be your biggest bottleneck.\n\nThis talk will discuss best practices and creative strategies for using caching, purging, preloading, server push, streaming, and other technologies to make sure your site hits your user's browser at top speed.\n\nAndrew is a web developer and principal developer advocate for Fastly, working with developers across the world to help make the web faster, more secure, more reliable and easier to work with. He founded a web consultancy which was ultimately acquired by the Financial Times, led the team that created the FT’s pioneering HTML5 web app, and founded the FT’s Labs division. He is also an elected member of the W3C Technical Architecture Group, a committee of nine people who guide the development of the World Wide Web. He will be talking about the power of the network.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference, visit\nhttp://www.yowconference.com.au"
