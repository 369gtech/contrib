description: "What’s one thing Slack, Facebook, and Google have in common? They’ve all embraced types in their JavaScript! Typed JavaScript is meeting lots of resistance from folks who don’t believe their JavaScript needs it, but many projects are transitioning to type systems such as TypeScript or Flow for better long-term maintainability and bug reduction.\n\nIn this session, Spencer will break down why types in your JavaScript will make you a better JS developer. We’ll explore the benefits brought on by typed JavaScript, such as better tooling and ease of refactoring. Finally, we’ll discuss how you can introduce typing to your JavaScript in projects small to large, new and old.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
