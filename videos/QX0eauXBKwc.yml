description: "Games in the 80s and 90s redefined the relationship between a user and a computer. Realtime, offline-first networking, fluid graphics, and physics-based animations posed incredible development challenges. Overcoming these challenges introduced a whole class of elegant techniques for immersive user experiences - that most JavaScript developers have never heard of!\n\nMy talk will show that normal JS apps will soon rely on game programming techniques every day. You’ll be amazed at how many libraries you’re using are already based on basic game-loop architecture. Finally, you’ll leave ready to push your own apps forward with a little bit of gaming magic.\n\nTranscript/Slides at: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/hunter-loftis-we-will-all-be-game-programmers.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
