title: 'Python and Autonomous Database: Better together for Location Analytics'
language: English
recordingDate: 1598450592
description: "In August we discussed the use of Python, and geospatial analysis libraries, in conjunction with the Autonomous Database's spatial features. David walked through a Jupiter notebook and outlined two scenarios. The first used spatial analysis, on a national scale dataset of vehicle accidents, to identify hot spots and cold spots where speeding was a factor or not a factor in the accident. The second scenario involved a spatio-temporal analysis of unemployment statistics. \n\nHere's a quick guide to the highlights:\n\n1:00 David provides an overview of Spatial features in the Oracle Database\n6:42 He discusses the vast ecosystem of geospatial analysis libraries for Python\n8:44 He provides the URL for a PDF version of the Jupiter notebook with the demos\n11:35 David introduces the first demo scenario\n29:00 He discusses the second demo scenario\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/  \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
