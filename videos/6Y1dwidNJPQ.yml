description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-mvc-4-web-apps\n\nSpring Framework 4.3 is the last in the 4.x generation and it brings plenty of refinements to the @MVC programming model. In Spring Framework 5.0 the same programming model will be supported on a new reactive foundation. This talk will review the main features in 4.x and preview the work towards Spring Framework 5.0."
