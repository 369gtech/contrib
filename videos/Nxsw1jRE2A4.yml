description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nWHAT DOES DIALYZER THINK ABOUT ME?\nby Stavros Aronis\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nDialyzer\nTherapy\nProductivity\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nIf you have been in the BEAM community for a while, you know that Dialyzer is a tool with fanatic lovers and haters. In the speaker's personal opinion, however, most of the haters actually like Dialyzer, but absolutely loathe how the tool is treating them. In this talk I will explain how Dialyzer works, with the goal to help you decipher its warnings (or their absence), make it run faster and increase your overall productivity while using it.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/stavros-aronis/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - STAVROS ARONIS\nHunter of discrepancies in Erlang code. Developer of parallel Dialyzer and Concuerror\n\nStavros' experience with Erlang started at the deep end of the pool, when he picked Dialyzer, the famously \"\"never wrong\"\"Â tool, and made it even smarter, as a master thesis project under the supervision of Kostis Sagonas. He then made Dialyzer faster and parallel, an improvement which has been included in the Erlang/OTP distribution since 2012. Later he got his PhD by re-engineering Concuerror, another tool for Erlang developers, focused on finding concurrency errors in programs and protocols.\n\nStavros loves testing and making tools and is now trying to bring all his favorite techniques into industry as an Erlang Solutions consultant and trainer.\n\nMore on Stavros Aronis: https://codesync.global/speaker/stavros-aronis/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
