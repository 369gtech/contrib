description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nAngel Rivera - Developer Advocate at CircleCI\n\nABSTRACT\nEver run code changes through CI/CD and everything passed clean and green in the pipeline checks, then experience undetected critical failures in the live target environment post-deployment? This scenario is very common and impacts many teams and organizations even the teams with the most rigorous testing practices. In most cases this behavior can be eliminated by running basic Smoke Tests on the application live in their target environments. Smoke testing apps in target environments will expose unwanted patterns/behaviors and provide a solid understanding of how the application will perform.\nThis presentation will discuss the advantages of implementing Smoke Test patterns into CI/CD pipelines using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Learn how teams can leverage automation to ensure apps are tested live in target environments which provide valuable insights pre-deployment. Presenters will demonstrate how to leverage IaC to provision kubernetes clusters, deploy apps, test live then destroy all the resources created [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n03:51 Smoke tests\n12:41 Increase app confidence\n14:22 Demo\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1418/increase-app-confidence-using-ci-cd-and-infrastructure-as-code\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ContinuousDelivery #CD #ContinuousIntegration #CI #CICD #IaC #k8s #Kubernetes\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
