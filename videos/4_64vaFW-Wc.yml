description: "This talk will provide a comprehensive picture of security within the world of service meshes. We will start with an introduction of the key security concepts and describe the key system components that implement those concepts. This will include references to open source offerings that can provide these components. The talk will progress to architectural patterns which will showcase the security capabilities available for production use. Finally, the talk includes a demo combining several CNCF projects for a scenario that can be replicated by attendees. We will touch on the following CNCF projects in this talk: Envoy, Linkerd, Spiffe, Spire, and Network Service Mesh.\n\nPresenter:\nJohn A. Joyce, Principal Engineer @Cisco"
