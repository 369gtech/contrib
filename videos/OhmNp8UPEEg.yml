title: 'Serilog: Instrumentation that Works for You - Nicholas Blumhardt'
recordingDate: 1499244176
description: "Collecting measurements and log events from your applications is not enough. Whether you need to tame unruly legacy code, get the jump on production errors from your web app, or just survive operating a large microservices architecture, it's important to record the right data in a format you can use efficiently when it counts.\n\nThis session will explore Serilog, a deceptively simple twist on application logging that's changed the way .NET applications are instrumented. You'll learn how to track complex application behavior through distributed and asynchronous systems, without sacrificing any of the development-time productivity of simple text logging.\n\nInstrumentation is a critical part of application development that's too-often overlooked. For a small investment up-front, you can save a great deal of time (and stress) in production. Your future self will thank you for it!"
