description: "Erlang User Group \nLondon 2013, July 16\nFirst talk: Embedded Erlang, RaspberryPi, Robosapiens - Darach Ennis\nSecond Talk: FiFo: an open source cloud orchestration suite for SmartOS written in Erlang  - Heinz Gies\n\nHeinz Gies will be giving a 25 mins talk about Project FiFo, an open source cloud orchestration suite for SmartOS written from the ground up in Erlang. The talk will be split into three segments. Starting with a short introduction of Project FiFo, what it is exactly what it does and how it looks. Going on with talking a bit about the experiences during the development, where Erlang was great where it wasn't, the biggest problems and the biggest wins on the ride.\n\nHeinz worked in the Telco industry for some years, but programming and languages were always something that fascinated him. He discovered Erlang about two years ago and fell hopelessly in love with it. Heinz started FiFo as his first big Erlang project mid last year out of purely egoistic reasons and he's working full time on it since December.\n\n\nStarters:\n\nDarach Ennis has been hacking up a bit of syntax compiler in Java... and he's willing to share in a 10-15 mins talk.\n\nDarach is the VP of engineering at Push Technology.  His background is working as Principal Consultant, Systems Engineer & Global Solutions Architect with companies such as Betfair, IONA, JP Morgan Chase and StreamBase. Regularly speaking at conferences and events on Big Data and CEP, Darach is a regular contributor to Big Data and CEP groups on LinkedIn.  He has designed and implemented algorithmic trading platforms, flow trading systems, smart order routing systems, online spread betting, sports and gaming systems, as well as championing hardware accelerated messaging and compute acceleration in CEP.\nDarach is currently interested in enabling the internet of things in the context of real time conversational and high touch experiences, and migrating the telemetry normally associated with sensor networks to targeted experiences on the web and mobile."
