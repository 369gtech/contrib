Spark, however is unique in providing batch as well as streaming capabilities & real-time processing, thus making it a preferred choice for lightening fast big data analysis platforms.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nPlease write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at US: +18336900808 (Toll Free) or India: +918861301699 for more information. \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka\n\nCustomer Review:\n\nMichael Harkins, System Architect, Hortonworks says: “The courses are top rate. The best part is live instruction, with playback. But my favourite feature is viewing a previous class. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! ~ This is the killer education app... I've take two courses, and I'm taking two more.”"
