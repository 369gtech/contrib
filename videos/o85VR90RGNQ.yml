title: '15 Kubernetes features in 15 minutes by Marc Sluiter'
language: English
recordingDate: 1478765805
description: "In July 2015 Google released Kubernetes version 1.0, a tool for orchestrating Docker containers in a cluster. A lot happened since then: Kubernetes gained a lot of attraction and was donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. The community is constantly growing, and new versions are released every few months, meaning a lot of useful features have been added since the first release. In this session I want to introduce you shortly to the basics of Kubernetes like Pods, ReplicaSets and Services, and some of the newer features like Jobs, DaemonSets, PetSets, Autoscaling and more.\n\nMarc Sluiter\nI started programming with Amiga Basic many years ago and didn't stop since then. After a short excursion to Microsoft .Net later on, I concentrated on developing Java applications. While I focused in most projects on backend development, I also worked with different frontend technologies. I have also some experience in developing Android apps and have interest in the Internet of Things. In my spare time I work with Java on a Raspberry Pi, the Leapmotion input device and Lego Mindstorms. During the last months I was busy with a research project about distributed, scalable, evolvable and secure systems, and a project about hosting distributed applications, both based on Docker and Kubernetes.\n\n[AHL-4947]"
