description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - Oh my god, your cell phone is stolen! And along with it, the brand new (hybrid) mobile application you have developed, storing all the nice sensitive data on the device! But you can relax - you have taken all imaginable precautions to secure the application, and have made it impossible for the thief to get through to your data. Or have you? This talk will shed some light about possible exploit strategies for hybrid (and native) applications on Android and iOS, as well as the corresponding methods to prevent these exploits.'
