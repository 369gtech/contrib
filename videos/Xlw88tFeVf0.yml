title: 'JDK IO 2016 - Claus Ibsen - Developing Java based microservices ready for the world of containers'
recordingDate: 1474443306
description: "The so-called experts are saying microservices and containers will\nchange the way we build, maintain, operate, and integrate\napplications. This talk is intended for Java developers who wants to\nhear and see how you can develop Java microservices that are ready to\nrun in containers.\nIn this talk we will build a set of Java based Microservices that uses\na mix of technologies with:\n- Apache Camel with CDI\n- Spring Boot\n- Vert.x\n- WildFly Swarm\nYou will see how we can build small discrete microservices with these\nJava technologies and build and deploy on the Kubernets/OpenShift3\ncontainer platform.\nWe will discuss practices how to build distributed and fault tolerant\nmicroservices\nusing technologies such as Kubernetes Services, Camel EIPs, Netflixx\nHysterix, and Ribbon.\nWe will use Zipkin service tracing across all four Java based\nmicroservices to provide a visualization of timings and help highlight\nlatency problems in our mesh of microservices.\nAnd the self healing and fault tolerant aspects of the\nKubernetes/OpenShift3 platform is also discussed and demoed when we\nlet the chaos monkeys loose killing containers.\nThis talk is a 50/50 mix between slides and demo."
