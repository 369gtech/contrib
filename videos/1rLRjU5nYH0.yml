title: 'YOW! 2015 - Ben Teese & Sam Ritchie - Rethinking MVC with React Native & ReactiveCocoa'
language: English
recordingDate: 1452679893
description: "Traditional event-based MVC has been the standard pattern for building user interfaces for decades. However, this pattern has its downsides - specifically, shared mutable state and cascading event chains can lead to code that is difficult to comprehend and reason about.\n\nIn this talk we’ll look at alternative approaches that leverage functional programming techniques, using the native mobile app development space to demonstrate. We’ll start by introducing the concepts of declarative UIs and reactive one-way data flow, as exemplified by the JavaScript-based React Native framework. Then, if JavaScript is not your cup of tea, we’ll see how we can apply the same principles using Swift and ReactiveCocoa, a functional reactive programming library for Cocoa.\n\nIrrespective of what language you use or what sort of user interfaces you build, this talk will introduce you to the virtues of reactive one-way data flow and immutable state, and how they can help you write code that is easier to understand.\n\nBen Teese is a senior software developer at Shine Technologies. He spent 10 years as a Java developer before moving onto Ruby and Javascript, with some excursions into iOS along the way.He specialises in sneaking web-inspired technologies into mobile development presentations\n\nSam has an extensive background leading small, focused teams building in-house business systems in .NET, and has concentrated on cloud & mobile solutions for the last five years. He’s been an Apple fanboy since the 80s, was coding in Objective-C before it was cool, and Swift was his favourite language before he’d written a single line.\n\nIn his spare time he likes to start projects he’s never going to finish, most of them involving one or more of iOS, CouchDB, LevelDB, F#, Haskell, and Arduino.\n\nFor more on YOW!
