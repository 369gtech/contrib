title: 'OML feature highlight: Deploy an XGBoost Model using OML Services'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628881319
description: "In this Session Sherry LaMonica, Principal Member of Technical Staff at Oracle Machine Learning team explained how to train a Python SciKit-learn Xgboost model, properly convert the model to ONNX format and then deploy the model to OML Services on Autonomous Database.\n\nOML Services extends OML functionality to support model deployment and model lifecycle management for both in-database OML models and third-party Open Neural Networks Exchange (ONNX) machine learning models via REST APIs.\n\nThe REST API for Oracle Machine Learning Services provides REST API endpoints hosted on Oracle Autonomous Database. These endpoints enable the storage of machine learning models along with its metadata, and the creation of scoring endpoints for the model.\n\nThese third-party classification or regression models can be built using tools that support the ONNX format, which includes packages like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, among several others.\n\nIn addition, OML Services supports proprietary cognitive text capabilities, with capabilities for topic discovery, keywords, summary, sentiment, and feature extraction. The initial languages supported include English, Spanish, French and Italian (based on a Wikipedia knowledgebase using embeddings).\n\nOML Services cognitive image functionality, supported through the ONNX format third-party model deployment feature, supports scoring using images or tensors.\n\nVideo Highlights:\n01:11 Topics for today\n01:41 Motivation: Why deploy an ONNX model using OML Services?\n02:44 OML Services overview\n04:51 ONNX overview\n05:54 Architecture for today's demo\n07:05 Live Demo on Jupiter Notebook\n07:33 Step1: Train a Python XGBoost model\n08:28 Step 2: Convert the model to ONNX format\n12:03 Step 3: Deploy the ONNX model in OML Services\n16:14 Q&A"
