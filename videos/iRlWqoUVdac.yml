title: 'Swarm Monitoring: Best Practices'
language: English
recordingDate: 1494277210
description: 'Pushing container-based applications into production will radically change the way you monitor & troubleshoot your environment. You''ll have to adapt to both a new set of technologies and a new set of practices in order to effectively complement your Docker strategy with a new monitoring approach. In this session we''ll cover the key elements of your new monitoring strategy, including: *How do you instrument Swarm managed containers effectively, taking into account best practices and the dynamic nature of containers? You need to monitor application components, not just Docker containers. How will you make that happen within a unified monitoring approach? *How should you monitor services built on top of containers? what metrics become more relevant in docker-based environments? *How do you construct alerts most effectively? how do you troubleshoot containers that are rapidly coming and going? *How do you isolate data for particular teams for the purposes of more effective monitoring and greater security? The session will focus on demonstrating both open source and commercial tools that can help you solve these new challenges. You''ll walk away with concrete recommendations that you can immediately put to work in any scale environment."'
