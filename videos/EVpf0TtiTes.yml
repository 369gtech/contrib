description: "Regardless of the technology you know, regardless of the job title you have, you have amazing potential to impact your workplace, community, and beyond.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll share a few candid stories of my career failures… I mean… learning opportunities. We’ll start by debunking the myth that leadership == management. Next, we’ll talk about some the attributes, behaviors and skills of good leaders. Last, we’ll cover some practical steps and resources to accelerate your journey.\r\n\r\nYou’ll walk away with some essential leadership skills I believe anyone can develop, and a good dose of encouragement to be more awesome! - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf with the Ustream Mobile App"
