description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCreating Cloud Native Security - Emily Fox, Apple; Brandon Lum, IBM; Andres Vega, VMware\n\nCloud native security is not new, but is under constant iteration and creation. As cloud native innovation occurs, the Security TAG is lock-step in considering, analyzing, and guiding the community on the most appropriate security mechanisms, architectures, design patterns, and tooling. This presentation covers an introduction to the Security TAG, their charter and scope, and then deep dives on several efforts the TAG has undertaken (completed and in progress) with their community impact such as the Supply Chain Security Paper, CNCF Project Security Reviews, Security Pals, and so much more. This session is for anyone interested in cloud native, cloud native security, or wishes to understand how a community of passionate volunteers can change an entire technology ecosystem."
