recordingDate: 1389388407
description: "In this interactive webcast presented by Stephen Wendel author of Designing for Behavior Change, he will talk about the business of behavior change: what it means for companies to design products that help users change their daily behavior and routines.\n\nFrom this webcast you will learn:\n\n How to discover the right behavior to change - generating product ideas and evaluating them for their beneficial impact for users and for the company or NGO\nClarifying the target outcome, actor, and action - how to get everyone on the same page and avoid disagreements down the line\nSustainable business models for building behavior change products\nWays to build relationships and work together with behavioral economists and others to get additional expertise and insight\n\nSteve will also preview a set of worksheets that companies and NGOs can use to start the process of designing for behavior change.\n\nAbout Steve Wendel\n\nStephen is the Principal Scientist at HelloWallet, where he's worked for four years to develop applications that help users take control of their finances. He is a behavioral social scientist by academic training, and works with behavior economists and psychologists to conduct research on behavior change, especially around savings and spending behavior.\n\nHe is currently writing Designing for Behavior Change for O'Reilly, which gives step by by instructions for designers and product managers on how to develop products that help users change their daily behavior - from exercising more to learning a new language.\n\nThe impetus behind the book comes from two places. First, it comes from his experiences at HelloWallet, which has confronted first-hand the frustrations and failures that come from the two most common approaches to behavior change: telling people what to do (without taking into account their psychology), and trying to directly apply the research literature (without focusing on the quality of the product itself). Second, he is a co-founder of community of like-minded practitioners, Action Design DC, where he has had the opportunity to learn from other companies attacking the same problems of practical behavior change."
