description: "USENIX Security '21 - A Side Journey To Titan\n\nThomas Roche and Victor Lomn√©, NinjaLab, Montpellier, France; Camille Mutschler, NinjaLab, Montpellier, France and LIRMM, Univ. Montpellier, CNRS, Montpellier, France; Laurent Imbert, LIRMM, Univ. Montpellier, CNRS, Montpellier, France\n\nThe Google Titan Security Key is a FIDO U2F hardware device proposed by Google (available since July 2018) as a two-factor authentication token to sign in to applications such as your Google account. In this paper, we present a side-channel attack that targets the Google Titan Security Key's secure element (the NXP A700x chip) by the observation of its local electromagnetic radiations during ECDSA signatures. This work shows that an attacker can clone a legitimate Google Titan Security Key. As a side observation, we identified a novel correlation between the elliptic curve group order and the lattice-based attack success rate.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '21 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/technical-sessions"
