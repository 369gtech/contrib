description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nIf you’re writing C++ for anything other than Windows, chances are that you occasionally break out GDB. This session presents some of the lesser known features of GDB that can change the way you debug. GDB has come a long way in the last few years and now does so much more than break, print, step and continue. Reversible debugging; Non-Stop Mode; Multi-process Debugging; and Dynamic Printf are but some of its best features, and its built-in Python scripting is particularly powerful. Join Undo co-founder and CEO, Greg Law, as he takes you through a series of demos to show some amazing tricks with GDB and some of its powerful new (and not-so-new) features that you may not have heard of.\n— \nGreg Law\nCEO, Undo Ltd\nGreg is a software geek at heart, but likes to keep one foot in the software world and one foot in the business world. He finds it particularly rewarding to turn innovative software technology into “real” business development. Greg has over 20 years of experience in both academia and innovative start-up software companies. In 2005 he co-founded Undo Software, which he now runs.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
