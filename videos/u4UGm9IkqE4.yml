description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nGiving and Getting Technical Help in Open Source Without Being Scared! - Sonia Singla, CNCF \n\nAs a developer, it’s exciting and challenging to stay up to speed with the latest trends in technology.Every day, new languages, frameworks and devices capture our attention and spur conversations in meetups, forums and chats.However, our developer community is made of people, not tools, and it’s fascinating to explore its sociopolitical aspects. We are always beginners at some things and experts at others.Along the way from beginner to expert we ask a lot of questions, but it can be intimidating to ask for help.This talk will be split into two halves: giving and then getting technical help.This talk gives concrete tools to help you ask with confidence, and highlights common expert mistakes that inadvertently make people feel foolish.It's important to learn how to manage your contributors in open-source.Once you learn it, your project will succeed and more contributors will flock to you! \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekBJ"
