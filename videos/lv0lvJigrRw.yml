description: "Welcome to Chrome University, where you will learn the foundations of how Chrome works. \n\nAre we really attacked? Yes. \n\nWho attacks us? What's their motivation? How do we stop them? \n\nThis talk will give a brief tour around adversaries, before focusing on a single bug to show its complete lifecycle from introduction, to real exploitation in the wild, to fix. \n\nAdrian shows how easy it is to introduce such bugs, some of the tools that attackers can use to turn a trivial vulnerability into a powerful exploit, and what you can do to frustrate their efforts.\n\nLinks:\nSecurity 101 → https://goo.gle/2tHJvSc\n\nChrome University playlist → https://goo.gle/ChromeU\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs"
