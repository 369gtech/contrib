title: '(Choosing our own) Adventures in Next.js - Cassidy Williams (Netlify)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608254322
description: '“Choose your own adventure” books were (and are!) a bit hit for anyone who loves a little creativity in storytelling. In this talk, we use the power of Next.js, state machines (with XState), a GraphQL database (with Hasura), and character submissions from users (with Netlify Forms) to show how to build a crowdsourced, mad-lib, choose your own adventure story application. It’s a mouthful, but it’s a spooky, silly result!'
