description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Europe 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nBernd Ruecker - Software developer at heart who has been innovating process automation deployed in highly scalable and agile environments of industry leaders such as T-Mobile, Lufthansa, ING and Atlassian\n\nABSTRACT\nWe’re slicing and dicing systems into ever-shrinking pieces from microservices to serverless functions that should be reactive and event driven. End-to-end processes now often require the integration of multiple components — but of course, without coupling them too tightly. In an e-commerce company, for example, a “customer order” might involve different services for payments, inventory, shipping and more. Many companies are slicing up their core business processes in the pursuit of modern architectures and running into unanticipated challenges along the way.\nThis talk will foster your understanding of how (business) processes can generally be implemented and monitored. Bernd will compare different approaches, from batches over streaming to workflow engines. You will understand the impact on agility and what is different [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:00 Change is the only constant\n07:52 Using a workflow engine instead\n09:30 Who am I\n10:35 Demo\n17:48 Microservices\n18:48 The era of APIs\n20:05 Going hipster\n21:34 Event-driven architecture\n29:27 Stateful orchestration\n31:12 Summary\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/2020/sessions/1561/automating-processes-in-modern-architectures\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#SoftwareArchitecture #Serverless #Microservices #Agility #APIs #EventDrivenArchitecture #EventDriven\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
