description: "Take away “Dev” and “QA” from engineer’s job title and build a truly “one team” – The Gumtree bidirectional transformation journey\n\nAs we move into agile and devops world, silos need to be broken down between different stages and different roles. Testing needs to shift left to remove the biggest barrier that having dedicated people/dedicated phase to do testing, which means “Developer need to do more testing”. DevOps requires continuous testing (automation) to provide fast quality feedback. With the majority testing work shifting left on Developer’s shoulder, and less needs for manual testing, traditional QA’s role needs to be reinvented.\nWhat exactly organisation can do to transform legacy Dev and QA team to embrace these changes? This session will share Gumtree’s bidirectional transformation journey – How we change people’s mindset and skillset and the way of working in stages, introduce the tools built along the transformation journey to support the changes, eventually take away the role from their job title to bring them together as a truly “one team”.\n\nMore than 12+ year testing experience for large scale system in eCommerce industry, used to work in eBay China, moved to Sydney ~4 years ago, currently working in Gumtree Australia as QE manager, passionate about build quality in via shifting testing left, delivery quality at speed via DevOps and leveraging release strategy and monitoring/alerting, cares about customer and user experience, believes in \"life is a university, everyone should keep learning\", enjoys cooking and food, likes dog and plants, also would like to connect with people for inspiration.  \n\nFor more on YOW!
