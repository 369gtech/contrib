description: "Micheal Hedgpeth, Senior Software Architect at NCR - ChefConf 2017\n\nLet's dive into how with policyfiles we can onboard others onto Chef in 1/4 of the time, define a change management approach that everyone can be comfortable with, and allow you to effectively implement Chef within an air-gapped environment. We'll provide an overview of the policyfiles feature, how to manage it through a pipeline, how to migrate an existing Chef structure to a policyfiles structure, and some considerations for when the feature is not the best choice."
