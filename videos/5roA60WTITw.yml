Being a true superset of JavaScript, TypeScript adds a powerful type system and language features to help developers from other languages stay alert in a world where \"undefined is not a function\". In this three hour deep dive session, you will learn TypeScript from the ground up.\n\nThe course covers in depth language features, tooling and real world examples. After this deep dive course you will be able to do the following:\n\nUse TypeScript in your regular JavaScript files, without any new syntax at all\nApply TypeScript's language features, from simple string types to Decorators and Generics\nSet up TypeScript with Webpack\nSet up tooling to check your code for errors\nSet up the perfect TypeScript IDE/Editor\nCreate union, intersection, index, mapped and conditional types for advanced type checks and tooling support\nUse TypeScript's type inference for React and Angular\nJoin us to make the web world a (type-) safer place!\n\n \nDeepu K Sasidharan \nFrom @xebialabs\nDeepu K Sasidharan is the co-lead of JHipster.
