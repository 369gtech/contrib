title: 'NorDevCon2020 Day 2 - Part 8 - James Seconde'
recordingDate: 1592325002
description: "The Politics of Tool Shaming\n\nJames Seconde - Developer Advocate\n\n\"We’ve all heard it: ““What?! You’re using X framework/language/tool? You must suck at programming!””\n\nWe work in jobs rife with debate and discussion, where it’s essential to give and take advice; some good, some bad. In this talk I’ll delve into what’s harmful about shaming, what’s constructive and how we need to think about what we want for our future as an industry.\"\n\n## About nor(DEV):con\n\nThe eastern region's biggest tech conference runs annually in February with a fantastic line-up of speakers and workshops. In our fifth year we joined 41 speakers, over 5 tracks, speaking on a wide range of subjects. Day 1 kicked off with technical deep dives into popular and important languages, frameworks and process. Our key theme for 2020 was wellbeing, with plenty of talks on the main stage around the subject on Day 2, alongside Workshops and plenty of tech talk too.\n\nYou can read more about the line up for 2020 at https://2020.nordevcon.com/ or watch 2021 shape up on our main site https://nordevcon.com/\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nComplementing the existing tech community, Norfolk Developers will be peeling back the high level and going straight to the heart of software development practices and processes.
