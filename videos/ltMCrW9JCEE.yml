description: "In “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” the Babel fish is an animal, which “if you stick one in your ear, you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language”. In this talk I’ll show you how easy it is to write a web app that does exactly that. I’ll also discuss some of the current Web Speech API limitations that hopefully will be removed in the near future to make the web even more powerful platform for real-time communication. And you won’t have to stick anything into your ear!\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte"
