description: "There's a new cool kid in town: JSR 371, ambiguously named MVC Specification, brings the action based web framework paradigm to the upcoming Java EE 8 release ­ finally, 15 year after the rise (and later fall) of Apache Struts 1. Similar to Unix, action based server side web frameworks seem to be fashionable again after being considered stone age technology not long ago.\n\nIn this session we will go through the fundamentals of the MVC 1.0 specification and explain the core concepts. Lots of code samples will be included, as well as tips on how to get started using this awesome technology.\n\nWe will also investigate chances and risks of JSR 371. In particular we will check how the new specification can compete with established Servlet based action frameworks such as Spring MVC or Struts 2."
