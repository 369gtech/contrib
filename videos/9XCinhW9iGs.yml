One of our latest projects is creating a playlist from movie reviews aired on the radio and in podcasts. In the talk you will learn about how to find interesting movies, classify reviews, and define success when you can't use the regular measurements. Join us to **hear** all about it!\n\nNitzan: I have a BSc. in computer science and linguistics and I'm working towards my MSc. in computer science. In the midst of all that, I am a data scientist at Audioburst, developing tools for geeks like me who are always looking for their next favorite podcast.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
