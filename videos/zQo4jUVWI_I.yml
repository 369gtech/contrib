recordingDate: 1510944686
description: "If you were asked to imagine what programming will look like in 10 years, what would you say? Perhaps something to do with functional programming. Maybe you imagine the rise of some of the more interesting nascent languages of today. That's where we started, but through an odd journey over the past several years, we've ended up somewhere entirely different in the pursuit of an alternative form of programming. Through dozens of prototypes, constant testing with real people, and a willingness to throw it all away, we've learned a great deal about what it would mean to turn the computer back into a tool for thoughtâ€”not just for you or me, but for all of us.\n\nEVENT: BIDS Data Science Lecture Series, December 2015\n\nSPEAKER: Chris Granger, Co-Founder and CEO, Kodowa\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZQoAKJPbh8&t=29s"
