description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nSpeaker: Matt Raible\nCore Spring track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/noxml-eliminating-xml-in-your-spring-projects\n\nMany Spring projects exist that leverage XML for their configuration and bean definitions. Most Java web applications use a web.xml to configure their servlets, filters and listeners. This session shows you how you can eliminate XML by configuring your Spring beans with JavaConfig and annotations. It also shows how you can remove your web.xml and configure your web components with Java."
