description: "Michael Plöd, Principal Consultant, InnoQ \nPart three of the Domain-Driven Design Webinar Series examines the internal software architecture of applications. This part of Domain-Driven Design is often misunderstood or poorly implemented by teams working with frameworks such as OR-Mapping tools.\n\nYou will learn how to use building blocks such as Entities, Value Objects and Aggregates for modeling the core domain of your application—the heart of your software’s business logic. In addition, we will look at the differences between JPA and DDD Entities and Value Objects—and rest assured there are some substantial differences.\n\nFinally, this webinar will cover patterns such as Factories, Repositories and Application Services and show you how to put everything in context with a rough architecture structure.\n\nPart 2: Strategic Design: Domains, Subdomains, Bounded Contexts & Context Maps\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNTsTVoV2qA\nPart 1: Overview and Core Values of Domain-Driven Design\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0zpSB85XGs"
