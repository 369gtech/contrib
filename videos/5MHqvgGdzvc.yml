description: "Using the Theory of Constraints to Prioritize Applications for Migration to Cloud Foundry - Mark Carlson, ECS Team\n\nCloud Foundry has enjoyed a tremendous adoption rate by Fortune 500 enterprises and large government agencies at both the state and federal level. Large organizations are turning to Cloud Foundry's agile infrastructure to help remove the friction of deploying and operation applications in both public and private clouds. \n\nMost of these large firms start their cloud-native journey with small or moderately sized pilot applications. Once these have enabled the \"pioneers\" within the organization to share their success, the attention turns to the large, sometimes massive, portfolios of existing applications. \nThe challenge common to all of these large organization is to devise a strategy for selecting applications to migrate to the newly implemented cloud-native platform. \n\nIn this talk, you will learn about an approach to analyzing an existing application portfolio using the theory of constraints in addition to the more common criteria of size, technical fit and business function. By identifying the \"innovation bottlenecks\" within your organization, it is possible to select the set of applications (and development teams) to migrate to your newly implemented cloud-native application platform for maximum business impact. \n\nThe talk will share some of the lessons learned from application migration projects within large enterprises like yours that can be used to avoid dangers encountered by others. It will also include some tips and practices shared by successful travelers ahead of you on the road to cloud-native. \n\nAttendees will learn about three phases of cloud-native application migration, how the constraint theory can supplement other more common selection criteria and how to jump start your organizations application migration.\n\nMark Carlson \nCTO\nECS Team\nDenver, CO\nMark Carlson is the CTO for ECS Team, a regional systems integrator providing cloud platform implementation and cloud-native development services in North America.
