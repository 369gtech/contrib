description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl)\n26th of September 2014\n\nPaul Stack - \"What is DevOps and How it Can Help My Business Succeed\"\n\n\"DevOps is not just a buzzword. DevOps is all about culture. By achieving the right culture, then your engineers can really start to move fast. Moving fast is something that we currently think we do.\n\nDevOps is not about tooling or giving developers root access to production systems.DevOps is about breaking down the communication barriers to allow our entire IT team to work as 1. When the team has a culture of open communication and business understanding, then they can achieve anything!\n\nDuring this talk, Paul will describe what DevOps is and how it is a great way for the entire business to achieve their goals. DevOps is not the new Agile! DevOps is about people :)\""
