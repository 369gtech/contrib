title: 'Lisi Linhart Animation for the mobile web at Mobile Era'
recordingDate: 1574413422
description: "The global mobile traffic is rapidly rising and thus developing web interfaces that are equally engaging and usable in a mobile environment is just as important as for desktop. Especially when we take into mind that a big part of the world population can only access the Internet via their smartphone. This talk explores the theoretical background of animation, the limitations and opportunities animations brings when done in the mobile browser, the connection of animation to touch gestures and some practical code examples of how animation can be incorporated into mobile websites. This talk is backed by a lot of science, theory and experience, since I wrote my master thesis in this field, which was titled 'Touch Interaction and Animation in Mobile Web Interfaces'. During the thesis I developed a mobile PWA that looked similar to native application (http://masterthesis.lisilinhart.info) and conducted a user study that A / B tested this prototype with and without animation. I feel that the insight I gained during the research can be transformed into an insightful talk, that's especially compelling for developers who are interested in usability, animation and touch interaction in the mobile web browser. A common question that guided this research was how to make websites feel more like native applications.\n\nAbout the speaker\nLisi is a lecturer for web development at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzburg, Austria, where she teaches students everything there is to know about front-end development and design. In her free time you will often find her at conferences, attending or speaking about web animation. Other than coding and design, she also loves to spend her free time drawing and illustrating.\n\nAbout Mobile Era\nMobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo. We're passionate about developing mobile apps and want to see a kick-ass event in Oslo for people like ourselves. The organizing committee consists of developers who are also active in organizing open events, conferences and meetups in the Oslo developer community.\n\nOur topics: iOS / Android, Mobile web / PWA, Cross-platform / JS-to-Native, IoT / Hardware, Mobile UX / Accessibility\n\nFollow us on:\n\nWebsite: mobileera.rocks\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mobileeraconf\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mobileeraconf/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mobileeraconf"
