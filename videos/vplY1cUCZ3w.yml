Fixing these type of bugs can be draining, but often improves your understanding of the system. Come and learn the nuts and bolts of writing a good regression test that exposes the bug at the right level of abstraction. We will pay close attention to the structure of our code after the bug fix. Through incremental changes, we will drive improvement. Iâ€™ll show you how you can have code that is simpler to understand, follows project conventions, and is easier to test."
