It provides a democratic vehicle for individuals and upstarts to challenge and neutralize powerful incumbents. Yet, because change accompanies innovation, it is a double-edged sword.\r\n\r\nThis presentation examines the historical reception transformative scientific breakthroughs initially received before widespread adoption. By example, it teaches principles that can help ensure change agents personally, and their organizations, are on the delivering side of innovation's sharp edge.\r\n\r\nW. David Schwaderer has a Masters Degree in Applied Mathematics from the California Institute of Technology and an MBA from the University of Southern California. He has worked at IBM, EDS, Adaptec, Symantec, and Silicon Valley startups. He has authored six commercial software programs for a variety of machine architectures using several different languages, dozens of articles, and ten technical books that explain complex technology in approachable ways. David's soon-to-be-published 11th book follows over 10 years of research and is titled \"Innovation Survival - Concept, Courage, Chance, and Change\"."
