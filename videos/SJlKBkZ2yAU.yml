title: 'Spring Data JDBC: Beyond the Obvious'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632325368
description: "Spring Data JDBC is an ORM inspired by Domain Driven Design. It purposely limits the ways you can model your domain objects. This makes Spring Data JDBC simple to maintain and to use.\n \n Sometimes, though, you want to achieve things that arenâ€™t obvious how to do. This talk shows how to solve common challenges:\n \n - Bidirectional relationships\n - ID generation\n - Contextual query strategies\n - Fine-tuning of mappings\n \n Whether you are new to Spring Data JDBC or have substantial experience with it, this talk can give you a better understanding.\n\nJens Schauder, Staff Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/spring-data-jdbc-beyond-the-obvious"
