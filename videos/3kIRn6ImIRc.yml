description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nKubernetes and Logging: Do It Right - Eduardo Silva, Arm Treasure Data \n\nLogging in distributed systems is not as simple as it sounds. The nature of having distributed applications comes with challenges for data processing such as parsing and unstructured/structured data handling, metadata correlation (labels/annotations), data centralization, and overall reliability. In this session, we will dive and explain all the concepts of Logging for distributed systems, specifically applicable for Kubernetes environments, best practices, and open-source tools available to satisfy the final needs of every user: data analysis. Doing Logging right is not hard if the concepts are understood, after this session you will be in a good position to implement a unified logging layer in Kubernetes with further knowledge of best practices for performance, security, and data transfer reliability. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekA9"
