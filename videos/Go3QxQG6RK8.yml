description: "Talk recording from JSNation Live 2020, the biggest JavaScript conference in the cloud: https://live.jsnation.com\n\n# Making Games in React\n\nThis talk is going to be about react-three-fiber. We'll make a mini game together. We'll see how even beginners can make it through all the heavy boilerplate and math without losing their minds, and then translate it to anything, be it a game or a website with some interesting visuals and effects."
