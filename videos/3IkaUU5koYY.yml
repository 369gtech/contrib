We analyzed the top performance bottleneck reasons in 2017 and see familiar patterns such as excessive service roundtrips, bad connection pooling, missing cache layers or simply sending too much data between service tiers. In this session we learn how to quickly pinpoint potential performance bottlenecks - even without executing large scale performance tests.\n#DistributedArchitecture #Performance\n\nPresented by Andreas Grabner\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
