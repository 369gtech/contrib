description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/continuous-delivery-of-the-cloud-foundry-platform-as-a-service-64888637\n\nEveryone has the question of how to continuously deliver; we have an answer that extends past the application to the platform itself. \n\nDeploying and updating Pivotal Cloud Foundry to your infrastructure can be a complicated process if performed manually. Automation and predictability are two important criteria for any mature operations organization. This talk focuses on lessons learned while building our continuous integration pipeline for deploying Pivotal Cloud Foundry to production. It will demonstrate how the commitment of the team towards operating Pivotal Cloud Foundry in a mature way matters more than the specific tools we used. The talk will cover a year’s journey of refining the process for updating a Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment. I will present a case study of how different manual processes and automated processes converged into what we have today. \n\nThe talk will focus on the different approaches we tried and elaborate on the details of the approach that has worked for us. The audience will leave with actionable takeaways in their pursuit of a continuously delivered platform.\n\nSpeaker: Tushar Dadlani; CloudOps Engineer, Pivotal"
