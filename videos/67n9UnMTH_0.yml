description: "http://www.oscon.com \r\n\r\nIn this interview at OSCON, O'Reilly School of Technology director Scott Gray talks to author Peter Scott about his upcoming OST course 'Perl 2', the passion of the Perl community, and how a practical education in Perl can lead to great jobs in Information Technology.  \r\n\r\nBased in the Pacific NorthWest but offering services around the globe, Peter provides both traditional on-site training in the Perl language and customized mentoring and tutoring. He also consults on enterprise architecture (Zachman framework) and infrastructure (open-source-based).\r\n\r\nPSDT specializes in solving the problems of \"legacy Perl\" - whether it's code that someone else wrote or merely ensuring that others can understand your own, we (literally) wrote the book on the topic!"
