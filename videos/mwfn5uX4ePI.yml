description: "Complex problem require strong teams to address them. But many teams are globally distributed, diverse in their nature, and way harder to manage than individuals. Atlassian is one of those work environments. We wanted to harness the power of these diverse teams, and resist the temptation to add layers of bureaucracy, process, and compliance regimes to make every team member act the same.\n\nWe gave birth to the Atlassian Playbook. A set of principles, patterns (our view of healthy teams) and plays (what those teams do to be healthy), that enable us to retain autonomy, provide teams with freedom to operate in their environment, drive continual improvement, eliminate management by committee, and to ultimately provide our teams with the techniques to be efficient AND effective.\n\nThis talk will teach you how to utilize the playbook at your company so you can drive efficiency and effectiveness in your organization without adding endless policy, procedures, or mind-numbing politics that slow down your org.\n\nDom Price is the head of R&D and work futurist at Atlassian, a leading provider of team collaboration and productivity software. Dom manages planning, execution and operations for Atlassian’s five global R&D centres, and is responsible for leading the company’s global innovation programs and workplace best practices for its more than 1700 employees.\n\nWith nearly 20 years of experience managing global teams, Dom is passionate about discovering patterns and creating play books that transcend cultural differences to help teams work together in the most efficient, productive way possible. His work is helping to define the way the teams and companies of tomorrow will work.\n\nDom’s career has reached far and wide through Europe, US and Asia PAC. Previously Dom was the general manager of program management for a global gaming company. Prior to that he was a director at Deloitte, where he provided assurance and consulting services across the areas of project management, product management, IT systems and change management. Over the years, Dom has held a variety of roles in technology risk consulting, product development and program management across businesses in beverage, telco, manufacturing, software development and gaming.\n\nDom is a keen traveler, having traversed over 50 countries and counting. Originally from Manchester, Dom now calls Sydney home after more than 12 years on the shores of Australia.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
