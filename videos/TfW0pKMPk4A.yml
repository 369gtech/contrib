description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nJavaFX replaces Swing with new paradigms and a cleaner separation between function and style... but the stylesheet isn't typed and it can be a bit of a pain to work out what's possible.\n\nIn this session we look at #TornadoFX;  a wrapper around #JavaFX that's quick to use, with type safe builders and stylesheets, dependency-injected MVC / MVP, and all the sweet synctactic sugar you'd expect from a Kotlin library.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nLiz Keogh is a Lean and Agile consultant based in London. She is a well-known blogger and international speaker, a core member of the BDD community and a passionate advocate of the Cynefin framework and its ability to change mindsets. She has a strong technical background with 20 yearsâ€™ experience in delivering value and coaching others to deliver, from small start-ups to global enterprises. Most of her work now focuses on Lean, Agile and organizational transformations, and the use of transparency, positive language, well-formed outcomes and safe-to-fail experiments in making change innovative, easy and fun... but she still codes in her spare time, and mostly uses Kotlin."
