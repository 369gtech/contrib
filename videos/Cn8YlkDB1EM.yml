The EU passed the SCA regulation to allow banks to require additional authentication for payments from customers. This helps to greatly reduce fraud, but it also makes life a whole lot more complicated as a developer.\n\nBut there is good news! You don't need to worry about it, because we've got you covered with Jumpstart Pro.\n\nAll payments with Stripe now show the required authentication modal and we'll even send emails alerting subscribers to come back and authenticate if needed later on.\n\nSubscriptions also now have a \"status\" attribute that help keep track of which subscriptions need authentication before they can become active. We handle all this using the Stripe CLI in development to forward webhooks to our Rails app. This keeps everything up-to-date locally and it makes development work very similar to production.\n\nWant to learn how all this works behind the scenes? Check out our Payments with Rails master class where we'll teach you how all this works: https://courses.gorails.com/payments-with-rails-master-class"
