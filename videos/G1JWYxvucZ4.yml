description: "We often neglect the fact of developing a distributed system by separating software artifacts and by setting up separate teams (yes, remember Conway’s law?)\n\n– How do we reason on distributed systems?\n– How to do TDD in distributed systems?\n– How does our system design impact the User Experience?\n\nClojure/ClojureScript allows us to rethink the design and implementation of distributed systems."
