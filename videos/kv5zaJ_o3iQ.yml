description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\n\"Extend All The Things!\": Cloud Provider Edition - Joe Betz, Google\n\nKubernetes integrates with a ton of Cloud Provider platforms, and as part of the \"Cloud Provider Extraction\" effort, all platform integration code in the main Kubernetes code base is being moved out of into separate repos. To make this possible, extensibility points have been introduced that create interesting ways to extend Kubernetes, including Cloud Controller Managers, Credential Provider Extensions and the Konnectivity server and agent.\n\nLearn the details from an engineer who helped bring the CRD and webhook extensibility mechanisms to GA, and who leads the adoption of extracted Cloud Providers at Google. How do these new extensibility points work? Why are they important? What can you do with them? We will discuss each extension point in detail, covering best practices learned as we migrated cloud providers to them.\n\nThe Cloud Provider abstraction delivers cross platform portability. We’ll close with details on how you (attn: tooling authors, cloud operators) can get involved with the community effort martialed by SIG Cloud Provider."
