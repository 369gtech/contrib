description: "Go, also called golang, is a programming language developed at Google in 2007 and publicly released in 2009. Combined with App Engine AND the AngularJS framework, golang represents the backend solution which completes Google's \"developer suite\". In spite of its youth, it includes a bunch of powerful features with a low learning curve and great performances, for any desktop platform. The talk would introduce golang with real examples, giving people the reasons why it will be a \"de-facto\" standard language in the imminent future. Slides would be in English, the talk itself in Italian.\nLanguage: Italian\n\nUrl slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Codemotion/go-is-your-friend-reppucci"
