As designers and developers, we build things. And we do it often. But we don't build websites or apps. We build systems. Systems that evolve and grow with a company, its users, and both of their needs. The way we design and build these systems should reflect the living, breathing things we want to create and leave more room for them to grow. The question is how do we accomplish this with static assets?\n\nThe answer is we set them all on fire. And start in the future. We start in the browser.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us. The speakers retain the copyright for their performances."
