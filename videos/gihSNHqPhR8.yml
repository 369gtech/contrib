description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nReact Native offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and tutorials on app development. But what if what you want to develop are games? Is that possible in React Native? I'm here to tell you that it's absolutely possible! You can rely on plain old JavaScript or you can take advantage of a tool called Unity3D. We will look at how Unity can be integrated into a React Native project and what we can build in Unity.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nAleksandra is a frontend and mobile app developer living in Poland. She started working as a developer almost 10 years ago. She has participated in a variety of projects, both big and small, boring and challenging, innovative and wellâ€¦ regular :) Outside of work she has 2 kids, and a few very cute pets.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/p_syche_\nGitHub: https://github.com/p-syche\n\nAdditional Links:\nList of all the links from the presentation:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1_DRvfJXGQ47Itzm99BSWnZ7td_JxJlWnSVutOFlGrNc/edit?usp=sharing"
