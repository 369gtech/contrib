description: "Keeping your Cutting Edge Platform Cutting Edge: Continuous Delivery of Cloud Foundry - Cora Iberkleid & Kartik Lunkad, Pivotal\n\nSo you’ve set up Cloud Foundry. Awesome. Your devs have speed, self-service, agility, no downtime. Great! But wait, there's a platform update? How do you know? It's critical? Hurry and download that file, go patch that dev environment! Good? Great! Now patch your other four environments. Nice job! Time for coffee. \n\nOh wait - there’s another update? Better get back to your workstation… \n\nPatching and upgrading your Cloud Foundry platform, be it the buildpack, a stemcell, a tile, or Ops Manager itself, is still a manual process. An operator must become aware of new updates, download the files from Pivotal Network, and initiate each update through Ops Manager. Rinse and repeat for each of your foundations. Manual processes are inefficient, cumbersome, and often postponed, leading to risk as potentially important updates are delayed or ignored. \n\nTaking a lesson from the app dev community, we can use the principles and practices of Continuous Delivery to alleviate these challenges. Join us to see how you can set up Concourse pipelines to automate the patching and upgrading of Cloud Foundry itself, such that new releases on Pivotal Network trigger the automated application of updates to all of your foundations. Cuz everyone can use an extra coffee break.\n\nAbout Cora Iberkleid\nCora Iberkleid is a Senior Cloud Application and Platform Architect at Pivotal, where she helps enterprises leverage modern technologies like Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud in order to deliver better quality software faster.
