description: "Speaker: Nicholas WL Koh\r\n\r\nPipenv is a packaging tool that brings concepts from other bundlers (e.g. npm) to the Python world. We'll walk through a simple workflow, contrasting it with Virtualenvwrapper.\r\n\r\nNick wishes he took CS instead of Business classes back in his University days (which weren't too long ago). He is currently building tools for the events industry, such as www.wedever.co.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group/events/244992207/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/ct6r/"
