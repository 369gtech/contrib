description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nHave you ever wondered how many file descriptors your application has available? What impact does scaling horizontally have on application cache?\n\nIn everyday work at small scale, we take a lot of things for granted and consider some details insignificant. When you enter the world of real-time big data processing those small things start making a massive difference in performance.\n\nAt DreamLab, tech hub of Ringier Axel Springer, we have built a personalization platform for 30m+ users, handling over 10k RPS and had to deal with and design around lots of problems, which would be insignificant at a smaller scale. Draw from our experience of building such a project and see what we have learnt along the way"
