description: "Before joining the community, Claudia was in despair for some employment-inactive years. This affected her self-esteem and was filling her brain with nothing but pessimism about the future. When she checked out a community website, started using the resources shared online, and got in touch with members things changed. She decided to jump into the train and find a way to upgrade herself. From learning to training and mentoring modules to networking opportunities near my location, she saw a window of opportunities to re-invent herself professionally and boost her skills and eventually, her self-esteem. For all this change, She feels she owes big debt to the community and would like to say it clear and loud! With a special announcement!\n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/community-lounge/"
