description: "Yo ninjas, in this AngularJS tutorial, I'll go through how we can handle form submissions with the ng-submit directive. We'll use ng-submit to allow the user to enter a new ninja to the data list, and use our controller to handle the event itself.\n\nHey gang, in this AngularJS tutorial, I'll be introducing you to filters and how we can use them to change the way our data is displayed to a user. Filters can be used in conjunction with ng-repeat, or directly on the expression itself. We use Angular filters to do things like ordering a list of items alphabetically, or by type, or to display numbers as a currency.\n\n----- COURSE LINKS:\n+ Source files on GitHub - https://github.com/iamshaunjp/angular-js-playlist\n+ Atom text editor - https://atom.io/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can find more front-end development tutorials on CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, WordPress & more on the channel homepage...\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Y...\n\n========== JavaScript for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n============ CSS for Beginners Playlist =============\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\n============== The Net Ninja =====================\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n================== Social Links ==================\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
