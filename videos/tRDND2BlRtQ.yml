recordingDate: 1400655849
description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/istanbultechtalks/itt-2014-niklas-therning-truly-native-java-apps-on-ios-with-robovm\n\nNiklas introduces and runs demos of RoboVM - a new open-source project with the goal of bringing Java and other JVM languages to iOS devices. The RoboVM ahead-of-time compiler translates Java bytecode into native code that runs directly on the CPU without the overhead of an interpreter. Access to the iOS Cocoa Touch APIs is provided through a Java to Objective-C bridge enabling the development of apps with truly native UIs and full hardware access."
