description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeaker:  Joe Kutner, Confluent\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/i-cant-believe-its-not-a-queue-using-kafka-with-spring\n\nYour existing message system is great, until it gets overloaded. Then what? That's when you should try Kafka.\n\nKafka is designed to be resilient. It takes the stress out of moving from a Spring monolith into a scalable system of microservices. Since you can capture every event that happens in your app, it's great for logging. You can even use Kafka's distributed, ordered log to simulate production load in your staging environment.\n\nCome learn about Kafka, where it fits in your Spring app, and how to make it do things message queues simply can't."
