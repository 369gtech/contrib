title: 'FRP: What does “declarative” mean (Peter Ovchinnikov, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1515769458
description: "Despite the fact that programming has been improved dramatically for last years, we’re still experiencing the same problems as 10 years ago.\n\nModern garbage collectors, smart pointer, thread dispatchers have made developer’s life much easier… Almost made…\n\nAlthough the deadlocks, race conditions, memory leaks and random crashes occur less often than ever before, the time we waste on solving each issue is getting more and more.\n\nIn my talk, I’ll introduce different (very old actually) look at programming: the declarative paradigm. And it’s not about “how to use it properly and get the problems above rid off”. It’s about “how to think to use it properly”.\n\nOn real examples, I’ll explain how we can interpret imperatively written code into “Graph of dependencies” and then convert it to declarative FRP style. It’s not only about the “states”. It’s about sequences of operations also. I’ll introduce some patterns of asynchronous programming like Future and Stream (aka Signal) and explain how effectively they may work."
