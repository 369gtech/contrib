Tom will highlight some of the most radical ideas from the new book “The Practice of Cloud System Administration”. The book focuses on “distributed” or “cloud” computing and brings a DevOps/SRE sensibility to the practice of system administration in ways that apply to the enterprise, the cloud, and everywhere.\nSome of the radical advice includes: improving uptime by using cheap unreliable hardware, why you should crashing servers at random times, and that you should make peace with outages.\nInfo about his new book can be found at http://the-cloud-book.com"
