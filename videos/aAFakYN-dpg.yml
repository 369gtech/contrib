description: "A Google TechTalk, June 29, 2016, presented by Peter Love (Tufts University)\nABSTRACT: Validation of Adiabatic Quantum computers is a significant problem. One of the advantages of the  Adiabatic model is that it does not require the rapid pulsed controls necessary in the gate model of quantum computation. However, eschewing this level of control also makes state and process tomography impossible in purely adiabatic hardware, and hence the quantum nature (if any) of such devices has to be established by indirect evidence.\n\nIn this talk I will describe how to use Adiabatic quantum computers based on the transverse-field Ising model to simulate elementary one-dimensional quantum systems, and discuss the quantum properties of the machines that can be exhibited by such simulations. I will also discuss how to detect the presence of one type of beyond-transverse-Ising coupling, namely the XX couplings of interest for non-stoquastic Adiabatic machines. \n \nPresented at the Adiabatic Quantum Computing Conference, June 26-29, 2016, at Google's Los Angeles office."
