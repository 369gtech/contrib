description: "Read-Execute-Print-Loops (REPLs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning and prototyping. JShell brings this power to Java. Targeted for JDK 9, and tightly integrated with the Java compiler and virtual machine, JShell enhances the programming experience for the Java language.\n\nLearn how to use JShell to explore new APIs, prototype code, or learn the Java language. Interactively explore new features of JDK 9. See the features that speed coding.\n\nThen take a peek under the hood to get an overview of how the JShell architecture fits in the Java platform. Learn how features like forward-reference are implemented. See how, with a few lines of code, the JShell API can enhance other tools."
