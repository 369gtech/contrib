description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\nThis practical workshop will give participants specifical ready-to-use facilitation formats they can use for their future workshops. From information gathering to prioritisation to group management, my purpose is to answer the most important topics of the group in the session itself using facilitation skills.\nMaybe you are curious as to how to transfer your facilitation skills online, maybe you want to learn how to work in difficult settings - difficult participants, technology imposed by the client,...\nWe'll find out how to work with the context and to stay in tune to the music in order to facilitate the best experience for the participants!"
