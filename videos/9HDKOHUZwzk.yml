description: "Doubling down on ChatOps in the Enterprise\n\nDaniel Perez, Build & Deploy Architect, HPE\n\nHPE's Research Development & Engineering team has been on a fast-tracked DevOps journey over the past couple of years.\n\nDuring our DOES 2014 talk we shared our deployment of ElectricFlow as a highly available and centralized self-service solution that has enabled HPE developers to quickly onboard onto ElectricFlow for build/test/deployment pipelines in a repeatable and cost-effective way. \n\nAt DOES 2015 we expanded on our investments into a comprehensive monitoring, self-healing, and accelerated deployment strategy across all of our applications to further bridge our Dev and Ops gap with greater visibility into our environments and to accelerate our time-to-market with repeatable and fully automated deploys.\n\nJoin us this year as we continue in this journey with our biggest transformation yet: the proliferation of ChatOps within our organization. We will discuss the decisions that lead us to these investments, the key lessons we have learned, and share our various Hubot integrations and capabilities.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
