description: "Have you adopted Dockerfiles to give your developers flexibility when building their application, but are now finding operational scale of those containers to be a headache? Have you adopted buildpacks to establish opinionated build standards for developers, but want to use them on platforms outside of Cloud Foundry? \nSay goodbye to the operational headaches of Dockerfiles and the limited portability of buildpacks, because now you can take your opinionated build process and day 2 operational readiness with you. Join us to learn how Pivotal is evolving buildpacks for usage in Kubernetes and beyond.\n\nSpeakers:\nScott Sisil\nStaff Product Manager, Pivotal\nStephen Levine\nStaff Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
