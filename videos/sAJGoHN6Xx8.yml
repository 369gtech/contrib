description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nDetlef Vollmann “Executors for C++ - A Long Story Stuggling for a Base Concurrency Building Block”\n--\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nExecutors will be a base building block in C++ for asynchronous, concurrent and parallel work. The job of an executor is simple: run the tasks that are posted. So the first proposals for executors in C++ had a very simple interface. However, being a building block, the executor should provide an interface that's useful for all kind of higher level abstractions and needs to work together with different types of concurrency, like co-operative multi-tasking or GPU like hardware. This presentation will look at the evolution of the executor proposals for C++ and what they'll provide for normal application programmers.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
