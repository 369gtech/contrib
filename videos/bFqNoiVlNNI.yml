description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nWhen the Tekton Cat Misbehaves – Pitfalls, Mistakes, and Lessons Learned - Mark Nuttall, IBM \n\nThe Tekton project provides Kubernetes resources for declaring and launching CI/CD pipelines. You and your team's skills in working with Kubernetes can be applied directly to building and maintaining your CI/CD system. This is great once it's all set up and working - but a new kitten will sometimes misbehave! Tekton's design, and its Kubernetes-native implementation can make it fail in peculiar, distinctive ways. In this talk we'll show how Tekton can go wrong, explain why, and demonstrate how to fix it. We'll also use these failure modes to talk more generally about the strengths and weaknesses of Tekton's custom resource-based approach. We'll highlight the best methods and tools for debugging in this environment, and look forward to the key improvements needed - and planned - to raise a truly well-behaved CI/CD system.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZenL"
