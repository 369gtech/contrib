description: "What does it take to protect your laptop, to keep your data secure, and to maintain your trust into your device while traveling abroad?\n\nYou probably have seen the cool crowd covering their built-in laptop webcams with geeky stickers. You heard them obsessing about hackers attacking their laptops with backdoored laptop chargers or malicious USB-cables. What if you’re not satisfied with stopping there at securing your device – how would holistic Laptop security look like?\n\nWhat if you want to get control back over your laptop, its operating system, its built-in devices like webcams, microphones, and network interfaces? What if you don’t want to worry anymore about sophisticated malware attacks reprogramming internal memories like BIOS firmware, SSD-firmware, keyboard controllers for becoming persistent? What if you don’t like to worry about sophisticated attackers with physical access to your machine while leaving it unattended in a hotel room or your car?\n\nIn this talk, we show how to configure your laptop securely – in anticipation of highly sophisticated attackers with physical access. Moreover, we will demonstrate modern hardware virtualization features for getting control back over your privacy and data. We explain how to use Linux based hardware virtualization features for trusted control of network interfaces, integrated audio- and video devices of a Windows 10 installation. We will show how internal and external hardware security features can improve contemporary disk encryption security – and how to get secure boot right.\n\n=== \n\nI am interested in hardware & embedded software security, protocols and security projects around mobile devices and the Internet of Things. I consider myself a hardware hacker. Before joining DarkMatter I was leading the Arm Research Security group where I worked on advanced IoT security solutions to allow detection and remote recovery from attacks or malware infection on embedded devices. One of my earlier security projects at Arm was the ARMmbed uVisor, a secure hypervisor that enforces hardware security boundaries between embedded software components using the ARMv7M memory protection unit on contemporary ARM Cortex M3/M4 microcontrollers. I have co-founded in 2006 open hardware projects like OpenBeacon.org and OpenPCD.org and designed the first open Active RFID reader hardware design to enable sophisticated research on human interaction and the spread of diseases as part of SocioPatterns.org. My open hardware OpenPCD RFID reader & sniffer designs targeting security researcher were used to break MIFARE Classic security. I had fun breaking HID’s iCLASS RFID reader & card security to make my point about security by obscurity and the treatment of fellow security researchers. As one of the three maintainers of the former Xbox-Linux Project I helped breaking the Xbox security in 2002 and ported the first Linux System to the Xbox. I enjoy designing secure ultra low power wireless devices with privacy-enabled protocols and services."
