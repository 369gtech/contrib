description: "In Agile we do not manage project. It is the sentence you heard the most when you work in PMO, in an Agile environment. So what do we then ? How bigger “initiative” are managed in an huge Agile organization? Can’t we really use a discipline, with already many lessons learned, to help success our Agile organizations?\n\nAbout the speaker: Passionate about Project Management as a discipline and of Agile as a Mindset, I am constantly working on combining them to gather the best of those two to deliver better product to customers.\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/denis-vanpoucke-csp-b17564a5"
