Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nApplication portability is a growing consideration among enterprises as the array of private, public, and hybrid cloud options continue to expand. Containers are gaining favor as the best approach to application portability, notably as a way to work around the issues of virtualization.\n\nRavi Alluboyina, Senior Architect at Robin.io, will focus on Application modernization, speak about why container-based portability is beneficial, and show a demo around portability across clouds for your Kubernetes based stateful workloads.\n- Learn what it takes to run Stateful applications such as Hadoop or Oracle RAC on Kubernetes\n- Understand how to backup your Kubernetes-based databases to the Cloud\n- See a demo of how to move an application such as Cassandra, MongoDB, MariaDB, or CouchDB from one cloud to the other"
