title: '#ChefConf 2014: Joe Nuspl, "Building Authoritative Resource Sets"--SFW'
language: English
recordingDate: 1400783721
description: "Chef is additive by nature. Removing resource definitions from recipes will not remove the resources from the system. This can be confusing for beginner chefs. An authoritative resource set is a term used to describe a resource set containing only the resources defined in the chef recipes.\n\nThe \"zap\" pattern emerged as a way to build authoritative resource sets. The LWRPs from the zap cookbook, https://github.com/nvwls/zap, will be presented as well as various use cases."
