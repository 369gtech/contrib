Managing config files isn't trivial. Distributed debugging; a mystery. Dev clusters are tricky to set up, and sharing cluster state among team-members is mostly fiction.\nL Körbes, an expert in Kubernetes development tooling, outlines successful development workflows in three different settings: a very large enterprise, a small and agile startup, and a popular open source project.\nL will share how they set up dev clusters, manage configs, automate the development feedback loop, share context across teams, debug, and, finally, deploy to production.\nCome learn how these teams made their Kubernetes dev workflows not only seamless, but amazing to use [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n04:24 WHOAMI\n04:57 The problem set\n05:21 The protagonists\n06:33 Development clusters\n13:55 Managing configuration files\n17:07 Feedback loop automation\n25:28 Problem solving (single player)\n28:47 Problem solving (multi player)\n32:09 Custom workflows\n35:35 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2021/sessions/1755/toolchains-behind-successful-kubernetes-development-workflows\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nLiz Rice • Container Security • https://amzn.to/3oU4iJe\nLiz Rice • Kubernetes Security • https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-security/9781492039075\nBrendan Burns, Joe Beda & Kelsey Hightower • Kubernetes: Up and Running • https://amzn.to/3wrtwlp\nChris Richardson • Microservices Patterns • https://amzn.to/2SOnQ7h\nJohn Arundel & Justin Domingus • Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes • https://amzn.to/3hKZvI5\nMichael Hausenblas & Stefan Schimanski • Programming Kubernetes • https://amzn.to/3qTvKch\nSam Newman • Monolith to Microservices • https://amzn.to/2Nml96E\nSam Newman • Building Microservices • https://amzn.to/3dMPbOs\nRonnie Mitra & Irakli Nadareishvili • Microservices: Up and Running• https://amzn.to/3c4HmmL Mitra, Nadareishvili, McLarty & Amundsen • Microservice Architecture • https://amzn.to/3fVNAb0\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Kubernetes #k8s #Containers #CloudNative #IDE #CNCF #FeedbackLoop #ConfigFiles #Debug #Helm\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
