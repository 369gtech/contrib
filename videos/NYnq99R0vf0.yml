title: '100 deploys per day (Dmytro Voloshyn, Ukraine) [UA]'
recordingDate: 1577306269
description: "At Preply we have adopted the culture of quick iterations as a central part of our delivery process. The approach impacted both developers’ culture and organization’s ability to deliver value to the end customers.\n\nThis talk will be focused around the evolution we went through with our delivery approach, and the benefits and challenges daily releases have thrown up. We will also discuss tooling around daily releases (CI/CD tools, logging, monitoring), infrastructure (k8s, aws) and the best practices (feature switchers, architecture, ab/testing).\n\nWe will also share insights on the role of the performance optimizations to make daily releases viable."
