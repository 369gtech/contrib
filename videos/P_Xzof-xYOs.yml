recordingDate: 1614437915
description: "You should never write an authoritative DNS server, but if you do, Erlang is a pretty good choice of language for implementing one. In this talk I will explain why we selected Erlang to develop our new authoritative DNS server for DNSimple. I will show you features of the language that were beneficial to the development of the system and I will present examples of code demonstrating how those features are used.\n\nI will also cover some of the challenges we faced when developing the application, including how we identified and overcame specific performance bottlenecks.\n\nAnthony Eden\nAetrion LLC dba DNSimple\n@aeden\n\n\nAnthony Eden is the founder of DNSimple and the perpetrator of numerous open source projects such as erl-dns, ActiveWarehouse and Rails SQL Views.
