recordingDate: 1592579127
description: "Linkerd, an ultralight service mesh for Kubernetes, is an open source, open governance CNCF project. With Linkerd, you can add security, observability and reliability features to your Kubernetes application without changing any code using features like gRPC load balancing, transparent mutual TLS, retries and golden metrics to observe exactly what is going on with your services.\n\nJoin us for this 60 minute tech classroom to get a brief overview of the service mesh and why you need one in today's cloud-native world. You will also learn more about Linkerd on OKE and how you can:\n\nDeploy Linkerd on OKE in less than 60 seconds \n\nLearn why Linkerd2-proxy was built in Rust for maximum performance and security\n\nTake back control of your microservices with a uniform, global view of service behavior regardless of how your applications are written\n\nCharles Pretzer\nField Engineer\nBuoyant"
