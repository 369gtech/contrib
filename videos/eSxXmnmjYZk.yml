description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotswift.io on January 28th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nAre your apps \"Pure Swift\"? Don't be so sure. Daniel demonstrates the extent to which Swift apps on iOS and Mac are dependent on legacy Objective-C conventions. He talks through scenarios where Swift facilitates interoperation, and how you can finesse the details. Stay tuned: he ends with a debugging trick that everybody will enjoy!"
