description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nNavigating the App Delivery Landscape While Solving Everyday Problems - Lei Zhang, Alibaba & Alois Reitbauer, Dynatrace \n\nRecently there was a lot of buzz around the CNCF landscape getting overly complex. There are more and more options to choose from which is good to see a growing ecosystem. However, this can sometimes also become overwhelming. In this session we walk through major challenges that people are facing and show how they can be solved with projects available today. We will look into scenarios from defining your application all the way to running it in production. Whether you are just about to start running applications on Kubernetes or want to improve your skills. This session will help you to identify what to consider when building app platforms, share good practices, compare different approaches and give you an interactive and quick tour through the CNCF landscape with a focus on delivering and running applications. You will also get some demo code samples to try everything hands on and have a reference to get started with your own projects. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekFr"
