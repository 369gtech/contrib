description: "As someone who has been an early member of two data science teams, I’ve spent a lot of time developing good processes and practices for running a data science team. I’ll give you some concrete tips on helping your team write production code. This talk is aimed at anyone (whether you are a manager or individual contributor) who wants their team to run more smoothly.\n\nMany data scientists who are used to working independently struggle when transitioning to teams. This talk is about best practices for processes on data science teams, taken from two teams I've worked on. Some topics I’ll cover are: tracking your work, organizing your code, and deploying models. These tips are meant to be utilized by any teammate including managers and individual contributors.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
