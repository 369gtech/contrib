description: "The Collections Framework was introduced in JDK 1.2 back in 1998 and is still in heavy use today. Although its fundamentals remain unchanged, it has evolved considerably since its introduction, and it continues to evolve. This presentation will describe some of the recent enhancements made to Collections, particularly the lambda-capable default methods added in Java 8. The presentation will also cover enhancements currently in development for Java 9, including JEP 269, Convenience Factory Methods, a library-based API that serves the purpose of collection literals. Finally, the presentation will provide a glimpse at some several possible futures for the Collections Framework.\n\nStuart Marks is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Java Platform Group at Oracle. He is currently working on a variety of JDK core libraries projects, including Collections, Lambda, and Streams, as well as improving test quality and performance. As his alter ego \"Dr Deprecator\" he also works on the Java SE deprecation mechanism. He has previously worked on JavaFX and Java ME at Sun Microsystems. He has over twenty years of software platform product development experience in the areas of window systems, interactive graphics, and mobile and embedded systems. Stuart holds a Master's degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University.\n\nRelated blog https://blogs.oracle.com/java//collections-refueled"
