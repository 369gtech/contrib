recordingDate: 1526228441
description: "Speaker: Erin Braswell\n\nWhat do geiger counters, black holes, heart monitors, and volcanoes have in common?  They all can use sound to convey information! This talk will explore using python for sonification: the process of translating data into sound that could otherwise be represented visually. Have you ever wondered how to use python to represent data other than making charts and graphs?  Are you a musician looking for inspiration in the world around you?  This talk will go over how to use python to translate time series data to MIDI that can be played back in real time. Weâ€™ll sonically interpret light-curve data from the Kepler space telescope using pygame, MIDIUtil, and astropy, turning points on a graph into a musical masterpiece! Come learn about how data sonification is used to help people, to expand the reach of scientific research, and to create music from data.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
