description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nI will discuss machine learning as it is applied to healthcare. The particular focus of my talk is on the limitations of pure machine learning approaches when it comes to biological systems. I will compare this with pure mathematical model-based approaches, which on the one hand appear more suitable but ultimately have their own attendant set of problems. I will finish up with hybrid approaches.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
