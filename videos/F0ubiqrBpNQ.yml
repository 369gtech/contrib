description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nThe Tech Coach strikes back\n\nIn the past years we have been overwhelmed by agile coaches bombarding us with important stuff like the optimal length of a sprint, how to rip off a Post-It and why we should use CAPITAL letters on story cards. The question is, will that help us write better code? Will it make our programs more maintainable? Probably not. Nevertheless, organizations spend barrows of money on agile coaches, but not a single dime on technical coaching. This lunatic must come to an end and now is the time for us developers to fight back and protect our right to grow in the art of creating code. Taking its starting-point in the XP-principles this session will explain what technical coaching is, why you should do it and how it could be done through mob programming sessions.\n\nTobias Modig, Citerus\n\nTobias Modig is a developer, coach, speaker and teacher who values clean code and good habits just as much as a positive work atmosphere. He is passionate about competence sharing and will gladly reveal his tips and tricks as well as confiding his own mistakes to prevent others from repeating them. Tobias has been working as a developer and architect since the late 90s and is currently a Software Development Consultant at Citerus."
