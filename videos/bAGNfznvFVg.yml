title: 'Oren Eini - Seeking simplicity in the cloud'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619690618
description: "\"Kubernetes? Containers? Serverless systems?\nDeploying to the cloud comes with its own unique set of challenges and a somewhat insurmountable set of tools, techniques, and methods for managing, deploying, and working with your application in a cloud environment.\n\nFor the most part, such systems appear horrendously overcomplicated. The number of steps and know-how you need to deploy the simplest application using \"modern cloud-native technology\" is far too complex. \n\nWhat is worse, all those layers, configuration knobs, and deployment options only make sense if you are trying to build stuff at a massive scale and complexity. At which point, you'll already replace much of the generic infrastructure with the things you really need.\"\n\nIn this talk, Oren Eini is going to talk about the internal architecture of RavenDB Cloud, RavenDB as a Service, running on AWS, Azure, and GCP. We'll look into the internal architecture, explore the design pressures that led to certain decisions and see how we can create a multi-cloud environment that is simple to operate and manage by removing all the craft from the system."
