title: 'Four real world streaming application architectures (Tim Berglund, Confluent)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1504534465
description: "Streaming systems have begun to move past trivial implementations of distributed message queues into more comprehensive architectures that model changed data as a first-class citizen, rather than try to hide changes behind update-in-place databases. This is not an uncommon way of modeling behavior inside a single application, but is a new paradigm in the distributed systems thinking of most engineers.\nIn this talk, we’ll consider four real-world streaming architectures based on Apache Kafka. We’ll look at the particular problems posed by the four different use cases, and how the systems solved them, with reference to features of Kafka, Kafka Streaming, and where appropriate, open-source extensions like Kafka Connect and schema features."
