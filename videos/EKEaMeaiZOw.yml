description: "The CIO of ING presents on the Agile DevOps transformation and their focus on IT talent. http://ITRevolution.com. This is his presentation at the DevOps Enterprise Summit in London 2016.\n\n\nRon van Kemenade - Nothing Beats Engineering Talent…The AGILE Transformation at ING\n\n\nING’s Global Chief Information Officer (CIO) Ron van Kemenade overseas over 10,000 IT staff members (including externals.) He’s responsible for all banking technology at ING. ING serves over 34 million customers globally - showing that Agile transformation is scalable to large organizations.\n\n\nRon opened his presentation with the “We love IT” video highlighting ING’s milestones during the transition to DevOps. He goes on to explain that in order to serve ING’s mission of empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and business, their IT would need to change to serve that strategy.\n\n\nAfter attending the Google I/O, Ron van Kemenade returned inspired to transform IT at ING. He started with a small mobile development team.\n\n\n“If you want to make clear the impact of your change, you don’t put ten people in a row and all at the same time make a small step. Everybody moves at the same pace forward. So instead of that we asked one team to make a huge step forward. One meter in front of the other nine. Then everybody notices. And then you need to allow other teams to copy their behavior.\n\n\nBy focusing on internal talent, ING has become more responsive to customer needs.\n\n\nRon van Kemenade, CIO, ING Bank\n\n\nShare this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKEaMeaiZOw&index=5&list=PLvk9Yh_MWYuzAfazAe6m8uE-_lVvshjX6\n\nShare your experience with DevOps or DOES16 in the comments below.\n\nDOES16 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
