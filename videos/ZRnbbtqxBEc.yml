In this video, members of the team give an overview of how they turned an interface that allows researchers to interactively evaluate their music generation models into a fun and powerful creative tool for musicians called \"AI Jam\". This interface won the Best Demo award at the 2017 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) and is freely available on Magenta's GitHub site.  \n\nWatch more Machine Learning videos here: https://goo.gl/KewA03\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5"
