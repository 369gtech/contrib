description: "Slides and more info: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2016/evelina-gabasova\n\nLet's dive together into the the world of Star Wars! We'll use the force of F# to process publicly available datasets relating to the Star Wars movies and we'll find out who's the most important character in the stories and why were the prequels so unsuccessful. On the way, you'll see why F# is a great language for data science - from preprocessing the data to visualizing them - and you'll also learn how you can use similar data processing pipelines to get interesting insights from your own data."
