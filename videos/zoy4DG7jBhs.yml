title: '#HITB2021AMS COMMSEC D2 - 5G Networks And Interconnect Threats - Martin Kacer'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623371930
description: "Roaming N32 interconnect between 5G SA (Standalone) core networks is one of the crucial external interfaces connecting carriers on which security by design was one of the key aspects by 3GPP standardization. Despite the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity protection of 5G interconnects, there is still need for application-level filtering by 5G signalling firewall on the network edge. This talk will cover some of the 5G security risks with focus on signalling interconnect messages which could cause harm in similar way like their predecessor protocols (SS7/Diameter/GTP-C) affecting user privacy and exposing networks.\n\n=== \n\nMartin Kacer is a Security Researcher, with more than 15 years of experience in telecom security. He made several key contributions to GSMA security guidelines related to interconnect signalling of mobile networks and was a member of the GSMA FASG working group calling for the 5G interconnect security. He is the author of open-source Signalling firewall and was designing the telecom signalling threat intelligence, IDS-es, signalling vulnerability scanners, fraud detection, and in the past developing network elements and signalling probes. He conducted many security missions such as pentests and security audits in the Telecom domain."
