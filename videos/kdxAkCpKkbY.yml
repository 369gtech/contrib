description: "RustConf 2018 - Embedding Rust in C/C++ by Katharina\n\nWe all know that using C/C++ code in Rust is not too complicated. extern \"C\", bindgen and build.rs scripts make this pretty easy. But letâ€™s challenge ourselves: what about the other way around? There are huge C and C++ projects that could use some corrosion.\n\nIn this talk I will not just show simple examples of how to use Rust modules inside larger C/C++ applications, the common pitfalls you will encounter, and to deal with them."
