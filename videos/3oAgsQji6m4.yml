description: "Andrew Williams\n\nCreate 3D rendered animations in a few lines of Python, for teaching concepts in Physics and Astronomy. Let your students write some simple code to, for example, model the movement of a bouncing ball due to gravity, and with only a couple of lines of extra code, actually render and animate the ball.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/3d-rendering-with-python\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nFri Aug  2 14:50:00 2019 at C3.4 & C3.5"
