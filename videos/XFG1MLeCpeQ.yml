title: 'TypeScript for C++ programmers - Ã“lafur Waage - NDC TechTown 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635790135
description: 'First appearing in 2012, TypeScript has grown a lot in the past 9 years and looking at how the language operates is a great exercise for C++ programmers. We will go over basic usage and compare it to similar functionality in C++, explore the type system the language offers, look at the environment the language lives in and it''s relation to JavaScript and then we will look at the development tooling that is available. This talk will hopefully teach you a few new things about the language and maybe it will open some doors in the future regarding language choices or how you approach problem-solving.'
