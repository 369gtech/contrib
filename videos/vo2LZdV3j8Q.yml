description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nIn this talk, we give an overview over a project that we are conducting at SAP. The goal of this project is to build a Scala-based application development stack that enables developers to easily build cloud applications that integrate with SAP systems. The application development stack we are building embraces Scala all over the place â€“ including the development of user interfaces for which Scala.js is utilized to provide a type-safe interface to SAP's own JavaScript UI library SAP UI5. Our stack is tailored to the needs of application developers who work within the SAP ecosystem and focuses on simplicity, for instance, provided by embedded domain-specific languages.\n\nAfter a brief overview of how we are using Scala within our project at SAP, we deep dive into one particular subproject that we also recently released as an open-source library called \"Dive\". The library provides functionality for functional-reactive programming as descriped in Ingo Maier and Martin Odersky's article 'Deprecating the Observer Pattern' from 2010. We use this library within our UI library."
