This hands-on video workshop shows you how to design faceted navigation, a powerful system that enables users to narrow their search results with filters. Host Jim Kalbach, Principal UX Designer with Citrix, also shows you how to design facets directly into your navigation, so that users can browse by facets before they even start to search.\n\nFaceted navigation improves the discoverability of your content dramatically throughout the entire user experience—but its design is more intricate than many people assume. You’ll learn how to deal with many hidden challenges, such as displaying large amounts of metadata, determining where and how you should display filters, and creating simple interactions that average users will understand.\n\nThrough exercises, examples (good and bad), and a clear, structured framework for understanding individual components, you’ll learn how to include facets in your UI design, whether it’s for desktop, mobile, or both. \n\nYou’ll learn:\n\n• The benefits of faceted navigation and ROI\n• The process for analyzing and documenting facets\n• How to use examples to lay out navigation on a page\n• Ways to show more values\n• Designing the interaction with faceted navigation\n• Multiple selections and grey ends\n• Mobile design concerns\n• Facet implementation concerns\n\nJim Kalbach is a speaker, writer, and instructor on user experience, information architecture, and business design. During his years in Germany, he helped found local UX groups in Hamburg, and organized conferences throughout the country and elsewhere in Europe. Jim is the author of Designing Web Navigation (O’Reilly). He blogs at www.experienceinformation.com\n\n\nDon't miss an upload!
