description: "PyData London Meetup #56 \nTuesday, May 7, 2019 \n\nA hands-on session in building and assessing predictive models that also produce uncertainty estimates of a their prediction, such as: predictive intervals, and fully probabilistic supervised predictions including Bayesian predictive posteriors. Starting with a gentle theoretical overview introduction on what are, how to make, and how to evaluate probabilistic classification/regressioÂ­n models, followed by a demo of the skpro package, \"scikit-learn for probabilistic supervised learning\".\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL \n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
