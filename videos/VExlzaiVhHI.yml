description: "Gustavo Durand, Technical Lead / Architect, Harvard University\nMichael Bar-Sinai, Fellow, The Institute of Quantiative Social Science at Harvard University\n\nStoring sensitive data has always been tricky, but with the GDPR, Cambridge Analytica, and users who finally care about where their data goes, developers and product managers alike need to start taking note. These matters are not new to this session’s speakers; in the last few years, Dataverse, a research data repository system developed at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University, has been preparing to store and share sensitive datasets. This presentation looks at various aspects of handling sensitive information: legal, engineering, UI/UX, operations. You’ll hear about preparing Dataverse to manage sensitive data covered by HIPAA, FERPA, and other intimidating acronyms."
