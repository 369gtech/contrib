description: "Personal growth and the Python community\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-30 - Brian]\n[Online]\n\nBy Yashasvi Misra\n\nI owe both my personal and professional growth to communities. As an engineering student in computer science, the first open tech community I joined was PyLadies. I have since then been actively involved in the Python community, always trying to learn and grow. Little did I expect how beneficial that would be. In this session, I will share my journey with the Python community, the impact it had on me, and how it boosted my self-confidence. If you donâ€™t know where to start, join me to explore what I have learned so far.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
