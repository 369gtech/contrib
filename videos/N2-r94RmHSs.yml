title: '#HITB2021AMS COMMSEC OPENING - Shaping The Future Of The 0Day Market - Andrea Zapparoli Manzoni'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623120875
description: "The 0-day vulnerability market developed over the years in a “bottom-up” way that is unsafe, chaotic and rather inefficient. Bad business practices, lack of professionalism and low levels of trust are still spread in this market even today, and can seriously hamper the ability of Law Enforcement and Intelligence Agencies to acquire and maintain strategic cyber capabilities in order to fight organized crime, terrorism and hostile geopolitical actors.\n\nHaving a deep understanding of these issues and of their solutions, Crowdfense is “shaping the future 0day market” by creating a better working environment for all the parties involved (researchers, brokers, integrators and end users), by introducing new platforms (as the Vulnerability Research Hub and the upcoming Vulnerability Research Marketplace) and new quality standards / best practices related to products and services, in order to improve significantly the sustainability of the underlying business.\n\nThis session will share how Crowdfense is doing this, why, what are the results, some statistics about the 0-day market and what our next steps are going to be.\n\n=== \n\nAndrea Zapparoli Manzoni manages Crowdfense Limited, which he designed in 2017 with a multidisciplinary team of ethical hackers, lawyers and vulnerability researchers.\n\nThe company’s main goal is to develop and apply new standards and processes to the vulnerability trading industry, which has become too strategic and complex to be managed with the old “crafts of the trade” methods. After more than two decades working in, studying in and consulting in the industry, Manzoni realized that there had to be a smarter and safer way to buy and sell active cyber-defense capabilities and decided to launch the Crowdfense Vulnerability Research Hub.\n\nSince 2012, he has served as a board member of Clusit (Italian ICT Security Association). In 2011, he started an in-depth analysis of the most severe national and international cyber-attacks (researching and classifying more than 7,700 attacks over 84 months). This work is published in Clusit’s yearly “Report on ICT Security.” To his great surprise, over the last seven years, this research has become a reference for private and public organizations in Italy and abroad."
