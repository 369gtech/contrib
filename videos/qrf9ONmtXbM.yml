description: "Almost two decades after the birth of JavaScript, I will give an update to my \"JavaScript at 17\" keynote last year, including the latest on the next version of the JS language, ES6. I'll then show where the JS leading edge is going: ASM.js, a compiler technology for translating C and C++ programs including high-end games into JS and WebGL. I will close by talking about how JS can satisfy all these demands and remain a coherent, healthy, and extremely popular programming language.\n\n- Don't miss an upload!
