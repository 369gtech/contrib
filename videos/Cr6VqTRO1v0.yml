description: "How is a total beginner supposed to get started learning machine learning? I'm going to describe a 3 month curriculum to help you go from beginner to well-versed in machine learning. Its an accelerated learning plan, something i'd create for myself if I were to get started today, but I'm going to open source it for you guys. This curriculum will cover all the math concepts, the machine learning theory, and the deep learning theory to get you up to speed with the field as fast as possible. If anyone asks how to best get started with machine learning, direct them to this video! \n\nCurriculum from this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months\n\nPlease Subscribe!
