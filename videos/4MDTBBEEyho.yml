description: "The biggest challenge of Deep Learning technology is the scalability. As long as using single GPU server, you have to wait for hours or days to get the result of your work. This doesn’t scale for production service, so you need a Distributed Training on the cloud eventually. Google has been building infrastructure for training the large scale neural network on the cloud for years, and now started to share the technology with external developers. In this session, we will introduce new pre-trained ML services such as Cloud Vision API and Speech API that works without any training. Also, we will look how TensorFlow and Cloud Machine Learning will accelerate custom model training for 10x – 40x with Google’s distributed training infrastructure.\n\nGuillaume Laforge is a Developer Advocate at @Google for @GoogleCloud during the day, and @ApacheGroovy programming language project PMC Chair at night."
