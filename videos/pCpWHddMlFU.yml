description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/qafest/\nНаш сайт: www.qafest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции QA Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nOur online communications with family, friends & business are increasing both in volume and number of applications we use. While a majority still don't know 2-factor authentication or end-to-end encryption, more and more people are using secure messengers like Signal, Whatsapp and Wire. However unencrypted email is still the most common way of transferring information and files over the Internet. This talk will give you an overview of key technologies & their implementations in various messengers. Last but not least I will show you how email can be made more secure in the future, based on existing standards that may become mandatory in all of EU within a few years."
