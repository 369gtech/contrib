Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nBuilding a Database as a Service on Kubernetes - Abhi Vaidyanatha & Lucy Burns, PlanetScale \n\nStateful, scalable storage on Kubernetes is an unsolved problem. Creating it as a service is even more difficult. The cloud-native ecosystem offers many tools such as the operator-sdk, Prometheus, Grafana, etcd, Vitess, and much more, but integrating them isn't necessarily intuitive.  Two of PlanetScale's employees that have engineered and managed the project describe the journey of leveraging all of these open source technologies to build out a database as a service on Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uabw"
