description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nManaging stateful services in Kubernetes is difficult. The Operator pattern has been created to deal with this, but existing frameworks require users to have intimate knowledge of Go and Kubernetes controller patterns. The Kubernetes Universal Declarative Framework (KUDO) is an operator development toolkit and runtime that makes writing operators productive and simple, enabling operator developers and end users to use tools they already know to manage the stateful services work with. This webinar will introduce KUDO, demonstrate the operator development toolkit, and show existing operators that have been written with KUDO."
