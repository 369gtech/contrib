description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nOmer Kilic - Embedded Systems Engineer at Erlang Solutions\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Actor Model has interesting properties that could be used for dealing with complexities posed by modern embedded systems. Using actors as compositional units to describe these systems is a new proposal which stands out and challenges conventional approaches.\n\nThis talk will demonstrate how, creating a layered architecture for hardware modules and partitioning up complex systems in smaller units, testing becomes much easier, runtime errors are contained, and the architecture becomes maintainable.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
