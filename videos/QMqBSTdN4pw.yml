description: "TestCon Moscow 2017 Conference, April 27. www.testconf.ru\n\nTransitioning from the monolithic technology era to microservices implementation, one key component is the service oriented architecture (SOA) principle. At the core of SOA lie services which enable various consumer and clients to access the same functionality provided by a back-end server.
