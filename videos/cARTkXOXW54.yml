description: "by Jaana Dogan (JBD)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB2.252A/critical_path_analysis.webm\n\n\nComplexity in coding and system design should be defeated until it is possible to do. Some problems are complex in nature and it is expensive to build and maintain solutions for problems in this category. Observability provides us tools to see our architectures from a different perspective. It is not just helping us to troubleshoot but also self-document our architectural decisions and help us to improve the most significant execution paths.

Observability provides us tools to see our architectures from a different perspective. It is not just helping us to troubleshoot but also self-document our architectural decisions and help us to improve the most significant execution paths. \n\nAgenda of the talk:\n- Give motivation why systems get more complex.\n- How to deal with complexity?\n- What else to do if complexity is in the nature of the problem?\n- Introduce critical path analysis as a solution.\n- Explain the organizational and technical challenges of critical path analysis.\n- Conclude by summarizing the pros/cons of critical path analysis. \n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:30:00+01"
