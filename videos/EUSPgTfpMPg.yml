title: 'NRTG: Fast, Systematic & Scalable Flink Application Development at Pinterest'
recordingDate: 1635787802
description: "Flink applications processing millions of messages per second, built in days with 3x smaller client code and 4x lower time to prod than the Datastream API and a fully testable, CI/CD enabled lifecycle to boot - whatâ€™s not to like! Come listen to how Pinterest systematically enables developing Flink applications at scale. We will talk (for the first time) about our in-house framework - Near Realtime Galaxy (NRTG) - that builds composable, large-scale, dependency injection based stream applications and the platform it enables. We will discuss our experiences while building NRTG on Flink - happy topics like Serialization, Async RPCs, Error Recovery, Late Data, Backfills and demo our dev to prod process: a CI/CD based lifecycle with automated checks, health monitoring and minimal manual intervention.\n\n0:00 Pinterest Architecture & Business Requirements\n3:40 What is NRTG, Why NRTG\n9:30 The Fast, Systematics and Scalable Promise\n21:13 Onboarding Outcomes\n22:56 CI/CD in the Future"
