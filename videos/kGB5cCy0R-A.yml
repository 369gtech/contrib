description: "by José Manuel Ortega\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1308/testing_nodejs_security.webm\n\n\nNodeJS is one of the fastest growing platforms nowdays and from a security point of view is necessary to know all posibilities that the platform offers to developers.This is a talk that explains some of the most common problems in NodeJS applications and how using frequently used tools it is possible to exploit such vulnerabilities.Also I will show what are the main vulnerabilities we can found and how we can fix them in our applications. These could be the talking points: \n\n-Node.js security packages \n\nI will comment how to protect express applications in terms of authentication, logging ,middleware and security best practices before put applications in production \n\n-How to prevent OWASP TOP 10 in a NodeJS application In this point I will comment the OWASP NodeGoat project that provides an environment to learn OWASP Top 10 security risks. I will comment the main risks we can find in nodejs applications from a attacker perspective. \n\nhttps://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat \n\n-Tools which will help to protect our node applications like NodeJSScan allow detecting vulnerabilities following some predefined rules \n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 14:30:00+01"
