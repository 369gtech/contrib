title: 'Optimizing the Programmer: Get More Done Faster - Dave Rael'
recordingDate: 1470316316
description: "Software developers have a reputation for being unlike other humans. We eat, drink, and sleep code and aren't interested in much else and aren't very good at interacting with others of our species. This may be true of a few programmers, but for most of us, it's a misguided stereotype. We're human just like everyone else. Though geeking out about a challenging technical problem gives us a charge and is an enjoyable experience, we want more from life (though we want the tech, too).\nFurther, there's a diminishing return on each hour you spend writing software each week to the point that working more can be counterproductive. Dave Rael is passionate about getting more done in less time. Come and join Dave as he takes you on a journey of how to more effectively use your chosen tools, like Visual Studio, Windows, and Powershell and how to manage your tasks so you can get your job done and live your life. Bring your laptop to play along."
