Tamas Piros - Supercharge your JavaScript with WASM\n\nSupercharge your JavaScript with WASM Browser and Web APIs along with JavaScript have seen an incredible amount of development and progress, however there are still certain limitations that these tools face. For complex, low-level work we can utilise Web Assembly. By the end of the talk attendees will have a throughout understanding of Web Assembly, and why it's such a great option for extending the capabilities of the browser and JavaScript via a real life example.\n\n#WASM #WebAPI #Javascript\n\n2. Yoav Yanovski - Micro Frontends: Composing a Greater Whole\n\nWhat are Micro Frontends?\n\nThe term Micro Frontends first came up in ThoughtWorks Technology Radar at the end of 2016. It extends the concepts of micro services to the frontend world. The current trend is to build a feature-rich and powerful browser application, aka single page app, which sits on top of a micro service architecture. Over time the frontend layer, often developed by a separate team, grows and gets more difficult to maintain. Thatâ€™s what we call a Frontend Monolith.\n\nThe idea behind Micro Frontends is to think about a website or web app as a composition of features which are owned by independent teams. Each team has a distinct area of business or mission it cares about and specialises in. A team is cross functional and develops its features end-to-end, from database to user interface.\n\nHowever, this idea is not new. It has a lot in common with the Self-contained Systems concept. In the past approaches like this went by the name of Frontend Integration for Verticalised Systems. But Micro Frontends is clearly a more friendly and less bulky term.\n\n#Microfrontends \n\n3. Jemima Abu - Building Accessible Components in React\n\nWhen writing in JSX or building reusable components, it's tempting to wrap everything in a div tag and call it a day.\n\nHowever, this is kinda like labeling every can in your fridge 'food'; it may be easier but it's definitely not the best approach.\nIn this talk, we'll focus on the use of Semantic HTML, managing user interaction and navigation, writing unobtrusive JavaScript functions and dealing with route changes. We'll also learn about tools for accessibility testing. Finally, we'll cover the importance of accessibility and why it should always come first when building a site (hint: because the web is for everyone so everyone should be able to use it).\n\n#JSX #components"
