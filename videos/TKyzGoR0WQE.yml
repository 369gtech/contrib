description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\n\nHaving business critical logic in legacy systems appears to be the norm for many established companies these days. In this talk we will investigate why this is so and how this can hinder further innovation.\n\nI will also share experiences from our teams current project in Equinor; improving and modernising the tool for maintaining reservoir and wind farm models. I'll talk about how we have leveraged technical, as well as knowledge debt while scaling up the team. How we have tried to mitigate quality fatigue. How we have utilised strangulation patterns and abstraction to improve the code base. And last, but not least, why I believe that we will succeed in creating a better product for our users."
