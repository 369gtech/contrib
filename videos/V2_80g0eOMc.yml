description: "http://www.cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\n\"Sanitizers\" is a family of dynamic testing tools built into C++ compilers (Clang and GCC):\nAddressSanitizer finds memory errors, such as use-after-free, buffer overflows, and leaks;\nThreadSanitizer finds data races, deadlocks, and other threading bugs;\nMemorySanitizer finds uses of uninitialized memory;\nUndefinedBehaviorSanitizer finds other kinds of undefined behavior, such as use of incorrect dynamic type, shift by illegal amount and many others.\nYou will learn how these tools work, how to use them on small programs and how we deploy them in large projects.\n--\nKonstantin (Kostya) Serebryany is a Software Engineer at Google. His team develops and deploys dynamic testing tools, such as AddressSanitizer and ThreadSanitizer. Prior to joining Google in 2007, Konstantin spent 4 years at Elbrus/MCST working for Sun compiler lab and then 3 years at Intel Compiler Lab. Konstantin holds a PhD from mesi.ru and a Master from msu.ru.Twitter handle: @kayseesee\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
