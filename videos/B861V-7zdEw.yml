recordingDate: 1490335948
description: "Java 8 provides us with new APIs to support a functional programming style. While the standard provides us with a good basis, we sometimes wish for even shorter or powerful ways to write clean code for complex tasks. In this talk I will show you some additional libraries for Java 8 (and beyond) which give you this little extras here and there. I will cover a wide variety of use cases like filter/map/reduce, stream API add-ons, lambdas with unit testing, SQL query support.\n\nRabea Gransberger, MEKO-S\nRabea studied computer science and got a diploma in 2008.
