Along the way, I’ll talk about how it relates to doing language design, functional programming, object programming, language features and the “sweet spot” for using functional-first programming both as an individual and in teams.  Much of it will be other people’s code.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/don-syme\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - DON SYME\n.NET Generics, C# 2.0, F# 1.0-4.5, Async, Type Providers \n\nDon is a language designer, compiler hacker, researcher at Microsoft Mobile Tools and a contributor to F#.
