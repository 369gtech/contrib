recordingDate: 1538585438
description: "Raytheon, a multinational Defense and Cybersecurity industry leader, is on a Digital Transformation journey including expanding its use of compliant Cloud based Service Providers. Embracing Digital Transformation requires cultural shifts, regulatory considerations and new approaches toward driving Regulatory Compliance. This presentation drills into the techniques used to achieve DFARS compliance within AWS GovCloud. We will detail aspects of how to incorporate encryption into your toolchain (encrypting of stemcells, Bosh, Concourse and the Foundation), validating the encryption status of instances, and trouble-shooting common challenges faced with using Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) in a limited connectivity IaaS. This presentation will also share methods for establishing a service around compliance that enables speed and agility while providing business value. We dive into how we embraced the PCF platform and developed a service from the ground up. We also discuss the cultural shifts required for your teams, organizations and policies.\nSpeakers: Joshua Kirchmeier, Application Platform Services Manager, Raytheon\nGarrett Klok, Operator / Platform Architect, Raytheon\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
