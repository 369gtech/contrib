title: 'YOW! 2012 Zach Holman - How GitHub Works'

recordingDate: 1513434914
description: "GitHub consists of a bunch of employees who have worked at other companies in the past and despised it. Okay, maybe they weren’t all terrible jobs, but a lot of us remain skeptical of most software development practices. We do things differently at GitHub. We don’t have meetings, we don’t have managers, we don’t do traditional code review, and we aren’t always in the same room, much less on the same continent. And we couldn’t be happier about it. We ship code quickly, without a lot of red tape, and still maintain an incredibly high level of code quality. It’s a great way to keep your developers happy, and we think it can work in your company, too.\n\nZach works at GitHub. When he’s not doing that, he’s blogging, hacking on open source, and filming screencasts that are anything but “traditional” screencasts. He attracted national media fame and glory when he built Facelette, a ridiculous three-hour experiment, and lost all of it again after admitting he sometimes stays home on Friday nights and replies to support emails. Preview his talk – http://www.infoq.com/presentations/How-GitHub-Works Software Passion: I like building sh@# that matters. Professional Contributions: GitHub, Play, spark, boom, gifme.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
