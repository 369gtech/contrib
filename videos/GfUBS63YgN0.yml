description: "by Eshed Shaham\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.3.201/gamedev_spring_steam.webm\n\nThe Spring RTS Engine has been in active development since 2005. In the past few years, two of its games, Evolution RTS and Zero-K, have been released on Steam. The journey to these releases was long and difficult. Let's regale ourselves with tales of the adventures of the devs, learn many things that you shouldn't do, and also learn what to do in case you've already done what you shouldn't have.\n\nRoom: K.3.201\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 16:50:00"
