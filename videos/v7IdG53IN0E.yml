description: "Angularâ€™s Reactive Forms module gives us a lot of control and flexibility to easily build and define our forms. While looking at async data and form lifecycle events as streams, we can leverage the power of RxJS to react to these events. Presenting a non-trivial custom form control, Shmuela will show how she uses Observables when creating the form, reacting to value and state changes, and validating the input.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/shmool/reactive-powered-rxjs-with-angular-forms"
