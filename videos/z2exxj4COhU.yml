language: English
recordingDate: 1368806425
description: "Alex Faaborg \n\nThis session will provide an in-depth look at human perception and cognition, and its implications for interactive and visual design.  The human brain is purely treated as an information processing machine, and we will teach the audience its attributes, its advantages, its limitations, and generally how to hack it.  While the content will provide a deep review of recent cognitive science research, everything presented will also be grounded in example design work taken from a range of Google applications and platforms.  Specific topics will include: edge detection, gestalt laws of grouping, peripheral vision, geons and object recognition, facial recognition, color deficiencies, change blindness, flow, attention, cognitive load balancing, and the perception of time.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
