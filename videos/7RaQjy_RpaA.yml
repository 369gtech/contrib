description: "Full title - Nicolas Pierre and Ioana Gherman: Geospatial analysis made easy with PostGIS and Geoalchemy\n\nUsing geospatial data is easier than ever. Data can easily be found on open data portals or simply on Open Street Map. But how can we use this data? What kind of tools are there to store and analyse this data in an optimal manner? During this talk we will answer these questions. We will discuss particularly about PostGIS, an extension of PostgreSQL database, and GeoAlchemy, a Python library.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
