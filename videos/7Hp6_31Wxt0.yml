description: "Most presentations introducing a new language are really just language tours. A lot of interesting language features are shown but it's not always clear why one would choose to adopt that new language. This presentation looks at a number of interesting features of the language and ecosystem that are more interesting than just a fancy new for loop. No one switch languages because of a for loop. So we'll look at a number of \"big ticket\" features of the language and ecosystem that do more to distinguish Kotlin than mere syntax sugar alone can provide. It will reasonably fast paced as we try to cover as many interesting tidbits as we can get through.\n\nJustin D Lee\nRed Hat"
