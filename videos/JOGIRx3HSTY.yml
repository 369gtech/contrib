description: "Left unrestrained, your Cloud environment can be like the wild west. Traditional approval processes just slow developers down though, so how can we maintain both our agility and our compliance & organisational requirements?\n\nIn this session, you’ll learn about foundational planning decisions, controls available through policies and how to programmatically enforce standards beyond just resource templates (including configuration sprawl over time). Finally, you’ll learn about controls to prevent or manage Cloud cost blowouts.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
