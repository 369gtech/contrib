description: "Real World AngularJS recipes: beyond TodoMVC\n\nYou got captured by Angular power and simplicity, and have chosen it for your next project (or you are thinking about it). Creating a prototype with Data Binding, scopes and MVVM was relatively quick and easy. But what do you need to effectively complete and bring a complex application in Production? We will discuss practical recipes from our real world experiences for choosing between ES5, ES6 and TypeScript, designing a modular, event-driven application structure, creating or selecting components and directives, implementing authentication, managing errors and logging, testing and packaging."
