description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — This is the story map of our journey throughout our Corporate Data Department cultural transformation to create autonomous DevOps Squads managing multiple data warehouses. We went through the classic transformation axis (people, process and tools) while continuously delivering projects, supporting 24/7 production environments and having fun. We will share stories throughout more than 2 years of multiple iterations/improvements/fails/learnings by our team and with the help of other internal groups at National Bank of Canada. A lot was learned starting with our redefinition of roles, to the way our ‘source code’ (ETL) is stored in git repositories while we took control of our own software release life cycle and also experimented with database virtualization and with automated testing.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
