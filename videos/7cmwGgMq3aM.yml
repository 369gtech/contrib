recordingDate: 1493241766
description: "Introduction\n\nIn this 25 minute session you will learn more about push notifications and how we use this new progressive web app feature in our Drupal 8 distribution Open Social, to improve user engagement with our product.\n\nIn an ever evolving techscape it’s important to keep up to date with innovations. Progressive Web Apps are a new way to deliver amazing user experiences on the web. I argue that PWA are:\n\nReliable - Load instantly even in uncertain network conditions.\nFast - Respond quickly to user interactions.\nEngaging - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.\nThis new level of quality earns Progressive Web Apps a place on the user's home screen just like a native app would.\n\nBut how do we integrate this awesomeness in Open Social, our Drupal 8 distribution, and even more importantly; how can you do it too?\n\nIntended audience & takeaways\n\nThis talk is interesting for developers with a beginner to intermediate experience level. Since it’s all fairly new, there is no prior knowledge required on Progressive web apps.\n\nIn this session I include instructions and demonstrations of topics including:\n\n- Introduction to progressive web apps and the web app manifest\n- Web push and the W3C Push API\n- How Service workers work and an introduction to their basic architecture\n- Insights on push events\n- How we used the message module as a base\n- The future and contributing back to Drupal so everybody can get a taste of this\n\nAt the end there will be some time for questions.\n\nAfter this session the audience should leave the room with an insight in Progressive Web Apps. I will focus especially on how push notifications work and how people can leverage its power in their own projects."
