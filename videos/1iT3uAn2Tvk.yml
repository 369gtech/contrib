description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic has struck my ground a lot - all my projects were suddenly put on hold, teams were disbanded. And, a couple of months later, everything had to be stood up again in a few weeks! I want to share a case study of how it has been managed, what I changed after the lockdown, my challenges, mistakes, wins, lessons learned and new ways of working."
