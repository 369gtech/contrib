description: "Keynote presented by Torsten Boettjer, VP of Strategy and Innovation, Swisscom.\n\nCloud Computing and Platform as a Service (PaaS) often mean different things to different people. For Swisscom, Cloud Computing has the potential to revolutionize they way telco or network services are delivered.
