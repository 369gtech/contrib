title: 'Polyglot Alchemy: JSR 223 in Action'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433508114
description: "Today customers want to tailor applications to their specific needs, in terms of both business logic and user interface. In short, they want to inject custom code to transform a mainstream system into a platform as a service (PaaS). To support this vision, Amadeus built an extensibility framework relying on the JVM and JSR 223 to turn its business-critical solutions into a PaaS. Attend this session to hear how it dealt with JSR 223 limitations, why it picked Groovy as its favorite language, and the challenges it faced with sandboxing and hot swap on multitenant systems. The presentation also shares what Amadeus expects from invokedynamic and the coming support of JavaScript on the JVM.\n\n\nAuthors:\nFabrice Matrat\nFabrice is a Web architect in charge of code quality for a large organization (nickname Mr. Clean Code).
