description: "\"Maintaining a Python Project When It’s Not Your Job\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Shanghai]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Hynek Schlawack\n\nPyPI is a gold mine of great packages but those packages have to be written first. More often than not, projects that millions of people depend on are written and maintained by only one person. If you’re unlucky, that person is you!\n\nSo how do you square delivering a high quality Python package you can be proud of and having only limited time at your disposal? The answer is not “try harder,” the answer is to do less.\n\nThis talk will help you get there by talking about how you can make your life easier, remove causes of friction with your contributors, and empower said contributors to take over tasks that you can’t make time for anymore.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
