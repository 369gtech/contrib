description: "Many “born in the cloud” organizations started and continue with “production only” deployments. This works fine in the early stages, but leads to complications later when a more robust set of processes must be put in place.\n\nIn this session you’ll learn how to transform your “born in the cloud” Azure environment to one which has a proper development and production environment, how to ensure that your workloads are backed up and recoverable, and how to ensure that permissions and roles are configured so that coworkers have the rights that they need, rather than everyone sharing a single administrative account."
