description: "Continuous Acceleration: Why Continuous Everything Needs a Supply Chain Approach\n\nJoshua Corman, CTO, Sonatype\n\nWith continuous development, we write less code and consume more re-usable open source code. Innovation is accelerated and so is application complexity. Complexity is the enemy of quality. Poor quality creates unplanned/unscheduled work. Re-work creates a drag on development speed. It’s a continuous loop. While Agile and DevOps have made us faster and more efficient, they can only take us so far... and worse, the year of OpenSource attacks we've just had commands better practices.\n\nWhat if we could deliver applications on-time (even faster), on-budget (even more efficiently) and with a natural byproduct of more acceptable quality and risk?\n\nThe good news: other industries have figured this out with supply chain management. Applying supply chain approaches to software raises the bar on continuous goals.\n\nA few of the patterns we can take from the rigor of things like the Toyota Supply Chain:\n\nScrutinize the number and quality of your “suppliers”\nManage out avoidable risk, complexity, and code bloat\nImprove traceability and visibility\nEnsure prompt agile responses when things go wrong\nPending legislation with the Cyber Supply Chain Transparency Act makes this a particularly important topic for Federal Agencies and the ISVs and SIs who provide software to them. This session will also provide background on this act and provide practical guidance on how respond to and benefit from it.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
