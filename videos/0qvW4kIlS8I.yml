description: "GoWayFest 3.0, Minsk – July 5, 2019\nGeneral Partner - SoftSwiss (https://www.softswiss.com/)\nVideo Partner - SEMrush (https://www.semrush.com/company/)\n\nPac Man from Scratch, Daniela Petruzalek\n\nImagine that: a Pac Man clone written in Go that runs on the terminal… with emojis! The purpose of this game is actually to provide a fun way to learn the Go programming language, instead of the traditional API and/or CRUD tutorials out there.\nThis project was originally designed to be a tutorial to be used in Women Who Go meetups, but in the end it is a fun way to learn Go for all the people who are tired of CRUD tutorials as their first contact to a language. \nWhile the game itself is very simple and the use of the terminal as a \"screen\" abstracts the need for using graphical libraries, we are still able to show some powerful features like the use of goroutines and channels. \n\nFor anyone who want to have a try at PacGo: https://github.com/danicat/pacgo. There’s also a “present” branch with the source code annotated for presentations."
