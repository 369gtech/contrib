description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nMost software engineers and programmers like to spend their time\nimplementing new features and exploring new ideas. Sadly for them, 70% to 80% of a product's life cycles are spent in maintenance mode.\n\nWhy does it take so much time? Generally, of most the maintenance time is spent in code, trying to understand how the system works, building a mental model of it, so that we can later change the program safely.\n\nErlang and OTP make it possible to reduce the effort required for this maintenance. This talk will explore and suggests explanations as to why software maintenance is made better with the Erlang/OTP platform."
