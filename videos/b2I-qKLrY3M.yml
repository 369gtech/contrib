title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Drupal hosting, avalanches and risk management'
recordingDate: 1493232851
description: "Sooner or later every website goes down and when this happens enterprises could lose money, possible clients or even credibility. That is why Drupal agencies and website/business owners should have a plan how to avoid such situations and know what to do in case their websites go down. This is especially valid for big Drupal enterprise sites.\n\nAs the enterprise hosting team lead and a passionate freeride snowboarder I will share with the attendees the story of how SiteGround managed to successfully implement a risk management framework. This framework has many similarities with avalanche safety and how people address such situations up in the mountains in the backcountry. All the examples in the talk are based on real situations both in the office and up in the mountain.\n\nThe target audience of this talk consists of people who want to learn more about IT risk management but do not want or don’t have the time to read official standards such as ISO 27005 and NIST SP 800 30. Previous experience is not a requirement and newbies are most welcome. At the end of the session attendees will walk away with knowledge in the following areas:\n\n- Why do you need a risk management strategy for your Drupal business and how to create one.\n- How to put the strategy into action and identify the key players in this ongoing process.\n- Testing your risk management strategy or what to do in case of a disaster.\n- Risk management and compliance with applicable laws and regulations (FERPA, HIPAA, PCI, etc.)\n\nThis talk is perfect for the “Business” session track and the “Going for Growth” category because the bigger an organisation becomes the better it needs to get at managing risk. The people who will learn the most out of this presentation are the C-level executives but team leaders, project managers and also people working for growing companies will also benefit from the talk."
