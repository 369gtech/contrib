title: 'Veracruz: Privacy-preserving mutliparty computation using trusted hardware'
recordingDate: 1612100549
description: "Derek Miller\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/67/\n\nVeracruz is a privacy-preserving compute infrastructure.  \r\nThe infrastructure allows secret data to be fed into secret programs, which are offloaded to third parties who host the computation, and produce secret results.\r\n\r\nIn this setting, everybody is mutually distrusting and has individual concerns:\r\n- The data and program owners want to retain their secrets,\r\n- The host does not want their machine to be damaged by programs they cannot audit or monitor\r\n\r\nVeracruz uses secure enclaves as the venue for performing these computations. Trust in the enclave is established via remote attestation, which establishes a trusted public key specific to the enclave.\r\nSecret inputs (program, data) are provisioned into the enclave using the trusted public key and TLS.\r\nResults are retrieved by an appointed agent.\r\n\r\nThe identities of all participants and their roles are compiled in a mutually agreed upon global policy file. The participants identities are established using TLS client certificates embedded in the policy.\r\n\r\nPrograms are provided to the system in Web Assembly, which allows the enclave software to enforce sandboxing of the provided program.\r\n\r\nVeracruz has implemented interfaces for Arm TrustZone (running on QEMU), Intel's SGX, and Amazon Nitro Enclaves. The specific details of each platform are abstracted from the parties in the computation.\r\n\r\nMost of the project is implemented in Rust to take advantage of its improved memory safety as compared to other mainstream systems programming languages.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
