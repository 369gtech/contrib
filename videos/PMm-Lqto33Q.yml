description: "Discretionary investment managers are using an increasing number of quantitative techniques and technologies to enrich their fundamental decision making process with the vast amount of data that is available nowadays. In this talk, I will outline the motivation behind such \"quantamental\" investment approaches (where fundamental and quantitative meet), how we at Man Group think about this topic, and the lessons learned on how to implement \"quantamental\" efficiently.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
