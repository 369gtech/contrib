Phase 3: Profit! Today, cloud-native platforms like Cloud Foundry are integral to delivering on your core business strategy, but integrating their bounty of features and architectures with your business’s existing systems, processes, and people isn’t (just) an engineering problem. Hear from cloud-native leaders how you can use Lean Product Management and User-Centered Design to focus precious engineering effort on delivering platform features most valuable to your company and offering a DevOps experience that will delight software engineers and SREs alike.\n\nAbout Kyle Campos\nTwitter Tweet LinkedIn Connect  Websitelinkedin.com/in/kylecampos\nKyle is a digital transformation and cloud operations leader who for the past 20 years has worked to turn non-scalable, resource intensive and painful systems into automated, scalable and efficient systems. Currently at CSAA Insurance Kyle leads the digital security, QA, support, analytics and platform teams who are working hard to deliver to application teams all the promises of a highly available, highly performant PaaS through Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Kyle is also the Co-Founder of Commit.to and a previous speaker at CF Summit Europe and OpenStack Conf.\n\nAbout Clayton Hynfield\nA graduate of philosophy and engineering physics, Clayton has never been comfortable confined to a box. Since the birth of Web 2.0, he has enjoyed marrying engineering with design, development with operations. Clayton has helped to build platform product teams central to transformation at two Fortune 100 companies, and now brings to bear cloud-native architectures and teams at many others with Pivotal.\n\nAbout Sean Keery\nSean began hacking obscure video game systems at the age of 13. Sean then developed interpersonal skills while teaching snowboarding. Nowadays we've got Cloud Foundry, choreography, containers and plenty of io. Cluster deployments, IaaS independence and his studies for a Masters in Data Science keep Sean occupied. The daily commute is filled with podcasts and chipmunk bunny hops. Some family time, spicy food, a good book and wrecking the latest toys keep Sean busy at home.\n\nAbout Kevin Mackett\nKevin is a Product Manager with Pivotal Cloud Foundry Solutions who helps platform teams manage Cloud Foundry as a product by working from an agile backlog driven by the voice of their customers. He comes to this role after holding just about every job related to “Product” as a Product Manager, Product Owner, Component Owner, and Manager of Product Owners in spaces ranging from end user facing UI software to microservice based middleware to Operations. In a former life Kevin was an Enterprise Agile coach working with teams and executives in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nAbout Jai Schniepp\nJai is a Sr. Product Owner for Cloud and Security at Liberty Mutual. \nShe’s an AWS product maven and an agile pro who's spent over a decade partnering with like-minded practitioners to introduce CI/CD practices, cloud native solutions, and deliver products that drive developers further up the value line. Her entire career is based on managing and building technical products from a non-technical perspective. Customer point of view and the developer experience are her everything--yet she still wants to be an astronaut."
