title: 'MLconf Online 2020: Adversarial Examples, Defense Methods for Online Fraud Detection by Nitin Sharma'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620924378
description: 'With the temporally evolving and diverse nature of fraud patterns in online payment systems, optimizing explicitly for recognition and defense against such attacks has assumed greater precedence. This talk introduces a cohort of domain-oriented adversarial attacks based on poisoning and evasion techniques. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of such cohorts in surpassing the attack capabilities of isolated attack frameworks. To proactively neutralize ensemble-oriented attacks, defensive procedures are demonstrated. Lastly, key challenges and applications in effective deployment of such models in large-scale fraud detection systems to identify temporally evolving attacks will be broadly addressed.'
