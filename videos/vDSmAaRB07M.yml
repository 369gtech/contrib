description: "Tutorial: Introduction to Kubeflow Pipelines - Michelle Casbon, Dan Sanche, Dan Anghel, & Michal Zylinski, Google \n\nIn this session, you will learn how to install and use Kubeflow Pipelines to create a full machine learning application on Kubernetes. Starting with an empty environment, you will create a Kubernetes cluster and install Kubeflow from scratch. Then you will build and run a full pipeline that first trains a model using TensorFlow, then serves the model, and finally deploys a web front-end for interacting with the resulting predictions. You will then move into a notebook to build and run your pipeline using the Python SDK. You will become familiar with Google Cloud Platform tools such as Cloud Shell and Kubernetes Engine. Prerequisite: fundamental knowledge of Kubernetes. Setup: must bring own laptop. Qwiklab/GCP credits will be provided. Note: this session showcases Kubeflow features newly released since the Seattle workshop. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPgr"
