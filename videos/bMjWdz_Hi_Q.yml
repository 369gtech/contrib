description: "Say goodbye to the days of TPS reports, and come learn how to automate the tedious tasks in your work day. Thanks to the extensibility of Google Sheets (and a special JavaScript client library for Sheets), as well as Cloud Functions, thatâ€™s easy. You can have all kinds of data, for example GitHub, Jira, uptime health, and even sales data combined and imported into a Sheet, analyzed, and output as an email report or slide deck-without ever opening the Sheet.\n\n\nEVENT:\nNodeJS Interactive 2019\n\n\nSPEAKERS:\nFranziska Hinkelmann & Leah Cole\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nThe Linux Foundation provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish NodeJS Interactive videos\n\n\nCREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l660-gUumDM"
