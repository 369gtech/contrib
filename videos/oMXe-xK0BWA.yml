description: "Google I/O 2010 -  Building real-time web apps with App Engine and the Feed API \r\n\r\nGoogle APIs, App Engine 201 \r\n\r\nBrett Bavar, Moishe Lettvin \r\n\r\nWe're introducing two new APIs which you can use to power real-time web apps: the App Engine Channel API and the Feed API v2 with push updates. Learn how the new Channel API allows you to push data from your App Engine app to an end user's browser. Also, learn how the new version of the Feed API allows you to subscribe to PubSubHubbub feeds and receive updates pushed to the browser. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
