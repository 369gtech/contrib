description: "Several incidents, such as `left-pad`, `eslint-scope` and `event-stream` have shown how easily a couple of `npm install` commands can result in a broken or compromised build.\n\nFor better or for worse, in the JS ecosystem, it is very easy to pull in dependencies and publish your own packages to the de-facto standard npm registery.\n\nThis makes pulling in vulnerable or unstable code extremely easy. In this quickie, we will blaze through these incidents and how they could happen.\n\nAfter learning from them, we will present avenues to a safer and saner web development ecosystem."
