description: "Before Spotify, before Pandora, before Apple Music, there was Spinner and NetRadio....and RadioNonsense!\n\nRadioNonsense was my online radio station, for over 10 years streaming from my personal collection of over 20K songs (all legally purchased, no Napster here!) to anywhere in the world: British troops in Afghanistan, Germans up-and-down the Rhine, even Malaysia.\n\nThe original implementation was a J2EE using EJBs deployed on JBoss5, Java application using the never-easy-to-use Java Media Framework, Shoutcast, and any number of other technologies cobbled together on a rack of servers in my basement. Not elegant and so not cool.\n\nJoin me as I recreate RadioNonsense using new, fun technologies. Raspberry PI's? IoT devices? Docker and microservices? BlockChain? Anything else? The opportunities are vast, if only I knew where it would lead. Rube Goldberg would be proud (I hope)!"
