description: "In this ver. @csell5 talks to @jlengstorf about this notion of “work life balance”. Look his beard fell out and that’s just wrong.\n\nJason Lengstorf is a developer, architect, occasional designer, and frequent speaker. He’s passionate about building tools, systems, and training materials to create high-performance teams and apps. He later encourages those teams to use their newfound free time to go outside and be people and stuff. He lives in Portland, Oregon.\n\nYou can find Jason at:\nhttps://lengstorf.com\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jlengstorf/\nhttps://facebook.com/jlengstorf\nhttps://github.com/jlengstorf\nhtttps://twitter.com/jlengstorf\n\nLinks mentioned in the show:\nhttps://gatsbyjs.com\nhttps://www.zenhub.com/\nhttp://danger.systems/js/\nhttps://www1.brain.fm/"
