description: "Hot Swap Your Datastore: A Practical Approach and Lessons Learned\n\nRaj Shekhar and Mehmet Can Kurt, Quantcast\n\nThis talk is about how we migrated from an in-house legacy datastore that handles 1.5 million lookup requests (per second) to a more reliable, flexible, and cheaper system.\n\nWe will talk about how to achieve three major goals for the migration process:\n\n- at least similar or better performance than the legacy system\n- ensure the quality and correctness of the data served by the new system, and\n- do the first two without any downtime on production and affecting the company's main revenue generating product.\nThis talk is aimed at software engineers and site reliability engineers who are thinking of replacing a critical part of their distributed system.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
