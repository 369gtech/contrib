description: "So mob programming is kind of weird - or that's how it can look at first. Lots of people, 1 screen, 1 keyboard... it's a bit... unnatural. But after giving it a try for almost a year, I'm hooked! We tried different things, tweaking as we go. Not everything worked, but we've evolved into a way of working that is *seriously* enjoyable and, better still, really effective!\n\nI've been a professional developer for coming up 6 years and have over the past year learned some really interesting things about who I am as a developer and how I can offer value to those I work with and for. I'm keen to share this knowledge because I feel a lot of other developers in the early stages of their career probably share the same sense of confusion. Helping others is something I really enjoy, and I also enjoy talking about things that I'm very passionate about. I have started interacting more with the development community and from the positive results I've had I am really keen to do more in this direction."
