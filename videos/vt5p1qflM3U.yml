description: "If you have read Michael Nygard's \"Release it!\" you know that a downstream service going down is just one of the many modes of failure that your new service will need to handle in production, and it is not the worse one.\n\nTo make your system resilient, you also have to worry about networks going slow, disks getting full or third party services disappearing.\n\nHow can we test those scenarios and make them part of our build pipeline?\n\nBut most outages are due to unforeseen interactions and unexpected circumstances. So how can you write a test case that you don't know that you want to test?\n\nIn this session, you will learn how use Docker and property based testing to automate the resilience testing of your system.\n\nDaniel Lebrero is a technical architect with more than 15 years of software development experience. He works at the fin-tech IG, where he is involved in architecting the web platform, the analytics website and the big data solution. A long time Java practitioner, he now also loves ()."
