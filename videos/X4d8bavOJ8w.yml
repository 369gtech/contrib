description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotai.io on June 1st in Paris. More talks on https://www.dotconferences.com/talks\n\nMuch of Artificial Intelligence Research is done by a handful of elite researchers. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of really talented developers and engineers stand behind a mental block that they need a lot of advanced skills to be able to contribute to AI Research, or even to use AI in their own work.\nSharada attempts to help clarify the myth, and convince everyone that they indeed have a lot to contribute to AI Research by  telling the story of how people from all over the world came together to teach a simulated skeleton how to walk using reinforcement learning."
