description: "James Lewis is a Principal Consultant for ThoughtWorks UK. He has helped introduce evolutionary architecture practices and agile software development techniques to various blue chip companies: investment banks, publishers and media organisations. James Lewis studied Astrophysics in the 90â€™s but got sick of programming in Fortran.\n\nThe software industry is changing faster than ever. Now, with microservices becoming more and more accepted as an architectural style, the rate of change of our industry and of the software we write is going to go one way, up.\n\nIn his keynote, James explores what this means for developers writing code *now*. Do we abandon our quest to build quality in? What does it mean for design if we are building software explicitly to throw it away a short time later. Is TDD dead? What does software craftsmanship look like through the lens of replaceable code in small replaceable services?\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
