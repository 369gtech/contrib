description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIntro: CNCF SIG-Runtime - Ricardo Aravena, Rakuten & Renaud Gaubert , NVIDIA \n\nThe CNCF SIG Runtime (https://github.com/cncf/sig-runtime) collaborates to explore how different runtime infrastructure technologies make it possible to run cloud-native workloads. Discussions are about generalized orchestration, autoscaling, scheduling, execution, container runtimes, sandboxing, virtualization, image packaging/distribution, and specialized architectures. Furthermore, technologies and projects, aimed specifically at Edge, IoT, Batch, Big Data, AI/ML, etc. and incorporating specialized computing elements beyond CPUs, including GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, ASICs, etc. In this session, we'll provide an overview of the current cloud-native projects and future technologies that fall within the SIG scope. You'll find out how to get involved and contribute, get to know some of the SIG members, and a showcase of the work thus far. The audience will come away with a basic understanding of the SIG and its place in the CNCF ecosystem. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekG6"
