description: "Current trends in software and backend architecture is evolving towards a more loosely coupled more granular design. The latest development on that front is the advent of serverless which allows you to run applications in very cost-effective ephemeral services. This is why it is important to have a proper gateway for your API that is able to route all your requests to the designated endpoint.
