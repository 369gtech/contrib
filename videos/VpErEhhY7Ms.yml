language: English
recordingDate: 1446493185
description: "Continuous Delivery Pipelines help developers safely iterate on and test new code in production-like environments. But what if your team is tasked with developing the CD Pipeline itself?  How do you empower multiple SCM engineers to make changes in a controlled way without impacting each other or degrading developer productivity? \n\nLearn how Sony has leveraged ElectricFlow and DevOps principles to construct a flexible, version-able, review-able, test-able, revert-able and resilient CD pipeline. This talk will focus on the infrastructure, tools and processes used to create and operate this pipeline, and the methods used to safely and rapidly onboard new business groups, developers and SCM engineers."
