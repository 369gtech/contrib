title: 'Automatic testing of a heavily integrated system - a case-study by Jörgen Andersson'
recordingDate: 1549470798
description: "Running more than 5000 automated system tests on a deployed application with outgoing connections to about 25 other systems, each with their own dependencies, where test data is complex and needs to be in-sync, is a great challenge. Doing it every night, year after year, with the requirement to fail only on the event of actual errors in the application under test, is a nightmare. Still, its the foundation of Continuous Delivery. If you can't test your software, you can't deliver with confidence!\n\nIn this talk I want to inspire you and share how we get to have a good nights sleep and find proper test results every morning, including\n\nexperiences from a five year journey\nproblems and findings\nthe blue-print to our open-source-based solution"
