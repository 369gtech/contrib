description: "Connor Mcdonald, Developer Advocate for SQL, Oracle\n\nMost SQL is so simple to write that we can hand off the job to an ORM tool or a similar mechanism. But by delving a little deeper into more-advanced SQL facilities, we can get performance benefits and write a lot less middle-tier code. This session highlights some SQL techniques for solving problems that would otherwise require a lot of complex coding. Learn how to become a more productive developer by expanding your knowledge of the SQL language."
