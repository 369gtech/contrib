description: "Why would you need to use the Angular Router in a Micro Frontend? Why should you care?\n\nMicro Frontends may be something as simple as a login form or as complicated as a single page application in nature. Wouldn’t it be nice to utilize the functionality provided by the Angular Router to employ functionality such as code splitting, guards, and named router outlets?\n\nIn this talk, we will walk through how using Angular’s Dependency Injection can provide each Micro Frontend with an isolated routing experience.\nng-conf is a multi-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1000's of developers from across the globe join together to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and other community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf​ \nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
