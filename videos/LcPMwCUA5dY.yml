description: "In 2012, back when DEF CON still fit in the Riviera (RIP), I recognized a gap to fill. I wanted to create a mobile version of the paper DEF CON booklet that everyone could use at the con. \n\nI was unable to attend the conference that year. I was 8 months pregnant with my first child, and because I couldn't be there in person, I spent a lot of time wishing I was. \n\nSo I built it. I spent countless hours pouring my heart into what became the Hacker Tracker, shiny graphics and all, and was committing code up until the minute I went into labor. \n\nFast forward a few years: Seth was frustrated with the lack of a mobile app for iOS while attending DEF CON. Subsequently, he found the Android version of Hacker Tracker and reached out to me about creating an iOS version. I was thrilled that someone wanted to join me and help grow the project. Not long after that, I recruited Chris to work on the app as well. \n\nNow, 6 years since its inception, a small team supports the app development across iOS and Android and the apps are being used by half a dozen different conferences, representing several thousand users. \n\nFrom nothing to something, we've experienced quite a bit in 6 years. Join us as we share our moments of joy, fear, and panic,\"things not to do\", and more."
