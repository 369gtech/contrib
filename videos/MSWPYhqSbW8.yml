description: "In this session, we will discuss the fundamentals of what a RESTful web service is. We will build a RESTful service using ASP.NET Core and discuss the benefits of using Swagger to describe and create a service contract.\n\nOnce the service is built we will explore how to test it using the Swagger web interface and Postman. Finally, we will create a client application to consume the service.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
