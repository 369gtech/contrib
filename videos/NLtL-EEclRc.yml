description: "\"Node.js is fast and scalable web-oriented non-blocking I/O built on top of Google Chrome V8 engine. Almost every web developer uses Node or Node-based tools to some extent. However, Node has some really powerful features worth knowing.\n\nThis talk dives deep into the core mechanisms of the Node.js platform and some of its most interesting features such as Event Loop, Streams and buffers, Process and global, Event emitters, Clusters, AsyncWrap, Domain and uncaughtException, and C++ addons."
