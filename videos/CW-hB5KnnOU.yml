description: "Eduardo Silva\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/88/\n\nLogging is one of the ancient mechanism behavior to perform application or hardware analysis. In a new era of distributed systems at scale and connected embedded devices, data collection and processing becomes a real challenge; Logging has been forced to evolve and adapt to new needs. \r\n\r\nIn Data Analysis, logging is one of the key components to collect and pre-process data, usually, a logging mechanism goes through collect, parse, filter and centralize logs to a storage backend like a database, so data processing and analysis can be performed. This usually happens after the data has been aggregated and stored, but for real-time analysis needs, process the data while is still in motion brings a lot of advantages and this kind of approach is called Stream Processing.\r\n \r\nWhat if it was possible to query your data using aggregation functions, windowing, and grouping results while the data was in motion and in-memory but on the edge side?.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will go further and present an extended approach called 'Stream Processing on the Edge', where data is processed on the edge service or device, in a lightweight mode empowering features like anomaly detection (in the order of milliseconds) and Machine Learning in a distributed way using pure Open Source software.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
