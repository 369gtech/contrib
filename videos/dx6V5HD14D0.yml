description: "Kirk Pepperdine, Director, Kodewerk Ltd.\n\nWith the release of Java 9, our beloved mostly CMS collector was deprecated and G1GC replaced the parallel collector as the default. The hype surrounding this massive change claims that the G1GC is the best collector…ever. Make no mistake about it: G1GC will be much much easier to tune. So, is this real, or is it #fakenews. This session explores the reality by looking at experiences with moving applications from CMS to G1GC in real production environments. The implications aren’t simply about performance. A suboptimally tuned collector will increase your company’s operating cost by 10% to 20%. The presentation also examines results from benchmarks that expose potential pain points and offers some suggestions on what actions can offer some relief."
