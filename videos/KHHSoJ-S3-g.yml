description: "Towards Augmenting Existing Procedural HPC Application Codes With Functional Programming Semantics - Daniel Rubio Bonilla (Lambda Days 2017)\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/daniel-rubio-bonilla\n\n\nIn recent years efforts have been made to introduce but fall short to address High Performance Computing (HPC) applicability. In this talk we will present how to introduce functional semantics to procedural code used in HPC to improve programmability and allow compilers to perform aggressive code transformations that lead to better portability and increased performance. It will be discussed what functional semantics are needed to bring benefits to the programmability, maintainability and performance to HPC and how to make it exploitable by compilers and tools to achieve the previously mentioned objectives."
