description: "https://ng-poland.pl\nAngular Elements and Zone-Less components in production\nPreconditions:\nAs a precondition, we assume you already know the basics of web components and angular elements.\nMany things are already written or recorded and we have a good overview of the basics.\nHow about elements in production? They can be used in a variety of ways:\n\n stand-alone or in an angular project\n zone-less or zone-full\n styles encapsulated or open\n\nFurthermore what about all the problems with manual change detection or the problem of multiple zone instances? Third-party libs also bring a lot of problems we need to solve.\nCurrent approaches bring a lot of ugly hacks as well as multiple versions of `polyfills.ts` and `main.ts`. Also, some of the problems remained unsolved until today. Let's change this!\nIn this talk, we will:\n learn the main 4 bundling strategies that pay off in real-life\n What to consider if we write zone-less components\n How to control different bundling strategies over the architect API\n How to link bundle settings to our components\n\nIn the end, you can copy ANY angular component into the project and build it for all scenarios in one single command. You will further be able to create code that works without zone.js and get, faster, even smaller bundles.\n\nMichael Hladky - Consultant/Trainer, Google Developer Expert in Angular | Austria\nHe is a Google Developer Expert and an active part of the community.
