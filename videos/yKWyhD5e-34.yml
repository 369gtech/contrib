description: "CI/CD/CS: implementing continuous security across your delivery pipeline and at run-time\n\nJorge Salamero Sanz\n\nContinuous Delivery helps to keep your software and Docker images updated and deploy new versions in production easily.\nMicroservices are great reducing the attack vector and limiting the privileges or credentials access of each piece of your application.\nContainers provide an opportunity to implement better security, small, inmutable, single process and purpose.\n\nIn this session, we will discover real use case examples on how to make your CI/CD pipeline interact with Docker security tools. But security doesnâ€™t stop where your deployment pipeline ends. How we can prepare for 0-days and policy violations that happen at run-time? Can we make it part of the CI/CD process?"
