description: "Automation is key to DevOps and Continuous Delivery and has led to the idea of Infrastructure as Code. Code without tests is bad.\n\nThis presentation gives an introduction to Behaviour Driven Infrastructure. It describes what BDI, or Test Driven Infrastructure, is; why it is important and how to use it to drive Continuous Delivery. The presentation will cover concepts and techniques followed by a concrete example: Behaviour Driven Infrastructure in action using Serverspec. This talk will include code."
