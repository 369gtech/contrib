description: 'Have you wanted to learn Clojure but didn''t know where to start? Have you wanted to teach Clojure but aren''t sure how to work with students? Beginner''s Luck is an interactive presentation where student and teacher share their experiences both learning and teaching Clojure over the past four months. The first part of the presentation will be a dialog where both student and teacher will switch off sharing experiences and coding examples of things that went well and the numerous surprises they encountered along the way. The second part will be a review of the open source beginner curriculum that''s published on Github.'
