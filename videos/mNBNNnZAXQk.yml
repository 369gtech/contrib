title: 'What Developers Need to Know About Google Glass'
language: English
recordingDate: 1370032421
description: 'Maximiliano Firtman talks about what developers need to know in order to start creating apps for Google glass. Right now, most apps fit the mold of cloud-based web apps that can be written in pretty much any language with the Mirror API. A forthcoming Java-based SDK will allow people to develop native Android apps, which will open up a world of as-yet-unknown virtual reality opportunities. The groundbreaking nature of this new device also means developers have to start to grapple with an entirely new user experience, not simply apps with a clear background, but a whole new way of navigating the world.'
