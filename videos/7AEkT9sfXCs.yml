title: 'Home multimedia and automation systems with GStreamer'

description: "Jan Schmidt\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/159/\n\nToday, people are increasingly familiar with multi-room sound systems that let you listen to your music anywhere in the house.\r\n\r\nBuilding one is easy! But why stop there?\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss how the flexibility of the GStreamer multimedia framework helps with implementing a home media system, and the features that make it very simple to develop such applications. It will briefly introduce how data flow handling and synchronisation works in GStreamer, and how various open standards like RTP/RTSP and PTP/NTP can be leveraged to implement these use cases.\r\n\r\nFinally the goal is to present an interesting extended use-case: Using the synchronisation primitives in the other direction - to capture and process audio from microphones distributed around a house. Through triangulation and filtering, such as system can provide useful features like speaker isolation and echo-location for recognition and contextualisation of spoken commands.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
