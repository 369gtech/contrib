recordingDate: 1620166431
description: "If you haven't used the debugger you might not be familiar with the concepts of breakpoints or how to step through code. Fortunately Leslie Richardson (@lyrichardson01), PM on the Visual Studio team, is here to show us the ropes. She introduces the different ways we can step through code, and how we can indicate where to where we want our code to run.\n\nThis segment was pulled from a full interview with Leslie: https://youtu.be/ZNG2fLvhkIU\n\nDid you know... You can find out all about the debugger on Microsoft Docs!\n\nVisual Studio debugger documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/?view=vs-2019&WT.mc_id=WebWednesday-c9-niner\nDebugger resources: https://aka.ms/vsdebugging"
