description: "The JDK is an open source project that you can download and build yourself! All the new things under work are available on Mercurial branches, that you can get and compile to test them before they are released. It allows you to play with them, see how they work, see what do the new syntaxes look like. In short: you can play now with a JDK from the future, that may never exist!\n\nWe will show how all this work, from the installation of a Ubuntu virtual machine to the execution of a home made JDK that will never be released.\n\nJosé Paumard\nPassionate about programming computers for over 20 years, Jose made his debut in assembler and C, C for SIMD parallel machines before adopting Java as an object-oriented language, indispensable to most major modern applications. He brings his expertise and capacity for analysis and synthesis to many projects, mainly in the lower layers, close to the data, but also on complex UI design, or in the browser. PhD in applied maths and computer science, assistant professor in Paris North University for 20 years, Java Champion, Java Rockstar, Jose also has a passion for education and knowledge transfer. He gives talks in major international Java conferences (JavaOne in San Francisco, Devoxx in Antwerp, Paris and London).  He wrote numerous technical articles on Java technologies for Java Magazine, Oracle Technolgy Network. He writes a blog, Java le soir, French documentary source on Java technologies for thousands of french speaking developers around the world. He is a member of the french Paris Java User Group, and has been a co-organizer of the conference Devoxx France for three years."
