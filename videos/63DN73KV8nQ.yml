This talk will explore some of the leading challenges and raise questions as the era of information technology transforms from its pirate era to the CEO era. \_\_\n\nJoin\_Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor who studies the intersection between technology and society, focusing on the myriad of impacts of digital connectivity and computational decision-making.
