description: "Compliance Help for the Agile Enterprise\n\nDavid Owczarek, Sr. Manager, Cloud Technology, Adobe Systems Incorporated\n\nImplementing controls for SOCII, PCI-DSS, HIPPA and other compliance standards is complex, detail-oriented work. Doing that in an enterprise with agile teams makes it even harder. This talk offers several conceptual frameworks for implementing agile controls. By looking at each control from four different perspectives: code, process, infrastructure, and evidence, concrete requirements for the solution rapidly emerge. Controls are also grouped by their frequency – continuous or periodic. Periodic controls are used to examine the consumption of people’s time in a 12 month, forward-looking view. Finally, three hard truths about compliance work provide an emotional framework.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
