title: 'Can Machines Learn Beauty? - Olha Shainoha'
recordingDate: 1571129743
description: "Nowadays with the hype of machine learning and AI, seems that via data science we can solve everything. But can we actually quantify a subjective topic like Beauty?\n\nAsking whether an image is beautiful, or how beautiful it is, will probably revoke different responses from different individuals. “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder”, it’s a subjective thing.\nSo, is it possible to teach a machine to make this decision if we humans fail to agree? My answer is - yes.\n\nIn this talk, Olha shares my journey of discovering an optimal solution for visual beauty evaluation.\nThrough the ups and downs exploring different algorithms and approaches to the problem, trying, failing and trying again till reaching the desired solution.\n\nOlha also walks us through machine learning projects lifecycle, how we approach problems and iterate to resolve & validate them, making (almost) anything, including beauty quantification possible.\n\nBio: Olha Shainoha has gained her masters degree in Computational Linguistics from Lviv Polytechnic National University in Ukraine.\nShe has been working as a Data Scientist in Wix.com for the past three years. She’s experienced in a variety of fields and projects such as NLP based classifiers, sentiment analysis, phishing detection and many more. Her current main challenges in Wix focus on beauty prediction of design assets.\n\nFor more engineering updates and insights:\n\n* Follow us on Twitter → https://twitter.com/WixEng\n* Subscribe our monthly newsletter →  https://www.wix.engineering/subscribe\n* Visit our blog →  https://www.wix.engineering/blog\n* Follow our Medium publication →  https://medium.com/wix-engineering"
