In the months that followed, we worked closely with Trail of Bits and Atredis Partners to assess and improve Kubernetes’ security posture.  Through code review and penetration testing, we found and addressed 37 new vulnerabilities.  With support from many Kubernetes contributors, the third party security firms and Kubernetes project produced a formal threat model covering eight critical components across six different trust zones.  In this talk, we will share our findings, methodology, and vision for future security investments.  We’ll discuss what the work uncovered, and what this means to Kubernetes security both now and for the future. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uad0"
