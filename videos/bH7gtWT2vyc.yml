title: 'Pydata Berlin Meetup February 2021: Bulk Labelling'
language: English
recordingDate: 1613845101
description: "Let's say you want to start working on a chatbot. Then the likely issue won't be that you don't have enough deep learning models that you can pip install. The real problem is probably that you don't have proper training data to start with. It's a precious moment in time to take serious, but what tools can we use for this?\n\nIn this talk I would like to share some techniques/tools that I've been working on for this use-case. The goal won't be to have a gold-standard right away. Instead the goal is to bootstrap as quickly as possible. During the talk I'll do some live-coding and I'll highlight some tools that I've open sourced that might help you bulk-label.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
