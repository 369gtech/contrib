description: "I got my first job as a Web Developer in just 7 days, that's one week. You gotta see this! You want to see at the end what HTML5 and CSS3 brought in front of my house. Is this motivating you? Is it enough as a wake-up call for you?\nGood, than let me show you my journey from a junior web developer to wizard web developer. This is the story of my first day in finding a job and how I surfed the technical questions, how I went from a simple programmer to become later on a guru, and mentor others just like you to get on this path and get from point A, junior web developer, to point B, senior web developer, from start to top 10% web developers in the world."
