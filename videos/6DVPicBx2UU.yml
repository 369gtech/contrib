description: "Agile methodologies are, in a way, a revolution of democracy over the dark ages of waterfall project management dictatorship. With great freedom though comes great responsibility and it is easy to minimize the advantages of the ‘old’ and overuse the freedoms of the ‘new’. I believe one of the great disciplines created by the old world which are key to having a sustainable agile project and methodology is the Software Architecture discipline. This talk is about reviving this essential role and bringing Software Architects back to their rightful spot, right there next to the Product Owners and Scrum Masters of the new world.\n\nShort Bio: Trainer, developer, project manager, technical coach, with a passion for technical teams and solutions architectures, I have more than 12 years’ experience in the engineering and management of complex software systems.\nAs a trainer I have been designing and delivering complex training programs on both technical as well as non-technical topics and have a continued preoccupation with individual as well as organizational learning and development.As a technical coach & consultant, I have been working with local and international, geographically distributed teams, employing Agile methodologies, Microservice and Serverless architectures, helping them develop and continuously improve their hybrid cloud solutions and guiding then through their digital transformation journey.I am a Computer Science alumnus of the Polytechnic University as well as the University of Bucharest, I hold a Diploma in Training Management and Organizational Learning as well as a Diploma in Software Architecture Design and Analysis from the Carnegie Mellon University and have been a speaker in various technology conferences such as DevTalks Bucharest, Agile Tour Bucharest, ISTA Sofia, etc."
