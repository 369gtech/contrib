title: 'Caching In: Understand, Measure, and Use Your CPU Cache More Effectively'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784669
description: "Modern computationally intensive tasks are rarely bottlenecked by the absolute performance of your processor cores. The real bottleneck in 2013 is getting data out of memory. CPU caches are designed to alleviate the difference in performance between CPU core clock speed and main memory clock speed, but developers rarely understand how this interaction works or how to measure or tune their application accordingly. This session aims to address this by\n\n&bull; Describing how CPU caches work in the latest Intel hardware\n\n&bull; Showing what and how to measure in order to understand the caching behavior of software\n\n&bull; Giving examples of how this affects Java program performance and what can be done to address poor cache utilization\n\n\nAuthor:\nRichard Warburton\nRichard Warburton is a software developer who loves solving complex problems, but actively challenges how much of software development is dealing with day-to-day trivialities. Having obtained a PhD in the area of compiler optimizations and static analysis, he has been applying his abilities in industry. Initially on bytecode analysis software, and more recently on Java performance tuning tools. He actively involves himself in the London Java Community, and its Java Community Process Committee. He has been helping with the push to improve and complete the JSR 310 API and the expand community engagement with JSR 335.\nView more trainings by Richard Warburton at https://www.parleys.com/author/richard-warburton\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
