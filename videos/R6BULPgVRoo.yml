description: "Big data is defined by its size, a huge volume of information to sift through to derive insights and aggregations. Fast data is defined by its speed, rapidly changing and requiring rapid analysis. What happens if you have both? A mass of data but you need quick analysis. An overnight batch won稚 be good enough here. What we need is to process the data as it arrives, before it is stored, to get the earliest possible result.\n\nTo solve this problem, we値l take a look at Hazelcast. This is a well-known In-Memory Data Grid with a streaming analytics engine known as Jet, and both of these are Java based. We値l take a look then at the essence of streaming analytics, the basics and some theory. Then we値l dive into the reality, with how streaming is implemented. And to show how this works, we値l do some demos, simple coding to do powerful real-world tasks, on real-world data, in real-time. Live!\n\npar Riaz Muhammed"
