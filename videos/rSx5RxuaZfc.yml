description: "Horia’s talk tells the story of building messenger.com. Horia will give us a glimpse into how CSS is used at Facebook, and how it worked both for and against the developers tasked with working on the first secondary domain: messenger.com. Contains cool CSS and a bit of React. You’ve been warned!\n\nHoria is currently a UI Engineer at Facebook, and in the past has worked on everything from design to project management, in all sorts of organizations, from social gaming companies to investment banks.\n\nhttp://2015.cssconf.eu/"
