recordingDate: 1610405366
description: 'Open the gate and enter into the Upside Down Dimension of Elixir that is metaprogramming. If you have become frustrated with boilerplate code in your modules, wanted to program in a language closer to your domain, or create new programming constructs in Elixir, then this presentation is for you. The format of this talk is a gentle introduction presenting key concepts reinforced with code demos. At the end of the presentation, you will have the tools to write basic macros and a solid foundation to explore more advanced concepts on your own.'
