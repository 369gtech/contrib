description: "Benjamin Purgason, LinkedIn\n\nFew companies invest in SRE before there is a raging operational fire on their hands. As a result SREs often start out as firefighters, desperately trying to keep the company alive for one more day. Once we put out the fires and our site is safe we can begin evolving—but where to?\n\nIn this talk we share the five distinct stages of SRE evolution. Moreover we’ll cover the transition of roles and responsibilities between site reliability and software engineers over time, the relationship dynamics that impede progress, and the shifts in mindset that must occur over time.\n\nJoin us, and we’ll help you transform the reactive growth of your SRE team into directed evolution.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
