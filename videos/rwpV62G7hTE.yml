description: 'Over the last two years, we’ve completed over 20 projects, wrote over 300K lines of Java code, closed over 20K tickets, pull requests and bugs, assembled together over 200 senior programmers and made a profit. We’ve done all that without a single meeting, Skype call, or a Slack chats. We barely knew each other aside from GitHub, where all that development happened. In this presentation, I will disclose a few of our dirty secrets.'
