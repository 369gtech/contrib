description: 'While microservices and containers promise to deliver endless scalability it doesn''t mean we automatically get high performing code in these distributed application architectures. We analyzed the top performance bottleneck reasons in 2017 and see familiar patterns such as excessive service roundtrips, bad connection pooling, missing cache layers or simply sending too much data between service tiers. In this session we learn how to quickly pinpoint potential performance bottlenecks - even without executing large scale performance tests.'
