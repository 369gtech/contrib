description: "Google App Engine (GAE) is a popular PaaS offering. Its scalable and reliable environment is hidden behind a custom API. This makes GAE apps hard to port over to non-GAE environments. But what if you could implement a similar environment and simply move your GAE application’s .war file to this new environment and it would just work? After all, in, the end it’s all about the API, plus scalable and reliable services. The JBoss CapeDwarf project aims to make this a reality. This presentation provides a glimpse into what it takes to implement something as GAE, ranging from runtime integration with the JBoss Application Server and the actual services implementation to, last but not least, automated heavy testing.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAleš Justin\nAleš Justin was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia and graduated with a degree in mathematics from the University of Ljubljana.
