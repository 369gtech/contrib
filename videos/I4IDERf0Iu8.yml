description: 'After having worked as a tester, an agile coach and a programmer, Ive seen and experienced software development from different perspectives. One of the things that has stuck with me the most is how limited our view of quality is. While we struggle with our unit tests or test cases, were missing out on some fundamental factors which affect quality. Instead of putting your faith in hiring more testers or sorting out if a test is a unit test or an integration test it is possible expand your view and work deeply with quality. This talk is designed to introduce three major perspectives which impact quality and give concrete tips for how to work with each of them.'
