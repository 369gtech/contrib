description: "It is often said, \"ship early, ship often,\" and most product teams are familiar with this classic building process: ideate, build, launch, measure, iterate, repeat. While this system can work, and has, it may not be the most productive. What happens when the original idea flops? Then, you've lost precious time and resources developing a product you don't want anymore. There's got to be a better way.\n\nDaniel Burka and Jake Knapp, Design Partners at Google Ventures, have created what they call a \"5-day design sprint.\" A faster and more efficient way to create, design, and test a product, all in a single work-week. In this presentation, they walk us step-by-step through this process, using their client Blue Bottle Coffee as a case study.\n\nThe pair make an argument for why the well-known truism should be changed from, \"ship early, ship often,\" to \"learn early, learn often.\"\n\nFollow along with Daniel and Jake's slides: http://crcl.to/wha8s\n\nMore videos from Cascade SF: http://crcl.to/jvfct\nInformation on Cascade SF: http://cascadesf.com/"
