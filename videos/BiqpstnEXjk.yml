description: "Have you ever wondered if you want/need/are able to test in production? Is it even possible without bringing harm to your users? Does it bring any value?\n\nThe approach isn’t new in the world. In this talk, Kateryna goes over how we have set up lean QA for our more than 30 independent teams. This includes both – manual and automation testing, all teams ownership on QA, experimenting, monitoring and so on.\n\nTakeaways:\n* Test in Prod – it can actually be done\n* Automation on many levels not only UI E2E tests\n* Monitoring is so helpful, you should use it too\n* Experimenting on humans is so much fun! And valuable"
