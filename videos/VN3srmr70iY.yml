description: "This video comes from Marakana's 5-Day Android Bootcamp Training Course which Marko Gargenta taught in San Jose, CA earlier this year.\n\nNow, that you've created the Timeline activity, you're going to give it an options menu that will allow users to toggle the service on/off. Instead of copying and pasting code that we've already written, we're going to again refactor the code.\n\n** Get the source code at: http://marakana.com/f/287\n** Find more educational resources on open source development at http://marakana.com"
