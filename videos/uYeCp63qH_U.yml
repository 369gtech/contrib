description: "Sustain in Open Source with Gitcoin Gitcoin is a decentralized application where you can use various ERC-20 tokens to grow and sustain in Open Source and many other things.\nby Saptak Sengupta\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1302/sustain_in_open_source_with_gitcoin.webm\n\n\nOpen Source Software and Open Source contributors\nprovide for a massive percentage of today's softwares and web\nand other technical ecosystems. It provides a freedom and global\nway of contributing to make things better. However, Open Source\ncontributions are mostly driven by intrinsic motivations. This often\nleads to burn out due to lack of sustainability.\nGitcoin provides a solution to help all the wonderful Open Source\ncontributors earn by doing what they do best. Gitcoin is a bountying\nplatform which helps bounty open source issues which now the\ncontributors can work on and also earn and sustain themselves. Gitcoin is a platform which incentivizes open source contributions in the form of bounties using blockchains.  Gitcoin is built upon the Ethereum network and the solidity of smart contract programming language. Ethereum provides opportunities to align incentives across actors in the ecosystem. By programming rights of stakeholders directly into smart contracts, actors are incentivized to provide value, and edge cases are handled without having to involve legacy legal enforcement mechanisms. \n\n\nWe believe in open standards and fat protocols, and have built Gitcoin with StandardBounties -- an Open, Free, Fair, Bounty Protocol on Ethereum.\nWe believe that an ICO and tokenization is not the best business model for our dapp. We do not have a token\nWe believe that blockchain is a game-changer for funding of Open Source. We believe that Open Source Funding and Open Source Jobs will be built on Open Source Money\n\n\n\nThe aim of Gitcoin is to make a community for developers to collaborate and monetize their skills while working on Open Source projects through bounties. Gitcoin is a decentralized application built on Ethereum’s blockchain. Gitcoin does not have a native token. \n\nRoom: H.1302 (Depage)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 14:20:00+01"
