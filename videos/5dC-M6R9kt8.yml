description: "One day we wake up and realize that our days are filled with all kinds of stuff unrelated to code or product, that our goals are driven by product owners, and that our code design is dictated by architects. A great coding culture gives that power back to the developers and concentrates on making them productive and happy by removing unnecessary overhead, bringing autonomous teams together, helping individual programmers innovate, and raising awareness among the developers to create better code. This presentation discusses how to establish and foster a strong engineering-focused culture and gives lots of examples from the experience at Atlassian to show that once you’re working in a great coding culture, you won’t want to work anywhere else.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSven Peters\nSven Peters is a software geek working as an ambassador for Atlassian in Germany.
