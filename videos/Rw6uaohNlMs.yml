With search incresingly becoming the primary information access mechanism, knowing how your search is doing is not just a matter of mere curiosity, but often has direct business impact.\n\nIn this talk we'll talk about Search Analytics and how it can be used to answer questions like:\nAre too many users getting the dreaded \"no matches\" results?\nHow deep into search results do people dig?\nWhich hits are they clicking on, or what percentage of them don't click on any hits?\nHow much do they use the Did You Mean or Auto-Complete suggestions?\n\nWe'll explore what specific Search Analytics reports tell us and what specific actions you should take based on those reports.\n\nMore info: http://2011.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/search-analytics-what-why-how"
