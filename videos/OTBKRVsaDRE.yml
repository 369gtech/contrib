recordingDate: 1578986975
description: "Andrew Pam\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/169/\n\nFilm Freedom is a documentation and development project to make filmmaking with free-software and releasing via free culture funding models more accessible.  It currently includes the following development projects:\r\n\r\nKitCAT: the Kit for Creative Arts Teamwork, is a virtual studio system and client which connects the TACTIC studio DAMS and Project Management suite to popular filmmaking and creative software packages.\r\n\r\nLib-Ray is a project to create an alternative to DVD and Blu-Ray for fixed-format releases, using only free-licensed software and open formats, without encryption or region-coding.\r\n\r\nLunatics! is an original animated science-fiction story about the first permanent settlers on the Moon. This is an independent, free-culture, open-movie production, made with open-source software, especially Blender. Regular updates and support are through Patreon.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 14:05:00 2020 at Room 5"
