description: "In this continuing series, we have built our interfaces, created our unit tests, and now we are ready to wire up our methods. In this challenge, I want you to create your methods in a way that ensures all of your unit tests pass. I also want to see you check for edge cases by creating a test first, watching it fail, then writing the code to make the test pass.\n\nChallenge Page (with solution): https://www.iamtimcorey.com/courses/c-weekly-challenges/lectures/13519193\nSubscribe to Solutions: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/c-weekly-challenges\n\nPractice makes perfect, right? Well, mostly, but practice is very important. This series is all about getting you to practice the things you learn. I would encourage you to do every one. See which ones are just easy refreshers and which ones are difficult learning experiences."
