description: "Creating the new C++ project and setting up everything. We're still covering GED video number 25.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nYou can SKIP the time frames between 6 Minutes 02 seconds and 7 minutes 25 seconds if you do NOT want to create a new folder called source within the EngineTester project. That step is optional. VS automatically saved your source file in the Project directory. When I say skip a step or two I meant creating the source folder. \nIf you didn't create a source folder, move the .cpp files into the main EngineTester project directory."
