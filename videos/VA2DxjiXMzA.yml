With brokers, partitions, leaders, consumers, producers, offsets, consumer groups, etc, and security, managing Apache Kafka can be challenging.\n\nFrom managing consistency, numbers of partitions, understanding under replicated partitions, to the challenges of setting up security, and others, in this talk we will review common issues, and mitigation strategies, seen from the trenches helping teams around the globe with their Kafka infrastructure.\n\nBy the end of this talk you will have a collection of strategies to detect and prevent common issues with Apache Kafka, in a nutshell more peace and nights of sleep for you, more happiness for your users, the best case scenario.\n\nSpeaker: Pere Urbon-Bayes - confluent.io\n\nPere is a Technology Architect for Confluent out of Berlin, Germany. He has been working with data and architecting systems for more than 15 years as a freelance engineer and consultant. In that role he was focused on data processing and search, helping companies build reliable and scalable data architectures.
