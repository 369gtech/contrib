description: "Nothing has happened in testing for a long time. While products are getting ever more complex and the pressure to ship grows every day, we are still hand-crafting test cases and spending immense manual efforts, especially when testing GUIs and other complex aspects of the system.\nIn the past decade, however, there has been a massive Machine Learning renaissance, showing a lot of promise in all fields. How is it affecting software testing?
