title: 'Ontologies helping to keep global warming in check - Oleg Mirzov'
recordingDate: 1525698192
description: "Ontologies in computer science are formalized descriptions of knowledge domains. They are similar in purpose to database schemas of relational databases, but with higher emphasis on meaning of the concepts and with lower coupling to the data model. Ontologies are used for enterprise data integration, in life sciences and health care, in geographical information systems, among other areas. Oleg will present use of ontologies and linked data principles at Carbon Portal for publishing the results of environmental research as open data, to make it accessible to everyone. You will get to see where the data backing the claims about global warming and greenhouse gases are coming from, and how you yourself can find them and take a look at.\n\nOleg Mirzov is a Capish \"alumnus\", where he worked for almost 7 years in the roles of data janitor, ontologist and full-stack software developer. For the last 3 years, he has been applying that experience as a systems architect at Carbon Portal -- a subdivision of ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System), a large European environmental research infrastructure.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
