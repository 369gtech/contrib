description: "Building on the EPoS Now Platform\nWayne Taylor  \nt: (@wtaylor509)\n\nApril 2015 celebrates 3 years of software development at local tech company EPoS Now. The business has had great success from introducing Software as a Service and some great developer tools.They are soon to extend this by offering Platform as a Service, which will allow developers to build, host and resell their creations. \n\nIn this talk Wayne will demonstrate how to build and host a simple JavaScript app using real-time data from multiple APIs. As well as exploring the approach and scalable technology used to build the platform. \n\nWayne works as Head of Software at EPoS Now where he has helped to create the successful SME from a fledgling start-up. Day to day means managing, coaching, problem solving, architecting, designing, watering the plants, keeping an ear to the ground and an eye on competitors... and every once in a while he still gets to write some code. He is very proud of the department he has built and is often amazed by the fantastic people he gets to work with."
