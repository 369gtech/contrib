title: '"Enhancing Angklung Music Rehearsals with Modern Tech" by Trapsilo Bumi'
language: English
recordingDate: 1568482081
description: "Angklung is a traditional musical instrument from Indonesia. This instrument has a lot of variety in how it is performed; a common format is the orchestral format in which 15-30 players gather to form a team. Playing angklung in this way is fun but also presents some challenges that are hard to solve manually. In this talk, we will learn how technology is used to improve the quality of rehearsals of this age-old instrument.\n\nFirst, I will introduce the Angklung, and explain the key concepts of an Angklung team. Then, I will show you the manual processes involved in forming an Angklung team, and how those processes can be automated, increasing efficiency of rehearsals and quality of the music itself, with the help of language-agnostic algorithms interfaced by a web application. This involves reading Angklung-specific sheet music of a song (written in cipher/number notation), assessing the distribution of notes in that song, and finally calculating the most optimal distribution of Angklung for a team based on several important factors. I will also show some actual code samples and demonstrate an application of the algorithm written in Python, to show how an Angklung team is formed in real life.\n\nTrapsilo Bumi\n\nBumi is a Software Developer for HENNGE, based in Tokyo, Japan. He's always excited in challenges whether it be tinkering with new tech or sharing it with others through talks. When he's not coding, he can be seen travelling, board gaming, or playing (and conducting) Angklung."
