title: 'Get Func-y: Delegates in .NET - Jeremy Clark'
recordingDate: 1491200594
description: "Do you use delegates in .NET? If so, then Func T  and Action T  are just waiting to make your life easier.\nNot using delegates? Maybe you should. We'll take a look at what delegates are, why you would want to use them, and how to use Func T  and Action T  to tie things all together (with a few Lambdas thrown in just for fun)."
