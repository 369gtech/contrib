title: 'Electron - Writing desktop applications using web technologies - Mahesh Krishnan & Cristian Prieto'
recordingDate: 1474032462
description: "Wouldn’t you just love to write a desktop application once, and run it on the Mac, Windows and Linux? And wouldn’t it be better if you didn’t have to learn something new to do it - like leveraging on your existing web skills - just HTML, JavaScript, and CSS? If you answered Yes to these questions, then Electron is the answer. Electron is the technology from Github that has been used to write applications like Atom, Slack for the desktop and even Visual Studio Code.\nIn this talk, Mahesh and Cristian will show you how to get started using Electron and start creating desktop applications using web technologies."
