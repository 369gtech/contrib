description: "Most scientists write bad software. This software can sometimes be improved with programming best practices. However, programming best practices do not help with data analysis software, the code that transforms the raw experimental data into digestible results, tables, and figures. Often, the most important results are not immediately obvious, only emerging after a period of exploratory analysis. This highly dynamic process involves pruning and sharpening, abandoning and starting fresh, and returning to a previously abandoned approach. Multiple lines of analysis from one stage serve as the starting point of the next. Test suites are a premature optimization, yet bugs sneak in and are discovered only in later stages. Over the last few years I have developed a modulino-based approach for managing this unusual set of challenges and constraints. In this talk, I will show the many inefficient approaches scientists use, how conventional software practices don't help, and how Perl's quirks make it easy to solve this problem with just a little bit of creativity and discipline.\n\nI am an Assistant Professor of Physics at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida. I have used Perl for scientific computing for a decade, prodding PDL and Prima in the process, and writing a number of scientifically-oriented distributions available on CPAN. I earned my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."
