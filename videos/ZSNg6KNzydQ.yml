title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 - Jed Wesley-Smith - Why "Names Don''t Matter" Matters'
language: English
recordingDate: 1532480400
description: "Increasingly, people are popping up stating the controversial opinion that names don't matter. To most programmers this statement is obviously untrue, as naming is seen as difficult, and critical to semantic expression and communication in their code. To make matters worse, these same people demand fidelity to obscure and difficult names from mathematics, leading to charges of hypocrisy – if names don't matter, why do they care we all use any particular ones?\nWe'll try and tease out these seeming contradictions. We'll look at why \"names don't matter\" is an important idea, and why its more obvious superficial interpretation is specious.\n\nJed Wesley-Smith is a programming philosopher, concerned with how software behaves, scales and composes. He has been a functional programmer for the last 10 years, having discovered FP as a technique to simplify intractable concurrency problems, and then became such an enthusiastic proponent he was nicknamed Captain Immutable at Atlassian. Jed is currently Director of Engineering at Simple Machines, is a YOW! Evangelist, as well as a co-organiser of the FP-Syd and ScalaSyd user-groups.\n\nFor more on YOW!
