description: "Google Tech Talk\nSeptember 16, 2010\n\nBreakthroughs in Imaging Neurovascular Diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis: Technical Aspects, Clinical Ramifications, and Understanding the Etiology of the Disease.  Presented by Dr. E. Mark Haacke.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging has long been an important diagnostic tool for Multiple Sclerosis. Recent developments linking MS to venous malformations have highlighted the use of advanced techniques for imaging iron deposits and blood flow. We introduce here a number of new technical image acquisition and image processing concepts whose application may well extend into other diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, stroke and traumatic brain injury. Finally, the development and data mining of worldwide data in specific diseases will also be discussed.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nE. Mark Haacke is a world renown MRI researcher at Wayne State University. He won the Gold Medal in Kyoto in 2004 for his work on Susceptibility Weighted Imaging and Education. He is the past president of two MRI societies and has just formed \"The International Society for Neurovascular Disease\". For the last 30 years, Dr. Haacke has focused on the physics and mathematics associated with the technical development of new imaging methods and their clinical applications."
