description: "This talk will explain practical deep learning with tensorflow. No theory, just implementation.\nAll steps for implementing a model will be explained using good patterns.\n\nThe talk will introduce a split into model, loss, dataset and estimator that keeps your code clean and easy to understand. For each of those 4 topics details how to implement it in an efficient, reusable way are explained.\n\nThe talk will assume basic knowledge about deep learning, since it will focus on implementation and no theory.\n\nYou will learn:\n* Writing good quality deep learning code\n* Implementing a model from scratch\n* Implementing a loss\n* Loading a dataset\n* Training a model\n\nEVENT:\n\nGPN18\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMichael Furst\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX51Dc1Dsbg"
