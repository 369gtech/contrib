title: 'Event Bus as Backbone for Decoupled Microservice Choreography'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502110706
description: "Microservices are independent, encapsulated entities that produce meaningful results and business functionality in tentative collaboration. Events and pub/sub are great for allowing such decoupled interaction. Using Apache Kafka as robust, distributed, real-time, high-volume event bus, this session demonstrates how microservices implemented in Java, Node, Python, and SQL collaborate unknowingly. The microservices respond to social media events (courtesy of IFTTT) and publish results to multiple channels. The event bus operates across cloud services and on-premises platforms; both the bus and the microservices can run anywhere.\n\nSpeaker: Lucas Jellema"
