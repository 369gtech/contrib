recordingDate: 1579299217
description: "Anton Blanchard\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/151/\n\nAt the OpenPOWER summit USA in August 2019, IBM opened up the POWER ISA making it available to be implemented royalty free. IBM also presented microwatt, a reference implementation of the POWER ISA.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be a walk through the POWER OpenISA and what microwatt is. It will also give some of the future directions we'd love to see the project taken.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 13:30:00 2020 at Room 7"
