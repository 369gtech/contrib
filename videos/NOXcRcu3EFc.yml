Yet we often struggle and feel a lot of pain when working for our clients. Why is collaboration with our clients so hard at times?\n\nAnd how can we cope with this discomfort that ranges from mild annoyance to rageful job quitting?\n\nFor Nihan, shifting from working FOR to working WITH the client has proven to be one of the most powerful solutions for these kind of challenges. By sharing the lessons learned, she will talk about her insights and observations from numerous collaborative projects, and illustrate how most of us share the same feelings when it comes to the occasionally annoying but mostly fruitful client work.\n\nThis talk is a service designerâ€™s take on how to become a successful team with your client rather than just delivering, and how to get back the energized feeling of joy. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/amuse"
