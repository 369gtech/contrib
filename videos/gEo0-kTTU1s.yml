Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nGetting More Out of Lua in Fluent Bit- Pranav Marla, Fidelity Investments\n\nFluent Bit has many useful plugins and features but by far its most powerful feature is its support for custom scripts written in a programming language called Lua. Unfortunately, it can also often be one of Fluent Bit's most underutilized features, with most users limiting themselves to minor variations of the sample scripts provided in Fluent Bit's documentation. This is because Lua is not as well-known as other programming languages, and its unfamiliarity can make it seem intimidating to people and prevent them from taking full advantage of its capabilities. This talk aims to help users become more comfortable using Lua outside the bounds of those sample scripts by walking through some novel scenarios, as well as sharing some tips and tricks, to help users take advantage of Lua to unlock Fluent Bit's true potential."
