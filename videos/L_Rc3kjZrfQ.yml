description: 'Testing, testing, testing. We all know it has to be done, but no one likes to do it. In this session youâ€™ll get all needed introduction to get started with Spock -the coolest testing and specification framework for Java and Groovy applications. What makes it stand out from the crowd is its beautiful and highly expressive specification language. Thanks to its JUnit runner, Spock is compatible with most IDEs, build tools, and continuous integration servers. Spock is inspired from JUnit, RSpec, jMock, Mockito, Groovy, Scala, Vulcans, and other fascinating life forms.'
