description: "Upcoming JS Conference:\r\nJS Fest 2020 - 3-4th of April, Kiev, Ukraine\r\nDetails and tickets: http://bit.ly/2EoHvQo\n\nThe talk from JS Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://mafintosh.github.io/jsfest-ua-2018/#0\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/JSFestua/\nWebsite: http://jsfest.com.ua/\n\nBuilding complex applications that run in the terminal can be tricky. They usually have a ton of state and if you want to update the terminal output you have to understand things like ANSI codes or frameworks like ncurses. What if, instead, we used a simple approach, similar to writing React web apps, where you always render your entire application but then use a framework that can figure only to update the small diff that actually changed. That's exactly what the diffy framework does! I this talk I'll talk about fun command line apps and do live coding to show how easy they are to write."
