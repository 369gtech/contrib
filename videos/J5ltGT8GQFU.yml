recordingDate: 1350916948
description: "Take a Free introductory instructor-led Live class at : http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course\n\nThis android tutorial talks about Basic Java Syntax in detail:\n\nJava syntax is mostly derived from C and C++. While Java is almost a true object-oriented language. No global functions or methods exist in Java, everything comes under a class except for primitive types, which are not represented by a class instance due to performance reasons. \n\nDifferent data-types that are generally used in java, like - long, int, short, byte, double, float, char, boolean etc. are explained in this lecture.\n\n\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \nhttp://www.edureka.co\n\nUse the link to watch all videos of this session :\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOHYERMLX7oJHhdXUTPAo3NF"
