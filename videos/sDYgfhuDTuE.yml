recordingDate: 1612990241
description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nSHARING MY PREFERENCE FOR DATASTORE\nFlorina Muntenescu, Android Developer Advocate, Google\n\nDataStore is a new and improved data storage solution, replacing SharedPreferences. Built on Kotlin coroutines and Flow, DataStore provides two different implementations: Proto DataStore, that stores typed objects (backed by protocol buffers) and Preferences DataStore, that stores key-value pairs.\nIn this talk you’ll see what DataStore offers over SharedPreferences, like being notified when data changes via Flow, UI thread safety, error signaling and more, when you should use it, how to adopt it or migrate from SharedPreferences. We’ll also sneak peeks at the implementation to better understand how the API works.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro​​​...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/​​​\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
