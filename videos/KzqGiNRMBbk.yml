description: "Presented by James Halliday at JSLA (js.la) March 28th, 2013\nBrowserify lets you use node-style require() calls to load files and npm modules in the browser (it's awesome).\n\nThe recent browserify v2 rewrite embraces streaming APIs, lots of tiny modules all doing exactly one thing well, and timeless unix wisdom. Now you can bundle static assets with source transforms, generate compact bundles with standalone streaming pipeline tools, trivially test your modules in node and against every browser ever and other superpowers all with a new very tiny bundle file size overhead that supports multiple bundles.\n\nFinally the sublime wisdom of node and unix can be realized all the way up the stack in browsers too.\n\nTwitter: twitter.com/substack"
