title: 'CON2385   Standardized Extension Building in Java EE with CDI and JCA'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449597509
description: "In 2003 the Java EE ecosystem received a gift with extensions: JCA 1.5 support in J2EE 1.4. However, it wasn’t until Java EE 5, in 2006, that extensions were really talked about. In Java EE 5, we received Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI). Along with the namesake of the specification, extensions were introduced. Together we have the ability to extend the platform to do whatever we need. The possibilities of these extensions are limited only by your imagination. You’ve heard about CDI and the extensibility of Java EE 6 and seen enough to pique your curiosity. This session will sate that curiosity and give you enough information to build great extensions for your application and business.\n\nSpeaker:\nJASON PORTER, Senior Software Engineer, Red Hat Inc\nJason is a software engineer currently working in the Java Enterprise Edition Space, Arquillian, Forge, web site and other developer experience projects within Red Hat. His specialties include Wildfly, Seam, CDI, JSF, Java EE, and Gradle. He has worked with PHP, Ruby, Groovy, XSLT, SASS the rest of the web language arena (HTML, CSS, JS, etc). His current position as Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat has him work primarily on the JBoss website, however, he also contributes to JBoss Forge, Arquillian, Apache DeltaSpike, Awestruct, Asciidoctor and others as time allows.
