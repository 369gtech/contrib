description: "Diversity and Inclusion are hot topics right now. But, year after year, our industry fails to move the numbers significantly. It seems everyone is talking about it, but how do you actually bring about change?\n\nIn this presentation, I’ll share the concrete actions from my efforts to bring inclusive practices into an engineering organization. From conceptualization to communication and implementation, you’ll hear about what worked and where I struggled. You’ll walk away with real world tactics—going beyond unconscious bias training and rooney rules—that you can use to start building your own inclusive workplaces."
