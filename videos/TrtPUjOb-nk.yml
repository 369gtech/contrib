description: "Parsing HTML in order to load a full Web page is a complex process. On the one hand the browser needs to discover external resources as soon as possible. On the other hand, those same resources can in some cases block the browser's HTML parser, as they may change the eventual result. Over the years browsers have developed mechanisms to cope with that, to make sure resources are discovered even if the parser is blocked.\n\nAt the same time, the link element is used to signify a relation between the current page and other resources. It allows us to tell the browser that a certain page should be styled using a certain resource, has an RSS feed alternative, is likely to be followed by another page and much more.\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss the connection between these two seemingly separate subjects, and talk about a number of new link relations that enable us to improve the browser's resource discovery process, and get us faster loading Web pages.\n\nSlides: http://yoavweiss.github.io/link_htmlspecial_16/\nAbout Yoav: https://blog.yoav.ws\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
