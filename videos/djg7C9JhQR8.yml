title: 'Introducing WinBro for Scalable Streaming Graph Partitioning - Zainab Abbas&Adrian Ackva'
recordingDate: 1571155272
description: 'In today’s world of sensors, events and social networks, data is produced with high frequency, often represented in the form of graphs. Certain applications such as network monitoring and credit fraud detection require fast (near) real-time graph analysis based on the latest data and thus, a great use case for a stream processing framework such as Flink. However, Flink only supports static key-based partitioning which in the case of ever-changing graph data dependencies cannot be a viable solution. On top of that problem, all existing smart graph partitioning algorithms cannot really scale out due to heavy dependencies to shared state. We have therefore investigated the heart of the problem and developed WinBro, a Flink-native framework, that allows the partitioning of graph streams in a scalable way. In principle, our solution exploits Flink''s windowing and broadcast state pattern to achieve the first ever smart yet scalable online graph partitioner. We used our partitioner to create optimal subgraphs using real-world data from social networks with billions of edges. WinBro can be used out-of-the-box for boosting dynamic applications (Page Rank and Connected Components Labelling) as a specialized alternative to Flink’s default hash partitioning.'
