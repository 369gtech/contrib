description: "Google I/O 2009 - Mastering the Android Media Framework\r\n\r\nDavid Sparks\r\n\r\nSome monks might take a vow of silence, but Android certainly hasn't. Attend this session, and help your app find its voice. Android engineer David Sparks will explore the multimedia capabilities of the Android platform, lifting the covers on the infrastructure to show you how it works and the right (and wrong!) ways to use it.  You'll learn how things work under the hood, how to dodge the common media-related developer pitfalls, and how to write secure and battery-efficient media code\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html"
