description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2012\n\nwww.erlang-solutions.com\nwww.erlang-factory.com\n\n\"This talk wants to sum up the experience of designing, deploying and maintaining an Erlang application targeting the cloud and precisely AWS as hosting infrastructure.\n\nAs the application now serves a significantly large user base with a sustained throughput of thousands of games actions per second we're able to analyse retrospectively our engineering and architectural choices and see how Erlang fits in the cloud environment also comparing it to previous experiences of clouds deployments of other platforms.\n\nWe'll discuss properties of Erlang as a language and OTP as a framework and how we used them to design a system that is a good cloud citizen. We'll also discuss topics that are still open for a solution.\_\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory \_https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\_\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory \_http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
