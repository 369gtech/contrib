recordingDate: 1491217257
description: 'The next milestone in Java world is Java 9 release, which is planned (as of now) in summer 2017. One of the key features of it is Jigsaw – Java Module System. The one important difference comparing to other features is that, as they say, Jigsaw is ”not a jetpack, but a safety belt.” It improves security model of Java, introduces dependency check at compile and start time – and in the same time enforces significant restrictions to the way how classes can access each other. That’s why there is an ongoing discussion about how existing frameworks will behave in Java 9 world. Let’s do some hands-on – take application which utilizes commonly-used framework, make it compliant with Java 9/Jigsaw, run it on Java 9 JVM and find out!'
