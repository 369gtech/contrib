description: "When a software system is getting bigger and older, it's also harder to change it due to many reasons: it absorbed too many coding styles from too many people, it was build upon some obsolete or redundant technologies, it has a lot of dependencies, which you can't get rid of, there are a lot of hidden assumptions inside, which cannot be decrypted and etc. That's a pain of our industry and there are many solutions to this. Personally, to solve this, I found that it's easier to start developing an application as a bunch of microservices, but after few attempts, I also have found that it is also easy to build them wrong, missing some key components of microservices architecture or to postpone 'em until the very last moment and then to find out that your other services can't work together as they should. In order to address this problem I'm offering this talk. It will contain:\nDescription of what microservices really are\nExplanation of the problem they intend to solve and how exactly it should happen\nProblems with microservices adoption with practical examples\nSolution to these problems with practical examples\nSolutions will include explanation of three key components for every microservices app: Service Registry, Gateway API and Health-check System. Also I'd like to give some examples of the components implementation using modern JVM -based tools and frameworks, just to show how easily it could be done. Also, it will be slightly cloud-related talk, since many of these tools are designed to work in cloud environment."
