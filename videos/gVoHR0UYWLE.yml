recordingDate: 1538634034
description: "With more than 10 years of experience helping Fortune 500 companies modernize and move their applications to Cloud, we have discovered several truths that apply to nearly every initiative:\n\n1. A brownfield strategy is critical to the success of any cloud program, since non-cloud workloads dominate the enterprise\n\n2. Enterprises must translate what \"Cloud Native\" guidelines mean in each app portfolio and for existing applications\n\n3. Conflicting priorities, lack of clarity and lack of SME bandwidth can spell doom for a transformation initiative\n\n4. Application modernization efforts must be structured and highly automated to deliver ROI\n\nIn this session, we will demonstrate how Syntel has helped clients execute brownfield application modernization initiatives, and explain how we automate the implementation of cloud native guidelines with the SyntBots automation platform.\n\nAttendees can expect to learn how to apply and automate cloud native principles, as well as best practices for achieving a digital and Pivotal Cloud Foundry transformation in a brownfield scenario.\n\nSpeakers:\nAshok Balasubramanian\nVice President, Syntel\n\nNaman Kher\nPrincipal Consultant, Cloud CoE, Syntel\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
