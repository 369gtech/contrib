description: "Automatic differentiation is all the rage these days, largely because it is a key enabler for machine learning. But reverse-mode AD (the important kind) is a bit mind bending, and becomes much more so if you want reverse-mode AD for higher order programs (i.e. the kind we love).\n\nIn this talk I’ll explain what AD is, and how we can do it for higher order programs, using a series of simple steps that take us a simple-and-obviously-correct version to a weird-but-very-efficient one. At the end of the road we’ll find the Kmett/Pearlmuttter/Siskind ‘ad’ library in Hackage… but I hope we’ll see it with new eyes."
