description: "Many developers want to make use of machine learning in their applications but aren’t sure what sorts of problems can be solved with it. This talk will explain the sorts of problems that can be solved, what data is required to solve them, and what the results look like. And, we’ll explore it using fun and geeky examples. We will cover five major types of problems that machine learning can solve: regression, forecasting, impact analysis, classification, and anomaly detection. When we’re done, you’ll have a basic understanding of what machine learning can do and what you might want to use it for. I might even be something other than role-playing!\n\nEVENT:\n\nIndyPy 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nGuy Royse\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhaCTZdNN0w"
