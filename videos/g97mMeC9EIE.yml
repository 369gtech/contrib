description: "The talk from QA Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: will be added soon\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/QAFest/\nWebsite: http://qafest.com/\n\nTesting provides the headlights for the projectâ€”but where should those headlights be pointed? In a car, the headlights are naturally pointed towards the road ahead, but on a software development project, we don't always know where precisely where we're headed. Problems directly in front of us pose a risk to the business... but where else might risk threaten the value of the product or the project?\nIn this presentation (co-authored with James Bach), Michael Bolton takes a deep dive into the relationship between testing, problems, and risk. He'll offer an approach to looking at the risk story, and the factors that inform it, and he'll provide you with a set of ideas to help you develop a risk model for your project."
