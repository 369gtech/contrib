description: "In this talk we take an in-depth tour of the different job and cluster configuration options available in Flink and how to leverage them to maximize performance, stability, security and observability of your pipeline. Flink features an impressive set of configuration and tuning options that an expert user can use to take their application to the next-level, and with every release the list of possibilities keeps on growing.\n\nBased on experience gathered over years of large scale flink deployment of hundreds of streaming jobs, we walk you through the most important configuration parameters that can make or break your application and also cover some rabbit holes that you might want to avoid. We will try to touch on the most important topics including resource allocation, state backend configuration, logging, metrics, debugging and security.\n\nBy the end of this talk you should have an up-to-date and comprehensive view of the configuration options available in Flink to fine tune your streaming applications."
