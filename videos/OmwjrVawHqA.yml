description: "Even if you're brand new to Kotlin, you might know that you can right-click any Java file and convert it automatically. Score! But wait, what are all these \"!!\" and why is the code littered with \"?\". Sure, the code compiles, but how do you make the code not just compile but follow best practices? How do you get closer to making your code idiomatic?\n\nIn this talk we discuss how you can get started in Kotlin by converting current code and adding new code, how to make that code more Kotlin-esque, including some good practices and some things to avoid. Hopefully, you will leave this talk being able to get over those bumps and speed your way to Kotlintown.\n\nHuyen Tue Dao is an Android developer and Google Developer Expert, currently working on the Trello Android app at Atlassian. She is also co-creator of the \"Android Dialogs\" YouTube channel. Huyen lives in Denver, CO though is often found in the DC Metro area. When not up late programming, she is often found up late gaming (video, board, card, anything).\n\nChristina Lee is an Android developer at Pinterest, where she works on Core Product initiatives, including video and networking."
