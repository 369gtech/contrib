title: 'An Auto-Join Network of Internet of Things Devices with a Java SE Embedded Lookup Service'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433232233
description: "This tutorial provides a coding and design example of an auto-join network of Internet of Things sensors and devices capable of dynamically locating remote services through a lookup service, using an advanced discovery process based on Java SE Embedded technology on a nearby wireless gateway. The lookup service returns Java objects that can be used by services and devices to register themselves so they can be found by client applications. Embedded client applications can use the lookup service to retrieve a Java proxy object to the service to call service requests in a secure fashion with proper authentication and encryption.\n\n\nAuthors:\n Hinkmond Wong\nHinkmond Wong is a Consulting Member of Technical Staff with the Java\nEmbedded group and has been working at former Sun Microsystems, Inc.,\nnow Oracle for over 19 years.
