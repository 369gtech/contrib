description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nMany of you are already using a number of tools to aid your C++ development process: from static analyzers like clang-tidy in your IDEs, through dynamic analysis with sanitizers, to debugging with gdb and performance analysis with perf, tools like these help make your programs better, safer and faster.\n\nIn this talk I will introduce you to some of their lesser known friends that are somewhat connected to compilers and might prove useful for your daily work. Also, in the end, we’ll have some fun!\n— \nReka Kovacs\nPhD Student, Eotvos Lorand University\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
