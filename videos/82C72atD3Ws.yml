description: "How often do you search for “how to do [x] in [language]”? Maybe you’re a Python developer who thinks Go’s dedication to clean syntax feels familiar, or maybe you’re a Ruby dev who thinks Erlang’s pattern matching doesn’t leave enough freedom in your code to deal.\n\nLanguage differences and similarities both enamor and infuriate us, but much as we love to debate otherwise, no language is 100% evil or 100% good.\n\nThere are reasons and background stories for why they do what they do.

Language list: Ruby, Python, Go and/or Rust, Erlang, Clojure, JavaScript"
