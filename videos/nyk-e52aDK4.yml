description: "Garden Project Update [I] - Julz Friedman, IBM  \n\nYou may know that Cloud Foundry uses Garden as its API for Container Management. But why does CF use Garden rather than Docker? What are the major features and advantages of the Garden Container Engine? How does Garden relate to other container technology you may have heard of (like OCI, runC, CRI-O, containerd and docker)? What security features does Garden give you out-of-the-box that other technologies make you configure?\n\nIn addition, this talk will provide an update on some of the major advances in Cloud Foundry Containers over the past year, including:\n\nThe Move to RunC - ensuring CF uses the exact same low-level open-standards-based container-runtime as other platforms (e.g. Kubernetes, Docker etc).\n\nPlugin API - allowing extension and experimentation in the platform, including container to container networking and more performance and supported overlayfs-based root filesystem management.\n\nSecurity Advances - Garden is the most secure container-runtime *out of the box* for multi-tenant deployments. We now take the guess-work out of configuring your container engine for multi-tenant deployments by enabling and configuring the needed features out of the box.\n\nDocker Auth, CPU Maximums, Better DNS Support - lots of new work for operability in large-scale environments, including support for CPU maximums, better DNS auto-configuration and support for username and passwords when pushing Docker Images.\n\nJulian Friedman\nIBM\nProduct Manager / Software Engineer\nJulian is an IBMer and the Product Manager of Garden Core, Cloud Foundry’s Container Engine supporting both buildpack and docker apps. Julian has worked on Cloud Foundry and IBM’s Cloud Foundry deployment, BlueMix, for 4 years and before that on Cloud Technologies, IBM Watson, Large Scale Performance engagements and Map/Reduce for around 10. He holds a doctorate in Large Scale Complex IT Systems. Julian spoke at all of the past Cloud Foundry Summits and at various other conferences, including twice at ContainerSched and at CF Meetups and authored the InfoQ article “Build Your Own Container in Fewer than 100 Lines of Go” which was one of the Golang Newsletter’s 10 most popular articles of 2016."
