recordingDate: 1493027637
description: "In the last 5 years we observe rapidly increasing interest to artificial neural networks. But what are neural networks and how do they differ from conventional algorithms?\nWhat kind of problems we can resolve with neural networks that could not solve with traditional approaches? In this session we will answer those questions explaining neural networks principles. We will explain concepts behind neural networks and give insight of neural networks usage such as self-driving cars, image recognition, automated translation and text analysis. We will walk you through real life application example: recognition of hand written digits using classical MNIST dataset and convolutional neural network. As a framework Microsoft CNTK and Tensorflow will be used in practical part of presentation."
