title: 'Java EE Next  HTTP 2 and REST Opportunities'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474495485
description: 'New paradigms such as microservices architecture, cloud-native development, and serverless computing suggest enhancements to Java EE going forward. As always, we need to be cautious when adding new technologies to Java EE, in order to avoid the “great technology of the day” trap. The recently announced Java EE effort presents many new opportunities. This session focuses on two areas: HTTP and REST. It discusses what HTTP/2 might bring to Java EE and then looks at some REST opportunities, such as the popular circuit break pattern, protocol buffers, a reactive client API, and NIO improvements. The goals of the session are to present potential improvements involving those two core technologies and to gather feedback.'
