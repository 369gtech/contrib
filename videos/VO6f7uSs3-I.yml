description: "Solo5: A sandboxed, re-targetable execution environment for unikernels A {unikernel,kernel} is just a {process,hypervisor} in disguise\nby Martin Lucina and Ricardo Koller\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.121/solo5_unikernels.webm\n\n\nSolo5 is a microkernel friendly, sandboxed, re-targetable execution\nenvironment for unikernels, with a taste for minimalism. We will start with\nan overview of core Solo5 concepts and present the interfaces it offers to\nthe unikernel/library operating system/application developer. Using\nexisting library operating systems, such as MirageOS, we will demonstrate\nthe developer experience for various Solo5 targets, going on to show how\nrigorously applying minimalist principles to interface design is used to\nour advantage, blurring traditional lines between unikernels, processes,\nkernels and hypervisors. We will conclude with some lessons learned during\ndevelopment of Solo5 thus far, and present ideas and challenges for future\ndevelopment. \n\nThe target audiences for this talk are application developers with an\ninterest in operating systems and unikernels, language runtime and\ntoolchain developers interested in porting their language to a unikernel\nenvironment such as Solo5, and operating systems developers in general. No\n{uni,micro,separation,monolithic,}kernels or hypervisors will be harmed\nduring this talk. \n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 14:30:00+01"
