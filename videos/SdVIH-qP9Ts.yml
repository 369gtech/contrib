Deployment, security, monitoring -- this list is far from complete.\nIn this talk Serhiy will speak about how to establish a fast and reliable communication channels between microservices. What patterns, protocols and data formats are available. How to enforce a backwards compatibility and strict contract between services and their clients. When we should use sync or async communication style, and so on.\nCome to this session and hopefully you will come out with new ideas of how to build your stuff even better."
