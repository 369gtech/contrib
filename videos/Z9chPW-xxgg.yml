description: "Wearable computers are one of the next big things. But at the moment, one can buy only specialized systems such as motion trackers, GPS watches, and the like. So why not use existing cheap technology to build your own wearable Java-powered device? This session shows what you can do with affordable technology and Java today. It uses a Raspberry Pi in combination with a heart rate sensor and a GPS sensor to track the heart rate and the location of a runner. The battery-powered Pi measures the data and publishes it via MQTT to different clients such as Java(FX)-based desktop clients and a smartwatch the runner can wear. Come get some ideas of what you can do with Java and wearable devices.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAngela Caicedo\nAngela Caicedo has been a Java Evangelist for 11 years, first at Sun Microsystems and now at Oracle.
