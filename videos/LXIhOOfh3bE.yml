title: 'Azure SQL VM: Use Azure Monitor Metrics to Track VM Cache Health (Ep. 3) | Data Exposed'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628784010
description: "Azure Monitor is a technology used to collect telemetry data from your Azure and on-premises environments. You can use Azure Monitor to improve performance and support the stability of your applications by identifying issues quickly. Azure Monitor includes Azure Metrics and Azure Logs to store telemetry data and track data in real-time and for historical analysis.\n\nAzure Metrics track values collected at regular intervals and can be used to describe the health of your resources at a particular point in time. Azure Metrics are lightweight and useful for creating dashboard KPIs, alerting, and fast detection of issues.\n\nIn part three of this seven-part Azure SQL VM series, we will use Azure metrics to identify the uncached and cached health of your virtual machine and disk resources. We will show how to find metrics at the VM scope, pin metrics to create a custom dashboard, how to manage alerts, and finally comparing cached and uncached metrics at the VM and disk levels.\n\n0:00 Show begins\n0:48 Tracking VM cached health\n2:55 Demo\n9:23 Getting started\n\n✔️Resources:\nDisk performance metrics: https://aka.ms/storagemetrics?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner\nAzure Monitor: https://aka.ms/azuremonitor?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner\n\n🎞️ More episodes in the Azure SQL VM series:\nCaching and Storage Capping (Ep. 1): https://youtu.be/GXEINbYKo94\nWhat is SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension (Ep. 2): https://youtu.be/KUlpjoeFipk\n\n📝 Azure SQL Virtual Machine Reimagined Series: https://aka.ms/azuresqlvmyt\n\n📌 Let's connect:\nTwitter: David Pless, https://twitter.com/dpless\nTwitter: Anna Hoffman, https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna\nTwitter: AzureSQL, https://aka.ms/azuresqltw\n\n🔔 Subscribe to our channels for even more SQL tips: https://aka.ms/msazuresqlyt\n\n#AzureSQL​​​ #AzureSQLVM #AzureMonitor​ #AzureSQLVirtualMachine"
