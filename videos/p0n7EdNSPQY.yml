title: 'USENIX ATC ''15 - Latency-Tolerant Software Distributed Shared Memory'

description: "Latency-Tolerant Software Distributed Shared Memory\n\nJacob Nelson, Brandon Holt, Brandon Myers, Preston Briggs, Luis Ceze, Simon Kahan, and Mark Oskin, University of Washington\n\nWe present Grappa, a modern take on software distributed shared memory (DSM) for in-memory data-intensive applications. Grappa enables users to program a cluster as if it were a single, large, non-uniform memory access (NUMA) machine. Performance scales up even for applications that have poor locality and input-dependent load distribution. Grappa addresses deficiencies of previous DSM systems by exploiting application parallelism, trading off latency for throughput. We evaluate Grappa with an in-memory MapReduce framework (10x faster than Spark); a vertex-centric framework inspired by GraphLab (1.33x faster than native GraphLab); and a relational query execution engine (12.5x faster than Shark). All these frameworks required only 60-690 lines of Grappa code.\n\nView the full USENIX ATC '15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc15/technical-sessions"
