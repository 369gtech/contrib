description: "At lightning speed, this talk will cover the bits that aren’t code that make up a working web app. These include servers, monitoring, deployment mechanisms, logging, alerting, secret management, recovery mechanisms… you get the idea.\n\nMaterial will be provided afterwards so you can try everything out on your own and really cement the concepts for yourself. Topics include: How to set up a web server on Linux, deploying changes to a web server with minimum downtime, keeping an eye on your server to make sure things are working, tracking down production bugs, and secure communication over HTTPS.\n\n// This talk was given by Samir Talwar at SC London 2017, a conference dedicated to Craftsmanship values, XP practices & clean code.
