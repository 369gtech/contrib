description: "Michael Still\n\nhttps://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/41704-learning-from-the-mistakes-that-even-big-projects-make/\n\nSince 2011, I've worked on a large Open Source project in python. It kind of got out of hand -- 1000s of developers and millions of lines of code. Yet despite being well resourced, we made the same mistakes that those tiny scripts you whip up to solve a small problem make. Come learn from our fail.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, australia, programming, sydney\n\nThis video is licensed under CC BY 3.0 AU ‹https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/›.\r\n\r\nPyCon Australia (“PyCon AU”) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python.\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU"
