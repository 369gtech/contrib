description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2012\n\nwww.erlang-solutions.com\nwww.erlang-factory.com\n\n\"After the success of the Java Hot Spot VM, just-in-time compilers are become more and more popular in more and more languages. Just-in-time compilers attempt to make code run faster by compiling parts of your programs to native code in order to speed up execution time. Just-in-time compilers have been shown to speed up performance by up to a factor of 5 for specific benchmarks and it is about time that the Erlang VM is fitted with one of its own.\n\nThis talk will give a brief overview of the different approaches one can take to just-in-time compiling and then dive into the details of how the Erlang VM executes code. After laying the ground work I will try to explain how a JIT can be done for the Erlang VM and finish of with a status report of what work has been done so far.\_\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory \_https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory\_\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory \_http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
