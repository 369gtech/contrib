description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nWe use a lot of code analysis tools to find out what's bad in the current version of our code. But in addition, Git commit logs contain a lot of analytical information about how our code has changed over time. Sometimes it can give us new valuable information but sometimes it is just fun to analyze also meaningless statistics. The presenter is the author of eazyBI data analysis application which can also be used to analyze Git commit logs. In this presentation, commit logs of several open source projects will be used as case studies. We will reveal new meaningful and also meaningless funny statistics about them."
