description: "Reinventing the Way of Building a Core Software Product in a 50 Year Old IT Company - Roman Swoszowski, Grape Up\n\nIn the fast-paced software development industry, to be ahead of competition means to deliver features, reliability and resilience at the speed demanded by today’s business – making your product cloud based seems to be a go-to plan. Nevertheless, moving the company’s legacy core product written in .Net to the cloud not only sounds but is also extremely complicated. In this talk, we will explain how Grape Up helped one of their customers throughout a journey to change waterfall to DevOps, on-premise to Cloud, and why Cloud Foundry was a vital part of that transformation. During the presentation we will share facts and statistics based on a true case study which compares the old, on-premise era with the new cloud era. Faster time to market, release cycle reduced to 2 weeks instead of 6 months, new style of working and thinking, .NET transformation on Cloud Foundry, culture of continuous feedback. We will prove it’s possible and worth it.\n\nAbout Roman Swoszowski\nRoman Swoszowski is VP and Head of Cloud R&D at Grape Up, responsible for developing the overall technology vision of the company with a focus on cloud native and open source technologies.
