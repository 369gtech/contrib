description: "Daniel Bryant, Principal Consultant, Big Picture Tech\nAdam Farley, Programmer / Developer, IBM\n\nAdoptOpenJDK: Lessons Learned from the New Build Farm for Java Itself [TUT5283]\nThe AdoptOpenJDK Build Farm is a new community project producing high-quality OpenJDK binaries for all versions, platforms, and variants. Want Java 10 with OpenJ9 on AIX or maybe Java 8 with HotSpot on macOS? AdoptOpenJDK can help! This session covers how 200+ people (from companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Red Hat), cloud providers, and the wider Java community (e.g., the LJC) collaborated to create a full build farm in under a year for the common good. Also learn how a modern CI build+test pipeline works:\n• Building hosts with Ansible\n• Build coordination with Jenkins\n• Advanced shell scripts for building Java on any platform\n• Swaths of testing\n• Certification\n•Deploying binaries via AdoptOpenJDK.net and the API gateway"
