description: "Elias Nogueira, Software Engineer in Test, Sicredi\nTatiane Aguirres Nogueira, Consultant developer, ThoughtWorks\n\nAutomating tests on a web front end is not the most important level in the test automation pyramid, but it is critical from a user perspective. If it is not done with minimal architecture and good use of software engineering practices, we will have a lot of maintenance and abandonment of tests in this layer. A test architecture using Selenium WebDriver with the Page Object model; some design patterns; parallel execution for multiple browsers, using containers that can autoscale and support a large test suite; and putting all this together in a test pipeline may be a good strategy for smashing the bugs and maintaining the high quality of your application. Learn more in this session."
