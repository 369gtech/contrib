description: "Speaker: Bahman Nikkhahan\n\nThis session is from NDC Sydney 2020\n\nMaintaining a legacy application sometimes could be cumbersome and costly. Hosting upgrade could be one step towards modernizing an app and helping future improvements of legacy products.\nThis talk is a case study about a legacy application which has gone through a lot of transformation throughout 15 years of development. It has many components that are dependent of IIS and Windows. The application had around 200 installations in separate Virtual Machine and on-premise infrastructure for individual clients. The main purpose of modernizing its hosting was to reduce maintenance efforts and costs.\nAzure Kubernetes Services with Windows containers and Azure SQL Server have been chosen for the target hosting platforms. In this talk I will take you through why we chose these hosting options, how did we implement our solution, challenges that we experienced in this journey and what are the lessons learned."
