recordingDate: 1523513948
description: "Join technical Drupal Commerce veteran, Josh Miller (all things programming) and Account Manager, Becky Parisotto (all things business) as they walk through the wild world of physical commerce that is powered by and paired with a Drupal web interface. Both Josh and Becky work together with a number of physical commerce clients. Through our client’s requirements, we have gained a better understanding of the iceberg that is building an interface for retail, and allowing for that true omni-channel experience for both customer, and (sometimes more importantly) the business owner.\n\nJosh will review the state of Point of Sale as it integrates with Drupal Commerce 2 on Drupal 8, compare and contrast fulfillment in the new shipping and inventory modules, and talk about a new module that handles requesting products from your suppliers and updates store stock when its received. Additionally, Becky will walk us through what Drupal Commerce is capable of in the way of “powering your business” and truly being the end to end backend brain for finances, accounting, product management, customer management, shipping, fulfillment, stock, inventory and community. Drupal Commerce is a big box of legos, come and learn how we build fully integrated businesses, from the web to the storefront to the back of house, to the warehouse, and more.\n\nThis is meant to be a practical review with easy to digest client examples and micro case studies of how we merge an online tool with a physical store. Setting clients in digital stone, all powered by Drupal."
