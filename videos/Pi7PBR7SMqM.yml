description: "HTML5 has been quite the buzzword for a while now and as developers we are stuck in between a massive demand and a lack of technical support. Devices and hardware that promised to be the bright future of HTML5 are not allowing us to do the things we want to.\n\nIn this talk Mozilla's Chris Heilmann will show how we can juggle our demands and move forward towards a world where HTML5 is not a cool \"nice to have\", but the standard it set out to be. There is a lot to be defined and many great things brewing - we just need to push where movement is needed rather than going in lots of different directions.\n\n** For more from HTML5DevConf, head to http://mrkn.co/kwu5v"
