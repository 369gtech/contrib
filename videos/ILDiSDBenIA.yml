description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nDeep Dive into Service Mesh Data Plane Performance and Tuning - Les Peng(彭磊) & Forrest Chen(陈凌鹏), Tencent \n\nThe benefits Service Mesh offers are widely recognized, however, the latency caused by the introduction of sidecars raises a big concern，and has become the main reason that holds back its adoption.    This talk will start with a performance break down of data plane from kernel to user space, explaining latency cost from iptables redirecting in the pod to sidecar and traffic forwarding delays while processing telemetry due to the Envoy filter mechanism.Then the speakers will walk through the approaches applied in Tencent that gain a 50% latency improvement.   1.use eBPF SOCKMAP to bypass additional message traverses in the kernel between Envoy and container by simply adding a new Daemonset  2.extend Envoy with a task scheduler to moves telemetry task to async-worker, which improves the resource allocation and prioritize the execution of traffic forwarding worker. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp9j"
