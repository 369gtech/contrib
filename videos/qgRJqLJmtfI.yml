description: "by Ewan Slater\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.119/containers_free_tools_devroom_2019.webm\n\n\nHoney I shrunk the container! Containers are increasingly the standard mechanism for packaging, delivering and deploying software. \n\nThey provide a simpler, more lightweight architecturally significant form of virtualisation than VMs. They are a natural candidate for running microservices. But can we do better? \n\nIf we can simplify our containers, we can shrink them further, improving:\n- performance\n- security\n- management \n\nIn this talk I'll be discussing:\n- advantages of microcontainers over containers\n- how to build and use microcontainers\n- Smith (https://github.com/oracle/smith) - a microcontainer builder from Oracle\n- Crashcart - (https://github.com/oracle/crashcart) a tool for debugging microcontainers (and containers) \n\nRoom: UD2.119\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 12:00:00+01"
