description: "Automate Your Life with BOSH Bootloader - Genevieve L'Esperance & Evan Farrar, Pivotal\n\nWell, actually, you need all this other stuff and it won't really change your life, but maybe your life as a Cloud Foundry operator.\n\nIn our talk we will illustrate how to bootstrap Cloud Foundry with bbl and concourse. Starting with a blank IaaS, we'll describe how to get your first BOSH director running concourse, then how to configure concourse to make more BOSH directors running CF, and finally how to configure concourse to update everything (including concourse!) This talk will focus less on hands-on demonstration and more on the philosophy for using these tools in your production deployment. \n\nAbout Evan Farrar\nEvan Farrar is a Product Manager at Pivotal, Cloud Foundry core contributor currently working on the Infrastructure team, which maintains BOSH Bootloader. In his spare time, he runs an orphanage for BOSH deployment manifests at http://github.com/evanfarrar.\n\nAbout Genevieve\nGenevieve is a Senior Software Engineer at Pivotal Cloud Foundry. She is Anchor of the Infrastructure team responsible for providing solutions for automation of provisioning and configuring IaaS resources needed to deploy BOSH, Ops Manager, and other applications before deploying Cloud Foundry. This includes maintaining bosh-bootloader, a CLI for bootstrapping BOSH with a bastion and optional load balancers for a Concourse or Cloud Foundry installation. It also includes multiple terraforming repositories with IaaS-specific terraform templates for deploying an Ops Manager VM and the recommended networking on AWS, GCP, Azure, and vSphere. Genevieve has spoken at the United Nations Economic and Social Council's Youth Forum and the United Nations Social Economic Forum on the representation of women in the tech industry."
