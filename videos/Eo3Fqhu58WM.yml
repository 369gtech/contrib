recordingDate: 1433514889
description: "Due to the demand for more efficiency in distributed Scrum teams, an interactive digital Scrum board based on JavaFX technology was developed. The system is set up in different locations, and changes made on one Scrum board are transferred to the others in real time. The successful development and implementation of the system emphasizes the importance of JavaFX in practice and demonstrates the interactivity and dynamics of this young technology in real life. This session presents extracts from the development process and general development to illustrate the experience gained and lessons learned in the course of the project.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAlexander Casall\nAlexander Casall graduated with a masterâ€™s degree in computer science in 2011.
