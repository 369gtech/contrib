language: English
recordingDate: 1601026496
description: "In this talk, we’ll discuss how modern software developers can take advantage of the new constructs provided by VMware Tanzu Service Mesh (TSM), such as Global Namespaces, to create flexible architectures with advanced degrees of control and security. We’ll explain how they can extract meaningful application-centric metrics, and showcase the new visualization tools they can use. We’ll also cover TSM’s sophisticated policy system, and how to tune system behavior even before events occur.\n\nDeepa Kalani, Staff Engineer 2 at VMware; Ramiro Salas, Staff Technologist II, R&D at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/vmware-tanzu-service-mesh-from-the-developers-perspective"
