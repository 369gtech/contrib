title: 'Samir Talwar: Four Rules of Simple Design to Higher Order Functions @ I T.A.K.E. Unconference 2013'
recordingDate: 1370704396
description: "Quoting @jbrains, \"A design is simple to the extent that it:\n1. Passes its tests\n2. Minimizes duplication\n3. Maximizes clarity\n4. Has fewer elements\"\n\nI want to demonstrate how object-oriented principles can only get you so far in simplifying your design.\nStarting with a clean yet completely imperative code base written in Java, I will explain how we can improve the code by applying functional principlesâ€”primarily extracting functions as objects and passing them around.\nAlong the way, I will be pointing out how each refactor simplifies the code according to one or more of the four rules.\nWe will start by removing duplication, even where duplication isn't apparent from an OO point of view, before making the code clearer by replacing the language of the system by the language of our domain. Along the way, we'll reduce the number of moving parts and increase test coverage.\nI will also show existing libraries in Java and C# that can help you refactor your own code to be smaller and more understandable.\nThis is a live coding presentation. There will be no* slides, just lots of refactoring on a projector. You will not need any understanding of functional programming in order to attend.\n\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
