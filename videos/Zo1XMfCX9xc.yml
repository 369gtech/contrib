title: '[DevFest Nantes 2019] Go “serverless” with Cloud Functions for Firebase'
language: French
recordingDate: 1572525177
description: "Speaker : Doug Stevenson\n\nFirebase makes it incredibly easy to write, deploy, and scale a serverless backend, written in TypeScript, for your app. In this session, \nyou’ll get to experience that using nothing more than a code editor and the Firebase CLI. You’ll see a live demo of an HTTP API, a Firestore trigger, and other deceptively powerful functions that glue together Google APIs and services."
