description: "What is an approximate collection and why would we ever only want an estimate of something? Avi Bryant shows us that when dealing with data collections in sets of millions, or even billions, approximations allow you to get information on an unbounded number of items using a bounded amount of memory.\n\nAvi Bryant, currently a Team Manager at Esty, puts the talk in the context of Algebird, the abstract algebra framework started at Twitter.\n\n** More free Scala resources, everything from NE Scala '12 & '13, and professional training all available at http://bit.ly/nescala13"
