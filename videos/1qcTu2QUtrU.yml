description: "How T-Mobile Built and Scaled Kubernetes On-Prem for the 2018 Retail Season - James Webb, T-Mobile \n\nHave you ever supported a major retail craze like the immediate spike in sales during a new smartphone launch? We have! We've deployed Kubernetes on-premise to support upcoming new smartphone launches and the busiest days of the year for T-Mobile including Black Friday & Cyber Monday. Through our “fail fast, fail forward” approach, we learned many valuable lessons on the way to being successful. Tons of research and testing took place, because failure in production was not an option. Millions of customers purchase smartphones on several key dates, producing huge spikes in transactions across dozens of internal business applications. Come hear our story of how we planned a Kubernetes project for the real world, including the biggest surprises, and keys to success. We’ll help you understand all the things you may not know about deploying on-premise at scale. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrSD"
