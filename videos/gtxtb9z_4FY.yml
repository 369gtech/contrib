description: "Dr. Sidney Dekker, Dr. Steven Spear, Dr. Richard Cook, John Willis and Gene Kim\n\nAs aspiring students of both Lean and Safety Culture, John Willis and I (Gene Kim) observed that there seemed to be many commonalities between the two movements of Safety Culture and Lean: the need for psychological safety, a scientific method for improvement daily work, systems thinking, and so forth. However, instead of these movements seeing the other as mutually supportive bodies of knowledge, they seemed to view the other with suspicion or even in diametric opposition.  \n\nOver the last four years, John Willis and I (Gene Kim) have had the privilege of interacting with many of the most influential thinkers from these two movements. In 2017, John and I filmed a half-day panel with Dr. Richard Cook and Dr. Sidney Dekker from the Safety Culture movement, and Dr. Steven Spear from the Lean movement.\n\nAs John will tell you, on the one hand it was amazing to see such an intellectual tour de force of argumentation, citing philosophy, physics, management and social sciences, medicine, ethics, economics, and even theology. On the other hand, it was at times a pretty stressful and wild ride, and at one point, John and I wondered whether we should have let this stay buried in the desert, so vehement was the discussion. \n\nThis full 2.5 hour dialogue was amazing to be part of, and listening to it always makes me feel smarter.  Certainly, by the end, it was clear that many principles and values span both Lean and safety culture.  \n\nAfter this session, we filmed the 30m panel that has already been posted — it was  in front of the entire conference, and is posted here:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFMJ3V4VakA.  I agree with my friend Charles Betz, who said, “This panel will go down in history as a watershed moment for the digital profession. Notable, in the fullest sense of the word.”"
