Pig is a high-level platform for creating MapReduce programs used with Hadoop. The language for this platform is called Pig Latin.Pig Latin abstracts the  programming from the Java MapReduce idiom into a notation which makes MapReduce programming high level, similar to that of SQL for RDBMS systems.
