title: '"Once more with feeling: Relevant tech skills for GLAMR workers" - Liz Stokes (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612099044
description: "Liz Stokes\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/95/\n\nOne of the best things I love about ‹a href = \"https://carpentries.org/\"›The Carpentries‹/a› is their attention to social infrastructure and community development. What’s also  great about The Carpentries is that their free and open source lesson materials are available for continuous iteration and improvement. In fact, The Carpentries community goes beyond teaching free and open source software (FOSS), and includes ‹a href = \"https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/\"›pedagogical strategies‹/a› for creating positive learning environments and teaching how to collaborate with friendly strangers with shared goals. ‹a href = \"https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/\"›Library Carpentry curriculum‹/a› particularly caters to introducing data science skills to GLAMR workers.  My reply to GO GLAM’s prompt is that GLAMR workers should be actively looking for ways to do things differently, and learning the skills that will loosen their dependency on proprietary software, and sharpen their ability to curate, preserve and share digital collections. FOSS technologists should support and build crossover communities of learners who co-create new practices with software they never thought they’d be able to use, let alone apply in their day to day work. Let's talk about how to create the conditions for putting into practice new skills we don't have (yet).\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSat Jan 23 15:45:00 2021 at Pia Andrews Conservatory"
