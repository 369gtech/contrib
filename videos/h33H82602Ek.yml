description: "Testing in production is the only way to know that your software is working right now in production. It not only increases developer confidence in the code but also development velocity because you will spend less time fixing bugs and more time building new products. This approach provides an increased accuracy of test results, faster test execution time due to elimination of bad data, and you will have higher confidence before releases because you already know that your features will work before you launch. I will talk about the way to run tests in the production environment of a system, how to do it without disrupting real end users, and how to exclude testing data from data and analytics. I will also talk about the tools that help in this process, the benefits of testing in production, why the pros outweigh the cons, and why it's more reliable.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
