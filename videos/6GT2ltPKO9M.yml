recordingDate: 1512086093
description: "Best Practices for Model Driven Approach to Application Release\n\nChris Doucet, Solutions Engineer, Electric Cloud \n\nWhat does your application-release process look like today? Is it fast and efficient? Is it reliable and repeatable? Does it satisfy your quality needs? \n\nEvery release pipeline and every DevOps implementation are different. Enterprises today demonstrate a variety of application-release approaches and are at different stages in their DevOps journeys. \n\nIn this talk, we will discuss these approaches and the pro/cons for each. We will focus on benefits and ROI of a \"Model-driven\" approach, and share best practices and patterns for rolling it out to scale DevOps adoption and in the enterprise and maximize developer productivity, resource utilization and time to market. We'll discuss the impact this release pattern has on your DevOps processes and tooling, pipeline design, infrastructure, and the business.\nThis talk focuses on several use cases and best practices for infrastructure management and automation to support large-scale DevOps â€“ for both legacy applications, as well as modern technologies such as microservices and containers.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
