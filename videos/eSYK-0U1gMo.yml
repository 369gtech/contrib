description: "Lead Trainer: Sheldon Cheng\n\nSheldon is a Front-end Developer at NTUC Link. An aspiring designer who stumbled upon the world of front-end development, he finds it a most rewarding discipline as it allows him to combine design-sensibilities with engineering-knowhow, playing on a synergy between two domains that cannot be found in any other role.\n\nA decade and a half later, Sheldon has crafted web interfaces at UX-focused digital agencies, a mature local startup, and enterprise companies undergoing digital transformation. He tries to be good at UX/Design and Javascript at the same time, and now hopes to help guide those treading a similar path. More recently he has worked on scaling his expertise through Design Systems, and been building apps with ReactJS.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/shldn/\n\nSlides: http://bit.ly/tl-ws1-2019\nWorkshop files: http://bit.ly/tl-starter\n\nEvent Page: http://www.techladies.co/techladies-bootcamp-5\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/rCdj/"
