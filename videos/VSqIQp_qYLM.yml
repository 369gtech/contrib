description: "Technology changes quickly. In the past 25 years we’ve moved from accessing the internet over slow dial-up modems using slow desktop computers to having always-connected mobile supercomputers in our pockets to entirely new virtual and augmented reality experiences. However, through all of this rapid change the human brain has continued to operate the same way it has for millennia, and it’s important for us to understand how we perceive, understand, and behave within the world around us – even the digital worlds we inhabit daily.\n\nWe can create better products, services, and experiences based on core psychological principles and theories enabling us to identify, define, and frame problems more effectively. Dave will use a model of perception, cognition, motivation, emotion, and behaviour to help us understand a wide range of diverse challenges that go beyond interface design and interaction to include context, communication, culture, humour, and more.\n\nDavid Hogue\nUX Design Lead, Google\nhttps://twitter.com/davehogue\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
