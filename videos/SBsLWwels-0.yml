recordingDate: 1523549317
description: "The Project Manager role in the digital space is still in its infancy. Because of that, we work hard each day to define and implement best practices at each level. Once we feel we have mastered our role, there isn’t a clear path of where to go next. What does that next opportunity look like and how do we find it? Now add to that the uniqueness of working within an open source community like Drupal.\n\nTo talk about their own unique career paths and challenges they have faced, we have pulled together 5 panelists of current and former project managers including:\n\nAlex MacMillan, COO, ThinkShout\nDarren Petersen, Senior Technical Project Manager, Lullabot\nJoe Crespo, Director of Accounts, Aten Design Group\nLynn Winter, Freelance Project Manager and Digital Strategist, lynnwintermn.com\nStephanie El-Hajj, Project Manager, Amazee Labs\n\nFor this session, we will start with a brief round of lighting presentations followed by a Q&A discussion. Some questions we will start with include:\n\nWhat is it like to be a PM within the Drupal Community?\nWhat are the different career paths for a PM?\nHow does one stay happy and fulfilled within the role?\nHow do you prepare yourself to move to the next level?\nDo certifications matter?\nHow do you make a freelance career work in this community?\nWe hope that you will bring your own questions to help us\_dive\_into the good stuff!\n\nBy the end of this session, you will walk away will ideas on how to approach your career within this community. The session is for all project managers no matter where you are at\_in your own PM career path."
