recordingDate: 1531743133
description: 'Do you have applications running on Windows Server?  Are those applications difficult to deploy, patch, manage and maintain let alone add new features to?  Container based workflows address many of these challenges.  This session will focus on the container-based developer workflows being enabled in Windows Server along with Azure, Service Fabric and partner services such as Docker that make containers a real option for Windows applications.'
