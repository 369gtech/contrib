description: "Speaker: Dandreb John Bitanghol\n\nI will talk about the advantages of using/adding hooks. How it massively helps pushing features to a large codebase/theme become a cinch, when is the best time to add a hook and where you can usually best place a hook.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nDandreb John Bitanghol is also known as Dreb Bits on the web (to save a couple of bytes and to easily register in peopleâ€™s memory). He hails from the countryside of the sunny Philippines. He is currently a web engineer at 10up, where he focuses on building and supporting WordPress.com VIP sites. He started contributing to WordPress core earlier this year, and builds and maintains a few plugins.\n\nWhen not plugging away with WordPress, Dreb likes taking photos and fantasizing about travel.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.singapore.wordcamp.org/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VfFj/"
