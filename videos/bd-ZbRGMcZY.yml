description: "What Legacy Government Organizations Need to Advance the State of DevOps\n\nSuzette Johnson, NG Fellow, Northrop Grumman \nMrs. Robin Yeman, LM Fellow, Lockheed Martin \n\nTwo large scale legacy government organizations have had similar journeys in transforming their companies to Agile and DevOps. The journey continues.. In order to continue the transformation we need to evolve and build the next generation engineer.\nBuilding cross functional teams with broad skills to deliver value require building new engineers. Currently universities are educating stove piped engineers to solve the last generation of problems. The future of our organizations requires a wider curriculum. If we can not hire out of universities, we need to build them internally.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
