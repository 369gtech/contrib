recordingDate: 1475912930
description: "The dramatic change in the availability of information over the past half century has radically changed the way we learn and share - and considerably lowered the cost of learning. We no longer have to sit in a classroom, pay huge sums of money, or travel long distances to learn. \n\nThis low-cost, low-barriers access to information changes everything about education. If we learn to leverage it, we can change learning from an early activity to a life-long activity. \n\nWe'll discuss the history of education, different methods of teaching and learning, and how technology and improved access to information enables life-long learning. You'll learn about the tools and resources that can help you get the education of a lifetime. \n\nSpeaker\nSteven R. Baker is a programmer, an international conference speaker, founder of RSpec, and much, much more.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
