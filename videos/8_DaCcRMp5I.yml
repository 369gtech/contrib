It is designed for those who have a basic knowledge of Kubernetes and want to learn how to apply domain or application-specific knowledge to automate common operational tasks.  Attendees will understand the past difficulties with building Operators with existing client-libraries and discover how the Operator Framework can ease development workflow.  Step-by-step guidance will be given on the process of creating real-world Operators with Go, Ansible and Helm charts while mastering methodologies, design patterns, and strategies that can assist in avoiding common pitfalls.  Attendees will use the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to define, install and upgrade Operators as well. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaet"
