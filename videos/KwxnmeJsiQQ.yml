description: "From autonomous vehicles, 3D printed rocket engines, and “affordable” consumer-owned satellites to rapid advances in AI and secure, decentralized electronic currencies, the past several years have shown us that the only prediction we can confidently make about the future is that it will arrive more quickly than any of us imagined. Yet with all of these major technological advances, the way we develop, test, deploy, and manage software has been incrementally changing over the years. Many of the most forward-thinking paradigms, practices, and technologies are based on concepts and even implementations created decades ago.\n\nHow can software development itself benefit from the disruptive changes in technology in recent years? This talk will explore influences, tech trends and coming innovations which will change how we as an industry approach to software creation, maintenance, management, and even employment.\n\nEVENT:\n\nAgile India 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nChad Fowler\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw0ZZGgdVio"
