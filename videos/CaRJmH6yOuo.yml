description: "Working within the complexity of building software, you’ve seen some scary things. Things that hold teams, businesses and the humans who use our software back from living their best lives. You’ve also seen and made some incredible things that remind us that anything is possible.\n\nIn this fireside story of horror and glory, Liam will share some laughs and learnings from developers and designers living in the trenches. You’ll come out on the other side with five tips about what to do, and what not to do as a creator of software.\n\nLiam Oscar Thurston\nSr. Director, User Experience, Loblaw Digital\nhttps://twitter.com/liamthurston\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
