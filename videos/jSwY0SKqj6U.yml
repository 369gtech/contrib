description: "by Samuel Thibault\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.121/roadmap_for_the_hurd.webm\n\n\nMost people don't realize it, but the Hurd system is actually well\nestablished. About 75% of Debian official packages do build fine, it\nhas mainstream gcc/glibc/llvm support, go and rust ports are ongoing, it can be\ninstalled with the Debian installer and GuixSD and Arch ports are ongoing... \n\nYet not so much has been happening within the Hurd itself in the past couple of years. We have notably added\na PCI arbiter, which allows for both flexible and safe PCI access for end users,\nand some basic ACPI support is ongoing. But many exciting features could be\nachieved with a bit of work. \n\nThis talk will discuss some of these promising features, to give a sort of ideas\nroadmap for contributions. Some have implementation sketches which just need to be polished to\nbe more production-ready, such as httpfs, mboxfs, or writing translators in\nmore high-level languages than C. Other features are at early stage, such as\nadding sound support through rump, getting complete rid of disk drivers from the\nkernel by moving them to userland, or also getting valgrind support. I will also\ndiscuss some promising ideas, such as using rump to get support for more\nfilesystems. \n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:40:00+01"
