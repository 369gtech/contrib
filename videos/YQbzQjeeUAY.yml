description: "\"I have no idea what I'm doing.\"\n\n\"I don't belong here.\"\n\n\"Everyone else is smarter than me.\"\n\nWhen you're new to any field, particularly a rapidly evolving, ever-changing one, it's normal to experience feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt. However, for many of us, these feelings\_continue well beyond the beginner phase,\_even after we've become successful in our careers. \_The persistence of self-doubt and fear of being discovered as a fraud despite evidence of achievement and success is known as impostor syndrome;\_and although it can happen to anyone, it most commonly afflicts\_high-achieving women, minorities, and other groups that are more likely to feel as if they don't belong.\n\nAs female web developers and a female tech director,\_we\_will\_share\_some of our own struggles\_and strategies to overcome impostor syndrome,\_such as:\_\n\nGetting comfortable with making mistakes on your way to success.\nFinding your own voice and support networks within the community.\_\nRecognizing your ability to contribute, whether it's code, presentations, or mentorship, no matter what your job title is or what level you're at.\nAdvancing your career, whether it's within your current company or when you're job hunting.\nHeather Rodriguez (Engineer at CivicActions), Kat Kuhl (Director of Technology at CHIEF),\_and Sarah Thrasher (Senior Front-end Developer at Acquia) have previously presented this session at BADCamp and NYC Camp."
