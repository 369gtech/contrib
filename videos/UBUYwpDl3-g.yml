description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia November 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nVagif Abilov - FP and OOP Expert & Talented Musician\n\nABSTRACT\nIt finally happened: tired of mutable data structures and thread synchronisation, Vagif's team decided to use functional programming and F# for the next generation of their system. Gigabytes of data are going through their applications every hour with high demand for performance, scalability and failure recovery. The fact that their project has for a long time been in production can identify it as success, but has the choice of FP become an essential part of this success?\nCould they achieve similar development speed and operational stability if we settled for OOP (and C# on .NET platform)?\nThey believe that functional programming provides a set of defaults that can give significant advantages for development with short deadlines and continuous deployment, and Vagif will share their experience [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n05:10 Modeling a point\n08:13 Principle difference in initial sets of defaults between OOP & FP\n11:54 Business objects\n18:08 Order processing\n22:06 Domain modeling in F#\n28:12 Can't we adopt FB style in C#?\n33:26 What advantage did we gain with F#?\n34:07 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/november-2020/sessions/1645/life-after-business-objects-confessions-of-an-oop-veteran\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#OOP #Programming #ProgrammingLanguages #FPvsOOP #FP #FunctionalProgramming #ObjectOrientedProgramming #Fsharp #Csharp\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
