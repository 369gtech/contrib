description: "http://www.cppcon.org\n--\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nThe transformation of data is the only purpose of any program. Common approaches in C++ which are antithetical to this goal will be presented in the context of a performance-critical domain (console game development). Additionally, limitations inherent in any C++ compiler and how that affects the practical use of the language when transforming that data will be demonstrated.\n--\nMike Acton: Engine Director, Insomniac Games\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
