description: "Luna Chen\n\nMonday 17th, 14:30 (Assembly Room)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nIntrospection/reflection allows us to gain a great deal of flexibility and control when building our program. In Python, we get the introspection feature out of the box. This talk will explore various builtin python functions and modules that fall under the category of introspection, and this talk will also demonstrate different use cases.\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for new programmers."
