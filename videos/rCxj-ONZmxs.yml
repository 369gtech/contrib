description: 'We''ve seen significant benefit from introducing microservice architectures, which have allowed teams to scale delivery of independently deployed and maintained services, yet with a very centric focus on back-end. Resulting in teams still creating front-end monoliths - large and sprawling browser applications that are as difficult to maintain and evolve as the monolithic server-side applications we''ve abandoned. In the past years we have seen new approaches coming up to break up this last monolith to provide teams with the entire value stream of concrete part of the application.'
