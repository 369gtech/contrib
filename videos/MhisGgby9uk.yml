description: "Data-centric, even-driven, stateless… these terms are often tossed about when people speak on microservices or distributed systems. But how often do these things work together to deliver the promise of a resilient and trustworthy environment? If you’ve struggled to build a distributed system that can deliver on all the promises of a Reactive, it could be due to poor architectural practices, especially around handling uncertainty that is part and parcel to distribution. But it doesn’t have to remain this way; you can learn to trust and rebuild trust in your systems. In this talk, we will drill into key concepts around Promise Theory and a framework designed to embrace this theory as a principle to building highly resilient, responsive and elastic systems.\n\nKiki Carter, Lightbend\nKiki is a Lightbend Principal Architect and Emerging Tech & Innovation enthusiast with a passion for building large-scale, Reactive Systems. Kiki has extensive delivery experience using Lightbend Reactive Platform in range of industries, from digital commerce and high tech media to hospitality and retail. In her other life, Kiki creates technological solutions to battle human trafficking.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
