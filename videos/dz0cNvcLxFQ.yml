title: '"Electronics from your Kitchen Drawer" - Peter Chubb (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579132593
description: "Peter Chubb\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/66/\n\nMost of the high street electronics shops (with one notable exception) have closed down, so one has to order components online.  But, resistors, capacitors and inductors are fairly easy to make, from materials commonly found around the house.    Active elements to provide gain, or rectification, are a little harder to build,., but are possible.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll show off home made capacitors, coils, resistors, and diodes, and describe my adventures in developing a radio receiver without using any commercial electronic components.  I'll also try to describe the making of a negative resistance gain element.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nWed Jan 15 15:45:00 2020 at Room 7"
