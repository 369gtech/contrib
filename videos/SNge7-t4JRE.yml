title: 'Securing the Software Supply Chain with TUF and Docker'
language: English
recordingDate: 1494276246
description: 'If you want to compromise millions of machines and users, software distribution and software updates are an excellent attack vector. Using public cryptography to sign your packages is a good starting point, but as we will see, it still leaves you open to a variety of attacks. This is why we designed TUF, a secure software update framework. TUF helps to handle key revocation securely, limits the impact a man-in-the-middle attacker may have, and reduces the impact of repository compromise. We will discuss TUF''s protections and integration into Docker''s Notary software, and demonstrate new techniques that could be added to verify other parts of the software supply chain, including the development, build, and quality assurance processes.'
