description: "Don't forget to check out our links below!\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\n\nWith the DevOps revolution we suddenly find ourselves with autonomous teams who can take full ownership and not only develop features but also follow up on their usage, put them in production and fix them when they break. Without operations, the developers suddenly need to care about things such as logging, metrics and container orchestration. How can we get our developers spend more time on building their product and less time on all the tooling?\n\nTo solve this, Meltwater has formed a platform team that creates a paved road for their developers! In this presentation they want to share their success story of how they enable their developers to be both DevOps and productive. They will show not only what, but also how this is done."
