description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch 13, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMy SoC project was Unit test automation in Drupal open source CMS system. Main goal of this project is to design and build an environment capable of automatically installing Drupal, applying a patch and run unit tests. There were two main objectives I tried to acchieve, first how to create a system that would simplify Drupals patch reviewers work and second would not be hard to use. I will try to present problems I encountered and how the system works.  Credits: Speaker:Rok Zlender"
