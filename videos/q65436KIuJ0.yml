language: English
recordingDate: 1433254256
description: "The open source project DataFX 8 builds on the core principle of DataFX 2: make it easy for JavaFX developers to retrieve external data (using REST calls, database systems, or custom methods) and visualize this data in JavaFX controls. Using DataFX, you can populate UI controls by using the most-common protocols, including REST, SSE, or WebSocket. Apart from retrieving data, the Flow component in DataFX enables developers to describe different flows between UI components and to inject data models into the flows. This session shows how the different DataFX components make it easy to manage external data by using well-known Java technologies.\n\n\nAuthors:\nHendrik Ebbers\nHendrik Ebbers is Java Architect at Canoo Engineering AG and lives in Dortmund, Germany.
