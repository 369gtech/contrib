recordingDate: 1496937396
description: "Creating beautiful applications with APEX is easy, especially after the introduction of Universal Theme. \n\nIt is easy to follow the wizards and drop SQL and PL/SQL all over the place in your application thereby creating a maintenance nightmare. When a table is changed, which pages are affected? How can you easily find out?\n\nGetting the structure of your application right requires a method to follow. In this session I will share my thoughts on structuring your APEX application.\n\nThis session will focus on just that: build robust applications; leverage views, packages, instrumentation, etc."
