description: "With no doubt, the most widely used API of the JDK is the Collections API. Brilliantly designed 15 years ago, it is still at the core of all Java applications. With the introduction of lambda expressions in JDK 8, the patterns of the Collections API are changed, The first part of this session introduces lambda expressions, how we can write them, and what they bring to us developers. The second part presents the new patterns introduced by the Stream and Collector APIs. These new APIs change the way we process large collections, enabling parallel processing with a very simple programming model and amazing patterns. Complex examples show how powerful those APIs are and how they can help us write efficient and clean code.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJosé Paumard\nPassionate about programming computers for over 20 years, Jose made ​​his debut in assembler and C, C for SIMD parallel machines before adopting Java as an object-oriented language.
