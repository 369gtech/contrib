description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nPrepare for JDK 9\n\nThe modularization of the Java SE Platform in JDK 9 will bring many benefits, but also many changes. Existing code that uses only official Java SE Platform APIs and supported JDK-specific APIs should continue to work without change. Code that uses certain deprecated features, however, or any JDK-internal APIs, is likely to break. This session will show you how to prepare existing libraries and applications for JDK 9, and how to get old code working on JDK 9 even when you can't update it.\n\nAlan Bateman, Oracle\n\nAlan Bateman is an engineer in the JDK group in Oracle. He is currently focused on the Java Platform Module System and the Modular JDK that targets JDK 9. He's an active member of the OpenJDK project and has a long history in the development of JDK."
