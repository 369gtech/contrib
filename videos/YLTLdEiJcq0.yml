description: "Productionizing an unsupervised machine learning model to understand customer feedback | PyData Eindhoven 2020\n\nHave you ever had to read through over 5,000 open-text feedback responses a month?\n\nOur colleagues at ING do this all the time, spending multiple hours each week. This is why we developed an unsupervised machine learning model that clusters customer feedback with similar meaning using open-source Python libraries.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
