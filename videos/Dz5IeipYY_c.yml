description: "DevOps Gathering 2017 | \"Docker Orchestration and Swarming\" by Peter Rossbach\n\ndevops-gathering.io\n\n****\nThis talk gives an overview of the technical solutions for the orchestration of Docker-based services. This means rethinking your IT-business in every area. Create, maintain and modify many machines and containers on your developer notebook, in your data center or the cloud is a challenge. Our applications are constantly expanded and adapted to different use cases. Hence, microservices need a better environment. The Docker ecosystem offers promising tools for service discovering, automatic scaling, failover and deployment. The talk presents and discusses the practical benefits of the Docker orchestration platform.\n\n***\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DevOpsGathering\nCheck out our website: devops-gathering.io"
