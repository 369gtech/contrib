description: "New to serverless or new to machine learning? We'll introduce both and show how serverless technology can make it even easier to use machine learning in your applications.\n\nYou will get an overview of machine learning today, how it's been typically done, and then we will dive into how to create a complete serverless machine learning pipeline, from training to prediction. No machine learning background needed!\n\nTypically machine learning has been reserved for large datasets that take a long time to process, and require hefty backend systems. Serverless lets you stop worrying about managing those large datasets and infrastructure and instead on getting the most value out of your data.\n\n# Bret McGowen\nBret is on the Google Cloud Platform team at Google, focusing on developer-oriented products like App Engine, Compute Engine, the Cloud Vision API, Firebase and more. He's currently an aspiring Node.js developer. Prior to Google, Bret came from Texas, having worked in the cloud industry at Rackspace as a software engineer building the RackConnect hybrid hosting product. Before that, he led engineering teams at e-commerce, non-profit and startup companies. He's often on the running trail, volleyball court or kickball field.\n\nBret earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science from Texas A&M University.\n\n# Yufeng Guo\nYufeng is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform, where he is trying to make machine learning more understandable and usable for all. He is enjoys hearing about new and interesting applications of machine learning, share your use case with him on Twitter @YufengG"
