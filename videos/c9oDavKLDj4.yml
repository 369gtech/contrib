title: 'What is Stadia Makers?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605546021
description: "At Stadia, we are passionate about indie games, but when we initially launched Stadia last year, we had more studios apply to be a Stadia developer than we could work with at the time. So we focused on improving our tools and building programs like Stadia Makers to allow us to work with more developers and bring your awesome games to Stadia. In this talk, we give an overview of the Makers program, the benefits for developers, criteria for having your game considered, share feedback from our first Stadia Makers devs, and tell you how to apply and have your game considered.\n\nWatch more MIGS sessions → https://goo.gle/2UpbOi1\nSubscribe to Google Developers → https://goo.gle/developers"
