title: 'Creating secure software - benefits from cloud thinking - Daniel Deogun and Daniel Sawano'
language: English
recordingDate: 1633093213
description: "Security is a tricky field – as developers, it doesn’t seem to matter how the software is designed. There’s always someone able to hack it. But as it turns out, software design can bring security benefits. Often when we hear the word ‘cloud’ we think it’s insecure, but in this talk you’ll learn how design patterns based on concepts such as 12-factor and cloud native apps not only yield great software, but also bring security benefits as an implicit side effect. These design patterns are applicable to legacy as well as green-field development, and regardless if you are running in the cloud or on-premise, you still get the same security benefits. And on top of this, you’ll see how it all comes together to create the foundation of modern software security – software that is secure by design.\n#Security #SecureSoftware\n\nPresented by Daniel Deogun and Daniel Sawano\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
