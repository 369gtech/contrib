description: 'Dropwizard is one of the popular choices to create microservices in java. Its basic claim is that it allows you to ship a production-quality RESTful web service in the shortest time possible. A Dropwizard application is delivered as a standalone jar which makes a lot of sense in the context of microservices. However a lot of companies/enterprises do not yet embrace DevOps. Often the java application server used in production is imposed on the developers. ''Wizard in a box'' allows you to deploy your regular Dropwizard application as a war on a Java application server, so that you as a developer can still enjoy the goodies of Dropwizard in this context. ''Wizard in a box'' is available on Github and is released in the central maven repository. The quickie will highlight the benefits of Dropwizard and will after that zoom into ''Wizard in a box'''
