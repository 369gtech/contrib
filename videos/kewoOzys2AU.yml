description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nFebruary 13, 2012\r\n\r\nPresented by Professor John Baez, UC Riverside.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOur heavy reliance on fossil fuels is causing two serious problems: global warming, and the decline of cheaply available oil reserves. Unfortunately the second problem will not cancel out the first. Each one individually seems extremely hard to solve, and taken together they demand a major worldwide effort starting now. After an overview of these problems, we turn to the question: what can we do about them?\r\n\r\nDr. Baez will be presenting from Singapore by means of an Anybot in Mountain View."
