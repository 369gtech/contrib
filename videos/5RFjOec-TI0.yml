language: English
recordingDate: 1368927852
description: "David Sehr \n\nSince 2011, NativeClient (NaCl) has been a feature of Chrome available through the Chrome Web Store.\n\nPNaCl is the next exciting step for this technology.  It continues Native Client's compatibility with developers' existing codebases and near native-code performance, but brings this to the open web in a truly portable fashion.  The technology is built around the open source LLVM compiler infrastructure. This technology enables application developers to build both web and Chrome Web Store applications that work on Windows, OS X, Linux, and ChromeOS for x86 and ARM.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
