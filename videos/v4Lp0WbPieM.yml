description: "This talk goes into detail about the projects of Moon Ribas, her philosophy as a cyborg artist and the process that drove her to cofound the Cyborg Foundation. Ribas has a sensory extension on her arm that allows her to feel earthquakes through small vibrations, she applies this new sense to her artistic work. Her talk is about the union between our species and technology, the extension of the human senses through cybernetics, using the internet as a sense and cyborg art. The talk will also explore how becoming a cyborg will enhance our relationship with animals, nature and space.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
