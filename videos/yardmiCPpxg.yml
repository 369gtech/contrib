description: "Video sponsor: United States Digital Service (https://usds.gov)\n\nKeeping an application stable starts off being simple since your codebase is small, there are few points of failure, and you can easily reason about the implications of code changes. Once the team scales, managing quality becomes intractable as you hire engineers, acquire users, and ship features and refactors. In this talk, you'll learn about a few frameworks and processes you can use for reasoning about and managing application reliability.\n\nAbout Kwame Thomison\nKwame is an engineering leader with 10+ years of experience at companies like Meebo, Facebook, and Asana."
