title: 'Ondrej Mirtes. Use Generics in PHP. Today'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620021850
description: "Developers in other languages like Java, C#, or TypeScript, have been enjoying the benefits of generics for a long time. They allow us to describe precise types of values included in a collection object or to work around type system limitations without the need for unsafe type casting. PHP does not support generics natively but with the help of PHPDocs, we’re able to simulate them. Static analysers like PHPStan or Psalm are able to interpret generics and take advantage of them to find more bugs thanks to strongly-typed code.\n\nIn this talk I’ll introduce the concept of generics, show several useful use cases to the audience, and even dive into how they’re implemented in PHPStan and what had to be considered during the development. \n\nPHPFest: https://2020.phpfest.ru/lecture/2"
