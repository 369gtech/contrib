recordingDate: 1558689045
description: "With React Native and tools like React Native Web, React Native Dom, and React XP it is possible to share nearly all of the same code between web, iOS, android, and windows apps.\n\nWith the addition of Electron, that same codebase can be used to create Mac and Linux apps too! This talk will go through some of the leading approaches and provide real world examples of production apps using these technologies.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
