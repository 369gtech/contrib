description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nDemystifying Cloud Native Concepts for the Business World - Catherine Paganini & Jason Morgan, CNCF Business Value Subcommittee\n\nAs co-chairs of the CNCF Business Value Subcommittee, Jason Morgan and Catherine Paganini seek to democratize cloud native concepts. Technologists have been talking about these topics for years, yet, for many, the cloud native space is still largely inaccessible. What is a service mesh? How do containers fit in? And how do any of these technologies help my organization achieve its strategic goals?\nIn this session, Jason and Catherine will talk about their first project: the CNCF Cloud Native Glossary.  The glossary explains these concepts in simple terms that anyone can easily understand—no computer science degree required. They'll discuss what motivated them and why they believe that now is the time to spread the cloud native gospel to a broader audience."
