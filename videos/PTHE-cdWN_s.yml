title: '"Room scale VR tracking with OpenHMD" - Jan Schmidt (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579213071
description: "Jan Schmidt\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/30/\n\nThe OpenHMD project provides cross-platform support for a range of virtual reality hardware. A variety of projects can use OpenHMD for VR - like the Godot game engine, Blender and the Monado OpenXR platform.\r\n\r\nIn the 0.3.0 release, the NOLO driver became the first one to add support for room-scale tracking. Now, work is underway to support room-scale tracking with other devices like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide an overview of VR (what is room scale tracking anyway?), the OpenHMD VR ecosystem and then take you through the technical details of what's required to make a device like the Oculus Rift work well.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nThu Jan 16 15:45:00 2020 at Room 6"
