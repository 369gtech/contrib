description: "Welcome to Designing in the Browser with our host, Una Kravets. Interactive touches can be great for user understanding in a digital environment, but they can also leave some of your users disoriented and frustrated, the opposite of the intended effect.\n\nSo let’s talk about how we can avoid that, and how we can be sure to include our cute animated SVGs and button hovers while also ensuring that users who might get a bit nauseous when seeing a lot of animation in front of them, can also enjoy your site. We’ll be demonstrating how to use the “prefers-reduced-motion” media query to progressively enhance animation into your website, as well as show you how to build a simple “reduce animation” switch.\n\nLinks:\nMedia Queries 5 → https://goo.gle/2RVQxLw \nBase Card Flip Demo → https://goo.gle/3mSd1vf \nPreference Reduced Motion Demo →https://goo.gle/2G9hgl8 \nReduce Motion Checkbox Demo →  https://goo.gle/306S1XM  \n\n\nDesigning in the Browser → https://goo.gle/2NeLxjI \nSubscribe to Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs"
