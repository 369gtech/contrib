recordingDate: 1493364288
description: "Feeling a bit left behind by the whole micro-services hubbub? Fear not! This is your chance to get ahead of the curve, skipping straight to serverless nano-services, using Azure Functions.\nIn this talk, we will cut through the buzzwords, and explain what Azure Functions are, why you should care, and how beautifully they fit with a functional style of development. We will demonstrate the benefits of the approach on a real-world example, illustrating along the way some patterns, benefits and gotchas."
