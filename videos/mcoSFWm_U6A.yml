description: "Diego vs Eirini: How to Choose the Best Fitting Container Scheduler - Julian Skupnjak, IBM R&D & Georgi Dankov, SAP\n\nNow that Eirini is an official incubation project, operators can choose between Kubernetes and Diego as their container scheduler in Cloud Foundry. But how should you - as an operator - make that choice? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?\n\nDiego and Kubernetes are both highly scalable, popular scheduling technologies. One has been built into Cloud Foundry for a long time. One, via Eirini, has recently become available to Cloud Foundry operators. Comparing them, one will find many similarities, but also more than a few differences. This brings up the question: when am I supposed to choose one vs the other?\n\nIn this talk, we will show the similarities between the two container orchestrators, and the key differences. Weâ€™ll give Cloud Foundry customers and operators a better understanding of in which scenarios it is useful to have Diego as container orchestrator, and in which scenarios it might be more useful to use Kubernetes.\n\nAbout Julian Skupnjak\nJulian Skupnjak (Herr Julz) is a Software Engineer at IBM Cloud and part of Cloud Foundry's Eirini development team. During his career at IBM Cloud he worked on IBM's Cloud Foundry production system in different roles, but mostly as DevOps engineer at the internal delivery team. During that time he developed multiple OpenSource tools that are used inside and outside IBM. Recently, Julian gave talks about Eirini and Serverless Computing at Cloud Foundry Summit NA and EU. In his free time he spends time playing the piano or swims laps to clear his head.\n\nAbout Georgi Dankov\nSAP\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
