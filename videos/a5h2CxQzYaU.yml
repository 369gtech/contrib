recordingDate: 1540540718
description: ".NET Core is an amazing shift for the Microsoft ecosystem, allowing developers to bring their skills to a cross platform world and take advantage of MacOS, Linux, Docker, and a whole new range of tools and options.\nThis gives developers a huge array of new choices in a time of already massive churn.\n\nThis talk is my journey as a seasoned .NET developer, architect, and deployment automation expert into this brave new world.\n\nAs part of building a new tech stack in a new company, I had to go beyond the “Hello World” demos and blog posts and go from newbie, to running .NET core on Linux in production, with container orchestration, deployment automation, and monitoring.\n\nThis talk is some of my lessons learned, and thoughts on moving to .NET core, Docker builds and CI, configuration management, monitoring, deployment, and infrastructure automation.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
