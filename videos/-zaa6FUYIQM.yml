description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nThere are well established patterns for dealing with conflicting updates in traditional data stores (Relational, Key value) but how do you deal with conflicts when you have event streams? This talk will cover the existing patterns for conflict detection in traditional storage; how those patterns can be applied to an event sourced system; what requirements that places on your event store and how an event-sourced system can enhance the user experience when conflicts occur.\n\nJames Geall is an independent consultant based in Europe and has been developing distributed systems for over 19 years. For the last 12 years, the majority of those systems have been built using eventsourcing or many of the principals that underpin eventsourcing. He has gained a wealth of experience about the challenges teams face as they try to build and run their service based architectures in the cloud. James teaches teams that buzzwords don't magically deliver success and helps them create the necessary processes and evaluate their options to deliver their projects successfully."
