description: "E. Dunham\n\nIn some ways, a browser engine seems to have little in common with a web\r\nframework. But both are ambitious software projects, approached by large\r\ngroups of diverse people trying and sometimes failing to cooperate,\r\ncollaborate, and code together. This talk shares firsthand observations,\r\ncollected over 3 years of working within the Rust and Servo teams at Mozilla\r\nas well as volunteering on the Rust Community Team, about what all developers\r\ncan learn from Rust's approaches to the universal challenges of code and\r\ncommunity.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/rust-s-recipes-for-code-and-community\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nFri Aug  2 09:15:00 2019 at C3.3"
