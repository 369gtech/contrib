description: "We’re going to start with exploring the evolution of making a SPA. Then we’re going to dive into the problem of how fetching, caching, and reading data really complicates state-management and see what approaches we took with different libraries and frameworks like jQuery, Angular, and React.\r\nExternal state management frameworks like Redux and MobX definitely helped with this problem, especially when the data is fetched from a REST endpoint."
