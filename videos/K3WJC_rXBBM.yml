description: "A Roadmap to Active Multi Cloud [I] - Steve Greenberg, Resilient Scale & Steve Wall, ECS Team    \n\nMulti-cloud capability is a key feature of cloud foundry. Extending this model to multiple active cloud foundry installations has many enterprise wide use cases.\n\nThis talk will define active multi cloud, look at common enterprise use cases, describe the concerns that must be addressed, walk through a roadmap and demo and wrap up with best practices.\n\nOften perceived as difficult, creating multiple active multi-clouds with CF is not difficult when you break down the concerns. This talk provides a reference architecture and roadmap for active multi-cloud using Cloud Foundry.\n\nSteve Wall\nECS Team\nDirector of Solutions Architecture\nDenver\nWebsiteecsteam.com\nSteve has over 20 years of experience architecting, designing and developing sophisticated enterprise applications, with the past three years focused in Cloud Foundry development. He is a Cloud Foundry Certified Associate and served on the Cloud Foundry Foundation’s committee to create the operator and developer certification programs. In addition, Steve has been a speaker at several user groups on Cloud Foundry-related topics, presenter at the Cloud Foundry Summit for the past two years, as well as a regular blogger on cloud-native topics. In 2017, he was named co-chair of the Cloud Foundry Summit Silicon Valley Cloud-Native Java Track. Steve has successfully led software development teams and provided guidance to clients from initial discussions for architecting and re-architecting entire systems from implementation through post-production support, including operator experience with Open Source Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Cloud Foundry.\n\n\nSteve Greenberg\nSteve is the Founder and CEO of Resilient Scale, a consultancy focused on building capabilities through collaboration, training and mentoring. He is a long time application developer and architect and a proponent of Spring & Cloud Foundry. Steve has been working with Cloud Foundry since March of 2012, was one of the first Pivotal Engineers to complete the Cloud Foundry Dojo, and built (and donated to the community) the Spring Cloud Service Broker. He lives in the mountains of Colorado and spends his free time skiing, mountain biking, fly fishing and making things in his workshop."
