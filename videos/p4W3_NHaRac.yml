title: '"Fonts and Math" - Jussi Pakkanen (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1578986915
description: "Jussi Pakkanen\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/231/\n\nFont design is seen as a purely artistic and aesthetic pursuit. In this\r\ntalk we shall examine some ways to do the same with mathematics. Things we\r\ncan expect to be talked about include nib pens, Donald Knuth, railroad\r\ntracks (yes) and possibly even differential equations. Not advanced math\r\nknowledge is needed to participate, though. This talk is almost guaranteed\r\nto provide no answers, but hopefully it will intrigue the audience's minds\r\nso that they will start coming upwith their own questions.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 13:30:00 2020 at Room 5"
