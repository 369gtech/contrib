description: "Let’s go back in time a bit. Remember when word was out that we were going to get new HTML elements? I don’t know about you, but I was so excited. After years of building the same tabset over and over, I thought, I’m done! Surely they’ll see that tabs are one of the most common elements in *every design system ever*. Imagine my disappointment. 'aside', 'article', and their friends seemed so disconnected from the problems I was solving every day. I had no problem with them, I just didn’t need them.\n\nSince then, I have held onto the core belief that HTML shouldn’t be finished. Design Systems have been innovating and lighting the path forward for HTML for a long time. The web platform is now ready to pave those cow paths and extend HTML. And we need your help with these brand new shiny components!\n\nPresented by: Nicole Sullivan, Greg Whitworth\n\nView the schedule → https://goo.gle/2nON8mp\n\n#ChromeDevSummit All Sessions → https://goo.gle/CDS19\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nEvent photos → \_https://goo.gle/CDS19Photos"
