language: English
recordingDate: 1578352035
description: "Don’t you wish you had a VM for testing IoT devices? I created ARM-X IoT Firmware Emulation Framework initially as a testing platform for my own research and development needs. Over the years what started as a clumsy Linux-on-ARM QEMU image has now turned into a tried-and-tested framework which has led to four 0-days discovered on SoHo routers, IP cameras and VoIP exchanges. In this talk, I shall cover the evolution of ARM-X, demonstrate a few use cases and discuss future directions of IoT firmware emulation.\n\n=== \n\nSaumil Shah is the founder and CEO of Net-Square, providing cutting edge information security services to clients around the globe. Saumil is an internationally recognised speaker and instructor, having regularly presented at conferences like Hack In The Box, Blackhat, RSA, CanSecWest, PacSec, EUSecWest, Hack.lu, 44CON and others. He has authored two books titled “Web Hacking: Attacks and Defense” and “The Anti-Virus Book”.\n\nSaumil graduated with an M.S. in Computer Science from Purdue University, USA and a B.E. in Computer Engineering from Gujarat University.
