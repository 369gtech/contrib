description: "You started an Elixir project, coming from another language, and you are curious about how everything fits, what are the most common problems encountered, and how is the best way to solve them.\n\nI'll answer questions such as: How to organize your tests in a concurrent application? What are the pitfalls when writing process tests? How can we organize our code? How can contexts help us? Which smells can help us realize it's time to refactor our code? And how do we use the language tooling in our favor?\n\nAfter this talk, you will get a clearer picture of how a functional language can help you solve day-to-day problems and how not to fall into some common code pitfalls.\n\nBio\nAmanda works with software development for almost ten years now. She has used a variety of languages such as C#, Ruby, and Elixir. Nowadays she writes code with Plataformatec folks."
