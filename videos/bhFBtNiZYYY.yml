description: "Ah, a typical day at work. Come in, get your coffee, check email. What does that typical day in the life of a modern batch developer look like? We aren't talking about someone running COBOL or batch jobs on bare metal somewhere. What does the day for a cloud-native batch developer look like? How have things changed? How are they monitoring their jobs? How are they deploying them? How are they scheduling them? In this talk, we'll walk through the typical lifecycle of a batch job using modern tools.\n\nSpeakers: Michael Minella, Director, Pivotal and Mahmoud Ben Hassine, Principal Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/batch-processing-in-2019"
