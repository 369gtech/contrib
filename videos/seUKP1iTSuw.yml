Vaadin 10 and its Java framework, Vaadin Flow, primarily uses Web Components and provides the easiest way to consume them from Java code. Join this session to understand what Web Components are, and how simple it can be to use them from JVM applications.\n\n# Matti Tahvonen\nMatti Tahvonen has a long history in Vaadin R&D: developing the core framework from the dark ages of pure JS client side to the GWT era and creating a number of official and unofficial Vaadin add-ons. Nowadays Matti is working as a developer advocate and Vaadin Framework marketing manager for Vaadin, creating lots of PoCs how other cool technologies can be used together with Vaadin to efficiently create stunning web applications. He loves his current position where he can explore new Java related technologies each and every day.\n\n# Teemu Suo-Anttila \nFramework developer and a technical speaker.
