title: 'The Privacy Tax: How tracking and hacking affect disabled people, and what we can do about it'
language: English
recordingDate: 1612440496
description: "Dawn E. Collett\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/41/\n\nSurveillance is everywhere.  From CCTV cameras on the streets to cookies that track users around the web as they browse, the vast majority of human activity is monitored in some form.  The burden of being watched disproportionately falls on marginalised groups, and people with disabilities are no exception in this regard.  If your medical records contain sensitive information that you've discussed with your doctor to get appropriate treatment, information security suddenly becomes far more important to you.  And if your only method of communication is connected to the Internet 24/7, and thus vulnerable to hackers, true privacy is a great deal harder to achieve.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll examine how data-driven systems view disability, and look at how accessible technology can be exploited to reveal information about its users.  We'll break down ways that disabled people can - and do - avoid tracking and hacking, and find out why paying a 'privacy tax' isn't always feasible for everyone.  Finally, we'll discuss open-source software that's already reducing the impact of surveillance and security risks on people with disabilities, and examine what technologists can do to make the privacy tax less necessary.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
