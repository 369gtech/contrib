description: "This short demonstration wants to show the results of Pasindu De Silvas workshop at JSConf.Asia 2018. Attendees created party themed within 2 hours and learned about getting started and how to control a device with servos and LEDs. The attendees then came up with their own ideas on a party robot and built it with the rest of the time. \n\nPasindu works on building open source text to speech systems for low resource languages by day and does various JavaScript Nodebots projects by night.\n\n\nJSConf.Asia - Capitol Theatre, Singapore - 27 January 2018\n\nSource: https://2018.jsconf.asia/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
