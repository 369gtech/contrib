description: "It’s Dangerous to Go Alone! Lessons Learnt from Onboarding New Cloud Foundry Contributors - Denise Yu & Andrew Su, Pivotal\n\nPivotal Cloud Foundry has hundreds of engineers working on Open Source Cloud Foundry and PCF, but the majority join us with no previous experience working in this project space. It is challenging to design an effective and empathetic onboarding program for engineers who are new to platform development, but technical onboarding is one of the most critical components for building an inclusive engineering culture, at home and within the larger Open Source community. In this talk, we will provide an overview of Pivotal’s “Onboarding Week” ritual, and showcase how we implement various Extreme Programming practices to facilitate learning, feedback, and continuous improvement.\n\nAt the core of all of these practices is psychological safety: a critical component for creating an environment where it is completely safe to fail and explore. By the end of this talk, all attendees -- whether they are engineers, managers, leadership, or somewhere in between -- will learn how to assess the effectiveness of their current onboarding practices and gain some new insights on how to design empathetic onboarding programs.\n\nAbout Andrew Su\nAndrew has been contributing to BOSH for two and a half years, and was the anchor of the Toronto BOSH team. In his time on the team he drove feature work on the BOSH links API, the removal of the registry, and many others. Prior to joining BOSH he built consumer-facing applications as part of Pivotal Labs.\n\nAbout Denise Yu\nDenise is a Senior Software Engineer at Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) in Toronto. In her time at Pivotal she has worked on a variety of open source and enterprise products, served briefly as the Product Manager of Pivotal's On-Demand Service Broker SDK, then moved across an ocean to the Toronto office where she now works on enabling high-confidence release engineering for the PCF program, as part of the Master Pipeline team. Denise has previously delivered talks at conferences and meetups throughout Europe, North America and Asia on topics ranging from continuous delivery to functional programming to cultural linguistics. She enjoys learning about distributed systems, release engineering, and low-level Linux kernel programming. In her spare time she creates illustrations that break down complex technical topics at deniseyu.io/art, and yes you may use these images with attribution in your decks!\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
