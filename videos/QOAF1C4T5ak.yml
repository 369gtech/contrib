description: "Join us for our next conference: https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\n\nManaging people is hard. Managing people who aren’t like you is harder. As we push to build more diverse teams, how do we ensure everyone can succeed equally? Exceptional leaders use empathy to develop relationships with their teammates, don’t shy away from conversations that feel risky, and use a variety of tactics to bring out the best in their colleagues.\n\nThis talk will cover challenging situations using scenarios from both sides of the manager/direct report relationship, applicable to anyone who’s tasked with developing the careers of their teammates. You’ll leave with specific tips on how to ensure everyone gets the opportunity and support they need to perform.\n\nAbout Jill Wetzler\n\nJill Wetzler is Director of Engineering at Lyft, leading their Core Services and Infrastructure orgs. She helped create UpLyft Tech, Lyft’s organisation focused on diversity and inclusion within engineering.
