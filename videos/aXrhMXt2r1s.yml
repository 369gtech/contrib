description: "by Scott Hanselman\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/Janson/open_source_microsoft.webm\n\n\nScott will talk about the last ten years at Microsoft. Scott went there specially to open source .NET and promote open source in general to a company that wasn't (at the time) OSS friendly. A decade later we have achieved that and .NET Core runs everywhere from microcontrollers to iPhones to any cloud. 40% of Azure runs Linux. .NET Core runs on every Linux and the full stack is open source, all the way down to the metal. How did that happen and what’s next? This technical and demo-heavy talk will cover .NET → WebAssembly running Open Source C# in the browser. Scott will spend much of his time at the command line doing demos in Windows, Linux, Docker,and online. He'll talk about the tech underneath that brings .NET, .NET Core, and Mono together in a cohesive OSS platform. He'll also talk about .NET Standard as a set of APIs and now it overs true and real code reuse across a wide range devices. Scott will also cover the history of WebAssembly as it relates to .NET and Blazor and show how C# and .NET can run within the browser. \n\nScott will also talk about how Microsoft changed both culture and code to release .NET Core as a fully OSS platform with more than 60% of contributions coming from the community. \n\nRoom: Janson\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:00:00+01"
