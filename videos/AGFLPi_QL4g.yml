description: "Michael Bolin is a former Google engineer who spent his four years there working on Google Calendar, Google Tasks, and the Closure Compiler. As a frontend developer, he used the Closure Tools suite on a daily basis and made a number of contributions to it. His last project at Google was to open-source the Closure Compiler. He is a blogger, often writing about web development, and graduated with both Computer Science and Mathematics degrees from MIT.\n\nNone of the JavaScript libraries today has a more impressive track record than Google Closure, the tool suite used for Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Maps. Closure: The Definitive Guide has precisely what you need to get started with these tools, including valuable information not available publicly anywhere else."
