description: "by Richard Brown\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.114/containers_kubic.webm\n\n\nAs the world moves more and more towards containerised solutions, a number of real questions start to appear.\n- What is the perfect platform for running containers atop?\n- How to use this platform as part of a flexible, scalable, highly available infrastructure fabric?\n- How to minimize the maintenance and administration of this platform at scale? \n\nAll of these problems are well answered in an enterprise environment by SUSE CaaS Platform, but for developers more interested in the state of containers &amp; kubernetes upstream, new issues start to appear. With such fast moving upstreams, developers and enthusiasts need a platform that can keep up and is closely involved with those upstream developments. This platform needs to not only be able to run containers at scale, but also on single machine, all the while preserving the attributes of low maintenance so the focus can be on the containers, not the base system beneath them. \n\nThis talk will introduce openSUSE Kubic, and explains how it addresses the above, being the perfect platform for container developers and enthusiasts. The session will mention how Kubic is based on the Tumbleweed rolling release and various upstreams including kubeadm and CRI-O. The kubeadm Kubernetes cluster boostrapping tool will be discussed in some detail and demonstrated, with some sneak peaks into how it may be extended in the future. \n\nAttendees should come away from this talk with everything they need to know to get starting using, developing with and contributing to openSUSE Kubic. \n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:00:00+01"
