recordingDate: 1464358763
description: 'If you ever wrote a parser, you know two things: parsing is fun, and parsing is hard. While it is a very rewarding and interactive process, it can easily make your code vulnerable. The nom project, a parser combinators library based on Rust''s memory safety features, makes parser development more interesting, with a focus on tooling and code reuse.'
