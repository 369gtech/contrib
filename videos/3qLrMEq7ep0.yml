recordingDate: 1535456798
description: "Have you ever experienced low back pain? Most people have, and it costs the Norwegian society large sums of money. Now wouldn't it be cool if an AI could help you with the self-management of the pain?\n\nI applied a combination of AI methods to create exercise plans focused on helping patients with low back pain. The resulting exercise plans were compared to plans created by a medical expert.\n\nThis talk shows how AI can be applied to a real-life scenario, and how well they perform according to experts in the field."
