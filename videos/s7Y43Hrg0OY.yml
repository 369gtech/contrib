description: "Have you ever wished you could watch 20 hours of DEF CON, C3 and Black Hat talks in 45 minutes? Are you curious about exactly how Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek managed to send vehicle CAN messages from the Internet? Do you want to know why John Deere's customers are buying black market hacking tools? Do you suspect you can charge your electric car on someone else's dime? Do you want to find out what the \"S\" in \"IoT\" stands for? (Spoiler: It’s “security”.) This event is for you.\n\nThere will also be a quiz on some of the more spectacular security breaches, reporting on some of the most hair-raising decisions made as far as cybersecurity and privacy is concerned for a few recent high-profile products as well as tips and tricks for increasing personal and corporate cybersecurity on the cheap.\n\nDavid Wenslandt spent the last decade hacking remotely-operated underwater vehicles and systems for synchronised sensors data recording and management. He is currently the leader of the Knightec specialty area Connected Device Security and member of the SIS committee working ISO/SAE 21434, a new standard for Cybersecurity Engineering in road vehicles.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
