description: "f(by) 2020\nScala track\n\nWe implement cache together - Yaroslav Klymko @t3hnar\n\nI have experience in software development, especially in distributed concurrent backend jvm applications.\nI truly believe that open-source is a way to go, and companies should open source everything that does not expose their business advantage.\nI often prefer going through source code over reading documentation :)\n\nGeneral Partner - Evolution Gaming https://eng.evolutiongaming.com/"
