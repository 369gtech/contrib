recordingDate: 1320863172
description: "Kate Matsudaira\nVP Engineering, SEOMoz\n\nHow To Be Even More Awesome at Your Job:\nWhen it comes to our careers, most of us spend the majority of our waking moments working. And all of us want to do well at our jobs; and part of that means focusing on continuing to improve our technical skills. However to be really awesome, it is not enough to be an amazing technologist, you also have to master your soft skills (you know, the ones that involve interacting with something besides your computer). This talk will cover ways to improve soft skills, like communication and leadership, which likely could use some focused attention.\nThe audience will come away with new ideas on how to be better versions of themselves -- in their work and life, with tips on how to manage up and improve their career trajectory, how to listen and communicate more effectively, how to be a great teammate, and how to lead -- even from the trenches without authority."
