title: '"Dancing With Myself" by Mariel Pettee'
language: English
recordingDate: 1633959937
description: "In a year marked by physical distance, my only dance partner was a past version of myself. Using motion capture of my own movements as training data, I have worked with teams of collaborators to develop custom machine learning tools, including a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Graph Neural Network (GNN), to generate choreography that feels like my own. In this talk, I'll discuss not only these models and their generative capabilities (and pitfalls), but also the creative motivations and tensions that guided me while shaping this research trajectory. This is a story about engaging with AI as a creative collaborator to understand to what extent algorithms can reflect the most cherished parts of our identities.\n\nMariel Pettee\nLawrence Berkeley National Lab\n@marielpettee\n\nfrom Strange Loop 2021 in St. Louis\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"
