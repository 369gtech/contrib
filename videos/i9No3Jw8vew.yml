description: "Sergey Kuksenko, Java Performance Engineer, Oracle\n\nThere are a lot of books, tutorials, and talks about performance methodology and optimizations in general. Unlike them, this session presents a real-life story of how a single project (new HttpClient API) was optimized. All the steps: how the team achieved high performance, what it was looking for, which tools were used, which optimizations were implemented."
