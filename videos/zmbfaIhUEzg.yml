description: "Beauty in Code 2020 was a single-track full day IT-conference organized by Living IT, featuring five amazing speakers from three continents. It was hosted at the Malmö Live conference center on March 7, 2020.\n\nhttps://beautyincode.se\nhttps://livingit.se\n\nSession 3 of 6 by Markus Borg (https://twitter.com/mrksbrg)\n\"Trained, Not Coded – Beauty In Software 2.0\"\nDeep learning has revolutionized several application areas, especially within computer vision. However, developing systems that rely on machine learning (ML) introduces new challenges. As features are trained rather than coded, the beauty concept must expand to cover also data. But even with beauty in the training data, how could we possibly trust AI in critical applications such as self-driving cars?\n\nIn this talk, we will look at testing of a pedestrian detection system in state-of-the-art automotive simulators. We will discuss how the concept of safety fundamentally changes with ML and present a promising approach to testing. By embracing beauty in test code, we will demonstrate evolutionary test case generation for testing of trained systems – using AI to test AI."
