description: "Do you want to start working with JavaFX but don’t know where you can find all the cool tutorials and open source APIs? This session is the perfect place to be! Leading up to the Java 8 release, a huge ecosystem with a lot of good tutorials and open source frameworks surrounds JavaFX. The community is getting bigger and bigger. The presentation introduces some of the most important parts of the JavaFX ecosystem such as third-party frameworks and popular knowledgebases and illustrates the functionality and synergy effects between the libraries with a live coding session. The session ends with real-world applications demonstrating the techniques and APIs discussed earlier.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAlexander Casall\nAlexander Casall graduated with a master’s degree in computer science in 2011.
