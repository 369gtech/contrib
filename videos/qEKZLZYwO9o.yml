Here you will be working on the concepts of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery & Deployment. Two technologies in particular that the session surrounds itself around are Jenkins and Docker. \n\nThe first project is to teach you to compile a code that is present in GitHub, Review that code and Analyse the test cases present in the GitHub repository through building a Jenkins Pipeline.\nThrough the second project, you will learn to pull a Docker Image as well as spin your own Mutlicontainer Application using Docker Compose.  \nThe final instalment will guide you to build a Docker image and then set up Jenkins to build and publish the image automatically, whenever you commit changes to your code repository.\n\nðŸŸ Codes and Dataset: https://bit.ly/2WJopxQ\n\nPart 1 - https://youtu.be/PwSZpcl7vUE\nPart 2 - https://youtu.be/EXdmo4OoB4Q\n\n\nðŸ”¹Check our complete DevOps playlist here: http://goo.gl/O2vo13\nðŸ”¹Check our Blog playlist here: https://bit.ly/3gfNuZr\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nðŸ”´Subscribe to our channel to get video updates.
