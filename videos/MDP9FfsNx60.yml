description: "In this video, I compare 5 of the most popular deep learning frameworks (SciKit Learn, TensorFlow, Theano, Keras, and Caffe). We go through the pros and cons of each, as well as some code samples, eventually coming to a definitive conclusion.\n\nThe code for the TensorFlow vs Theano part of the video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/tensorflow_vs_theano\n\nAn article that explains the differences in more detail:\nhttps://medium.com/@sentimentron/faceoff-theano-vs-tensorflow-e25648c31800#.bg4xmz1au\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nLearn more about TF Learn here:\nhttps://github.com/tflearn/tflearn\n\nand here:\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/tflearn/index.html\n\nLearn more about TensorFlow here:\nhttps://www.oreilly.com/learning/hello-tensorflow\n\nMore on Keras here:\nhttp://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/\n\nMore on SciKit Learn here:\nhttp://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/\n\nMore on Caffe here:\nhttp://christopher5106.github.io/deep/learning/2015/09/04/Deep-learning-tutorial-on-Caffe-Technology.html\n\nMore on Theano here:\nhttps://github.com/Newmu/Theano-Tutorials\n\nThanks for watching guys, I do this for you.
