description: "Forging a strong relationship with developers is essential part of creating an impactful AppSec program. Without it, your team will have little idea what's going on and will have trouble getting bugs fixed and features shipped. Segment has built strong ties to developers using our competition-based training featuring Burp Suite and OWASP Juice Shop, partnership during implementation of tooling, and contributions to the existing codebase. This presentation is chock full of practical examples and references that attendees can bring back to their organization.\n\n\nLeif Dreizler\nSecurity Engineer, Segment\nLeif works on the AppSec team at Segment, partnering with engineers to continuously improve their security story and protect customer data. Leif got his start in the security industry at Redspin doing security consulting work, and was later an early employee at Bugcrowd.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
