description: "One on One SRE\n\nAmy Tobey\n\nAs someone who has carried the title of Site Reliability Engineer at many companies, I have struggled with how to influence an organization to make the changes necessary to ensure high availability, sustainably. Fixing things directly doesn't scale with the organization, so a broader approach is needed. Leadership usually desires the outcome of better availability and sometimes even say so publicly, but then what? In this talk, I will discuss the one-on-one approach I created for SRE outreach both proactively and in incident debriefs. I will demonstrate how this approach enables vulnerability and better information gathering through application of psychological safety principles.\n\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
