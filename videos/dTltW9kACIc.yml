He has worked with all kind of programming platforms and languages, and currently focuses mostly on .NET. He likes to tinker with new stuff and try it out in new projects. When not programming, you can meet him doing some high velocity and high-g craziness - shredding mountain on one ski or piloting flying machines.\n\nMaking world statically typed with F# type providers\n\nF# type providers are way to inject types for external data sources into compiler without code generation. Let's dive into the world, where all your data, wherever it comes from, can be statically typed.
