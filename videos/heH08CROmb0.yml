recordingDate: 1572935063
description: "Maintenance Lead Werner Keil will present JSR 354 (Money and Currency). They will discuss the API from a developer as well as user perspective and share details on the design decisions behind the JSR. Monetary values are a key feature of many applications, yet the JDK provides little or no support.\n\nThe existing java.util.Currency class is strictly a structure used for representing current ISO-4217 currencies, but not associated values or custom currencies. The JDK also provides no support for monetary arithmetic or currency conversion, nor for a standard value type to represent a monetary amount.\n\nThe session will demonstrate how the JSR models monetary capabilities, monetary amounts, currencies, rounding, financial arithmetics as well as formatting and currency conversion in a platform independent and flexible manner.\n\nThe first part of the talk will focus on key concepts, improvements like Java 9/Jigsaw modularity and planned new features for a future release followed by a live coding session demonstrating the Money JSR in action.\n\nWerner Keil is a Cloud Architect, Java EE, Microservice and Embedded expert for a security firm. Helping Global 500 Enterprises across industries and leading IT vendors. He worked for nearly 30 years as IT Manager, PM, Coach, SW architect and consultant for Finance, Mobile, Media, Transport and Public sector.
