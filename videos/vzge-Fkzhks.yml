description: "http://www.cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nSG5 is a Study Group within WG21 developing a promising new way to deal with mutable shared memory, that is expected to be more usable and scalable than current techniques based on atomics and mutexes. It promises to be as easy to use as coarse-grained locks, as scalable as fine-grained locks and yet remain composable.\n\nFind out where on the Gartner hype cycle lives Transactional Memory.\nIs it at the Peak of Inflated Expectations, Trough of Disillusionment, Slope of Enlightenment, or Plateau of Productivity?\n\nFor that matter, just how soon will I be able to use it with the new Intel Haswell, and IBM Power Hardware, or is it one of those mirages where the closer you get to your hardware, the further it moves away. \n\nAnd is it true that one of the lead author of this TM proposal also wrote \"Is it just a Research Toy?\"\n\nThis 60 minute advanced talk will cover the history of Transactional Memory, various lock elision and optimistic speculation techniques, the technical engine behind Transactional Memory, the recent research in its use cases, usability and performance data that supports its entry into the C++ Standard, and of course the latest details of the SG5 Technical Specification, including our effort at transactionalizing the C++ Standard Library.\n--\nYou can talk to me about anything including C++ (even C and that language that shall remain nameless but starts with F), Transactional Memory, Parallel Programming, OpenMP, astrophysics (where my degree came from), tennis (still trying to see if I can play for a living), travel, and the best food (which I am on a permanent quest to eat).\n\nMichael Wong is the CEO of OpenMP. He is the IBM and Canadian representative to the C++ Standard and OpenMP Committee. And did I forget to say he is a Director of ISOCPP.org and a VP, Vice-Chair of Programming Languages for Canada's Standard Council. He has so many titles, its a wonder he can get anything done.\n\nOh, and he chairs the WG21 SG5 Transactional Memory, and is the co-author of a number C++11/OpenMP/TM features including generalized attributes, user-defined literals, inheriting constructors, weakly ordered memory models, and explicit conversion operators. Having been the past C++ team lead to IBM´s XL C++ compiler means he has been messing around with designing C++ compilers for twenty years. His current research interest, i.e. what he would like to do if he had time is in the area of parallel programming, transactional memory, C++ benchmark performance, object model, generic programming and template metaprogramming. He holds a B.Sc from University of Toronto, and a Masters in Mathematics from University of Waterloo. \n\nHe has been asked to speak at ACCU, C++Now, Meeting C++, CASCON, and many Universities, research centers and companies, except his own, where he has to listen. \n\nNow he and his wife loves to teach their two children to be curious about everything.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
