This is a 4 Week Instructor-led Online Course.\n\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n\n3. At the end of the training, you will be working on a real-time project for which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout Microservices Architecture Training\n\nEdureka’s Microservices Architecture training introduces you to the concept of Microservices that are small, lightweight, process-driven components. So, Microservices are the next important thing in designing scalable, easy-to-maintain applications. This not only makes application development easier but also offers great flexibility and lets you utilize various resources optimally. If you want to build an enterprise-ready implementation of the Microservices architecture, then this course is the first step for you!\n \nIn this Microservices Architecture training, we will start by giving you a deep understanding of the core Microservices concepts and principles with insight in how they have evolved. We will walk you through the complete life cycle - from design to development to testing; including cross-layer concepts such as how to secure Microservices.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free)."
