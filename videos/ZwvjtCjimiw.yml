title: 'Mariatta Wijaya - Build-a-GitHub-Bot Workshop - PyCon 2018'
recordingDate: 1526135873
description: "Speaker: Mariatta Wijaya\n\nGitHub provides a great platform for collaborating. You can take it to the next level by creating custom GitHub bots. By delegating some of the chores to a bot, you get to spend more time developing your project and collaborating with others.\n\nLearn how to automate your workflow by building a personal GitHub assistant for your own project. We'll use libraries called `gidgethub` and `aiohttp` to write a GitHub bot that does the following:\n\n- Greet the person who created an issue in your project. \n\n- Say thanks when a pull request has been closed.\n\n- Apply a label to issues or pull requests.\n\n- Gives a thumbs up reaction to comments **you** made. (becoming your own personal cheer squad).\n \nThe best part is, you get to do all of the above using Python 3.6! F-strings included!\n\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
