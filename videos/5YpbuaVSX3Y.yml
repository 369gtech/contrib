description: "T-Mobile Going Digital - Speed, Scale & Agility Delivered on Cloud Foundry Leveraging TIBCO - Rakesh Madireddy, T-Mobile & Hitesh Nembhwani, TIBCO Software\n\nWith over 70 million customers, T-Mobileâ€™s vision is to create an exceptional customer experience through the T-Mobile-as-a-Service platform. This needed a cloud-native platform that delivered at scale while still providing control and monitoring at a granular level. Leveraging TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition allowed us to do both - leverage the existing assets while building out and connecting the new class of microservices and APIs.\n\nJoin this session to hear from the battle hardened team on best practices, lessons learned and myths debunking while realizing such a digital transformation that touched aspects of technology as well as team culture. \n\nAbout Hitesh Nembhwani\nHaving lived and worked in multiple countries and all 3 regions of APJ, NAM and EMEA, Hitesh (almost) speaks most languages that TIBCO's customers use :) Over the last 10 years in Enterprise Software, he has donned numerous hats including Engineering, Consulting and Customer Advocacy.\n\nHe's a regular speaker at meetups, developer events and global conferences (incl. TIBCO). When he's not busy piecing together application architectures for the customers, he likes to try his hand at cooking or playing tennis."
