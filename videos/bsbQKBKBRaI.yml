language: English
recordingDate: 1303762713
description: "Presented by J. Chris Anderson and Dustin Sallings. CouchOne and Membase users have been begging for a combination of the power, performance and functionality of our technologies for some time. We listened, and Couchbase is the name of the new company, formed from CouchOne and Membase, and our new product family. Apache CouchDB document database technology is at the core of our combined solution. Membase, with its integrated memcached caching technology, adds technology enabling dynamic cluster elasticity and sustained low-latency, high-throughput data operations. Couchbase becomes the only document database capable of safely storing your data whether stored on a single server, or spread across hundreds.\n\nIn this webinar we introduce you to the Membase caching and clustering architecture, and show how CouchDB is a drop-in fit as the storage and query engine."
