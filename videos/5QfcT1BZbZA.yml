description: "The much-discussed Micro-Frontends have challenges and trade-offs. Many wonder whether their benefits would pay off for their projects and how to implement them. This session sheds some light on the matter.\n\nWe start by exploring several real-world use cases I have helped plan and implement in recent years. They are from different industries: Finance and accounting, banking, and insurance. We also discuss projects where we deliberately decided against Micro-Frontends. With this background, we set out reasons to use, or not use, this new architectural style.\n\nIn the second part we look at implementation strategies such as Module Federation, a game-changer for Micro-Frontends even beyond SPA. After seeing how to integrate it with Angular and the CLI, we discuss consequences, trade-offs, and alternatives.\n\nBy the end, it will be clear whether Micro-Frontends are a good choice for your project and how to implement them.\nng-conf is a multi-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1000's of developers from across the globe join together to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and other community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconfâ€‹ \nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
