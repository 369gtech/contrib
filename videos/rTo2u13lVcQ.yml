title: 'Building on an unsafe foundation — Jason Orendorff'
language: English

description: 'Beneath every safe programming language, library, or virtual machine is a whole lot of unsafe code. Rust is no exception. This talk will explain why “unsafe” code is allowed at all in a safe language, show the unsafe code at work inside safe features like Vec, and teach how to write a safe library that uses unsafe code.'
