description: "ServerlessDays Paris - https://paris.serverlessdays.io\n\nEvent-driven architectures using Amazon’s EventBridge allow us to create highly scalable, loosely coupled systems. However, testing these architectures can be a great challenge. In this session, we'll explore different testing options in order to have confidence in our distributed systems!\n\n\nAbout Sarah\n\nSarah is a cloud developer at web and mobile development agency - Theodo. She specialises in Serverless, with a keen interest in EventBridge, and particularly enjoys working with clients who want to scale their products to more users. From game-tech to beauty-tech, she loves the challenges that each project brings. In 2020, she scaled a video conferencing product that needed to grow quickly due to the impact that Covid-19 had on people’s work."
