description: "Comcast Cloud Foundry Journey - Part 2 - Greg Otto, Comcast   \n\nIt is hard to believe that Comcast is on the third year of our Cloud Foundry Journey! Our platform has scaled 490% in 2016 and has enabled development teams to improve productivity and time-to-market by as much as 75%! However, this is yesterday's news and our developers want more. Our focus has shifted to engaging closer with the developer community, expanding the platform by creating new capabilities and contributing back to the open source community, all with less than a handful of resources! Come talk to us about our lessons learned, how we’ve tapped into the passions of our developer community, our strategy for changing our focus to expand the platform to deliver even more services and business value! All of this while still keeping the lights on.\n\n\nGreg Otto\nComcast\nExecutive Director, Cloud Services\nTwitter Tweet LinkedIn Connect\nNote - Keynote speaker at Cloud Foundry 2016 and SpringOne Platform 2016 BIO - As Executive Director of Cloud Services at Comcast, Greg is helping transform the product delivery experience.
