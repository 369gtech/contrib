There has been plenty of discussion over the last few years about the need to not just make predictions, but provide ways to communicate how models and predictions work. What tools are available now and how can they help?\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other.
