title: '"Systems that run forever self-heal and scale" by Joe Armstrong (2013)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1616759901
description: "How can we build large self-healing scalable systems?\n\nIn this talk I will outline the architectural principles needed for building scalable fault-tolerant systems. I'll talk about building systems from small isolated parallel components which communicate though well-defined protocols.\n\nPrograms will have errors in them and will fail so I'll talk about detecting and correcting errors at run-time. Programs will evolve with time, so I'll talk about how they be changed while they are running. I'll talk about Erlang and how it relates to these architectural principles.\n\nJoe Armstrong (https://twitter.com/joeerl)\n\nJoe Armstrong is one of the inventors of Erlang. When at the Ericsson computer science lab in 1986, he was part of the team who designed and implemented the first version of Erlang. He has written several Erlang books including Programming Erlang Software for a Concurrent World. Joe held the first ever Erlang course and has taught Erlang to hundreds of programmers and held many lectures and keynotes describing the technology.\n\nJoe has a PhD in computer science from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden and is an expert in the construction of fault tolerant systems. Joe was the chief software architect of the project which produced the Erlang OTP system. He has worked as an entrepreneur in one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail) and has worked for 30 years in industry and research."
