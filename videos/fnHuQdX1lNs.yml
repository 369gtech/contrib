description: "Overengineering: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment - Alex Sologub, Altoros    \n\nIf your are using Cloud Foundry, you are most obviously into the microservices architecture and cloud-native app development approach. These are definitely best practices in modern application development, but too much of a good thing is good for nothing. Overuse of these principles may lead to overengineering, when an application is split into too much microservices and, as such, gets hard to maintain and support. In this presentation, Alex will talk about how far overuse of the microservices concept can go, what issues exist and how these issues can be avoided.\n\nAlex Sologub\nAltoros\nSoftware Engineer\nMinsk, Belarus\n\nAlex Sologub is a Software Engineer at Altoros.
