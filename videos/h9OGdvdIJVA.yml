title: 'ScalaSphere: Declarative artifact packaging with SBT by Mikhail Mutcianko'
recordingDate: 1571304141
description: 'Scala plugin for IntelliJ has a fairly complicated build with tens of subprojects, hundreds of dependencies and an artifact which has to be built according to a specific structure. We developed an in-house SBT plugin to help us get rid of tedious task of imperative artifact assembly. The plugin automatically infers artifact structure based on inter-project dependencies, dramatically reducing build file complexity. This talk aims to share our experience and the plugin itself with the Scala community.'
