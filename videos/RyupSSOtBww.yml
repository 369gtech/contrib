description: "Animation is a powerful design tool that designers all too often ignore. When used well, motion can engage, communicate and improve interactions. Thatâ€™s the kind of animation we want in our work: animation that has both purpose and style. Knowing how to use animation effectively will make your work stand out and allow you to approach projects differently than most designers. In this session, Val will discuss where animation can best inform UX and how to build more sophisticated animated interactions for apps and the web.\n\nVal Head\nDesign Evangelist, Adobe\nhttps://twitter.com/vlh\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
