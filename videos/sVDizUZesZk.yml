description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nPeople love Visual Studio Code for its superfast performance, lightweight nature and active open source community around it. All of these are now available for Java developers by extensions contributed by individuals and companies such as Red Hat, Microsoft and Pivotal. By combining a couple independent extensions, you can create a lightweight working environment just for your Java workload yet powerful enough to almost match the feature richness of existing IDEs.\n\nThis sessions shows how you can use Visual Studio Code to develop your Java application. It guides you through all the available extensions so you can later explore then base on your own needs. The session will also introduce how to easily push your Java microservices to cloud within the editor itself."
