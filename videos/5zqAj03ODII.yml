description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks are a promising modern application of Deep Learning that allows models to generate examples. However, GANs are complex, difficult to tune, and limited to small examples. We will explore recent GAN progress with a model that generates faces conditional on desired features, like 'smiling' and 'bangs'. Accessible to anyone comfortable with keras or tensorflow.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
