description: "Typography on the web has improved dramatically in the past few years with the wide availability of web fonts and browser support for basic typographic features. As browsers slowly implement support for font features, color font formats and better control over font display during loading, authors will be better able to customize more precisely how type appears in the browser. At the same time, type designers are coming up with clever solutions to problems associated with fonts for the web. This session will cover the current state of type in the browser and improvements on the horizon.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/nattokirai/web-typography\nFollow John on Twitter: https://twitter.com/nattokirai\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
