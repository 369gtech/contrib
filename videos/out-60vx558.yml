title: 'Run Deep Learning Models in the Browser With JavaScript and ConvNetJS'
language: English
recordingDate: 1520958600
description: "This hands-on session will dive into the current state-of-the-art for running pretrained (publicly available) Deep Neural Nets directly in the browser using JavaScript and frameworks based on ConvNetJS. In recent years, the browser has become a powerful platform for running a variety of workloads including GPU accelerated multitasking on almost any digital device. Using this platform for building, running and visualizing Deep Neural Nets makes Deep Learning accessible for everyone - for research and education as well as for real practical applications. The talk will also include some cool demos for practical applications and use cases.\n\nEVENT:\n\nJazoon TechDays 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nChristoph KÃ¶rner\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nJazoon TechDays Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nJazoon TechDays: http://jazoon.com/"
