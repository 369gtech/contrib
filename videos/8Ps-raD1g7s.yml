title: 'Custom App Autoscaler Using Cloud Controller API - Christopher Decelles'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513268979
description: "This topic is a discussion on building a custom app autoscaler using the cloud controller api. In addition, the custom app autoscaler is bundled as a service broker using the tile generator. The metrics used for scaling are based on the results from any REST endpoint. A user can build a rule through a custom U/I that defines the url for the REST endpoint and rule definition (based on data elements from the REST endpoint). For example, using a 3rd party API that return changes in the stock market in percentages for daily, monthly and yearly. A demo showcases on how all the pieces fit together.\n\nChristopher Decelles, Sr. Platform Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
