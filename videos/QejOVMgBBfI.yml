description: "Craig Sebenik, Split\n\nAbstract: \nThe Google \"SRE book\" gives a great explanation of what SRE does. That model works great for LinkedIn or Facebook. But, what happens when you loose some of those economies of scale? How do you implement those paradigms when the company (or team within a larger corporation) is only a couple of dozen people?\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss 2 different approaches; a centralized team that supports development versus a more distributed team that include developers themselves.\n\nI have witnessed both approaches at different startups. I will finish up with the lessons learned and the pitfalls implementing either approach at another company.\n\nView the full LISA18 Program at https://www.usenix.org/lisa18/conference-program"
