description: 'The knowledge gap between engineers, designers and management is widening and becoming an obstacle for successful project completion. Artificial Intelligence and Robotics are viewed to be too complicated for non-technical people. It''s time to bridge this gap by having everyone understand the topic and have hands-on experience. In this talk, I will prove that everyone can work with Robotics and Artificial Intelligence—namely, by showing how designers and management can learn about these important topics. When humans go into hands-on contact with technology they learn by experiencing the technology interactively („by doing“). Thus, instead of discussing complex mathematical formulas they learn with playful interactions. I will prove that even with a non-technical background, anyone can build a robot from scratch and install a trained neural network to its brain. In the talk, I will also show how humans learn about the strengths and weaknesses of methods learned through behaviour analysis of a robot. I will also show that humans even discover something about themselves when going through a hands-on learning process that incorporates aspects of emotional intelligence and curiosity—now considered top skills for the modern workplace.'
