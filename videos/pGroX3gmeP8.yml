description: "One of the most intriguing classes in the JDK is the Collectors utility class, with a collection of some highly powerful functions that are useful during the reduce operation of streams.\n\nThe functions that are in this class have so much to offer and yet, due to their complex nature, often are not used as much as they should be. Using well defined live coded examples, we will take up several common programming problems.\n\nDiscuss them quickly and drive the implementation of these using the Collectors methods. By the end of this presentation you will know more throughly the power of Collectors and how to apply the methods in there.\n\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston.\nHe has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with sustainable agile practices on their software projects.\n\nVenkat is a (co)author of multiple technical books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer. You can find a list of his books at agiledeveloper.com."
