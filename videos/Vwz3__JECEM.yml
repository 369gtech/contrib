recordingDate: 1404256431
description: "DevArt celebrates art made with code, by developers using technology as their canvas and code as their raw material to create innovative, interactive digital art installations. \nDevArt includes a gallery at the Barbican's Digital Revolution exhibition, for which Google, together with the Barbican, have commissioned some of the world's most progressive interactive artists: Karsten Schmidt, Zach Lieberman, and duo Varvara Guljajeva and Mar Canet. \n\nIt also includes a global initiative and website (g.co/devart), launched in February 2014, for developers to showcase their creativity for a chance to be commissioned by Google and the Barbican. All participating developers were encouraged to open-source their creative and technical process for others to see, from early sketches and concepts, to their completed installations. From this initiative, the judges hand-picked a 4th commission for DevArt at the Digital Revolution, which was awarded to Béatrice Lartigue and Cyril Diagne for Les Métamorphoses de Mr. Kalia."
