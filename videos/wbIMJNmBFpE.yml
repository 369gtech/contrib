title: 'REPL Driven Development, Scrum, and the Wright Brothers - Jamie Dixon'
recordingDate: 1469111057
description: "Do you work in an organization that uses Agile? What about Scrum? TDD? One of the signers of the Agile manifesto, Jeff Sutherland, makes a convincing argument of using scrum outside of software development in his recent book Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time. A full 111 years before Sutherland published this book, the Wright Brothers practiced scrum to outmaneuver better funded and more entrenched competitors to create the first heavier-than-air flying machine that could carry humans. REPL driven development is a technique that comes to business software creation from the scientific computing community.\nIt takes the benefits of small iterations and immediate feedback and marries it with the change-proofing benefits of test-driven development. Taking the lessons of Sutherland and the Wright Brothers back to software, we will see how REPL-driven development aligns perfectly with their techniques. At the end of the session, you will know how to write code faster and better, and have a heck of a lot of fun doing it. This session will be using F# in Visual Studio 2015. If you have learned some F# and are eager to start using it in your day job, this session will use some techniques help you achieve that goal."
