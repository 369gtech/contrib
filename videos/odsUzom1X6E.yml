description: "Video recording of a presentation given at JDK IO conference in Copenhagen in June 2018 at the IT-University organized by the Danish Java User Group - Javagruppen.\n\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/201-martijn-verburg\n\nThe Diabolical Developer's Guide to Surviving Java 9+\n\nSpeaker: Martijn Verburg\n\nJava 9 comes with a new modularity system (Jigsaw), restrictions on the use of internal libraries such as sun.misc.Unsafe, a new REPL (JShell), a change of the default garbage collector to G1, and much more. All of this combined means that Java 9 is potentially the most groundbreaking release since Java 5 introduced generics. In this session, the Diabolical Developer presents a pragmatic guide to migrating your apps to Java 9 and how to avoid the common pitfalls. He covers how to still gain access to those restricted internal libraries, how to deal with the performance impact of moving to G1, how to split your app to use both the classpath approach and the new modularization approach, and more. Leave this session with the confidence to move to Java 9!"
