description: "Speaker: Kai Rueber, Chief Executive Officer, Mercurics\r\n\nKai is the CEO of Mercurics, a people analytics startup focusing on computational psychology. He previously worked as a recruitment consultant specialising in tech.\n\nAfter working 10 years in the HR industry, from recruitment to L&D, Kai noticed a gap between companies and its people - employers not knowing enough to bring out the best in their employees - a gap that can be closed using data. So with a background in psychology and a passion for tech recruitment, he and his team at Mercurics plan to help companies, big and small, hire, train and retain better through computational psychology - from getting the right fit to correctly assessing performance.\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/274030422/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael Cheng"
