language: English
recordingDate: 1433234967
description: "Spring MVC forms a solid foundation for implementing REST-based web services in Java. However, in real-world projects, developers still face challenges when it comes to advanced questions of REST. How to really leverage hypermedia? How to model more-complex business functionality with REST? This session introduces the Spring RESTBucks sample project for implementing a business process in a hypermedia-driven way and discusses approaches to challenges in implementation and how the Spring HATEOAS library helps overcome them. The presentation also dives into new Spring MVC testing features introduced in Spring 3.2 that make it easy to integration-test REST web services.\n\n\nAuthor:\nOliver Gierke\nOliver Gierke is engineer at SpringSource, a division of VMware, project lead of the Spring Data JPA, MongoDB and core module and member of the JPA 2.1 expert group.
