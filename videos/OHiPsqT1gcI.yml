description: "Deep Dive: SPIFFE - Scott Emmons & Emiliano Bernbaum, Scytale \n\nSPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone) is an open source standard for giving identities to services in dynamic and heterogeneous environments. SPIRE (SPIFFE Runtime Environment) is an implementation of SPIFFE that can be deployed to attest service workloads and the infrastructure that runs them. Is it best to deploy SPIRE components in daemonsets, statefulsets, or regular container deployments? How should configmaps be used to configure the SPIRE server and agent? How is the SPIRE agent deployed and configured so the workload API is available to service containers? What is the recommended mechanism for persisting SPIRE data for resiliency and security? In this deep dive, weâ€™ll discuss these best practices plus more suggestions and recommendations for deploying SPIRE in Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPk9"
