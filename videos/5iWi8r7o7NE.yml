description: "Building a JavaScript Powered, Cloud Connected Smart Aquarium\nLots of people have pets, and many of those pets live in aquariums. But how many people automate their aquariums with JavaScript? I did just that using Node.js, a Raspberry Pi, and the cloud...and became a collaborator on the Johnny-Five project in the process. Now I can control my aquarium using my smart phone from anywhere in the world!\n\nIn this talk, I'll show you how I used a Raspberry Pi and Node.js to automate the lighting and temperature monitoring on my freshwater aquarium, and how you can too!\n\nEVENT:\n\nSFNode 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBryan Hughes\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nSFNode Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this talk.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRus4lYrdM8"
