description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nTileDB is an open-source storage manager for multi-dimensional sparse and dense array data. It has a novel architecture that addresses some of the pain points in storing array data on “big-data” and “cloud” storage architectures. This talk will highlight TileDB’s design and its ability to integrate with analysis environments relevant to the PyData community such as Python, R, Julia, etc.\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/the-tiledb-array-data-storage-manager-stavros-papadopoulos-jake-bolewski\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
