recordingDate: 1427289764
description: "Productivity decreases when code rots. Code rots because we are afraid to clean it. By practicing TDD you can gain executable documentation, loosely coupled components and a safety net that keeps you from being afraid. This session, led by TDD trainer Sebastian Larsson, will go through the inner mechanics of TDD. Practical examples of how to develop using TDD will be demonstrated along with resources for learning more about TDD. Participants will pair up and take part in practical exercises, so it is encouraged but not required to bring a laptop. The session is appropriate for both new and experienced developers in TDD.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
