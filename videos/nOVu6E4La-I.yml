description: 'Lot''s of software engineers seem to avoid the field of machine learning because it seems hard. In this talk, I want to give developers an intuition of what machine learning is using visual examples and without using mathematical formulas. I want to show that machine learning will make things possible that cannot be achieved using traditional procedural programming. I will identify high-level components of a supervised machine learning algorithm: vectors, feature spaces, neural networks and labels.'
