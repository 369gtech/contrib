recordingDate: 1435657188
description: "http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015/loic-hoguin\n\nThe Cowboy project has matured. After the 1.0 release in the middle of 2014, the project has made great progress toward a simpler, unified interface, started using maps, added a ton of configurable options and numerous hooks for instrumentation purposes, and of course improved conformance with the ever evolving standards. In addition to Cowboy itself, the talk will also shed some light on the three other projects that are vital to its existence: Ranch, Cowlib and Gun.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\nThis is your typical \"where do we come from, where are we, where do we go from here\" talk. A lot of new cool things added to the project will be explained in great details.\n\nTarget audience:\n\nAnyone using Cowboy today or interested in HTTP or Web development using Erlang.\n\n\n\nAuthor of the Cowboy web server, Gun web client, Erlang.mk build tool and more. Founder of the Nine Nines open source Erlang company. Loves Erlang, games, cycling and sunny seaside."
