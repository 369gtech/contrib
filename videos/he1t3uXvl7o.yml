description: "Previous time, we generated the graphics for JetBrains in static with P5.js and nodes. It wasn't only for fun, for sure, but also was used in splash screens of the IDEs you love and company promotion too. Now we've gone functional and dove into three dimensions and developed the new GUI. No quantum computations or strings discoveries were used yet, though. \n\nWe'll tell the boring details how precisely and why exactly it was doneâ€”why Elm, why WebGL, why functional, why even bother.\n\nThe product / playground: https://www.jetbrains.com/goodies/code2art/#tron  \nThe code: https://github.com/JetBrains/elmsfeuer\nThe slides: https://speakerdeck.com/shamansir/generating-animation-with-elm"
