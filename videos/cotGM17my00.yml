description: "If it connects, it can be pwned! As much as we may love IoT, it introduces all new vulnerabilities in places we've never before seen them. We're collecting classes of data that have never been digitised before, storing it on the cloud and opening up control of devices to potentially anyone with an internet connection.\n\nThis talk delves into real world examples of how IoT fails us. It looks at what the vulnerabilities are, how they were exploited, the impact they're having and importantly, how we need to evolve as an industry to prevent future incidents. It's an often frightening and sometimes hilarious look at just how pwned the internet of things is becoming.\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
