description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotjs.io on December 1st in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nFlow Control in JavaScript is hard! Native Promises in JavaScript have helped immensely, but the syntax is still a little callback-y. With Async + Await, we can write synchronous looking code without losing any of the benefits of JavaScript's asynchronous nature.\n\nWes explores how async + await works, best practices for flow control, and explores several solutions for handling errors."
