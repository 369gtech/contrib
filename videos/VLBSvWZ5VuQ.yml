description: "Computer scientists have discussed the design of computer programming languages for decades. Although these debates have led to an explosion of competing programming technologies, randomized controlled experiments on the human impact of competing language designs are rare, even in academia. This session discusses Quorum, a new JVM language in which a majority of the features are based on empirical studies. Quorum is a member of a growing new class of what are sometimes termed  evidence-based  programming languages. More specifically, the design of Quorum is dictated by rigorous scientific tests. The session presents the considerable academic evidence on the design of programming languages and introduces the latest version of Quorum.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAndreas Stefik\nAndreas Stefik is an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. He completed his Ph.D. in computer science at Washington State University in 2008 and also holds a bachelor's degree in music. Andreas's research focuses on computer programming languages and development environments, including their use by sighted, blind, and visually impaired people. He won the 2011 Java Innovation Award for his work on the NSF funded Sodbeans programming environment and has developed a computer programming language, Quorum, designed to be easy for novices to use.\nView more trainings by Andreas Stefik at https://www.parleys.com/author/andreas-stefik\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
