description: "Even after twenty years, Java is still going strong. The language has evolved from a small, simplified innovation in the C++ family to the enterprise juggernaut we know today. The growth of Java has encompassed all sorts of features, some of which wound up being used for purposes other than intended. This hopefully entertaining talk will highlight some of the major changes in Java over the years, from JavaBeans and introspection to EJBs to generics to streams, lambdas, and modularization, and will include a glimpse at some of the expected changes in Java 10 and 11. To coin a phrase, developers who forget the past are doomed to refactor it. This guided tour may bring back fond memories of the twists and turns in Java over the years, with an eye toward the future.\n\nKen Kousen is a Java Champion and the author of the books \"Modern Java Recipes\" (O'Reilly Media), \"Gradle Recipes for Android\" (O'Reilly Media), and \"Making Java Groovy\" (Manning), as well as a dozen video courses at Safari Books Online covering topics ranging from Java to Spring to Groovy and more. He is a regular speaker on the No Fluff Just Stuff conference tour and has given keynote addresses at conferences all over the world. He was awarded JavaOne Rock Star status in 2013 and 2016. In addition to his software background, he has BS degrees in both Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics from M.I.T., an MA and a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from Princeton, and an MS in Computer Science from R.P.I.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
