description: "droidcon Italy webinar\n13 October 2020\nAndrii Rakhimov, Android Chapter Lead, BabylonHealth\n\nHow to build a messenger for Android\n\nIt looks so simple outside, the app which can send messages from one user and receive from others. This is what we were thinking from start. 9 months passed we're still on it. In this talk, I will go through the main parts of the messenger project such as transport, synchronization, architecture, storage, pagination as well as explain common mistakes we've made on the way to instant messenger.\n\nYouâ€™ll leave this talk with a solid understanding of how modern messengers are built and the confidence to get started.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
