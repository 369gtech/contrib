description: "After the Value Stream\n\nAlexa Alley, Program Manager, Hearst Business Media\n\nWe spoke at DOES 16 about how to host and conduct a VSM; but now that you have a transformation plan, how do you implement it using Agile methodologies and make sure the business stays on track to complete the plan on time? This talk will cover how to take what was accomplished during the workshop and help transform your teams into high-functioning (mostly) agile teams. We will cover how the workshop be used as a tool to measure success, and ensure your business continues moving forward with Agile practices for long-term success and implementation.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
