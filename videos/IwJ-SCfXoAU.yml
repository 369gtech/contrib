description: "Java 8 makes it relatively easy to program with parallel streams and to implement asynchronous tasks using CompletableFuture. When someone says it’s easy, cautious programmers ask “What’s the catch?” Well, of course, that’s one of the major topic we’ll address in this deep dive session. We will start with a fast introduction to parallel and asynchronous programming with Java 8 and quickly delve into the gotchas, when to use these facilities, when to avoid them, and how and where to put them to good use.\n\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with sustainable agile practices on their software projects.\n\nVenkat is a (co)author of multiple technical books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer. You can find a list of his books at agiledeveloper.com. You can reach him by email at venkats@agiledeveloper.com or on twitter at @venkat_s"
