description: "by Bruno Cornec\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.401/redfish_the_new_standard_for_a_software_defined_infrastructure.webm\n\n\nRedfish is an IPMI replacement standardized by the DMTF. It provides a RESTful API for server out of band management and a lightweight data model specification that is scalable, discoverable and extensible. (Cf: http://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish). This presentation will start by detailing its role and the features it provides with examples. It will demonstrate the benefits it provides to system administrator by providing a standardized open interface for multiple servers, and also storage systems. \n\nWe will then cover various tools such as the python-redfish library (Cf: https://github.com/openstack/python-redfish) offering Redfish abstractions useful to provide Redfish support for python based solutions such as Ironic in OpenStack, cobbler or anaconda. The recently OpenSource python-redfish-utility client will also been covered. \n\nFinally, we'll show how to combine that to add CMDB support (with the Open Source iTop tool as an example) into a Software Defined Infrastructure. \n\nLive or Recorded demos will be displayed in order to illustrate the different aspects covered during the presentation. \n\nRoom: K.4.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 16:30:00+01"
