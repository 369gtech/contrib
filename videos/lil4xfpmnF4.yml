description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nThis panel of representative members of the C++ standards committee is ready to discuss everything from the just-completed C++20, to how the committee is working online as we start the C++23 cycle, and what to look forward to in Standard C++ in the coming years.\n\nBesides C++’s creator, the panelists include the current leaders of key subgroups. These leaders are responsible for language and library evolution, and topics like compile-time programming, real-time/embedded systems, AI, and teaching as the community starts to absorb all the new features in C++20.\n\nThe panel also includes representation of fresh forward-looking thinking with the heads of some of the newest national bodies to join in and participate in ISO C++.\n\n---\nHerb Sutter\nMicrosoft\n\nBryce Adelstein Lelbach\nCUDA C++ Core Libraries Lead, NVIDIA\n\nMichael Wong\nDE, Codeplay\n\nBjarne Stroustrup\nTechnical fellow, morgan stanley\n\nInbal Levi\nSoftware Engineer, SolarEdge\n\nJF Bastien\nSoftware Architect, Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development\n\nHana Dusíková\nStaff Scientist, AVAST\n\nJC Van Winkel\nSRE EDU lead educator, Google Switzerland\n\nTony Van Eerd\nStunt-double for C++ Expert, Christie Digital\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
