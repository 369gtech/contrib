description: 'At Docker, we like to “eat our own dog food” or “drink our own champagne.” Whatever your favorite phrase, the importance of a software company using their own software is critical to relating to our customers. In this talk, we will discuss how the Docker Infrastructure and engineering teams have deployed and operationalized Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) for our staging and production environments, what we have learned in the process, and how it''s making Docker EE better.'
