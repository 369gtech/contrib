title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2015 Sebastian Grail - Introduction to Functional Reactive Programming in Swift'
recordingDate: 1514642142
description: "Functional Reactive Programming is a paradigm that expresses changing data as streams of values over time.\n\nCombined with the functional programming concepts introduced in Swift, it greatly reduces code complexity and leads to more expressive and reusable code.\n\nThis talk gives an introduction to functional reactive programming using Swift with ReactiveCocoa 3 and shows how it can be used to write software more declaratively.\n\nSebastian is an iOS developer at Canva and formerly at Shiny Things. After trying to manage code complexity in OS X and iOS apps for many years he is now looking forward to finally leaving Objective-C behind and fully embracing the functional goodness that comes with Swift.\n\nFor more on YOW!
