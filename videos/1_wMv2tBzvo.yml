description: "The World's Information in Context\r\nMichael T. Jones (Google)\r\n\r\nGoogle's mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful is made both more accessible and more useful when that information is delivered in a geographic context. Michael will review the ways Google's Geo team works to accomplish this in Google's own Websites, on more than 100,000 other websites, and in dedicated software for personal computers and mobile phones.\r\n\r\nTopics covered will include progress to date, new product directions, and key trends of importance to developers."
