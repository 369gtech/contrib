description: "Lizzie O’Shea\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/215/\n\nTechnological advancement is not just about intelligent design, clever cryptography or brilliant coding; it’s also a function of power. To make technology work for people, we need to take this power back – and demand that the development of technology involve social, political and ethical considerations. Protecting encryption is about protecting democracy – it is about shifting power away from states and companies and towards people. \r\n\r\nIn late 2018, digital rights activists took on the national security establishment to try to resist attacks on encryption. It was a important and spirited effort but it was ultimately unsuccessful. The AABill passed, despite it being widely-accepted as a serious threat to our digital security. This talk will explain how that occurred, and how the intersection of technology and politics can be a challenging place for people interested in good public policy. \r\n\r\nIf we are going to improve our laws and public policy in relation to technology, we are going to need to fight for it. This requires a broad based alliance. We must take highly technical debates to the mainstream. It means finding ways to discuss these issues with precision but also simplicity, with determination but also compassion. The opportunities are there provided we can organise and make the most of them.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
