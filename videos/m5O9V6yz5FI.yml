While working for two large companies and helping teams implement a DevOps mindset we discovered similar approaches and techniques. From growing the team and the skills needed for this transition to looking at the larger organization as system in need of streamlining processes, we will share practices that have worked well for these teams and how to begin building a DevOps culture.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
