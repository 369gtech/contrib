We’ll code and package a web application. Its development versions will be inspected with SonarQube, shipped with Docker, and deployed to Artifactory. Jenkins 2 with its native delivery pipeline features serves as a backbone of our delivery ecosystem. Final releases are published to Bintray, the distribution management platform. Operations (e.g. uploads) on the final releases are gathered by JFrog Firehose Events API. Monitoring with the ELK stack does polish the overall DevOps tool chain. After the interactive session, you know nuts and bolts of setting up a scalable, high-end Delivery Pipeline, using Cloud, microservices, and container technologies.'
