description: "We'd love to think that Happy Hour is 9 to 5. But for most of us, it isn't. Happiness in the workplace is not some airy-fairy pipe dream, but cemented in reality as a key to unlocking our passion and unleashing our full potential in the workplace.\n\nThis session gets into the nitty-gritty stuff that can impede us kicking butt at work. The topics that will be covered are those common to many of us - dealing with a conflict with your boss, shifting to a more positive work-life balance (which I call 'work-life blend'), how to cope with workplace change, and the like - and provide strategies to deal with these in a positive and productive manner. The talk will also provide you with an understanding of the fundamentals of what makes different people happy at work - because happiness means different things to different people. You'll walk away with tools, case studies, and real-life examples of how *you* can kick butt at work."
