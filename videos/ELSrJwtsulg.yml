title: 'Ihor Lozynskyi - Building a Reactive DB driver with R2DBC'
recordingDate: 1576746636
description: 'Reactive programming is popular nowadays. We have Spring WebFlux for high-performance web-applications and Spring Cloud for reactive messaging solutions. Now, we are tackling the last frontier where blocking approaches are still winning: database access. During this talk, we are going to implement our own reactive database driver and use it for accessing data via Reactive Spring Data.'
