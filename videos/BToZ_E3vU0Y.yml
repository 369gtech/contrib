description: "Parsing JSON is a staple for any application these days. Come share my experiences in trying to squeeze every last ounce of speed out of parsing JSON in Perl.\n\nMore than just “which JSON parser is faster?”, we’ll look at a handful of other open-source JSON libraries and build XS bindings for them, and discuss several tools/techniques that you can use for profiling/benchmarking XS code, and look at how much of a difference compiler options can make."
