description: "Can machine intelligence enable new forms and interfaces for written language, or does it merely reveal an \"uncanny valley\" of text? Join Ross Goodwin as he discusses his work with neural networks for creative applications, including expressive image captioning, narration devices for your home and car, and two films (Sunspring & It's No Game) created from computer generated screenplays.\n\nRoss Goodwin\nSELF-EMPLOYED / GOOGLE\n\nRoss Goodwin is an artist, creative technologist, hacker, gonzo data scientist, and former White House ghostwriter. He employs machine learning, natural language processing, and other computational tools to realize new forms and interfaces for written language. His projects -- from word.camera, a camera that expressively narrates photographs in real time using artificial neural networks, to Sunspring (with Oscar Sharp, starring Thomas Middleditch), the world's first film created from an AI-written screenplay -- have earned international acclaim. Goodwin's work has been featured in the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, NPR, CBS News, the Financial Times, the Irish Times, El Pais, CBC Radio Canada, RTE Radio Ireland, ABC Radio Australia, Deutschlandradio, the Guardian, the Globe and Mail, Ars Technica, VICE Motherboard, Gizmoto, Engadget, TechCrunch, CNET, Forbes, Slate, FiveThirtyEight, Fast Company, the Huffington Post, Mashable, Fusion, Quartz, PetaPixel, and other publications. He has exhibited or spoken at Science Gallery Dublin, the International Documentary Film Festival (IDFA) DocLab in Amsterdam, the TriBeCa Film Festival Interactive Showcase in New York, the International Center of Photography (ICP) in New York, the Phi Centre in Montreal, Gray Area in San Francisco, the MIT Media Lab, Maker Faire, GitHub Universe, the NIPS machine learning conference, Molasses Books in Bushwick, and other venues. Goodwin earned his undergraduate degree in Economics from MIT in 2009, and his graduate degree from NYU ITP in May 2016."
