title: '#ChefConf 2014: Sascha Bates, "Chef: Whip It Good"--SFW'
recordingDate: 1400780936
description: "Based on the principles of manipulexity and whipitupitude, Chef was born from the desire to enable without regimentation. As a community we prefer to not dictate solutions. As individuals however most of us have strong opinions on right and wrong ways to do things. These opinions often manifest in heated arguments on the internet or an instant dismissal of \"that's stupid, don't do that\"\n\nWhen evaluating the merits of different tools and solutions, we often judge without understanding limitations around others' use cases. Regardless of whether you like or approve of certain solutions, they are often created to address specific problems dictated by individual organizations. Engineers often aren't given a choice regarding larger infrastructure solutions, or have organizational challenges that preclude the use of ideal solutions.\n\nIn this talk we'll explore tools and solutions like Berkshelf, Chef-Librarian, Spork and Roles vs Role Cookbooks and the strong opinions surrounding them. The object is to examine the needs and use cases that drive adoption in hopes that people can better understand when something is a good fit for themselves and perhaps understand each other better as well."
