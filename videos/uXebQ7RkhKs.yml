title: 'Nelson Morris - Extending Leiningen to Make it Do What you Want'
recordingDate: 1395719545
description: 'The clojure ecosystem has centered around leiningen as the project tool. Some of the downsides include a limited number of built in tasks and the amount of boilerplate when starting new projects. Additionally, sometimes its nice to extend application specific logic to the command line, such as for database migrations. In this talk, I''ll cover some of the internal details of leiningen, and how aliases, plugins, and templates can solve these issues.'
