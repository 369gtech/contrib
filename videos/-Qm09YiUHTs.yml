description: "Is the repl compiling my code? What happens if the clojure filenames donâ€™t match the namespace names? What is require doing? Is this one of those self-referential talk descriptions? What about like, AOT compilation, and gen-class, and all that? These questions and probably a few more will likely be answered by this talk on the life cycle of Clojure bytecode on the JVM.\n\nSlides: https://gfredericks.com/speaking/2018-11-30-compiling.pdf"
