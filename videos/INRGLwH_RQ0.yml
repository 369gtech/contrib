The platform provides an extensibility model for test frameworks (and language runtimes) to provide a common set  of operations such as filtering and test execution.\n\nIn this episode, Sarabjot Singh joins Kendra to give us a deep dive into the features and extensibility model that the VS Test Platform provides.\n\n[01:29] - What are some of the benefits of software testing?\n[03:30] - Stages in test execution\n[07:03] - What's new in the Test Platform v2?\n[10:15] - Running the Test Platform without Visual Studio\n[11:19] - .NET Core testing in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Azure Pipelines\n[14:15] - Executing tests in parallel\n[18:34] - Migrating to the new test configuration format\n[20:46] - Diagnostics test crashes with blame\n[22:24] - What are the extensibility points for the Test Platform?\n[27:55] - Documentation and quarterly reports\n[29:36] - Demystifying Test Platform v1 versus v2\n[31:20] - Can other programming languages plug into the Test Platform?\n[32:09] - Using blame in Azure Pipelines"
