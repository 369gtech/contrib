title: 'A Long Day''s Journey Into Backups'
recordingDate: 1548381699
description: "Rachel Kelly\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/198/\n\nThis is a story of the journey taken to have effective, safe backups in customer environments. Part history (four separate solutions implemented), part prescriptivism (use the cheaper storage solution, my GOD use the cheaper storage solution), part actual technical solutions (tar, S3, NFS/EFS), let's talk about the thousand solutions we tried, and what is really and truly working for the company and for me (and you!), the operations engineer.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource"
