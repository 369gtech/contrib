But, rather than deliver a fixed and eternal set of rules, author Damian Conway wanted to stimulate a mindset of continual re-evaluation of all Perl coding techniques and tools. \n\nIn this in-depth video course, Dr. Conway revisits and re-evaluates the rules, suggestions, and advice given in Perl Best Practices, drawing on his ten extra years of experience as a developer and educator. You’ll learn a new and improved set of 50 core guidelines to make your best-practice Perl code even better.\n\nThrough numreous examples, you’ll explore nine major topics:\n- Philosophy\n- Layout\n- Naming\n- Values and Variables\n- Control Structures\n- Built-in Functions\n- Subroutines\n- I/O\n- Error Handling\n\nA prominent contributor to the Perl community, Damian Conway is an internationally renowned speaker, author, and trainer.\n\nDon't miss an upload!
