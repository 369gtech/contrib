title: '"Disaster recovery for event organisers" - Christopher Neugebauer (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612093408
description: "Christopher Neugebauer\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/52/\n\n**CONTENT WARNING**: This talk discusses natural and human disasters that have resulted in loss of life, and damages to property and livelihood, including floods, wildfires, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlood, fire, and plague. Far from being signs of the apocalypse, these have been the sorts of disasters that Free and Open Source Software conference organisers have faced in the leadup to their events over the last ten years.\r\n\r\nLinux.conf.au in 2011 took place in the immediate aftermath of a one-in-forty year flood on the Brisbane River. North Bay Python in 2019 took place amongst nearby mass evacuations and the threat of smoke pollution from nearby bushfires. PyCon US 2020 cancelled an in-person event and rapidly regrouped to produce online material, barely weeks after Coronavirus became widespread in the United States.\r\n\r\nAll three of these events delivered an event that was significantly different to what they had originally planned, but successfully navigated unexpected circumstances to deliver valuable material and a memorable experience for attendees.\r\n\r\nWhile events like conferences are unique in that people (used to) travel to them, have real deadlines, and have physical constraints that online communities don’t have to deal with, unexpected crises can affect any project.\r\n\r\nThrough interviews with organisers from three disaster-impacted conferences, we’ll explore common themes that helped them successfully navigate a crisis, and important lessons they learned through the process including:\r\n\r\n* Maintaining the trust of your community through effective and timely communication\r\n* Developing and evaluating alternative plans when time is of the essence\r\n* Effectively navigating your commitments with external vendors \r\n\r\nThis talk uses conferences as case studies, but this talk will be of value to anyone who needs to navigate a community-led project through a crisis. Whatever’s next, you’ll be able to prepare for it.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
