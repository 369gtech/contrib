title: 'GraphQL At Scale With AWS'

recordingDate: 1525647290
description: "As the popularity of GraphQL grows, many hard questions are being asked by companies adopting it as an API standard. What databases or search engines can I use it with? How do you aggregate data from multiple sources globally? Can GraphQL fetched data be available offline, and if clients mutate it how are conflicts resolved? Is there a secure way to control data access based on user authentication? Do subscriptions scale to thousands or millions of users? How do I use it with content like images or video? Weâ€™ll learn about AWS AppSync, a managed GraphQL service with offline and realtime features, and see the latest features and functionality that have just been released to market.\n\nEVENT:\n\nReact Amsterdam 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRichard Threlkeld\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nReact Amsterdam Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nReact Amsterdam YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw"
