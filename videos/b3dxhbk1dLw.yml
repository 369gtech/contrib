description: "http://oreilly.com/go/clojure\n\nWhy is Clojure the most interesting new language on the horizon? With this video, you'll not only learn how to tackle practical problems with this functional language, you'll learn how to think in Clojureâ€”and why you should want to. Neal Ford (software architect and meme wrangler at ThoughWorks) and Stuart Halloway (CEO of Relevance, Inc.) show you what makes programming with Clojure swift, surgical, and accurate."
