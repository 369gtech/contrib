description: "Read the transcript of this interview:  https://bit.ly/3FPmlJD\n\nDomain storytelling is a technique for understanding a business domain by relying on people’s natural ability to learn a new language by listening to other people speaking that language. In this episode of the podcast, Stefan Hofer and Henning Schwentner cover when to use domain storytelling, what is involved in the pictographic language, and how to have productive storytelling sessions. They go into far greater detail in their new book, Domain Storytelling.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletters: \n- The InfoQ weekly newsletter: bit.ly/24x3IVq  \n- The Software Architects’ Newsletter [monthly]: https://www.infoq.com/software-archit...\n\nUpcoming Virtual Events - https://events.infoq.com/\n- InfoQ Live October 19, 2021:https://live.infoq.com/\n- QCon Plus November 1-12, 2021: https://plus.qconferences.com/\n\nFollow InfoQ: - Twitter: https://twitter.com/infoq\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/infoq/\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/InfoQdotcom/\n- Instagram: @infoqdotcom\n\n#DomainDrivenDesign #DomainModeling #InfoQPodcast"
