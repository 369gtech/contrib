description: "Are you developing applications that communicate over a network? Of course you are! This talk will take you through all the ways you can build fault-tolerant applications and how, once you get your team in the mindset that everything will eventually fail, dealing with the failures gracefully is no more work than building fragile applications.\n\nWith supporting slides, I'll cover the theory and motivation behind moving to a more distributed architecture and then go through the pitfalls and the strategies for improving fault-tolerance, backed up with real examples from the system I built at Sky television.\n\nAfter an introduction the talk will be split into 6 sections/principles/lessons learned from the field:\n\nImplementing SLAs + timeouts in a networked environment\nProactively avoiding work: bound your queues\nFailing gracefully + don’t cascade failures\nCircuit breaking unreliable dependencies\nKill switching unreliable dependencies\nKnow it is your fault: monitoring a micro service architecture"
