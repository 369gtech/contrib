description: "There is no shortcut to great security! However, there are some practical steps that developers can take to contribute to the company's security posture, and to help reduce the likelihood of the software you produce being at the center of a major incident. This talk will cover some of these steps, and explain not only why but more importantly how developers can make a positive difference in a market where security is becoming a constantly bigger focus point for investors and consumers alike.\n\n# Siren Hofvander \nHave you seen a fire breathing dragon dual wield My little pony figurines? How about an IT Security employee with a burning passion for keeping users say, security fun and accessible? Siren Hofvander delivers on the latter and strives for the former in her daily job as CSO for Min Doktor -responsible for the security of not only the patient data but also the service itself. She is an expert of embedded security and specialises in building security into the SLDC and firmly believes that security is a task for everyone, not just the hacker elite.
