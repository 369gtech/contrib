title: 'Aurelia vs “just Angular” a.k.a “the framework formerly known as Angular 2” - Chris Klug'
recordingDate: 1499244244
description: "There are a gazillion JavaScript frameworks out there. And probably another one being released while you read this abstract. However, for a lot of Microsoft devs, the two main frameworks to focus on are Aurelia and Angular. Why? Well, the way they are written fit well into the way we Microsoft developers are used to writing our applications. But which one is the best? Which one is the right choice? Which one will make my project a success, and which one will make it a pile of failure?\n\nObviously, those are some hard questions to answer. It all depends…as usual. But knowing a bit about how they both work, and the pros and cons of both, does make it a lot easier, and that is exactly what this talk is about. It will give you a run through of both frameworks, focusing on comparing them, giving you enough information for you to make an informed choice of which one will fit you the best."
