description: 'The release of Java SE 8 is the most significant release since Java 5 that happened 10 years ago. This presentation is an overview of the new features of the language and the new APIs. We’ll have some fun going over the code demonstrating new interfaces, lambdas, Stream API and new way to work with Date and Time. We’ll discuss all this using an easy to understand business domain: love and beer.'
