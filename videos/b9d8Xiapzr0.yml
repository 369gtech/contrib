description: "\"Kube\" your Enthusiasm: Bringing Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes Together with Project Eirini - Julz Friedman, IBM & Mario Nitchev, SAP\n\nIs container scheduling commoditised yet?\n\nThe Eirini project (now an “official” incubator project in the Runtime PMC) is bringing pluggable container scheduling to the Cloud Foundry Application Runtime. In other words: the `cf push` developer experience we all love, with your choice of container orchestrator - including Kubernetes - under the covers. \n\nThis session introduces the Eirini project, talks through the reasons behind it, updates the audience on the latest progress (passing CATs! available in beta! ready to try out!) and tells you what it means for your developers (not much) and your operators (potentially, quite a lot!). \n\nThe speakers will also demo getting up and running with Eirini on Kubernetes using a single Helm chart. After this the audience - and their Kubernetes-loving friends and colleagues! - will be able to try out the `cf push` developer experience, going from code to first-class Deployments, Pods and Services in your existing Kubernetes cluster, all in a single command!\n\nAbout Mario Nitchev\nMario Nitchev is a Software Engineer at SAP in Sofia, Bulgaria. He previously worked on internal projects for the SAP Cloud Platform. Currently he is working on Eirini - the Cloud Foundry incubator project that aims to abstract away container orchestration. He also enjoys poking around with electorincs, computer graphics and AI.\n\nAbout Julz Friedman\nJulian Friedman (julz) is an IBMer and the project lead for Cloud Foundy's low-level container engine (\"Garden\") and Eirini (the project to allow Kubernetes to be used as the container scheduler in CF). He has previously worked on various Cloud Foundry projects, performance optimization of Jeopardy-playing AIs, large scale and small scale Cloud projects, emerging technologies consulting and various other things. He has a doctorate in Large Scale Complex IT Systems (with a focus on data-parallel systems and Map/Reduce) which he is pretty sure is a long way of saying “Clouds”. If you have several free hours and enjoy the sound of a rant delivered in a British accent, ask whether he thinks pushing a database to a cloud platform is a good idea.\n\nhttps://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
