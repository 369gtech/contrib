description: "Matt Trentini\n\nMicroPython is a _fantastic_ environment for embedded development. But it _is_ an interpreted language; what happens when you hit performance limitations? Or want to use a new feature of your microcontroller? We'll look at how MicroPython can be _extended_ to add features and improve performance.\n\nhttps://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/extending-micropython-using-c-for-good\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 2 - 6 2019.\n\nVideo licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU\n\nSun Aug  4 13:30:00 2019 at C3.6"
