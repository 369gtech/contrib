description: "Irit Katriel\n\nThe Quartz engineering team at Bank of America hosts one of the world's largest python codebases. Changes in core components of the platform can have high impact.\n\nHow do you safely make changes in a library that thousands of applications are using? Why would a one-line bugfix take months or years to roll out? These are the day to day problems we face in the Quartz engineering team at Bank of America, which hosts one of the world's largest python codebases. In this talk Irit Katriel, one of the Quartz technical leads, will describe some of the unique maintenance challenges she and her team have tackled."
