title: 'Building apps with React Native by Maarten Mulders'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510221157
description: "There's nothing more expensive than building the same thing twice. Yet that is what a lot of companies do when they publish a mobile app: they build one for Android and one for iOS. But wait, you don't have to! Using React Native, you can build one mobile app for both platforms from one code base using a language you're probably already familiar with - JavaScript.\n\nIn this session, we'll discuss building a simple word game app for both iOS and Android. First, we'll dive into how React Native works and how to build a basic application. Then, we'll dive into the Redux framework, which helps us building predictable state and allows for great testability of our application. Finally, we look at how the two integrate and how to build a simple game.\n\n# Maarten Mulders\nEnthusiastic senior developer and trainer. Passionate about \"building the right thing\" and \"building the thing right\". Seasoned in Java and JavaScript, recently entangled by Scala and Akka. Love to share new ideas and knowledge."
