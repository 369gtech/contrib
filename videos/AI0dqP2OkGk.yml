title: 'Adam Sandor. How GitOps Changes Everything in CI/CD'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620893006
description: "Rus: https://youtu.be/dtGt5syu2mY\n\nIn the past years of Cloud Native conquering the world, implementing CI/CD remained surprisingly difficult. Docker and Kubernetes helped solve some problems but created others and don’t provide a tight recipe for delivering applications in an efficient and developer-friendly way. That is changing with the GitOps pattern getting adopted as the centerpiece of the CD process. It’s a deceptively simple idea, which nevertheless has far-reaching consequences for how we design and think about our software delivery pipelines. This talk will show how GitOps provides a better interface for development teams to define their environments, and what do Custom Resources and Operators have to do with all of it. Most of it is tool agnostic (only relying on Kubernetes), but I will show how tools like Helm, JenkinsX or ArgoCD fit into the picture.\n\nAdam is a Sales Engineer at Container Solutions, helping companies adopt Cloud Native tech. Coming from a Java-dev background he is most excited about the space where software development and operations meet. When he is not flying in DCS World he is hacking on CI/CD, GitOps and Kubernetes Operators.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/CwNyyRevXTNwDA\n\nDevOpsFest: https://2020.devopsfest.ru/"
