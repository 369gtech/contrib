description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2012\n\n\nSlides available here: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2012/speakers/JesperLouisAndersen\n\nerlang-solutions.com\nerlang-factory.com\n\nErlang is perfectly suited for a modern distributed world. Part of this world is also a relatively new kind of client/server paradigm, namely Peer-to-Peer communication. We believe that this kind of communication is important to the modern internet and hence, the eTorrent project was born to gauge the usefulness of Erlang in a heavily distributed Peer-to-peer setting.\n\nThis talk is about using Erlang for implementing Peer-to-Peer clients. I claim Erlang made us write an efficient BitTorrent client in a fraction of the effort compared to other clients. I claim our client is more robust than the competition for normal operation. And I claim the Erlang mentality fits the Peer-to-Peer model well. I also explain how we utilize the Erlang platform to implement the client in an OTP-idiomatic way, and how we differ from the mainstream implementations.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory ;\nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
