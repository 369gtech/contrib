This model, initiated by some web giants (Netflix, Google …), promotes extreme applications modularization, runs counter to the monolithic model. Microservices allows: reduced release cycle, loose coupling between services, standardization of communication (REST), reduction of risks during deliveries, cloud orientation, etc.\n\nBut it still remains tedious to easily connect these services without changing the application code. Traefik was born from this.\n\ntraefik.io, a reverse-proxy that can watch orchestrators’ API to generate its configuration automatically. This tiny tools solves what can be a huge pain when dealing with microservices deployed in an orchestrator.\n\n***\n\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DevOpsGathering\nCheck out our website: devops-gathering.io"
