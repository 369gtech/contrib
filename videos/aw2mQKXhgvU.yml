description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nIâ€™ve previously shown how to embed snippets from Tests and other compiled code in to Markdown docs, so the docs are always right, and users can trust your docs - using a tool called mdsnippets.\n\nThis year, it's even easier to keep code in your Markdown docs automatically uptodate.\n\n---\nClare has worked in software development for over 30 years, and in C++ for 20 years.\n\nSince 2017, she has used her spare time to work remotely with Llewellyn Falco on [ApprovalTests.cpp](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp), to radically simplify testing of legacy code. She has enjoyed this so much that she recently went independent, to focus even more on helper others work more easily with legacy code.\n\nClare was until recently a Principal Scientific Software Engineer at Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, which releases data and powerful software for scientific education, research, and streamlining the design and manufacture of new medicines.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, she lead the team that replaced their 30 year old database format and Fortran code. She then returned to C++ and Qt, working on the popular 3D crystal structure visualisation program [Mercury](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/mercury/), which she was the original author of.\n\nWhen not thinking about supporting teams to streamline development, testing and releases, she spends time with family and friends, and enjoys the Raspberry Pi, folk music and cinema.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
