description: "The World Economic Forum and the Aker group have established an Affiliate Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Network for ocean innovation and technology in Norway (C4IR Ocean). The objective of C4IR Ocean is to bring industry, academia, government, and the public together to create new and better ways of harnessing rapidly emerging data technologies to heal and restore the ocean so it can be resilient and economically productive. \nOne of the projects in C4IR Ocean is the Ocean Data Platform. It has emerged as a central tool in the C4IR Oceanâ€™s efforts to unlock the power of ocean data. The Platform is designed as a global, open-source, integrated data digital ecosystem built to pilot and support new data-driven tools to improve ocean health and productivity.\n\nMicrosoft Build 2021"
