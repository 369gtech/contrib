description: "Node runs on a powerful JavaScript engine, but that same engine can complicate things when it comes to obtaining accurate information on your application's performance.\n\nThere are plenty of tools for profiling C++ or Java applications, but understanding JavaScript interactions with native code can be extremely challenging. In this talk we will discuss profiling options for Node.js, including perf_events, dtrace, the V8's engine built-in --prof switch, and tools based on the bleeding-edge kernel BPF technology. We will also talk about turning profiler results into flame graphs, an innovative visualization tool for understanding stack sample reports, and for figuring out the time split across the JavaScript and native parts of your application."
