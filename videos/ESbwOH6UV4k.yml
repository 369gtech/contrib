description: "How to survive the plague of undead institutions and create a company that can kick ass and take brains. \n\nDo you work for (or with) a Zompany? A Zompany is zombie company that has lost its humanity and is in a relentless, tunnel-visioned pursuit of profit (brains). It has no other purpose, and no regard for who or what gets in its way. We all know that 21st century creative companies cannot afford to operate in this manner. \n\nAre you interested in starting your own venture, or making positive change within the company you work for? Become familiar with the 8 Value-Steps every entrepreneur should know, and inoculate yourself against the dead-end career apocalypse.\n\nJason Theodor\nCreative Director, jasontheodor.com\nhttps://twitter.com/jted\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
