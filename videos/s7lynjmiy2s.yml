description: 'AI on the Edge is here! Watch Paul de Carlo, Microsoft Cloud Developer Advocate, step through his Intelligent Edge Hands-on Lab (https://aka.ms/iotshow/intelligentedge -- which is open source and available for you to try) During this lab, Paul deploys an IoT Edge module to an NVIDIA Jetson Nano development board to allow for detection of objects from the live video stream of a Webcam. In this episode, the webcam is scanning the floor at Microsoft Ignite 2019 and detects people, backpacks, chairs and more, in real time. The same setup can detect objects in YouTube video streams, RTSP streams, or HoloLens Mixed Reality Capture and stream up to 32 videos simultaneously. Object Detection is accomplished using YOLOv3-tiny with Darknet. Learn why Paul and Olivier are never going to give you up, never going to let you down during this memorable episode.'
