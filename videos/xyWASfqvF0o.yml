title: 'Emmanuel Gaillot: The Server That Goes Ping @ I T.A.K.E. Unconference 2013'
recordingDate: 1584028384
description: "Node.js is getting increasingly popular among developers who have to code HTTP servers. And because its underlying single-threaded model makes programming with Node.js quite an unusual experience, developers have one more excuse not to test-drive their code.\nIn this session, we'll do some live coding and demonstrate a possible way to code from A to Z (using mocha and expresso to test-drive our code) an HTTP server that requests informations from a third-party Minecraft server -- in the hope to inspire the audience to follow the same path, or to find an even better one.\n\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E. Unconference: http://itakeunconf.com\n\nThe organizer of I T.A.K.E. Unconference is Mozaic Works http://mozaicworks.com"
