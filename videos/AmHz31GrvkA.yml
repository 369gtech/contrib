language: English
recordingDate: 1609866593
description: "Talk \nIntroducing automatic linked selection and cross filtering tools for HoloViews, GeoViews, and hvPlot supporting the concise and convenient .plot() interface in Pandas or Xarray along with custom widgets from Panel, allowing data scientists to create even complex dashboards relating values across each of the dimensions without having to program with callbacks or other advanced mechanisms.\n\nSpeakers\nPhilipp Rudiger is a Software Engineer at Anaconda, Inc. developing open-source and client-specific solutions for data management, visualization and analysis. He is the author of the open source dashboarding and visualization libraries Panel, hvPlot and GeoViews and one of the core developers and maintainers of Bokeh, Datashader, and HoloViews. He has a strong background in the Python data science stack with experience in visualization, ML and numerical analysis. Before making the switch to software development he completed his PhD and Masters in Computational Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh working on biologically inspired, deep and recurrent neural network models of the mammalian visual system.\n\nDr. James A. Bednar is the Senior Manager of Technical Services at Anaconda, Inc., and was a faculty member in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh from 2003 to 2015. At Anaconda, Jim is the project lead of a variety of open-source packages under the HoloViz.org banner, including HoloViews, GeoViews, hvPlot, Datashader, Panel, and Colorcet.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
