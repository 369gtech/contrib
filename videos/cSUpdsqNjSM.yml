title: 'Anton Zlygostev. Linq2d: Efficient processing of 2D arrays in C#'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619617897
description: "You all know about Linq in C#. The one that lets you using a language like SQL to perform operations on the object collections in memory. One can use the same language, and the operations will be rendered into an SQL code and run within a real database. However, can we apply the same approach to make mathematical calculations more efficient? Yes, we can. The linq2d library allows developers to declaratively describe the operations on the two-dimensional arrays; in run-time, the compiler generates an efficient and safe code using SIMD instructions.\n\nThe talk aims to inspire developers who value the efficiency of their code to take advantage of the C# and .NET framework: use the ready-to-use compiler to perform the lexical and syntax analysis and JIT to generate the target machine code.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/UcJHACdZNQ6GMw\n\nDotFest: https://2020.dotfest.ru/lecture/13"
