description: "Patterns of Modern Data Integration\n\nData integration is a really difficult problem. We know this because 80% of the time in every project is spent getting the data you want the way you want it. We know this because this problem remains challenging despite 40 years of attempts to solve it. All we want is a service that will be reliable, handle all kinds of data and integrate with all kinds of systems, be easy to manage and scale as our systems grow. Oh, and it should be super low latency too. Is it too much to ask?\n\nIn this presentation, weâ€™ll discuss the basic challenges of data integration and introduce a few design and architecture patterns that are used to tackle these challenges. We will then explore how these patterns can be implemented using Kafka producers, consumers, Kafka Stream, and KSQL\n\nDifficult problems are difficult and we offer no silver bullets, but we will share pragmatic solutions that helped many organizations build fast, scalable and manageable data pipelines.\n\nNeil is a Technologist in the Office of the CTO at Confluent, the company founded by the creators of Apache Kafka.\n\nHis role is as an industry expert in the world of streaming, distributed systems and the next generation of technology as the world becomes real-time. This includes working on fun things like dataflow system design, modeling, stream processing, serverless, developing crazy ideas and bending Kafka in all kinds of directions.\n\nWith over 25 years of expertise in distributed computing, messaging and stream processing. He is an active member of the CNCF serverless working group. The last 16 years has been mostly in finance, and helping startups. Prior to that he was at Thoughtworks, ran his own startup and was the CTO at a fin-tech.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
