description: "Workloads like data plane network-functions require guaranteed, predictable performance, high throughput and low latency. Similar requirements may also reside with other workload categories like the ones serving the Finance sector. To apply cloud principles and satisfy these workloads specific requirements, we have enabled platform technologies and test tools. In this webinar weâ€™ll discuss building Kubernetes clusters with appropriate technologies, optimizations, methodology and the usage of tools to do characterize performance. We will provide you with examples of how to deliver policy-based orchestration of function in order to achieve targeted data plane performance.\n\nPresenters:\n\nDana Nehama, Director, Product Management Network Cloud\_@Intel Corporation\nPetar Torre, Principal Engineer\_@Intel Corporation"
