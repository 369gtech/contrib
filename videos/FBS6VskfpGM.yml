description: "Visit the largest developers congress in Europe: WeAreDevelopers World Congress, 16 - 18 May 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/congress/\n\nThe life of machine-generated data holds incredible value for those willing and able to deal with data at an incredible scale. In this talk, we’ll be looking at the challenges of working with machine data alongside the tooling and best practices to help you tackle the whole life cycle of working with machine data. We’ll look at machine data generation, transfer, storage, analysis, and how to cope with large-scale data that never dies. This talk will include a live demo showing MQTT transfer of machine data, ingestion, storage in the CrateDB-distributed database, the application of visualization tools, and machine learning to add extra value to the data.\n\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers.org/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/wearedevs/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearedevelopers.org/"
