title: '.NET Application Modernization with Pivotal and Azure DevOps - CFS2001'
language: English
recordingDate: 1557183722
description: "In partnership with Microsoft, Pivotal has helped many organizations make sense of a .NET application portfolio that needs to move “to the cloud” and prioritize which are the best candidates to modernize versus replatform versus leave alone.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will look at how one goes about modernizing a .NET Framework application using the rich tooling available on Azure DevOps. We will successfully migrate a monolithic app from a classic IIS environment to .NET Core with microservices, leveraging Pivotal Application Service for Windows running on Azure Cloud.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with an understanding of what an Azure DevOps app modernization strategy looks like and will have the building blocks to begin their own strategy."
