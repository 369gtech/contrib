description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nTo meet regulatory and business continuity requirements, it’s critical that companies deploying a cloud-native strategy have the flexibility to deploy a multi-cloud application strategy. Major cloud vendors regularly experience outages, and organizations lose data as a result. Concerns around these outages and potential data loss, along with requirements for availability and reliability, are driving the need to be able to distribute business critical applications across multiple clouds. These concerns are changing the playing field for how companies will deploy distributed application in the cloud.\n\nView this webinar based on a case study with a challenger bank in Hong Kong. We’ll discuss how this bank is using the NuoDB SQL database and the Rancher Kubernetes Engine to provide distributed transaction processing across multiple clouds. Join us to learn:\n-Why multi-cloud environments are growing consideration for running core banking applications in the cloud\n-How to achieve optimal data protection and availability for your core banking applications\n-How new regulations pertaining to multi-cloud and persistent data applications may push Kubernetes to the next level"
