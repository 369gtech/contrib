description: "How can we apply technology to drive business value? For years, we've been told that the performance of software delivery teams doesn't matter―that it can't provide a competitive advantage to our companies. Through six years of groundbreaking research, the DORA team set out to find a way to measure software delivery performance―and what drives it―using rigorous statistical methods. This talk presents the findings of that research, including how to measure the performance of software teams, what capabilities organizations should invest in to drive higher performance, and how software leaders can apply these findings in their own organizations.\n\nJez Humble is co-author of several books on software including Shingo Publication Award winner\_Accelerate,\_The DevOps Handbook,\_Lean Enterprise, and Jolt Award winner\_Continuous Delivery. He has spent his 20 year career in software tinkering with code, infrastructure, and product development in companies of varying sizes across three continents, including working for the US Federal Government’s 18F team as part of the Obama Tech Surge, and co-founding startup DevOps Research and Assessment LLC, which was acquired by Google in December 2018. He works for Google Cloud as a technology advocate, and teaches classes on agile software engineering and product management at UC Berkeley’s School of Information.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
