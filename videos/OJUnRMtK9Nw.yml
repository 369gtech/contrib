description: "Donna Benjamin\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/74/\nOpen source software projects can be prickly toward their users. Poor documentation, a steep learning curve, and a finely tuned focus on excellence and quality can make a project community seem hostile. As users of many different open source projects over the years, Donna Benjamin and Leslie Hawthorn have often wondered about this problem and contemplated what to do about it. This session takes their long-standing private rant public in the hopes that it will help us all be better developers, collaborators and community members."
