description: "Running a programming and robotics holiday club for teens\n\nSarah Townson\n\nSunday 16th, 15:30 (Room D)\nEducation Summit talk for educators (Sunday, 25 mins)\nOver the summer, Science Oxford (and educational charity) ran an IET/IMechE-funded robotics holiday club for 11-15 year olds living in areas of high socio-economic deprivation in Oxford.\nThroughout the week, participants learnt to program a BBC micro:bit in Python, then designed and built their own robot to follow a winding path, by choosing from a range of sensors. We also took them to visit local organisations to show the range of opportunities available within engineering, and the different routes to a career.\nHear about the problems we overcame to get this project off the ground, our successes and failures, what the young people thought about and gained from the week, and how we plan to improve it for next year!\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for teachers."
