description: "Code Mesh London is the best place in Europe for non-mainstream tech and programming languages. On 4-5 December 2013 over 50 inventors and originators of the most innovative languages and technologies of the moment shared their experience with 200 attendees. Topics included Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Julia and much more. See you at Code Mesh 2014! codemesh.io/\n\nAbout the talk:\nThe world of *Copious Data* (permit me to avoid the overexposed term *Big Data*) is currently dominated by NoSQL databases and **Apache Hadoop**, a clean-room version of the *MapReduce* computing model and distributed, reliable file system invented at Google.\n\nWe'll examine the strengths and weaknesses of these systems and see how to address the latter with newer APIs, programming languages, and other, emerging tools. We'll see how more focused tools are emerging, like search engines. I'll make the case that Big Data is essentially *Applied Mathematics*, a \"killer app\" for *Functional Programming*. To succeed, Big Data systems must embrace this essential truth.\nTalk objectives:\n- Briefly summarize the current state of the art for NoSQL and Hadoop.\n- Describe pain points and other areas where improvements are needed.\n- Discuss improvements to Hadoop and emerging alternatives.\n- Discuss the renaissance of SQL stores and SQL-query APIs, like Hive for Hadoop.\n- Discuss emerging technologies that focus on more specific problem domains, vs. relying on \"generic\" solutions."
