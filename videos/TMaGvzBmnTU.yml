description: "How would you like to learn how to leverage machine learning in countless Computer Vision use cases the easy way? Recently, Computer Vision Technologies have skyrocketed. Why? Machine Learning and a number of brilliant people working on Computer Vision.\n\nMachine Learning is currently a hot topic and holds a bold promise yet to be truly exploited. But, no matter what your level of understanding of Machine Learning is, we all can agree that it is a broad technology whose pioneers and leaders have a very specific expertise in. In other words, it just does not make sense for all developers to be experts in machine learning. It is more important for developers to understand how to leverage machine learning in your applications.\n\nThe Vision APIs of Microsoft Cognitive Services are easy to implement, free to prototype and inexpensive to scale in production. There is a rich set of services and a comprehensive SDK. And best of all the Vision APIs leverage billions of dollars spent in Microsoft Research and cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe Vision of Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford) is for more personal computing experiences and enhanced productivity aided by systems that increasingly can see, hear, speak, understand and even begin to reason.\n\nMicrosoft Cognitive Services are a set of APIs, SDKs and services available to developers to make their applications more intelligent, engaging and discoverable. Microsoft Cognitive Services expands on Microsoft’s evolving portfolio of machine learning APIs and enables developers to easily add intelligent features – such as emotion and video detection; facial, speech and vision recognition; and speech and language understanding – into their applications.\n\nTake a lap around the features and functionality of the Microsoft Cognitive Services Vision APIs with Tim Huckaby to see how powerful these services are and how easy they are to implement in your own applications."
