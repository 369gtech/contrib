description: "The HTTP protocol is now over 15 years old and it has served us well, but a new version will address some of the fundamental problems with how it was implemented “on the wire”. The changes are based on experience with Google’s SPDY protocol, but standardized for everyone to use.\nMajor features of the current version such as methods and status codes will be unaffected. Existing sites should just work with the latest version, but they can drop many of the old tricks they used to squeeze out performance like CSS Sprites and file bundling. This session will review the basics of what is being changed and how to best utilize the new protocol."
