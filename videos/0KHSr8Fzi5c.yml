Modern methods take a very different approach based on resiliency, which promotes embracing failure instead of trying to avoid it. Resilient architectures improve observability and leverage well-known patterns such as graceful degradation, timeouts, circuit breakers and embrace chaos engineering, a discipline that promotes breaking things on purpose in order to make them more resilient to failure. In this session, will review the most useful patterns for building resilient software systems and I will introduce chaos engineering methodology and especially show the audience how they can benefit from breaking things on purpose.\n\nAdrian Hornsby \nFrom Amazon Web Services\nI am Technical Evangelist with AWS - Coding, Speaking, having fun :-)"
