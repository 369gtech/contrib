In this talk I will present the unique challenges in the medical imaging domain, and how they can be addressed. We will take image segmentation as an example and see the evolution of solutions for this problem.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
