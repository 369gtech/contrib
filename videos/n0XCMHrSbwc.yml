description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nWORKING WITH LEGACY CODE\nby Gabor Olah\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nLegacy \nCode \nBattle-story\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n\nABSTRACT\nIn a world driven by software, sooner or later, everyone needs to develop code left behind by somebody else. In this talk, we discuss what is legacy code, how to understand it, and the required mindset needed to tackle it. Since dealing with legacy is mostly about understanding the code, we provide some ideas of what tools to use on the BEAM platform to ease grokking the legacy system. Through battle stories, we provide examples which challenge the job of future developers, suggesting how to avoid them.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/gabor-olah/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - GABOR OLAH\nDeveloper and consumer of legacy code\n\nGabor was introduced to Erlang during his university studies by participating in the RefactorErl group. He was interested in language design and a lot of academic problems, so this project was an excellent opportunity to get into type systems and other projects. From there, he joined Ericsson Hungary in 2011 to work on telephony switches (mostly on the famous one mentioned in Joeâ€™s book). This taught Gabor to enjoy the complexity of this application.\n\nThis was the point when Gabor started loving working with legacy code and learned how to work in a team. After three and a half years, he joined a research project inside Ericsson where he was exposed to Executable UML and testing strategies. In 2015, Gabor joined Erlang Solutions where he has been working with different clients (e.g. backbone financial payment solutions) as well as internal products like WombatOAM. Gabor's main professional interests are language design, architecture and math.\n\nGabor likes drawing and painting, watching science fiction movies and series, he is a big Doctor Who fan.\n\nMore on Gabor Olah: https://codesync.global/speaker/gabor-olah/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
