description: "We implement a hash function that we use to assign indexes into a hash table. This lets us look up our data very quickly.\n\nI forgot to mention in the video but if we let n be the number of items in the hash table and m be the length of the string we are hashing, the algorithmic complexity of a hash table is O(m). It does not depend on n at all, and since m is generally very small, people usually say that hash tables are O(1). That makes hash tables are your best friend.\n\nMore hash table algorithms can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table\n\nNew video every Thursday. Question?
