recordingDate: 1542527929
description: "Franziska Bell, Senior Data Science Manager on the Platform Team, Uber\nPresented at MLconf 2018\nAbstract: At Uber, we are using natural language processing and conversational AI to improve the user experience. In my talk I will be delving into 2 use cases. In the first application we use natural language processing and machine learning to improve our customer care. The other use case is the recent launch of a smart in-app reply system that allows driver partners to respond to incoming rider messages at a click-of-a-button. Finally, we will cover the components common to most conversational AI systems."
