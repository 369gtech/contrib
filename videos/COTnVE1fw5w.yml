description: "Learn how Spring and Cucumber integrate to make test automation easier. Cucumber is a framework for Behavior-Driven-Development (BDD), a refinement of TDD (Test-Driven-Development). Its intent is to enable developers to write high-level use cases in plain text that can be verified by non-technical stakeholders, and turn them into executable tests, written in a language called Gherkin.\n\nUsing Spring, Cucumber, WebDriver2, Hemant Joshi will show you how to use Spring & Cucumber to do BDD with elegance and joy."
