description: "Slide Deck: http://bit.ly/slidedeck-210525\n\nBlog: https://blogs.oracle.com/apex/mle-and-the-future-of-server-side-programming-in-oracle-apex\n\nFor developers that know SQL and PL/SQL, no other framework is as empowering as Oracle Application Express (APEX). But not all developers know how to program using PL/SQL.\n\nIn Oracle Database 21c, developers now can write server-side code in JavaScript. Younger generations and JavaScript professional developers who chose that technology as a life career can now be part of the team and participate in your APEX applications' code base. As a result, you can now leverage a massive set of JavaScript libraries for tasks that are hard to solve in PL/SQL.\n\nIn this hands-on lab, learn how to utilize that feature and start writing server-side JavaScript in the different areas of Oracle APEX. Weâ€™ll start with the SQL Commands, Processes, and Validations, and end using external modules to empower your APEX application even further.\n\nImportant Note: In order to provision Oracle Autonomous Database 21c, you will need an Oracle Cloud account in one of these regions: Germany Central (Frankfurt) - FRA, US East (Ashburn) - IAD, US West (Phoenix) - PHX or UK South (London) - LHR. If you currently do not have an account, you can create one here and specify one of the regions above."
