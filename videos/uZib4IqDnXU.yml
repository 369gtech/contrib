description: "Live Coding systems encourage us to think extremely differently about programming languages. In addition to considering standard requirements such as reliability, efficiency and correctness we are also forced to deal with issues such as liveness, coordination and synchronization all whilst working in real time. Live Coders not only run and modify our code live — they often performing with it live on stage in front of large crowds of people who really don't want the code to miss a beat. In this code and demo-heavy talk, Sam will take a deep technical dive into the internal ideas and innovations of Sonic Pi — a system designed specifically for live coding music. The audience will explore Sonic Pi's novel temporal semantics which allows multiple concurrent threads to execute in synchronizatio\n\nSam Aaron, Sonic Pi\nI am a researcher, software architect and computational thinker with a deep fascination surrounding the notion of communicative programming. I see programming as one of the many communication channels for descriptions of formalised process of any kind, be it a business process, a compiler strategy or even a musical composition.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
