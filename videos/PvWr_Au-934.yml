The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nMaking Plugins Mainstream: Developing a Plugin Manager for Kubectl - Ahmet Alp Balkan, Google  \n\nKubectl Plugins are an extension mechanism to add custom commands to Kubernetes developers’ favorite tool: kubectl. As the plugin mechanism became stable recently in Kubernetes 1.12 and people started to develop plugins, we realized a challenge is upon us: How to make these plugins easy to develop, package and distribute.    This talk is a Kubernetes SIG CLI subproject \"krew\" and how we have designed and built a \"cross-platform package manager\" that makes plugins accessible to vast amount of Kubernetes users easily.    This talk will go through:  * Kubernetes project’s emphasis on extensibility  * Introduction to kubectl plugins and writing a small plugin  * Designing Krew: how to write a plugin manager for kubernetes without writing a fully-fledged package manager  * Life of a kubectl plugin managed by Krew  * Challenges of building a curated catalog of plugins as Kubernetes OSS community \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uab4"
