description: "There is no official “devops” Manifesto. I’ve always shied away from writing this for two main reasons:\n\nnot setting things in stone encourages people to keep an open mind. So they can come with their own version of the solution AND the problem. This allows our field to expand and have people re-think and re-evaluate other people’s solutions.\n\nit often brings a sense of checklist. Do A,B,C and you have reached the final goal. Devops does not have an end-goal, it is continuous journey; whatever you change to improve, will have an impact and might require you re-think your strategy\n\nTherefore I value more the different models people have developed along the years to understand/explain the “devops” problem space:\n\nIn the first part of the session, I will iterate over the conceptual models I’ve come across that try to capture the essence of devops. In part two we will leave the theory, and provide a more practical way of obtaining the shared view, using a sort of ‘reverse value stream mapping’ technique. Finally, we’ll take a step back and see how well we’ve done in the past years, explain some of the caveats and look towards the future.\n\nDon’t expect specific tools to be explained in full; We will refer to the tools as examples of concepts though. Come with an open mind and re-think / re-evaluate your “devops” project while applying the principles of the different models.\n\nIn order to understand current IT organizations, Patrick has taken a habit of changing both his consultancy role and the domain which he works in: sometimes as a developer, manager, sysadmin, tester and even as the customer.\n\nDuring 15 years of consultancy, there is one thing that annoys him badly, it is the great divide between all these groups. But times are changing now: being a player on the market requires you to get these ‘battles’ under control between these silos.\n\nHe first presented concepts on Agile Infrastructure at Agile 2008 in Toronto, and in 2009 he organized the first devopsdays . Since then he has been promoting the notion of ‘devops’ to exchange ideas between these groups and show how they can help each other to achieve better results in business.\n\nFor more on YOW!
