description: "Deep Dive: Rook - Travis Nielsen, Red Hat & Alexander Trost, Cloudibility \n\nThe Rook operator implements custom resource definitions (CRDs) to express desired state of storage providers for Kubernetes. This deep dive will review the framework Rook provides to integrate the storage providers with an operator and CRDs. As an example, details of the Ceph operator will be shown, including how it builds on the Rook framework and how Cephâ€™s specific orchestration needs are met. The Ceph mons require special handling to stay in quorum and handle failover. Ceph OSDs require several stages of discovery and provisioning before the daemons are started. The Ceph mgr runs an active and standby daemon for high availability. For object storage, Rook creates all the pools and starts the rgw daemons needed. For a shared file system, Rook creates the pools and starts the MDS daemon with a standby. These and other challenges with the Ceph daemons will be discussed. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrdU"
