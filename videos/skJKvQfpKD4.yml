title: 'Monitoring Cloud Foundry: Learning about the Firehose - Dustin Ruehle & Tom Collings, ECS Team'
language: English

description: "Distributed and massively scalable systems are difficult to design, implement, and operate. Further, microservice architectures are supposed to enable your business to be disruptive and innovative. Cloud Foundry provides that solution for modern, cloud native architectures and accelerates the ability to transform operational and development practices. The aggregated logging subsystem of Cloud Foundry, the Loggregator, is a key component of this transformation. And within the Loggregator, the firehose is where log and metric data is consumed. This talk will walk through how to consume the firehose and dive into the anatomy of the various firehose message types. Several use cases and lessons learned monitoring the platform versus an application will be covered to further demonstrate how Cloud Foundry can facilitate innovation.\n\nTom Collings \nECSTeam\nTom Collings has more than twenty years of software implementation experience, ranging from the simplest of utilities to enterprise-wide systems serving millions of customers. His current focus is delivering cloud-native solutions to his clients, and he is a Certified Practitioner of Pivotal Cloud Foundry. He has degrees in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and in Computer Science from the University of Colorado. In his spare time he is active outdoors and plays the banjo.\n\nDustin Ruehle\nECS Team\nDustin Ruehle has over 19 years of software development, integration and architecture expertise. For over eight years at ECS Team, he has architected, implemented and supported large-scale web application and service oriented environments for enterprise-wide systems. He also serves as a technical subject matter expert on modern architectures and is a Certified Practitioner of Pivotal Cloud Foundry. He has spoken at Cloud Foundry meetups in Atlanta and Dallas."
