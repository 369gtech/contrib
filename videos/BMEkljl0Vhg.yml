description: "Kotlin is a new OSS programming language from JetBrains, an IDE and developer tools leader. Its purpose is to provide a general industry-focused language that can be used for all types of development and, at the same time, fixing some of the common pitfalls of other languages that can end up being very expensive. Thatâ€™s the idea behind it at least, but does it hold? You can find out in this session, which puts it to the test by creating a real-world application to see if and when it can help and whether it has enough potential to be a prime runner.\n\n\nAuthor:\nHadi Hariri\nHadi Hariri is a developer, speaker, podcaster and Technical Evangelist at JetBrains.
