description: 'Red team is a commonly misunderstood offensive security discipline. Red team has been used as a general term for all areas of offensive security just as blue team for defensive security. True red teaming goes Beyond Pentesting and into more adversarial emulation. While there are overlapping skills, there are differences that will be discussed as Phillip shares his experience of going from a pentester to a red teamer. In this talk, you will learn about the different areas that make up red team operations, common tools, and the path to becoming a red teamer. In this presentation, you will learn about resources helpful for a path into red teaming.'
