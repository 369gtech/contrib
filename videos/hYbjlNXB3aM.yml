description: "Everyone's talking about CSS-in-JS. It's the Kim Kardashian of web development. And, as with Kimmie, opinions are polarised. To some, CSS in JS just makes sense: it's local to your component, it can't leak and, hey, I know how to write JavaScript and CSS is weird. \n\nTo others, CSS-in-JS is an abomination that makes them want to emulate Kimmie and \"release a fragrance\" in disdain. Why are scripters so afraid of the cascade? Why the hesitance about inheritance? \n\nLet's look at what CSS seems to lack, what the CSS-in-JS libraries can teach us, so we don't do as Kim's buttocks did and \"Break the Internet\".\n\nEVENT:\n\nCSS Day 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nBruce Lawson\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynhYEO2fwf0"
