description: "Write your own compiler in 24 hours \nby Phil Trelford \n(@ptrelford) \n\nCompiler writers are often seen as the stuff of myth and legend.\n\nIn this session we'll step behind the proverbial curtain and reveal how compilers actually work.\n\nExpect plenty of live code samples, primarily in F#, covering language design and parsing, all-the-way through to emitting code. This session is aimed as a primer for those interested in writing an external DSL, general purpose language or just understanding how these things work.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/205707742/"
