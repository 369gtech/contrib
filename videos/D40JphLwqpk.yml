description: "Developers today are exploring creative code to build something expressive and engaging. Traditionally this has been done with frameworks such as Processing and Cinder, and on the web, both Canvas and WebGL. While WebGL and Canvas provided you access to low level APIs, you lost the power of CSS animations and the composability of the DOM. Today the combination of React & SVG provides an elegant solution that bridges the gap between these two worlds. Gone are the days when the SVG’s cryptic syntax could only be deciphered by apps such as Illustrator or Sketch. Now you can dynamically generate animations with components and then wire them up to the application state and user interactions.\n\nIn this talk Varun will present some examples of what can be achieved, discuss performance aspects and show you practical applications to try.\n\nVarun Vachhar\nDesign Leader / Front-­End Developer, rangle.io\nhttps://twitter.com/winkerVSbecks\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
