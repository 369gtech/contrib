description: "Speaker: Gojko Adzic (gojkoadzic), Partner @ Neuri Consulting LLP\n\nContinuous delivery is not just a technical tool. Regardless of whether we want it or not, it creates a fundamental change to the world around software teams, including marketing and customer interaction. Ignoring those changes is dangerous, because it can lead to conflicts with the rest of the company. Embracing those changes and exploiting them opens up new business opportunities. By recognising and taking charge in this transformation, software teams can become much more valuable to the companies around them. This talk will focus on how to unlock all that potential, and turn the fact that your teams can deliver frequently into an engine that will help you outrun your competition. This is a talk for tech and business people.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nGojko Adzic is a strategic software delivery consultant who works with ambitious teams to align software delivery with business goals, and improve the quality of their software products and processes.
