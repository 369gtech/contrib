title: 'Docker Networking: From Application-Plane to Data-Plane'
recordingDate: 1494277135
description: "Madhu Venugopal - Sr. Director, Networking, Docker Inc\n\nDocker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment. By default, containers isolate applications from one another and the underlying infrastructure, while providing an added layer of protection for the application. What if the applications need to communicate with each other, the host, or an external network? How do you design a network to allow for proper connectivity while maintaining application portability, service discovery, load balancing, security, performance, and scalability? In this session you'll learn about these network design challenges, the latest tools available to you from Docker, and common deployment patterns."
