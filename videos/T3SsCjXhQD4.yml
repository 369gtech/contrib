recordingDate: 1606559065
description: "As part of a not-for profit activity led by Emergent Alliance, a joint team from Rolls-Royce and IBM have performed a variety of analyses around COVID-19, from health, public opinion, impact on tourism to the impact on the economy. Most blog entries from https://emergentalliance.org/?page_id=1128 are from us, most of our work is on https://github.com/emergent-analytics/workstreams.\n\n\n\nWe aim to supply governments and businesses with insights which could be used to support decision making during the Covid-19 crisis. Some of our developments include:- A risk index to evaluate the public health risk of a region.- A pulse dashboard to understand the sentiment about covid expressed on media how travelling has changed.- An economic simulation engine to model the impact of shocks in the different sectors of the economy.- A labelling tool to understand what happened so far, which measures were put in place, and how the economy reactedWe are a team of data scientists from IBM’s Data Science & AI Elite Team, IBM’s Cloud Pak Acceleration Team, and Rolls-Royce’s R² Data Labs working on Regional Risk-Pulse Index: forecasting and simulation within Emergent Alliance. Have a look at our challenge statement, our articles on the blog, and our github repository!\n\n\n\nÁlvaro Corrales Cano is a Data Scientist at IBM’s Cloud Pak Acceleration team. With a background in Economics, Álvaro specialises in a wide array Econometric techniques and causal inference, including regression, discrete choice models, time series and duration analysis.\n\nKlaus G. Paul is a Data Scientist and the Berlin AI Hub and Emerging Technologies Capabilities Lead for R²Data Labs at Rolls-Royce Deutschland. As an aerospace engineer, Klaus has a background in condition monitoring, big data systems, predictive analytics, and a passion for intelligent assistants that support decision making.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
