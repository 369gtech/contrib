title: 'James Weaver - Quantum Computing Exposed -Schrödinger''s Grumpy Cat - Code BEAM SF 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1521249644
description: "The buzz about quantum computing has been rapidly increasing lately, and a growing number of developers have been looking into the subject. Concepts that developers typically find challenging after a cursory investigation of quantum computing include:\n\n    superpositions of quantum bits (qubits),\n    quantum gates,\n    quantum entanglement (Einstein’s “spooky actions at a distance”),\n    and the relevance of Schrödinger’s famous cat.\n\nIn this session, James Weaver will give a gentle introduction to quantum computing, including:\n\n    A brief history of quantum computers,\n    visualizing superpositions,\n    composing quantum algorithms with quantum gates,\n    understanding Shor’s potentially RSA encryption busting algorithm,\n    and current status of quantum computers.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/james-weaver/"
