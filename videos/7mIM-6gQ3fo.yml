With the pace of GO-JEK business that has been growing 6666x in 36 months, we need an infrastructure platform that could scale quickly and deliver products to customers faster. Three years ago, all of GO-JEK services ran in our baremetal machines in Jakarta. Today, they are running across multi-cloud: GCP, AWS, and on-premise datacenter. GO-JEK is in the process of migrating applications to containers, centered around Kubernetes. We chose Kubernetes because of its portability across cloud and dynamic scaling.  We will talk about the work that went into building Kubernetes custom resources for our workload deployment, custom controller, integration with Consul to discover external services, and how GO-JEK got to where it is today: processing 350 million internal API calls per second. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuJX"
