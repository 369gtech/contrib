description: "Check out https://g.co/aiexperiments to learn more.\n\nThis experiment helps visualize what’s happening in machine learning. It allows coders to see and explore their high-dimensional data. The goal is to eventually make this an open-source tool within TensorFlow, so that any coder can use these visualization techniques to explore their data. http://g.co/aiexperiments\n\nBuilt by Daniel Smilkov, Fernanda Viégas, Martin Wattenberg, and the Big Picture team at Google.\n\nMore resources:\nhttp://www.tensorflow.org"
