description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nParsing natural language time expressions into structured data is challenging. Whilst there are quite a few tools, many are either too simplistic or problematic in a python setup. ctparse is a pure python library (MIT-License) build on straight forward concepts, allowing to parse complex expressions efficiently and can easily be adjusted for domain specific use cases.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
