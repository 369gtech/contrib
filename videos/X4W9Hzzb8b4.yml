description: "Mayank Prakash, Chief Digital and Information Officer, DWP Digital\n\nDiptesh Patel, Deputy Director, Hyper Cloud Services - Technology Services, DWP Digital\n\nMayank Prakash started his career as a Graduate Engineer Trainee at the Hewlett-Packard. He worked in the HCL JV starting with the entrepreneurial Frontline Solutions start-up venture and was soon after selected to join the Senior Management Trainee Programme and deputed to incubate ERP implementation capabilities working with the Big 4 Consulting firms.\n\nPrakash was the International CIO of Avaya, then the Group CIO of iSoft and later the CIO of Sage Group in UK.[3] Prakash was hired by Morgan Stanley as a Managing Director, Tech and Data, as part of the executive team of Morgan Stanley Wealth and Asset Management.\n\nIn 2014, Prakash left Morgan Stanley to join the Department for Work and Pensions as the Director General in charge of technology, replacing Andy Nelson. In this role, Prakash combines his predecessor's job as CIO with business transformation, security and data responsibilities, and works directly for Sir Robert Devereux. As of 2015, Prakash was paid a salary of between £195,000 and £199,999 for this role, making him one of the 328 most highly paid people in the British public sector at that time.[6]\n\nThe British Computer Society welcomed the appointment, and Morgan Stanley was sorry to see him leave. GDS Chief Mike Bracken described the hiring of Prakash as the turning point for Whitehall's ability to hire the best digital leaders across industry.\n\nCredited with quietly turning around one of the largest IT estates into a lean digital delivery machine on a massive scale, TechUK and DigiLeaders recently recognised the strength of industry partnerships and the scale of digital transformation being delivered at DWP resulting in DWP becoming #8 on Twitter attracting a million digital techies and leaders from all sectors.\n\nDOES18 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
