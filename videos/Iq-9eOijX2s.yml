description: "Where is Erlang when we move from the cloud towards the edge?\n\nIts traditional use case in telecom equipment has always been in larger embedded systems, which were always reaching towards the edge of the network. With our GRiSP project and evaluation board we push to get Erlang's advantages into smaller devices in IoT, home automation, manufacturing and automotive systems.\n\nTo extend this reach of the Erlang VM even further we are not only building boards and software that run Erlang directly on the hardware but also extending the capabilities of the Erlang VM towards a more scalable, heterogeneous, Erlang distribution protocol supporting hard realtime Erlang processes.\n\nIn this talk we will give an overview of our progress so far and will demonstrate use cases in home automation and robotics. Our work for improving Erlang distribution for our Industrial and IoT applications will bring improvements for cloud based solutions too, like a remedy for head of line blocking and better scalability.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/sebastien-merle/"
