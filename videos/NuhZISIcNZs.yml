title: 'DevOps Transformation at Absa Bank: Technical Evolution; Cultural Revolution - May 24, 2017'
recordingDate: 1497038910
description: "Andrew Holt & Benjamin Hinson of Absa Bank - ChefConf 2017\n\nThere is one thing that makes up DevOps. Tools. Tools and process. Okay two things. Tools, process and culture. Among the things that make up DevOps, tools, process and culture are three. And of course, nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition, which makes it tough to get teams to buy into new ways of doing things. We are delighted to share our DevOps transformation journey with you. First, there's the technical journey, such as how we are automating our infrastructure, and our software engineering practices (see www.practicesofmastery.com). Then there's the process journey such as how we have redefined our SDLC to remove friction, and our use of scrum. Finally, there's the cultural journey, such as how we're forming teams around customer value rather than functional silos, as well as our guerilla marketing campaigns (see www.productivitypact.org). Software mediates every interaction with our customers and the purpose of our transformation is to increase our ability to deliver higher quality software at higher velocity in the pursuit of customer value."
