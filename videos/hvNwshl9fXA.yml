It's a great term, one that promises significant benefits \nfor Java developers and Java applications. However there are traps for the unwary traveler undertaking this journey. It's best to be prepared and forewarned. In this talk hear more about what cloud-native Java looks like, and how it can differ from what you might be expecting. From application to JVM to hosting environment, there are challenges to face and obstacles to overcome before you've reached your goal. This talk will educate and remind you of the important points to be aware of, and will offer an opinionated view of the open technologies you should be including in your travel bag.   Whether a new starter or an old hand, this session will leave you thinking differently about cloud-native Java!\n\nSteve Poole From IBM\nDeveloper Advocate for IBM Cloud Runtimes.\n\nLong time IBM Java developer, leader and evangelist.
