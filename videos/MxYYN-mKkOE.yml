description: "??ATTENTION ??\nRegistration to ?DevTernity 2018 is running:\n? https://devternity.com\n\nWhat do you do when you know your codebase is dirty, and it’s your in-house framework? This happened to us at Wix. As we debated how to tackle our massive technical debt, we were struck by a wonderful realization: the process of transforming the old framework into something new and shiny is a golden opportunity to improve coding practices throughout the organization. We steered clear of specs and coding standards in favor of a platform of debating, reviewing and improving code. In this talk Ittai will walk you through the process we went through, sharing the story of how we used this ongoing refactoring effort to drive code quality improvements throughout Wix R&D."
