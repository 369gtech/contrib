description: "Transitioning to a Community-owned Stemcell - Felix Riegger & Florian Nachtigall, SAP\n\nWhile the stemcell source code is open source and was always open to contributions, the actual release process was run on vendor-owned infrastructure and it was not easy to actually contribute. This has changed. When it became clear that there might be no Bionic Stemcell for the community in time SAP volunteered to bring the already existing beta version to a GA release and to stewardship the transition of the necessary build infrastructure to CloudFoundry Foundation owned hyperscaler accounts. Now, every community member can easily participate in the stemcell creation process. â€‹ In this talk we will give an update of what has changed, how the new community-owned pipeline setup looks like and how you can get started / involved. We will touch upon architecture decisions made, access and credential management and the future of stemcell publishing.\n\nTo learn more about Cloud Foundry, The Proven Developer Experience For Kubernetes click here: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
