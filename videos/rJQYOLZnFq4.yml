Come learn about our efforts to write modern boot loaders in Linux's user space.\n\nLinuxBoot is a project to put Linux kernels into firmware. LinuxBoot means we have the full toolset of modern languages like Go at our fingertips: let's use them! We can now easily develop boot loaders with trivial support for HTTPS-, gRPC- or TPM-based network booting.\n\nChris Koch\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/en/ASG2018/public/events/215"
