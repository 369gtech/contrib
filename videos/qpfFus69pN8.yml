description: "Individually creating software to get the tasks done is the easier part of the whole story compared to doing it as a development team. From conflict resolution between the team members to deciding what features goes into the product, the team needs to make countless of decisions everyday and I bet you want to do this fast in order to hold on to your business’ competitive advantage.\n\nAs being a Technical Lead to a software development team, I’ll share my experience in this talk on what the essential principles are for building and leading a fast-paced, customer-centric and effective software development team. By the end of the talk, I hope to leave you with a few ideas that you can experiment within your own teams.\n\nDevConf 2018 (http://devconf.pl)\n26-28 September 2018"
