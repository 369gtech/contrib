description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/36kRzXi\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\n\nFor the past couple of years it seems that Microservices is all the rage. We want to use Microservices, we want to decompose into Microservices and we want Microservices to be a part of our world. While modern tools and platforms such as Docker, Kubernetes, Service Mesh and the public cloud help in implementing and maintaining such systems, the reality is that many fail even before the first line of code was written. This can happen for many reasons; Perhaps you chose a Microservices architecture for the wrong reasons? Maybe the organization wasn't ready for it? Or just possibly - the proposed architecture didn't embrace the true meaning of Microservices?\nAs the CTO of a software services company I get tackle these questions a lot. Join me in this session as I provide my perspective on transitioning from Monolith to Microservices through lessons learned in the real world, while architecting and implementing multiple Microservices based software systems at various customers."
