description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nTaking Your Database Beyond the Border of a Single Kubernetes Cluster - Christopher Bradford, DataStax & Ty Morton, Google\n\nDeploying applications on Kubernetes is getting easier every day. From a minimal deployment to distributed service mesh enabled applications with planning and a little bit of YAML resilient cloud-native applications are the norm. In this session, Christopher Bradford and Ty Morton will help answer the following questions: - What about your data behind these apps? - Are you running those in a multi-cluster environment or sending everything back to a common location? - How do you modernize to a distributed peer-to-peer data architecture? - How do you plan for this change? - Are there pitfalls on the road to enlightened data? Join this session to explore the key concepts needed when investigating multi-cluster deployments for data. This includes: - Cluster planning - Network design - Security - Failure handling"
