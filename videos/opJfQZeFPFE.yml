title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Shifting UX to the Editorial Experience'
recordingDate: 1523563018
description: "Normally in a web development agency, your focus is on the front end, consumer-facing side of a website. Yes, we talk about the administration but mostly defer to \"it is what it is\" and \"that's just how Drupal works.\" With the rise in popularity of decoupled infrastructures, more clients are shifting their focus to improving the Drupal Administration UX.\_\n\n\nFrom a business perspective, an editor often has more say in the support and success of your CMS then the end user browsing the site so the editor persona should be considered throughout the development process. In this session, we'll dive into how Group Nine Media (parent company of Thrillist.com, TheDodo.com and others) are evolving the Drupal 8 editorial user experience and contributing that back to the community. We'll not only look into their use case but also explore what modules and options are out there for improving editorial UX without custom development work.\n\n\nWhat to expect:\n\nHow is design/UX reversing to focus on the editorial experience?\nWhat contrib modules currently enhance the editorial experience?\nHow can a better editorial experience be beneficial to your client?\nWhere is the future of editorial experiences and Drupal heading?"
