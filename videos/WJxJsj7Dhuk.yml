title: 'Communication between (micro-)services - Bernd RÃ¼cker - Codemotion Amsterdam 2018'
recordingDate: 1530612514
description: 'Have a bunch of nicely decoupled (micro-)services (e.g. checkout, payment & shipping) raises questions: How do the services communicate - synchronous, asynchronous or event-driven? How can you implement complex end-to-end use cases (e.g. a customer order)? How can you tackle the challenges around distributed systems? What does all this mean for us as developers? In this talk I discuss the impact of different solutions to your architecture. I will show various recipes around fail fast, retry, back pressure or business transactions using the Saga pattern.'
