description: "As the world grows more dependent on a shared open source software ecosystem, we all must consider who shares the responsibility of keeping that infrastructure healthy. In his 15 years at data science and technology company Two Sigma, as well as his service on the board of TS Ventures, Matt Greenwood has had to think deeply about how to most efficiently allocate capital to open source software (OSS) to best support the companies’ various lines of business. Matt shares four ways of engaging with open source—funding OSS startups, paying for OSS contractors through trusted consulting companies, hiring OSS engineers in-house, and building a consortium with committed stakeholders—covering the costs and benefits along with examples of Two Sigma’s experience with each. Matt focuses on the fourth point, highlighting how partnerships with real teeth, like his work with the nonprofit NumFOCUS, have been the most effective in terms of continuity, risk mitigation, and scalability.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
