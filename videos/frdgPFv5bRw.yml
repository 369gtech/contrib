description: "In today's Software Development world the number one demand from employers is to deliver features as soon as possible. Everything else is secondary. That means engineers are doing only one thing: writing new code, debugging, and writing new code again. And most of the time this code is running in one of the very convenient clouds. Rarely anyone ever stops and thinks about performance as a whole. If performance is an issue the to-go solution is to throw more money at it. Which usually means buying more computing power in the cloud. But is this really the best way of solving that issue? We should make ourselves aware how wasteful our industry is sometimes and think about ways to avoid that.\n\nChris Thalinger\nTwitter\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
