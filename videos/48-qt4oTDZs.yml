description: 'If you are interested in Big Data, you surely have heard about Apache Spark or Apache Cassandra, but do you know Apache Zeppelin ? Do you know that it is possible to draw out beautiful graph using an user-friendly interface out of your Spark RDD or out of Cassandra queries ? In this session, I will introduce Zeppelin by live coding example and highlight its modular architecture which allows you to plug-in any interpreter for the back-end of your choice.'
