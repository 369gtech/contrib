In 2006 he created AMEE, raising over $10m from world-class venture investors including O'Reilly, USV, and Amadeus (AMEE organises the world's environmental data, standards, and calculations into a simple web-service). In 2011 he joined the UK Government's \"Energy Sector Board\" as part of their Midata open-data initiative.\n\nHaving helped to kick-start the streaming media industry in Europe in the late 90's, he created an award-winning media-technology service, Tornado, and sold it to a larger media group in 2003. He then helped create the digital supply-chain as founding CEO of world-leading digital distributor, CI: the first company to deliver digital products to iTunes, and delivered Amazon US ~25% of its download store.\n\nAt the UK's Jodrell Bank Radio Observatory he worked on systems designed to map and interpret the universe. He created courses and lectured in Engineering and Music at Glasgow University, and has degrees in Astronomy (B.Sc.), and Electronic Music (M.Mus.). He has also co-created a co-operative harbour on the Thames where he now lives, as a musician has released his own album, and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.\n\nYou can follow Gavin @agentGav."
