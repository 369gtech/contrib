title: 'Data Serialization and CI/CD Techniques for Apache Geode'
language: English
recordingDate: 1571418265
description: "Since Apache Geode is implemented in Java, data serialization has always been an important topic for discussion when designing an Apache Geode cluster. Different data serialization techniques and configurations have a direct impact on the performance of Apache Geode cluster and Day 2 operations.\n\nIn this session, we'll cover Apache Geodeâ€™s data serialization concepts, configurations, and impact to the implementation style of server-side components that will be deployed to an Apache Geode cluster. We'll use Pivotal Cloud Cache as an example for specific configurations that improve developer experiences, cluster performance, and Day 2 operations. Furthermore, we'll use a CI/CD pipeline to showcase the deployment of data model changes without the need to restart the Apache Geode cluster but still maintain the \"Strong Type\" programming preference.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2MVTNni\n\nSpeaker: Jeff Cherng, Advisory Solution Architect, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlides: Coming Soon"
