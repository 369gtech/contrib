description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nIntro to the CNCF SIG Storage - Quinton Hoole, Futurewei & Alex Chircop, StorageOS \n\nThe CNCF SIG Storage collaborates to explore and understand how different storage technologies are used in cloud-native environments. Topics include block stores, file systems, object stores, key-value stores and databases, amongst others. Different architectural approaches (centralized, distributed, sharded etc) are compared in terms of key attributes like availability, scalability, performance, data consistency, durability, fault tolerance, ease of development and operational complexity.  In the intro, we'll provide an overview of the work currently underway and on the roadmap. You'll get the meet the people leading these efforts, and find out how best to get involved and contribute.  We'll present our work thus far, and host discussions around the findings of our recent end-user surveys covering how cloud native storage is approached in the real world, including some representative successes and failures. Our hope is that others can learn from, and expand upon those experiences. \n\nhttps://sched.co/W87B"
