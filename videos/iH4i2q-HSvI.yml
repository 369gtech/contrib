title: 'Baking a Microservice PI(e) by Antonio Goncalves and Roberto Cortez'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510141205
description: "Imagine you have several microservices exposing REST APIs. Imagine now that these microservices are spread all over and need to talk to each other. Imagine that you have a nice user interface interacting with these APIs where you can authenticate. And now, imagine that all this runs smoothly.\n\nIn this Deep Dive session, Roberto and Antonio will build, step by step, a full microservice architecture (using different languages and frameworks). This session will answer these questions:\n\nHow to build, document and deploy several microservices spread on different nodes (we use a Raspberry PI cluster, because the Cloud is too expensive)\nHow to make those microservices talk to each other (Eureka for registry and discovery)\nHow to scale up, down, and deal with network failures (Ribbon and Zuul to the rescue)\nHow to deal with high traffic (Hystrix, here you come)\nHow to monitor this distributed system (Dropwizard metrics with the ELK stack)\nHow to centralize configuration (Archaius)\nHow to trace calls (Zipkin)\nHow to authenticate and manage authorization with JWT (Tribestream Access Gateway)\nHow to have a centralized nice looking entry point (with Angular)\n\n# Antonio Goncalves\nAntonio is a senior developer specialized in Java/Java EE. As a consultant he advises customers and helps them in defining and developing their software architecture.\n\nThis Java Champion is also the founder of the very successful Paris JUG, Devoxx France and an independent JCP member on various JSRs (Java EE 6, Java EE 7, Java EE 8).\n\nBased on his Java EE experiences, he has written three books covering Java EE 5, Java EE6 and recently Java EE 7.\n\n# Roberto Cortez\nRoberto Cortez is a passionate Java Developer with more than 10 years of experience; mainly the Finance sector. He is involved within the Open Source Community to help other individuals spread the knowledge about Java EE technologies.\n\nHe is a regular speaker at conferences like JavaOne, Devoxx, JFokus, and others, leads the Coimbra JUG and enjoys writing blog posts. He is very excited to be a Triber; he now has the opportunity to work on the servers where everything happens, instead of just developing applications that run in a container.\n\nWhen he is not working, he hangs out with friends, play computer games and spends time with family."
