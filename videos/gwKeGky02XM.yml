Docker is awesome. Together you can do great things. But, are you doing it the right way? We'll walk you through, in detail, the optimal way to structure Docker images for Spring Boot applications for iterative development. Structuring your Docker images correctly is really important for teams doing continuous integration and continuous delivery. Using Docker best practices, we'll show you the code and the technologies used to optimize Docker images for Spring Boot apps!\n\nMike Thompson \nFrom IBM\nDeveloper, Architect, Evangelist, and whatever else I'm doing at the moment\n\nGraham Charters \nFrom IBM\nGraham is an IBM Senior Technical Staff Member and WebSphere Applications Server Developer Advocacy Lead based at IBM's R&D Laboratory in Hursley, UK.
