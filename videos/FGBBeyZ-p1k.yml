Rowe, Jr., Pivotal \n\nEnvoy is a high-performance open source edge and service proxy that makes the network transparent to applications. As of now Envoy is only available on Linux, and thatâ€™s a big blocker for Windows teams who want to migrate their monolithic apps to more service-oriented architectures.  Last year a team at Pivotal started working with Microsoft on making Envoy on Windows a reality. This talk will give a progress report on the work being done:  * An overview of the history of the project. Starting with the work done by Microsoft, contributions to upstream so far, and what we have left.  * Some of the challenges the team faced and how they overcame them. For example, the workarounds we employed to get a working Windows environment for Envoy, and some of the performance issues which still need to be solved.  * What the team is currently working on and what the outlook for the future is like. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UacB"
