description: "The talk from QA Fest 2019 conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: http://bit.ly/2ooBgHC\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/QAFest/\nWebsite: http://qafest.com/\n\nMost of us testers are called these days as QA engineers, which sounds pretty confusing to me. Testing and Quality Assurance are two different process areas, which may not even overlap sometimes. However, due to this configuration, most testing activities may not be performed as good as they could. Let's think whether we understand QA right and whether we really have to be testers in order to assure quality."
