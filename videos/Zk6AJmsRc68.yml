title: 'Elastic Streams at Scale - Till Rohrmann & Joerg Schad'
recordingDate: 1563141779
description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nOne of the big operational challenges when running streaming applications is to cope with varying workloads. Variations, e.g. daily cycles, seasonal spikes or sudden events, require that allocated resources are constantly adapted. Otherwise, service quality deteriorates or money is wasted. Apache Flink 1.5 includes a lot of enhancements to support full resource elasticity on cluster management frameworks such as Apache Mesos. With the latest version, it is now possible to build elastic applications which can be programmatically scaled up or down in order to react to changing workloads. In this talk, we will discuss recent improvements to Flink's deployment model which also enables full resource elasticity. In particular, we will discuss how Flink leverages cluster management frameworks, e.g. Mesos, and already-introduced features like scalable state to support elastic streaming applications. We will conclude the presentation with a short demo showing how a stateful Flink application can be rescaled on top of Mesos.\_\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
