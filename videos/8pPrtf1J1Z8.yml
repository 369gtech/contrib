description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotscale.io on April 24th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nNo software system on the planet is today fully failure-resistant. Given this, it becomes crucial for software teams to be able to deal with major production incidents in a nimble way. However, just as complex systems fail, responding to a major system outage is a painful operational exercise that may at times require multiple stakeholders to work together.\nIn this talk, Aish discusses how to efficiently deal with the human element, when complex systems fail."
