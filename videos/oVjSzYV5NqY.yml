description: "Speaker: Nuttapat Kirawittaya\r\n\r\nGraphQL is a query language for your API. There are a lot of benefits gained if you using it. For my point of view, the best benefit of GraphQL is not that we can reduce number of requests or prevent overfetching. The best feature of GraphQL is schema which allows developers, tools to work together seamlessly. I will show my usage of schema including Apollo plugin for your vscode, Type generate from your schema, automatic reviewing schema changes using GraphQL Inspector\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\nMy name is Nuttapat Kirawittaya. I'm a react-native developer at Shopee. I love GraphQL.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/React-Knowledgeable/events/265344291/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/CHIpG/"
