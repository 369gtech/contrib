description: 'After 20 years of evolution Java Virtual Machine became a real masterpiece of engineering and can easily outperform static compilers in many cases. There are however lot of issues arising when someone tries to use JVM for functiona laungagues. Clojure or Scala compiler creaters had to fight with JVM types, lack of tail recursion and other problems. It was particulalry hard to create efficient Haskell implementation for JVM Developers of Eta tried it once again in a little bit different way. We will analyze how it works on a sample system, where the business logic is written in Haskell and middleware components and libraries in Java. We will try to analyze when it makes sense and how does it compare to the pure Java/Haskell implementation in terms of performance and code quality.'
