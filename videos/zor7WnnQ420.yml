description: "During the first part of this exclusive webcast event we welcome Eric Ries (@ericries) author of New York Times bestseller \"The Lean Startup\" for a fireside chat with Alistair Croll (@acroll) and Ben Yoskovitz (@byosko) authors of \"Lean Analytics\" to learn the story behind \"Lean Analytics\" and how the material was chosen for the book.\n\nBy now, you're probably heard of Lean Analytics. Maybe you've even learned about the five stages all startups go through, or how to pick the one metric that matters for your business model and how to draw a line in the sand.\n\nIn this webcast, authors Ben Yoskovitz and Alistair Croll take you deeper down the Lean Analytics rabbit hole. In their practical, no-holds-barred style, you'll learn about:\n\n   -  using the data you already have to find new ideas to test\n    - how to pick the right experiments\n   -  the role of subversiveness in growth hacking\n    - how to apply Lean Analytics methods to enterprise-focused innovation\n    - and what intrapreneurs within existing organizations do differently\n\nLearn why readers are calling Lean Analytics the must-read book of the year for founders and innovators."
