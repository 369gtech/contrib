title: 'Zero to Mobile Hero - Intro to Xamarin and Visual Studio Team Services - Luce Carter'
recordingDate: 1550656603
description: "You can be faced with a nightmare of Xcode, Android Studio, Swift, Objective C, Swift and other options. This means not only learning multiple languages and frameworks but also having to support two different codebases for the same application. But Xamarin Native and Xamarin.Forms offer a powerful, cross-platform development solution for .NET developers looking to target smartphones, tablets, TVâ€™s, computers and IoT devices.\n\nIn this talk, Luce shares what Xamarin is including Native and Xamarin.Forms for both C# and F#, how to get started creating a simple HelloWorld app from scratch and a more complex example (will involve at least one Azure service including Cognitive Services for facial recognition). Also how to use Visual Studio Team Services for Continuous Integration and some awesome examples of apps written using Xamarin including ones used to save lives!\n\nLuce will take examples from xamarin.com/customers as well as show this demo about how Xamarin was used alongside other technologies to aid with Skin Cancer prediction.\n\nThis talk will include slides, demos, code samples, live coding and the audience will walk away feeling like they too can create a mobile app in just a few minutes and carry their work around with them in their pocket or backpack!\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
