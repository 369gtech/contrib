description: "The new six-month release cadence for the JDK has seen more major releases of Java in the last eighteen months than in the previous ten years.\n\nIn this session, we’ll look at how Java is changing, both from a technical perspective and from that of changes to release schedule, binary distributions and availability of updates.\n\nWe’ll discuss the major new features in JDK 9, 10, 11 and 12 . We’ll also look at some of the larger, longer-term projects to improve Java: Amber, Valhalla and Loom."
