language: English

description: "“That would never work here.” You’ve likely heard this sentiment (or maybe you’ve even said it yourself). Good news: change is possible. Martin Hinshelwood explains how Microsoft's Azure DevOps Services formerly VSTS went from a three-year waterfall delivery cycle to three-week iterations and open sourced the Azure DevOps task library and the Git Virtual File System.\n\nThere is a lot we can learn both from Microsoft's success and failures in moving towards Scrum, Agile, & Continuous Delivery."
