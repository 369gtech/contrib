description: 'When users make millions request to your site every single performance bottleneck could present a serious problem. Every millisecond becomes critical for your service stability. Where the line between premature optimization and neccessary adjustments should be drawn? This session is intended to share and discuss common mistakes and antipatterns causing performance degradation. There will be given examples on how to achieve better performance both from WebApi prospective (.Net) and the database layer. We will also discuss how to test and estimate your service performance with k6 before going live to production. The talk is intended for backend developers primarily and is based on work done for yr.no - norwegian weather forecast service used worldwide with more than 10 millions unique users per week.'
