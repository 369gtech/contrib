description: "Developers use to study and talk about DDD usage, but many people haven't had an opportunity to see DDD used in practice.\nDuring my session, I will present how Hapag-Lioyd used DDD to design and implement its core system Freight Information System in Java technology, and why DDD is the best choice in this context.\nI will also present how a developer can use the event storming technique for application design.  \n\nPrezentacja miała miejsce 26.01.2021"
