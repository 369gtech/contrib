description: "\"Speaker: Christy Heaton\n\nMaps are powerful tools that we use every day. Python is well-equipped to handle spatial data and with well documented robust libraries to help you perform spatial analysis and create beautiful maps. In this talk, we'll discover the fascinating world of spatial analysis by solving a fun problem: where can we go to see an upcoming solar eclipse? Along the way we'll learn about mapping topics like projections and coordinate systems, best practices for map making, and intricacies of spatial data.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
