Our portfolio is composed of luxury and fashion-oriented brands, like Vogue, GQ, Wired, Glamour and many more. Condé Nast International is a digital-first company, targeting to migrate 34 out of 62 existing websites to the Kubernetes clusters across the globe.  Kubernetes underpins Condé Nast International's entire infrastructure, and Helm is used as the de facto deployment package manager. These two components were critical for the delivery of the highest developer experience.  In time, the development teams became self-sufficient and started to contribute to the base Helm charts instead of going the feature requests route. This created a substantial and agile environment for developers, being able to instigate changes and contribute to the internal developer community. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaXL"
