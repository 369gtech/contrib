description: "This session looks at invokedynamic, a Java 7 feature that has had the most impact at the bytecode level and also in terms of performance. First perceived as a feature to help dynamically typed languages on the JVM, it has turned into a powerful feature that has been exploited quite a bit in the implementation of features in the Java language itself. The presentation details what problems this feature really solves and how it has influenced other features in the Java language and on the Java platform.\n\n\nAuthor:\nVenkat Subramaniam\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., and an instructional professor at the University of Houston.\n\nHe has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences.
