description: "Joe Beda, principal engineer at VMware and Kubernetes co-founder, will kick off this packed 60-minute session by emphasizing how to make the most of Kubernetes. And then we’ll get into the details with demos:\n\nLearn how Kubernetes has been embedded in vSphere 7 with Kubernetes to make our flagship offering even more powerful.\nSee how enterprises will manage tens or hundreds of Kubernetes clusters with Tanzu Mission Control across clouds.\nUnderstand how development teams will drive code into production in a fraction of the time using Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes.\n \nThat’s how we’re putting Kubernetes to full effect for our customers."
