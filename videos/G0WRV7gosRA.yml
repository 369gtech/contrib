description: "Computer security is now a public policy issue. Election security, blockchain, \"going dark,\" the vulnerabilities equities debate, IoT safety , data privacy, algorithmic security and fairness, critical infrastructure: these are all important public policy issues with a strong Internet security component. But while an understanding of the technology involved is fundamental to crafting good policy, there is little involvement of technologists in policy discussions. This is not sustainable. We need public-interest technologists: people from our fields helping craft policy, and working to provide security to agencies and groups working in the broader public interest. We need these people in government, at NGOs, teaching at universities, as part of the press, and inside private companies. This is increasingly critical to both public safety and overall social welfare. This talk both describes the current state of public-interest technology, and offers a way forward for us individually and collectively for our field. The defining policy question of the Internet age is this: How much of our lives should be governed by technology, and under what terms? We need to be involved in that debate.\n\nBruce Schneier\nBruce Schneier is an internationally renowned security technologist, called a \"security guru\" by the Economist. He is the author of 14 books—including the New York Times best-seller \"Click Here to Kill Everybody\"—as well as hundreds of articles, essays, and academic papers. His influential newsletter \"Crypto-Gram\" and blog \"Schneier on Security\" are read by over 250,000 people. Schneier is a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University; a Lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School; a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, AccessNow, and the Tor Project; and an advisory board member of EPIC and VerifiedVoting.org. He is also a special advisor to IBM Security.\n\nTwitter: @schneierblog\nWebsite: https://www.schneier.com"
