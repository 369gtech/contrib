title: 'Data science at scale using Apache Flink: Dynamic model serving and real-time feature generation'
recordingDate: 1604322501
description: "While developing Machine learning models to solve Fraud detection, delivery address autocompletes, user identity detection, etc. we faced different challenges. One of the major challenges was the real-time feature generation and dynamic ML model serving in real-time at scale.\n\nFor achieving this in real-time and on the high scale we developed our Data intelligent platform \"Mitra\". It’s based on Kappa+ architecture where we process all data on streams. Our core engine is based on Apache Flink with Kafka as a data queue and Rocksdb as in-memory states. We use Kafka for both Data flow and as a control stream to send dynamic control signals to our platform. We have a lot of other components in our Mitra platforms like Graph DB, ML Model server, Dynamic rule engine on streams and in-memory data lake\n\nKey features of \"Mitra Platform\" which developed using Apache Flink :\n- Predict results within 200 milliseconds in the distributed environment\n- Generate Hundreds of features on the fly during model serving\n- Serve results from deployed ML models\n- Dynamic rule engine on Flink streams\n\nWe heavily use Flink’s in-memory states, CEP (Complex event processing), broadcast states and Async IO to achieve this. We have more than 60 operators and 40+ in memory states in our Flink application.\n\nFor more info read this blog: https://medium.com/razorpay-unfiltered/data-science-at-scale-using-apache-flink-982cb18848b\n\nOur platform and architecture improved a lot after this blog. It serves 500+ e-commerce companies in India in real-time.mpletes, user identity detection, etc. we faced different challenges.
