In 2016 Bragful project was created.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/manuel-rubio/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MANUEL RUBIO\nPolyglot Developer, Manager and Coach\n\nManuel is a developer since he was 12 years old (26 years ago) and he started with Basic, like others, but later also with Modula-2, Pascal, C, Assembler and these before 20 years old.
