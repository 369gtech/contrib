title: '"Hey, Python-Web-Community! What''s going on?" - Vibhu Agarwal (PyConline AU 2021)'
recordingDate: 1631471733
description: "(Vibhu Agarwal) Django, Flask or FastAPI, ASGI-WSGI, asynchronous-synchronous, protocol or web server, workers or threads, gunicorn-uvicorn - **What** is going on!? What exactly are these? How do they come along together? Do I even need to know about them?\r\n\r\nDeveloping back-ends for dynamic websites can be done in a lot of different ways, and fortunately, python has a great set of libraries and packages to help us with the implementation. The problem arises when we dive deep and are overwhelmed with the stuff we have at our disposal.\r\n\r\nDuring this talk, we'll try to find answers to the above questions. We'll take a look at the high-level and core features of different parts and understand how they are kept compatible with each other to bring out a fantastic web ecosystem.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2021/talk/BWN9BP/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the countryâ€™s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nSat Sep 11 15:30:00 2021 at Curlyboi Theatre"
