We’ve experimented and successfully introduced some creative approaches to focus on this. Come learn about how we're building a global network of Dojo’s as well as using gamification and a little competition to empower this transformation.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
