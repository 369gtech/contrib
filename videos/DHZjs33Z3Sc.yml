title: 'Victor Kropp - Async programming in Kotlin with coroutines'
language: English
recordingDate: 1532267038
description: 'Most modern applications are working asynchronously. Some programming languages even have built-in support for writing asynchronous code, like async/await in C# or Python. Kotlin 1.1 introduced a concept of suspendable functions also known as coroutines, which allowed supporting async/await as primitives defined in libraries, not as built-in language constructs. Let''s see how Kotlin coroutines can help us make asynchronous code easy to write and understand.'
