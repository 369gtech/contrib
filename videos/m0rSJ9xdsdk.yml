description: "What do we talk about when we talk about Clojure?\nWe love to talk about its simplicity, its functional roots, its elegance, and we are right;\nbut so is everyone else, praising their favorite technology.\nBootleg has to be pushed, luxury designer brands are sought after;\ndemonstrate that elegance and power in terms that everyone understand: solving domain problems better than everyone else,\nand give people a reason to ask “how did you do that” first.\nI present the who, what, why, how, and when of Clojure in the context everyone’s talking about: Artificial Intellignce.\nI hope to fill some of that gap by developing several software libraries and writing a book series Interactive Programming for Artificial Intelligence."
