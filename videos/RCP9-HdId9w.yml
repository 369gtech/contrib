title: 'Introduction to Flink in 30 minutes'
recordingDate: 1635787806
description: "This talk is for everyone looking for an overall introduction to Apache Flink and the big ideas that make it special. Along the way, we'll explain what use cases can be tackled, show you how to choose an API, and share the resources we've found most helpful for getting started. In particular, we'll cover the key organizing principles that make it possible for Flink to deliver high performance, robust stream processing, at scale, and we will answer questions like these:\n\nIs Flink appropriate for my use case?\nWhat does it mean that Flink unifies batch and stream processing?\nWhat does \"exactly once\" mean, and why should I care?\nHow do I choose between the DataStream, Flink SQL, and Stateful Functions APIs?\nWhat are Watermarks?\nWhat are the best resources for getting started quickly?"
