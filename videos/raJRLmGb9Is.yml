description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nMaking the Most Out of Kubernetes Audit Logs - Laurent Bernaille & Robert Boll, Datadog \n\nThe Kubernetes audit logs are a rich source of information: all of the calls made to the API server are stored, along with additional metadata such as usernames, timings, and source IPs. They help to answer questions such as “What is overloading my control plane?” or “Which sequence of events led to this problematic situation?”. These questions are hard to answer otherwise—especially in large clusters. At Datadog, we have been running clusters with 1000+ nodes for more than a year and during that time, the audit logs have proved invaluable.    In this talk, we will first introduce the audit logs, explain how they are configured, and review the type of data they store. We will then demo a functioning setup and show a few different types of analysis techniques. Finally, we will describe in detail several scenarios where they have helped us to diagnose complex problems. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uab7"
