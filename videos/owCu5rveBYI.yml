description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nThe BEAM is the standard Erlang implementation in use today. It was specially designed just to run Erlang. We will make a quick tour of the BEAM visiting the major sights to see what it looks like internally and how it functions. There will be no need of a towel on this short tour."
