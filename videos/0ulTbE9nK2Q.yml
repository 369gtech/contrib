description: "EmpowerUs, sponsored by Chronosphere - Moderator: Heather Joslyn; Speakers: Aparna Dhinakaran, Elenore Bastian, Sophia Vargas, Colleen Coll\n\nAttendees who identify as women, non-binary individuals and allies are invited to join this special event and program, sponsored by Chronosphere. With women and non-binary individuals being minorities in tech, itâ€™s especially important for these groups to know how to drive influence and gain respect and notoriety amongst their male peers. We will ask questions to our panelists (all women or non-binary) about how they have overcome the challenges of being a minority within their space, and how they have been able to avoid imposter syndrome."
