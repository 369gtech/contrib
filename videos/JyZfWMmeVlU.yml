Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nUse Your Favorite Developer Tools in Kubernetes With Telepresence - Abhay Saxena, Datawire \n\nAre you new to building cloud-native applications? As an engineer, it can be a tough transition if you're used to a quick inner development loop. With the overhead of image build/push/pull, the ability to see your code changes in action immediately probably seems impossible. But Telepresence can help! And it works well with many of the tools you're using already.    In this talk Abhay Saxena will demonstrate how to use Telepresence with some popular IDEs and debuggers, including VSCode for Node and Rust services, IntelliJ for a Java service, as well as some command-line examples with Delve for a Go service and Pdb for a Python service. Abhay will also look at how to get Telepresence to play well with Kubernetes client libraries and sidecar containers. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaeA"
