description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIntro: CNCF SIG Storage – An Intro to Cloud Native Storage - Alex Chircop, StorageOS & Erin Boyd, Red Hat \n\nThe CNCF SIG Storage (https://github.com/cncf/sig-storage) collaborates to explore and understand how different storage technologies are used in cloud-native environments. Topics include block stores, file systems, object stores, key-value stores and databases, amongst others. Different architectural approaches (centralized, distributed, sharded etc) are compared in terms of key attributes like availability, scalability, performance, data consistency, durability, fault tolerance, ease of development and operational complexity. In the intro, we'll provide an overview of the work currently underway and on the roadmap. You'll get the meet the people leading these efforts, and find out how best to get involved and contribute. We'll present our work thus far, and host discussions around the findings of how cloud native storage is approached in the real world, including some representative successes and failures. Our hope is that others can learn from, and expand upon those experiences. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpAk"
