description: "During the first part of this exclusive webcast event we welcome Eric Ries (@ericries) author of New York Times bestseller \"The Lean Startup\" for a fireside chat with Ash Maurya (@ashmaurya) author of Running Lean to learn the story behind \"Running Lean\" and how the material was chosen for the book.\n\nWhile running experiments is a key activity in a Lean Startup, running effective experiments that lead to breakthrough insights is still considered more art than science.\n\nAt the earliest stages of the product lifecycle, when we have relatively few customers, we struggle with making sense of seemingly small scale and qualitative customer feedback.\n\nEven though the mechanics of running experiments are quite straightforward, most lean practitioners fail to run effective experiments.\n\nIn this webcast talk, Ash Maurya will teach you how to avoid these pitfalls and instead use a systems approach to craft the right next experiment no matter the stage of your product.\n\nAbout Ash Maurya\n\nAsh Maurya (@ashmaurya) is the founder of USERcycle. Since bootstrapping his last company seven years ago, he has launched five products and one peer-to-web application framework. Throughout this time he has been in search of better, faster ways for building successful products. Ash has more recently been rigorously applying Customer Development and Lean Startup techniques to his products, which he frequently writes about on his blog ashmaurya.com, and which turned into a book: Running Lean. \n\nAbout Eric Ries\n\nEric Ries is an entrepreneur and author of the New York Times bestseller 'The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Business' published by Crown Business. The Lean Startup methodology has been written about in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Harvard Business Review, Inc., Wired, Fast Company, and countless blogs. \n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
