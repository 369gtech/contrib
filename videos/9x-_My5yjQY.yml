description: "Check out https://g.co/aiexperiments to learn more.\n\nSounds are complex and vary widely. This experiment uses machine learning to organize thousands of everyday sounds. The computer wasn’t given any descriptions or tags – only the audio. Using a technique called t-SNE, the computer placed similar sounds closer together. You can use the map to explore neighborhoods of similar sounds and even make beats using the drum sequencer. http://g.co/aiexperiments\n\nBuilt by Kyle McDonald, Manny Tan, Yotam Mann, and friends at Google Creative Lab. Thanks to the London Philharmonia for contributing some sounds to this project. t-SNE animation featured in video by Gene Kogan.\n\nMore resources:\nhttps://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne\nhttp://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/make_music\nhttp://ml4a.github.io"
