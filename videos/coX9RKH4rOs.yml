title: '"Function Passing Style: Typed, Distributed Functional Programming" by Heather Miller'
language: English
recordingDate: 1411324461
description: "TLDR; Asynchronously pass safe functions to distributed, stationary, immutable data in a stateless container. Plus, use lazy combinators to eliminate intermediate data structures.\n\nThe functional programming paradigm nicely fits problems in distributed programming. For example, moving computation to data can achieve multi-fold improvements in latency and throughput of big-data-style applications.\n\nThis talk presents a new paradigm of “Function-Passing” as an effective means of asynchronous and distributed programming. By bringing together recent advances in type systems research and new language features in Scala, this paradigm promotes new patterns of programming in distributed environments using distributable lambdas and types.\n\n\n\nHeather Miller"
