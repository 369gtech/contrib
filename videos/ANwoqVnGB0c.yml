description: 'VC Paul Kedrosky and Tim O''Reilly, CEO of O''Reilly Media, Inc. discuss how the Web 2.0 wave is slamming into Wall Street. Sharing and social networks that once seemed antithetical to the zero-sum world of money are finding their places in investing. From social stock-picking, to new and tradable web-based data, to search, all of these Web 2.0 technologies are showing up on Wall Street. At the same time, Wall Street is pushing the edge in technologies in areas ranging from realtime to databases. The confluence of money and technology is changing both, and there is a lot to learn on either side. This talk will set the stage for the next two days of discussions.'
