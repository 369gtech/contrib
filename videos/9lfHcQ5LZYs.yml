title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Wait, there are 35 Symfony Components? What Cool Stuff am I Missing?'
recordingDate: 1493227357
description: "What is Symfony *really*? It's a collection of *35* independent libraries, and\nDrupal uses less than *half* of them! That means that there's a *ton* of other\ngood stuff that you can bring into your project to solve common problems... as\nlong as you know how, and what those components do!\n\nIn this talk, we'll have some fun: taking a tour of the Symfony components, how\nto install them (into Drupal, or anywhere) and how to use some of my *favorite*,\nlesser-known components. By the end, you'll have a better appreciation of what\nSymfony *really* is, and some new tools to use immediately."
