description: "The elapsed time for a change made by a developer to reach a customer can now be measured in days or even hours, causing many fundamental changes to software development models. Continuous deployment is a software engineering process where incremental software changes are automatically tested, and frequently deployed to production environments. Continuous deployment was born out of a need to reduce the overhead, to increase the speed of deployment, and to decrease the technical challenge of replicating the production environment for the purposes of testing. To study this new process, a one-day Continuous Deployment Summit was held at the Facebook campus in July 2015. The Summit attended by one person from 10 companies, and facilitated by three researchers from North Carolina State University. These companies were: Cisco, Facebook, Google, IBM, LexisNexis, Microsoft, Mozilla, Netflix, Red Hat, and SAS. The purpose of the Summit was to share best practices and challenges in transitioning to the use of continuous deployment practices. This talk will present the highlights of the Continuous Deployment Summit.\n\nSpeaker: Laurie Williams, North Carolina State University\n\nLaurie Williams is the Associate Department Head of Computer Science and a Professor in the Computer Science Department at North Carolina State University (NCSU).
