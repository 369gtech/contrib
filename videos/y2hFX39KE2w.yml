language: English
recordingDate: 1634065835
description: "10 Lessons Learned in 10 Years of SRE\n\nAndrea Spadaccini, Microsoft Azure\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss some key principles and lessons learned that I've developed and refined in more than 10 years of experience as a Site Reliability Engineer across several teams within Google and Microsoft.\n\nThese are topics that often come up as I discuss Site Reliability Engineering with Microsoft customers that are at different stages of their own SRE journey, and that they—hopefully!—find insightful. They broadly belong to the areas of \"Starting SRE\" and \"Steady-state SRE.\"\n\nPlease join us if you want to discuss fundamental principles of adopting SRE, want to listen to my mistakes (so you can avoid making them!), and want to compare notes on different ways of doing SRE.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
