description: "We're going to use logistic regression to predict if someone has diabetes or not given 3 body metrics! We'll use Newton's method to help us optimize the model. We'll use a bit from all the mathematical disciplines i've mentioned (calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, statistics). \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/logistic_regression_newtons_method\n\nPlease subscribe!
