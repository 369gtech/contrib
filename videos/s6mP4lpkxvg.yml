title: 'Cloud Native Streaming and Event-Driven Microservices by Marius Bogoevici'

recordingDate: 1478851915
description: "The future of scalable data processing is event-driven microservices! They provide a powerful paradigm that provides solutions for problems typical for distributed applications, such as availability, data consistency, or communication complexity. The also allow the creation of sophisticated and extensible data processing pipelines, and bridge the gap between big data and the more traditional enterprise integration world.\n\nSpring Cloud Stream is a framework for creating event-driven microservices, building on the ease of development and execution of Spring Boot, the cloud native capabilities of Spring Cloud, and the message-driven programming model of Spring Integration, using messaging platforms such as RabbitMQ or Kafka. Complementary, Spring Cloud Data Flow is the orchestration layer that makes it easy to deploy and manage sophisticated data pipelines consisting of microservices, through a pluggable SPI that allows it to coordinate them across a variety of platforms such as YARN, Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes or Mesos. Via live coding, we will demonstrate how to use both to create complex data processing pipelines that bridge the world of big data and enterprise integration together.\n\nMarius Bogoevici is a software engineer at Pivotal, leading Spring Cloud Stream, and working on Spring Cloud Data Flow, Spring XD, and other Spring projects. Marius has an experience of 15+ years of software development, a significant part of it being spent developing open source software. Marius is co-author of \"Spring Integration in Action\" (Manning, 2012).\n\n[HQK-8232]"
