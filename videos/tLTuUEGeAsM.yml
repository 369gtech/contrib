title: 'The Empowerment Journey - Aviva Peisach (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1512392591
description: "As a woman in a man's world, Aviva tends to push away any gender related reference, assuming that if we treat everyone as equals, equality will prevail. And, if you're good at what you do, and work hard, you’ll succeed regardless. If this was true though, why are there less women than men in the high tech industry? \n\nThis talk is a journey within a journey - Aviva talks about studies on the confidence gap between men and women, how this gap affects our life, and may even prevent us from speaking up, promoting ourselves or applying for our next exciting job. Aviva teaches us how to embrace the confidence gap and make it our strength, rather than our weakness. \n\nShe shares her secret empowerment toolkit which will help you turn the confidence gap into a “call for action” rather than a road block. Lots of things need to change in order to make our industry a truly equal and diverse one; education, stereotype shifts, awareness, organizations focus and more. \n\nHer hope is to promote change by making our journey to success and empowerment a little bit easier. Enjoy!"
