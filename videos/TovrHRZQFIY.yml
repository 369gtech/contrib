title: 'Guerilla Scala Programming at eBay'
recordingDate: 1371578677
description: "In the last few years, Scala and Scoobi have become the standard infrastructure at eBay. That's due in part to Alex Cozzi, a member of their Search Sciences Team, who visited SF Scala to talk about his experience using the language and framework to develop MapReduce programs on Hadoop at eBay.\n\nThis is a fun talk connecting advanced languages, big data, and a website with a long history. Alex also gives you a few good reasons for bringing Scala to a startup near you.\n\n**Take your next step to programming with Scala: http://marakana.com/training/scala/"
