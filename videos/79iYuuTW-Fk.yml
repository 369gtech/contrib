description: 'The browser is a window into a vast, unlimited world. But what about we don''t just peek into a flat, page-based world, but into a space with depth? What can we build with that? And now that our browser is the portal to a space, how can we immerse ourselves into it, rather than stare into it from the outside? And maybe we can link this world inside our browser to our real world as well? This talk explores the possibilities technologies such as Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality by using WebGL and Javascript to extend and enhance the web beyond the flat browser window.'
