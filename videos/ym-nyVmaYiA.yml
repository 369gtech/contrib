It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. \nThe frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.\n\nThis video gives you a brief insight of Apriori algorithm.\n\nRelated Blogs:\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/introduction-to-clustering-in-mahout/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=apriori-algo\n\nhttp://www.edureka.co/blog/k-means-clustering/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=apriori-algo\n\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would prefer a hassle free and self paced learning \nenvironment, accessible from any part of the world. \n\nThe topics related to ‘Apriori Algorithm’ have extensively been covered in our course ‘Machine Learning with Mahout’.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co \nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
