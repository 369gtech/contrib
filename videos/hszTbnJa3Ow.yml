description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\n提高 FUSE 文件系统的性能和可靠性 | Improve FUSE Filesystem Performance and Reliability - Tao Peng, Ant Group\n\nFUSE（用户空间文件系统）因其实现简单和易于部署而被广泛采用。然而，由于其用户——内核空间的分离设计，其在用户和内核空间之间引入了额外的数据副本。FUSE 用户空间守护进程也更容易出现故障。本演讲将介绍 Linux 内核社区正在讨论的一些最新改进措施。通过这些改进措施，FUSE 文件系统可在向应用程序发送本地数据时绕过用户空间守护进程。这极大地提高了 FUSE 文件系统的性能，使其可与原生内核文件系统相媲美。此外还引入了通用文件描述符存储，可助力 FUSE 用户空间守护进程实现热升级和紧急故障转移，从而大大提高 FUSE 文件系统的可靠性。\n\nFUSE (Filesystem in UserSpacE) is widely adopted for its implementation simplicity and ease of deployment. However, due to its user-kernel space separation design, it introduces extra data copy between user and kernel spaces. The FUSE userspace daemon is more prone to failures too. The talk will present some latest improvements being discussed in the Linux kernel community. With these improvements, FUSE filesystems can bypass the userspace daemon when sending local data to applications. It hugely improves FUSE filesystem performance, making it comparable with native kernel filesystems. A generic file descriptor storage is also introduced to help FUSE userspace daemons to implement hot-upgrade and panic-failover, and thus greatly improves FUSE filesystem reliability."
