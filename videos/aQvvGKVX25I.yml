description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe SAME Project: A Cloud Native Approach to Reproducible Machine Learning - David Aronchick, Microsoft\n\nWe live in a time of both feast and famine in machine learning. Large organizations are publishing state-of-the-art models at an ever-increasing rate but the average data scientist face daunting challenges to reproduce the results themselves. Even in the best cases, where a newly forked code runs without syntax errors (often not the case), this only solves a part of the problem as the pipelines used to run the models are often completely excluded. The Self-Assembling Machine Learning Environment (SAME) project is a new Kubernetes and Kubeflow project and community around a common goal: creating tooling that allows for quick ramp-up, seamless collaboration and efficient scaling. This talk will discuss our initial public release, done in collaboration with data scientists from across the spectrum, where we are going next and how people can use our learnings in their own practices."
