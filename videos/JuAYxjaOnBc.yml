recordingDate: 1433505514
description: "GroovyFX is an API that makes working with JavaFX in Groovy much simpler and more natural to those well versed in Groovy. GroovyFX is focused on leveraging the Builder pattern for JavaFX applications, but—more than that—it leverages some of the DSL capabilities Groovy provides and makes the Groovy-based JavaFX 2.0 code easier to write and—just as important—easier to read. For example, JavaFX 2.0 colors can be set with pseudovariables, such as red or blue. The primary goal of GroovyFX is to make JavaFX development simpler and more concise than what it is in Java. Come to this session to hear the primary contributors discuss this exciting new open source project.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDierk Koenig\nDierk König (JavaOne Rock Star) works as a fellow for Canoo Engineering AG, Basel, Switzerland.\nHe is a committer to many open-source projects including OpenDolphin, Groovy, Grails, GPars and GroovyFX.\nHe is lead author of the \"Groovy in Action\" book, which is among the publisher's best-selling titles of the decade.\nView more trainings by Dierk Koenig at https://www.parleys.com/author/dierk-koenig\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
