description: "Speaker(s): Venkatesh Duggirala (Bangalore)\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nThe MySQL Group Replication feature is a multi-master update anywhere replication plugin for MySQL with built-in conflict detection and resolution, automatic distributed recovery, and group membership. MySQL released GA version of Group Replication plugin on Dec 12 2012 (MySQL 5.7.17).MySQL Group Replication provides distributed state machine replication with strong coordination between servers. Servers coordinate themselves automatically when they are part of the same group. The group can operate in a single-primary mode with automatic primary election, where only one server accepts updates at a time. Alternatively, for more advanced users the group can be deployed in multi-primary mode, where all servers can accept updates, even if they are issued concurrently. There is a built-in group membership service that keeps the view of the group consistent and available for all servers at any given point in time.\r\n\r\n(Type: Talk | Track: Database - MySQL Day | Room: Curie & Hershel (Floor 2))\r\n\r\nEvent Page: http://2017.fossasia.org\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/5L44/"
