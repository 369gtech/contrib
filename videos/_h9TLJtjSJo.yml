title: 'Mike Anderson - Enter the Matrix'
recordingDate: 1389033481
description: "core.matrix is the new API for numerical computing, designed to make Clojure a first class language for data science. core.matrix was inspired in part by discussions about the need for a common matrix API at last year's Clojure Conj. The talk will highlight why vector / matrix maths is important for data science, demonstrate how core.matrix makes numerical computing both simple and easy (with live coding examples) and discuss the various design principles and implementation techniques.\n\nMike is a technology consultant and entrepreneur who has been using Clojure for as his main language for over three years. He maintains the core.matrix API for numerical computing, wrote the games \"Ironclad\" and \"Alchemy\" and has contributed several other other open source libraries for Clojure. In his spare time he develops Neural Network technology at Nuroko."
