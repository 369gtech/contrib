Due to its size, simplicity, and fast spin up, thousands of users are currently running k3s in various use cases besides the edge. Darren Shepherd will cover in depth how k3s is built, what changes are made, and how the benefits of k3s are achieved. The technical details about how k3s is packaged as a single binary, how sqlite was added as a data source, how certs are managed, how HA is achieved, how agent tunneling works and much more. Finally, Darren will discuss how these changes are made while still being a fully certified CNCF Kubernetes distribution. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaa0"
