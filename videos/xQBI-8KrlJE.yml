title: 'MessageBus: A High-Level Async Buffer-Based API for TCP/UDP/SDP/InfiniBand'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433233428
description: "Distributed computing is becoming the norm. Distributed applications such as Memcached and Coherence generally rely on a platform’s synchronous streaming transports (such as TCP, UDP, or SDP) to distribute data. MessageBus provides an asynchronous ByteBuffer-based reliable Java API that enables distributed apps to run on Internet Protocol (IP)–based as well as InfiniBand-based platforms. This presentation quantifies gains in InfiniBand-based environments and reports no loss of performance in IP-based environments (compared to writing directly to IP APIs). The main idea is that an application written to the MessageBus API will work on typical transports and get great latency and bandwidth improvements when deployed in InfiniBand environments.\n\n\nAuthor:\nHarold Carr\nundefined\nView more trainings by Harold Carr at https://www.parleys.com/author/harold-carr\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
