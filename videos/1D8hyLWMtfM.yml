description: "In this presentation, I will show you how to combine Apache Ignite with Docker to not only build an event-driven microservice platform but also to make this dynamically re-configurable without any downtime at all.\n\nThe pre-requisites for the platform are banking grade NFRs such as Exactly Once Processing of requests, High Availability -even in case of data center disasters- and no downtime ever. For this, all containers are linked in one big software-defined network in which the contained services form one big distributed grid, and in which new services register themselves during deploy time and are auto-discovered by the grid to process requests.\n\n# Sven Beauprez\nSven Beauprez is architect at The Glue, a fintech startup that develops a platform for financial institutions to quickly develop innovative financial services.
