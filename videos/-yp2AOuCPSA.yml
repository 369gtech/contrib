language: English
recordingDate: 1588196046
description: "We know that team-based software delivery can be very effective, but how can we promote and enable team-based approaches in a “remote-first world”? What should teams think about and what patterns can teams adopt to be effective when no one is in the office?\n\nAddressing how to address remote interactions between teams that need to work together remotely is critical for success in this new world. Moving from the physical to the online world can further expose pre-existing team interaction issues, increase wait times, and slow down delivery if left unchecked.\n\nBased on the ideas from the book Team Topologies, authors Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton will present some useful approaches to clarify and evolve inter-team interactions and communication in this remote-first world. \n\nFor more information about Team Topologies: itrevolution.com/team-topologies/\n\nFor all the resources from this presentation: http://teamtopologies.com/remote-first\nFor training: https://teamtopologies.com/training\nFor assessments: https://teamtopologies.com/assessments"
