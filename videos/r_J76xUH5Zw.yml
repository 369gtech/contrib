description: "In this talk I'd like to show You the biggest advantages of Kotlin - a great new programming language for JVM, Web & Native.\n\nI use it for over two years now, and I simply love its readability, elegant solutions of Java’s biggest issues, and vast amount of features that we won’t see in Java anytime soon…\n\nDuring this talk You'll learn about Kotlin's main characteristics (e.g. null-safety), seamless Java interop, greatest features (e.g. extensions, data classes) etc.\n\nBut, most importantly, you'll see that Kotlin is easy to learn and makes you more productive and satisfied as a developer :)"
