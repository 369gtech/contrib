description: "When IT Closes the Deal\n\nBrandon Holcomb, VP Technology, Global Platforms at Equifax, Equifax Inc.\nAndy Cooper, SVP, Technology, Global Platform Services, Equifax Inc.\n\nDescription:\nEquifax powers the financial future of individuals and organizations around the world. Using the combined strength of unique trusted data, technology and innovative analytics, Equifax has grown from a consumer credit company into a leading provider of insights and knowledge that helps its customers make informed decisions.\n\nDelivering on that trust requires both business and technical operations excellence. Faced with the growing challenges of the modern marketplace, the Equifax IT organization embarked on a top-to-bottom cultural and technical transformation. This presentation will outline how the Equifax IT team has taken steps towards transforming itself into a nimble, efficient and internally-capable organization. Topics will include key management lessons learned, budget realignment, creating partnerships across organizational boundaries and strategic projects to focus the organization’s transformation efforts. The early results? IT is no longer viewed as a liability to the business, instead IT is now an asset – a strategic partner that is actively helping to close deals.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
