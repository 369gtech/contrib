description: "The Consilience Of Networking and Computing\n\nDinesh G Dutt, Chief Scientist, Cumulus Networks\n\nHistorically, networking and computing have approached similar or sometimes even the same problems very differently. Consequently, network & server admins, and network & application developers have spoken different languages and inhabited different worlds. This has led to an inability for each to leverage the solutions of the other, whether it be simple package management, configuration and monitoring or even more advanced areas. Through real-life examples, this talk will show the discrepancies, solutions that can be commonly adapted across the two worlds, and a new breed of solutions that are a result of the consilience between networking and computing.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
