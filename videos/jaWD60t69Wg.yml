Building test infrastructure is hard. Working cross-platform is hard. Combine the three and you have a recipe for disaster. In this talk, Dan Giovannelli will share his experiences working on a cross-platform mobile test infrastructure project. He'll discuss the things that went right, the things that went (very) wrong, and what he wishes now he knew starting out. Come for insights on designing mobile tools for non-mobile engineers, stay to find out just what the heck The Matrix is and how to beat it at its own game."
