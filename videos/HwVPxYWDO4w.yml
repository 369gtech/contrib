description: "\"The Mythology of Big Data\"\n\nMark Madsen \n\nAnalyst, Third Nature\n\nMark spent the past two decades working on analysis and decision support projects in many industries. He is the founder of Third Nature, a research and consulting firm focused on emerging technology and practices in analytics, BI and information management. Mark is also an award-winning former CTO and consultant who frequently speaks at US and European conferences.\n\nI focus on two types of work: using data to make decisions and manage organizations, and building data technology infrastructure. I've spent the past two decades working on analysis, performance management and decision support projects. A big part of making decisions and using data in a corporate setting is ensuring that the right data capture and data delivery infrastructure is in place to manage the business. As a result, I do as much information strategy and IT architecture work as I do performance management and decision support.\n\nYou can reach me via Twitter as @markmadsen or via Thirdnature.net"
