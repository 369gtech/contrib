title: 'Building Connected Azure Apps with Xamarin - Richard Hopkins & Mike James'
recordingDate: 1493363504
description: "Creating a connected mobile application requires some form of backend infrastructure.\nIn this session, we will demonstrate how you can re-use your existing .NET/C# skills, or gain a straightforward introduction to building out a simple cross-platform, native mobile application with Xamarin and hook it up to cloud services in Azure. By integrating the easy to configure Azure client SDKs into your app, and leveraging the Azure Mobile App Service, we will show how app developers can create a powerful end-to-end solution with little or no requirement for server-side development skills."
