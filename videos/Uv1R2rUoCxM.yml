title: 'Webinar: Declaratively managing apps in a multi-cluster world'
language: English
recordingDate: 1600366764
description: "There are lots of tools out there that help us with the config management around deploying apps into Kubernetes clusters. Especially Helm and its Helm charts as well as Helm repositories have established themselves as a widely-used and defacto standard for packaging and distributing apps in the community.\n\nIn this webinar, Fernando, will dive into the open-source tool app-operator (and its sibling chart-operator), which build on Helm and offer platform teams a declarative way to manage apps in fleets of clusters. Fernando, will talk about the reasons an abstraction in the form of simple CRDs can make sense and the ways it can be used for various use cases.\n\nPresenter:\n\nFernando Ripoll, Solution Engineer @Giant Swarm"
