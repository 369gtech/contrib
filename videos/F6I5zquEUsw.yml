title: 'Big Data Processing : Where do we go next ?'
recordingDate: 1635787801
description: 'Batch and Stream Processing models have dominated the world of Big Data processing and been steadily maturing over the last couple decades. There have also been many efforts at unifying them to achieve simpler and more powerful systems. So, are we now in a matured space or is there still room for significant evolution? This talk reexamines fundamentals of these processing models to uncover potential for some major evolution in stream processing. Please join me as I explore "Streaming 2.0", the benefits it can unlock and what it means for batch processing.'
