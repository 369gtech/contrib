description: "The browser needs to get faster. The first browser was created almost 30 years ago. Since then, the browser has moved from its past as a simple document viewer towards a future as a fully-featured application platform. But those applications are testing the limits of current browsers, especially on devices like smartphones. To support those applications, browsers need to adapt to modern hardware.\n\nIn this talk, Lin explains how the browser works today. Sheâ€™ll share what browser vendors need to do over the next few years to ensure their browsers (and the web itself) meet the upcoming demands.\n\nEVENT: btconfBER2017\n\nSPEAKER: Lin Clark\n\nPERMISSIONS: Coding Tech received permissions to republish this video from the event organizer.\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwXLYoUj8J4"
