title: 'Billions of Sensors - The UX Beyond the Screen - Niklas Norin'
recordingDate: 1533203866
description: "Why did we design an Integrated Circuit, IC, in-house from scratch and what made us design our own wireless protocol instead of using [insert buzzword here]?\nWe often hear that the number of connected devices will reach into the tens of billions within just a few years. If you take a moment and try to imagine the type of sensor solution, from the actual sensor to the API, that can drive such a tremendous growth, what would it look like?\n\nWhile Cloud Processing and Cloud Storage with built-in extreme scalability is increasingly a commodity, extremely scalable sensor solutions are not. In this talk, I will explore the concrete architectural and design decision, from hardware to API, that we have made to create a scalable sensor solution. To drive my point home, I will briefly touch on everything from graphs of power consumption to wireless network topologies as well as running Docker on embedded devices.\n\nAll of these complex design decisions and compromises need to be made to pave the way for a simple and intuitive user experience outside the screen."
