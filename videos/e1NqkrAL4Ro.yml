description: "Terraform is a tool for defining, creating and changing versioned infrastructure in a safe and efficient way. The tool lets you define infrastructure using a simple JSON-like syntax, and services from different cloud providers, both public and private, can be combined to create advanced setups.\n\nShowcasing most of the standard features found i Terraform, I'll create a rather complex infrastructure in Azure and combine it with resources found with other cloud providers. Expect lots of live demos!"
