description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nStefan Tilkov - SOA & REST Authority, innoQ Founder\n\nABSTRACT\nWhy would anybody want to use more than one programming language? Or why would anyone accept being stuck with just one? In this session, we'll explore what makes programming languages equal and what makes them different (including paradigms, typing strategy, verbosity, ecosystems and politics), and what your strategy for dealing with conservative and progressive forces within your organization should be. Some real-world experience will be thrown in for good measure.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
