recordingDate: 1589493000
description: "Traps and Cookies\n\nTanya Reilly, Google\n\nDoes your production environment expect perfect humans? Does technical debt turn your small changes into minefields? This talk highlights tools, code, configuration, and documentation that set us up for disaster. It discusses commons traps that we can disarm and remove, instead of spending precious brain cycles avoiding them. And it offers practical advice for sending your future self (and future coworkers!) little gifts, instead of post-mortems that just say “human error :-(”. Includes stories of preventable outages. Bring your schadenfreude.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
