description: "Avoiding Tainted Tenant Apps with Staging Gates and Electric Fences - Bret Mogilefsky, 18F\n\nYou've deployed Cloud Foundry and now your tenant applications are unable to mess with each other. Mission accomplished, right? Not if you're the government! In this session, we'll describe how the cloud.gov team used Cloud Foundry's multi-buildpack feature to scan for CVEs during staging, and used kernel tracing to report and optionally restart apps that behave in unexpected ways. \n\nAbout Bret Mogilefsky\nBret Mogilefsky is an Innovation Specialist at 18F, the agile design and development consultancy inside government, for government. Bret leads teams and projects focused on deconstructing the biggest technical hurdles to improving government services. Prior to 18F, Bret was the architect and evangelist for the overall developer experience at PlayStation, and was lead programmer and assistant designer of the legendary adventure game Grim Fandango at LucasArts. Bret lives in Castro Valley, CA with his wife, two kids, nervous pup, indifferent cat, and two ambivalent guinea pigs."
