language: English
recordingDate: 1598238099
description: 'One of the most important parts of avionic systems is the communication. Airplanes use mobile communication to connect to stations on the ground. In many cases the connection is based on LTE-Advanced technology and in some cases when an airplane is on the seas or somewhere else that there is no base station on the ground, It uses the satellite as a hub. In this presentation I will explain vulnerabilities and ways to take advantage of A2G systems and other avionic components.'
