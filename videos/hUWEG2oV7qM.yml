recordingDate: 1557256733
description: 'Come see how Visual Studio 2019 delivers unprecedented developer productivity through the lens of building the award-winning SeeingAI app. SeeingAI uses C#, ASP.NET Core, Python, Xamarin, and Azure Cognitive Services to build an app which enables the low vision community to harness the power of AI to describe people, text, and objects to navigate the world around them. The team codes on both PC and Mac (with Visual Studio for Mac) and uses Azure DevOps and Application Insights for a tight feedback loop. We will share how we deliver an amazing experience using the latest and greatest tools and developer platforms from Microsoft.'
