description: "Machine learning can have some pretty complicated concepts to grasp if youâ€™re not a data scientist. However, recent developments in tooling make it more and more accessible for developers and people with little or no experience.\n\nOne of these advancements is the ability to now train and run machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, opening this world to front-end developers to learn and experiment.\n\nIn this presentation, we will talk about the different applications, possibilities, tools and resources, as well as show a few examples and demos, so you can get started building your own experiments using machine learning in JavaScript."
