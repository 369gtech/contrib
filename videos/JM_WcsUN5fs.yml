description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tRWUJnGCGMbYjB11koaOukgzD-zNB8MaimeoFPJ2_JQ/edit\n\nIn the era of Docker, big data and microservices it is really important to distribute your applications reasonable across your cluster and keep a good overview of all of your running applications. Because of this, cluster management software like Apache Mesos and DC/OS are very important and popular. In this session we will implement a java based service using spring boot and will start him locally and with docker-compose. Then we will deploy our service to DC/OS and see how easy it is to scale, upgrade, monitor and do other fancy stuff. And the best thing for the demo: We will have a nice UI and super cool CLI."
