title: 'David VÃ¡vra - From Firebase to UI with RxJava'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498676546
description: 'Firebase Realtime Database is an awesome tool which solves offline and sync problems for your app. But it requires flattening your data and your UI needs bits from multiple Firebase paths. RxJava is ideal for this task. Rx examples online are usually too simple - I will show you real-life examples which will help you understand the power of Rx. All code samples will be in Kotlin.'
