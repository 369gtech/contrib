description: "Parth Padgaonkar, Senior Android Developer, August Home\n\nRXJAVA EXTENDED: WRITING YOUR FIRST CUSTOM OPERATOR\nIntermediate / Languages / Talk\n\nRxJava is a fantastically powerful library/framework, and for the vast majority of use cases, you can live happily with FlatMap, TakeUntil, and Debounce. However, there comes a time when you'll need to roll up your sleeves and extend RxJava's functionality. Maybe you want to extend a library or API to make it “reactive” (like Retrofit) -- or maybe you just want to componentize a network connectivity listener to handle your IOExceptions. In either case, you'll need to face your inner reactive demons and write some custom operators. But don’t worry! In this talk, we’ll walk through how to create a small library to bridge MaterialDialogs into the Reactive Streams world. At the end of this talk, you'll have learned how to: implement your first custom operator how NOT to implement custom operators (e.g,. \"just use Observable.create\") avoid memory leaks and other pitfalls in standard + custom RxJava code Note: It is recommended that you have at least a basic understanding of RxJava for this talk. If you know the difference between an Observable and Disposable, you'll be just fine :) (Even if you aren’t 100% sure, come anyway and walk away with some cool RxJava knowledge!)"
