description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\r\nApril 19, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Holden Karnofsky.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nHolden will discuss GiveWell's research on accomplishing as much good as possible with your donations. He will focus on relief efforts for recent disasters as well as everyday international aid, and will leave substantial time for Q&A. \r\n\r\nGiveWell (www.givewell.org) finds outstanding charities and publishes the full details of its analysis to help donors decide where to give. It started as a group of finance professionals trying to do as much good as possible with their personal donations, and since 2007 it has been a full-time independent research group. Its research has attracted attention from Peter Singer (who featured it in his manifesto on giving, The Life You Can Save), Nicholas Kristof (who featured it in Half The Sky), the Hewlett Foundation (a current funder of GiveWell) and media including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, CNN and NPR (see www.givewell.org/press). In 2010, GiveWell tracked over $1.5 million in donations to its recommended charities as a direct result of its research.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Info:\r\n\r\nHolden Karnofsky graduated from Harvard in 2003 with a degree in Social Studies, and spent the next several years in the hedge fund industry. He co-founded GiveWell in 2007."
