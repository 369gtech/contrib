Now I enjoy the luxury of no longer having to get up to turn it on/off when it's too hot, cold or noisy.\n\nIn this talk I will show you how easy it is to give your fan a second life while you are living a more luxurious life.\n\n \nPaco van Beckhoven \nFrom OpenValue\nPerfectionist. Full stack developer. Likes to make things move using code and some electronics. Challenges the world around him."
