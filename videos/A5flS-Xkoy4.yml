description: "Chris Ciborowski - CEO, Nebulaworks\n\nSo you are looking to adopt docker, but receive feedback and commentary such as \"our development pipeline won't support containers\" or \"the applications aren't micro services, so I don't see a benefit.\" You are not alone, these and other statements are common misconceptions when considering using docker in the enterprise. Perhaps having a real enterprise use case with some tips on objection handling would support your goal of adopting docker in your organization? In this presentation, Chris Ciborowski, CEO and Principal Consultant at Nebulaworks and Docker Captain will discuss ways that you can leverage docker in existing enterprise environments providing tangible benefits to both developers and operations teams and accelerate DevOps adoption.
