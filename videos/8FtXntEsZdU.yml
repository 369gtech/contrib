language: English
recordingDate: 1597824045
description: 'The RockYou leak was a big deal back in 2009. 14.3 million unique passwords were leaked to the public domain. This has been a go to list for a number of crackers, but we take it for granted because it was a plaintext leak. We decided to hash the entire list in MD5 and crack it using only candidates that did not originate from the leak for fun.'
