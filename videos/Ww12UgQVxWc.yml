description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://bit.ly/2Pny1MD\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\nAbout a decade ago the mainstream Web stopped at a crossroad: JavaScript or native code? Silverlight was all the rage for a few years but then HTML5 won and Angular/React/Vue—all purely JS frameworks—have become mainstream. Today, Blazor comes up as a possible alternative to Angular/React/Vue and thanks to WebAssembly it opens up the web to be able to take advantage of existing development ecosystems, including .NET. Blazor is, to some extent, a modern attempt to revamp and refine the Silverlight concept—bringing the power of C# to client-side web development. In this session, I’ll discuss the underlying system architecture of an ASP.NET Blazor application and present a few examples."
