description: "Do you still think that Java EE is heavy-weight, cumbersome and doesn’t keep up with modern trends? I’ll show you that there are already production-ready enterprise and opensource solutions to bring more flexibility than the traditional Java EE servers from the past. They strive to provide lightweight and extensible runtimes to power microservices, cloud deployments and reactive architectures already. Their individual efforts are naturally followed by an open collaboration within the MicroProfile project.\n\nI invite you to join the adventure with me and follow the quest for a new generation enterprise Java platform. We will explore what has happened recently in the world of enterprise Java and the features already provided by some interesting open-source projects. Afterward, we will discover what the Eclipse MicroProfile project is, what it can bring to you, and how you can influence it. As a core contributor in the MicroProfile project, I'll provide details about how to get started and what to expect in the near future, all illustrated by live coding and demonstrations.\n\n# Mike Croft\nMike is a support and services engineer for Payara. Mike has spent the last few years specialising in the non-functional aspects of middleware and likes to keep up-to-date with the latest products and solutions for production Java EE.\n\nMike now works for Payara supporting the community's use of Payara Server on GitHub, and supporting customers both remotely and on-site.\n\nMike blogs regularly on the Payara website and would like to stop talking about himself in the third person. http://blog.payara.fish/"
