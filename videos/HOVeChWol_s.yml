title: 'Privacy, Security, Convenience; when it comes to home automation, can we pick all three?'
recordingDate: 1579268107
description: "Ben Dechrai\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/101/\n\nMost of today's home automation products rely heavily on cloud services. This allows us to manage and control our homes from anywhere in the world, by placing the configuration and logic processing in a publicly accessible location and avoiding opening our home network.\r\n\r\nBut as we know, the cloud is just someone else's computer, that we have to trust. If they are the arbiter of what happens in your home, you are not truly in control.\r\n\r\nThis presentation discusses end-to-end encryption, secure claims, network firewalls and segmentation, and a smattering of zero-knowledge theory. You'll hear some of the available options for resolving the connectivity issues and even taking some home-automation devices off-line altogether, without weakening your home network or losing the ability to verify the validity of all operation requests within.\r\n\r\nAs part of an ongoing project to bring these theories to life, this talk includes a live demo of a work-in-progress, custom-built garden irrigation setup.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
