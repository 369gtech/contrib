recordingDate: 1631434951
description: "(Lilly Ryan) Legend has it that a vampire cannot enter a home unless they are invited to do so.\r\n\r\nMuch like vampires, Javascript cannot generally enter your web application unless it is invited in. However, there are many sneaky ways that you may find yourself with ‹s›a vampire‹/s› some Javascript inside your app without realising you've technically allowed it to be there.\r\n\r\nThis session will teach you some common ‹s›incantations‹/s› configurations you can deploy to prevent this from happening.\n\nhttps://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2021/talk/D3WLNR/\n\npython, pycon, australia, programming, conference, technical, pyconline, developers, panel, sessions, libraries, frameworks, community, sysadmins, students, education, data, science\n\nVideos licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0\r\n\r\nPyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.\r\n\r\nPyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\nFri Sep 10 13:30:00 2021 at Snakeoil Academy (Security & Privacy)"
