title: 'GeeCON Prague 2019: M.Salatino - From Java Monolith to K8s:Lessons learned in an Open Source project'
recordingDate: 1579081218
description: 'I was in charge of migrating a monolithic open-source large application written Java to a cloud-native approach running smoothly on Kubernetes. To fully take advantage of the new environment, the architecture was completely redesigned. In this session, I will cover my lessons-learned from that exciting/painful experience and give you some guidance on what going cloud-native could mean for you. I will cover tools around the K8S ecosystem that will help you to sail smoothly to your destination port. A live demo on how it feels to bring an application to Kubernetes â€“ with a hint to the typical pitfalls will be presented.'
