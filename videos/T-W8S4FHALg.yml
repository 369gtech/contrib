description: "Data breaches are the new normal. We’ve created ecosystems with so many moving parts and so many complex units, it’s little wonder that we so frequently see them go wrong. A combination of more systems, more people, more devices and more ways than ever of producing and publishing data stack the odds in favour of attackers breaching more systems than ever.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll get a look inside the world of data breaches based on my experiences dealing with billions of breached records. You’ll see what’s motivating hackers, how they’re gaining access to data and how organisations are dealing with the aftermath of attacks. Most importantly, it will help you contextualise these incidents and understand both what these attacks actually look like and how to defend against them in your organisation.\n\nTroy Hunt is an Australian Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for Developer Security and Author for Pluralsight — a leader in online training for technology and creative professionals. Troy has been building software for browsers since the very early days of the web and possesses an exceptional ability to distill complex subjects into relatable explanations. This has lead Troy to become an industry thought leader in the security space and produce many top-rated courses for Pluralsight. Currently, Troy is heavily involved in Have I been pwned? a free service that aggregates data breaches and helps people establish potential impacts from malicious web activity. Troy blogs regularly about web security and is a frequent speaker at industry conferences and throughout the media to discuss a wide range of technologies.\n\nFor more on YOW!
