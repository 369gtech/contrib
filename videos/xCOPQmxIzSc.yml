description: 'How can our Node.js can be faster? What does faster means? In this journey we would walk through different performance optimization techniques you can apply to your code. We will see start from --v8-options, and we will discover how to leverage what v8 tells us to optimize our code. We will discuss hidden classes, function optimizations and deoptimizations, and inlining. We will discuss the tools and the libraries you can use to do perf analysis on your code. In this journey, we will discover that the main villain is Lord GC, and we will fight him to reclaim our memory!'
