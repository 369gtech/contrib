description: "Speaker: Björn Andersson\n\nDevOps is a word used a lot these days and reading job ads it seems like it's something one person in a team does. It also looks as if I buy the right tools I'm doing DevOps, but is that it?\n\nBjörn is a programmer with lots of strong opinions, weakly held. When he's not busy changing his mind, he builds data products at Spire using data collected from the satellites they build and get launched into orbit.\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/254063930/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: Woo Huiren\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/lR1k/"
