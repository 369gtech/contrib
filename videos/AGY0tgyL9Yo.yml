description: "My talk is going to be about Probot â€” GitHub's framework for creating bots. A bot built with Probot is a NodeJS application that handles GitHub's events. Probot allows us to automate and improve GitHub workflow, extend it with tools that we love as far as we wish.\n\nIn my talk, I will show what Probot can do right now and how you can create your own bot."
