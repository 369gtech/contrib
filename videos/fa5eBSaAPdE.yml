Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nThe New Stack Makers Virtual Pancake Breakfast + Podcast: IT, Developer Strategies, and Open Source - Moderators: Alex Williams, Speakers: Cheryl Hung, Itzik Reich, Nivas Iyer\n\nIt’s pancake time! How do you manage your pancake stack? That’s the question. Well, it has nothing to do with modern applications but those pancakes sure taste good! So what about that app data management? The needs are outpacing the reach of today’s DevSecOps digital transformation plans. Join us for a short stack with The New Stack and the CNCF for this Pancake & Podcast discussion with sponsor Dell Technologies to talk about how DevOps, AppSec and IT teams can best use open source projects and enterprise management tools to enable developers to be free from the overhead of IT demands and keep data secure. \n\nWe’ll look at persistent data and the role developers play with IT now that Kubernetes has emerged as the orchestration engine for at-scale architectures and microservices are taking center stage. Bring your questions for a chance to win a custom TNS spatula!"
