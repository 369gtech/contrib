title: 'React Native Code Reuse: Architecture that Works - Aaron Greenwald'
recordingDate: 1551275514
description: "React Native promises 85% code reuse, but can it really be done? From our experience, YES. Aaron talks about code sharing between iOS and Android, the web, and between multiple projects.\n\nBio:\nBefore mobile development with React Native existed, Aaron architected and built web apps using AngularJS. Now he’s part of the team building Wix’s mobile presence, and is focused on delivering first-class experiences to users who need their business to be mobile. He enjoys talking about React Native and teaching others how to use it."
