description: "It's time to wrap up our series on Firebase and Polymer. In today's episode we'll look at how you can use the polymer-build library to craft a Gulpfile to bundle your Polymer and Firebase resources for production. polymer-build is a really helpful little resource that will take your HTML Imports and split them into individual streams for your CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. You can then pipe these streams to individual gulp tasks to do minification, etc. then use polymer-build to recombine the streams and output the final product.\n\nSample Code: https://github.com/Polymer/polycasts/tree/master/ep60-firebase-build\n\npolymer-build: https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-build\n\nPolycasts playlist: https://goo.gl/r5fsMq \nPolymer Slack: http://bit.ly/polymerslack\n\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers channel: https://goo.gl/OUF4e2"
