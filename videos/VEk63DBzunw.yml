title: 'Running developer''s blog directly from an IDE - hacks and tricks'
recordingDate: 1586857504
description: 'Have you ever experienced starting a new technical blog using one of the most popular blogging platforms and leaving it after writing a single article or two? Have you felt like the initial motivation got lost after a few days or weeks, and getting back on track sounded like mission impossible? Or maybe you have never considered running a blog as an exciting adventure? I hope I can help change your mind. In this presentation, I want to show you an alternative way of running a blog directly from your favorite IDE, using popular tools and techniques that make Open Source projects successful, and hacking your intrinsic motivation to stay on track and continue the journey. You will learn how to start blogging in less than 5 minutes and how to grow incrementally to keep the readers close to you. Last but not least, I will tell my own story of creating a blog where I share my love to Groovy with thousands of readers every week.'
