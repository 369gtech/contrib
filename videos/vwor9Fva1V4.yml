description: "Every product in your home is there as a result of being distributed across whats called a supply chain. The path that a commodity takes through manufacturing, transport, distribution centers, etc. is called the supply chain. The supply chain for most companies is riddled with inefficiencies. Late drivers, bad weather conditions, suboptimal planning, timing issues, the list of things that can go wrong is endless and most of this coordination is done by humans. AI can be used to optimize this entire pipeline, from planning to autonomous transport. In this video i'll demo an app using IBM's Logistic Wizard to optimize a simulated companies supply chain, as well as build a time series forecasting model using Keras to predict the price of a shipment on a certain date. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/AI_Supply_Chain\n\nPlease Subscribe!
