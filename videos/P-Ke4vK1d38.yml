description: "Are you a \"back-end\" developer over in the \"front-end\" world, either dabbling or migrating?\n\nDo you find this side messy and discomforting, or outlandish and fantastic?\n\nThe web front-end side of our industry is embracing changes at dizzying speed, and it's time we all take notice and draw inspiration.\n\nLook! The front-end developers are leading the charge on immutable, pure, functional, and reactive ways of programming! The languages they use are with bells and whistles unheard of.\n\nMost blasphemously, they are leaving our endeared SOLIDs, GoFs, interfaces. Worst of all, where are the classes?!\n\nCome! Developers front both ends, for an anecdotal, fun, and meaningful account of examples and observations. Let's smash some stereotypes, re-calibrate the \"balance of coolness\"!"
