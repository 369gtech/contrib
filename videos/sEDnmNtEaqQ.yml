description: "Welcome to Designing in the Browser with our host, Una Kravets. Today we’re talking about color contrast! We’ll go over what the A, AA, and AAA conformance levels mean and how to ensure proper accessibility compliance for your own site. We’ll go over how to use Chrome Developer Tools and preference media queries, such as “prefers-color-scheme,” to make the right choices for your applications and design systems.\n\nLinks:\nUnderstanding Conformance Levels → https://goo.gle/352mg5n \nPrefers Color Scheme Demo → https://goo.gle/3gY4HGa \nTooling.report → https://goo.gle/3eDuvad \n\n\nDesigning in the Browser → https://goo.gle/2NeLxjI \nSubscribe to Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs"
