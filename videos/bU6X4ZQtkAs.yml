description: "An API-first approach assumes the design and development of an application programming interface (API) comes before the implementation. Your team begins by creating an interface for their application. After the API is developed, the team relies on this interface to build the rest of the application. By introducing new features as an independent service accessed by API, the rest of the app can be stitched together, along with any other future apps.\n\nThroughout an API’s entire lifecycle, different stakeholders have unique requirements. It’s not just developers who are collaborating on APIs within your organization. In a world where speed-to-market holds a premium, learn how to harness the power of your team to build better APIs within your own organization.\n\nJoyce Lin\nDeveloper Advocate, Postman\nhttps://twitter.com/PetuniaGray\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
