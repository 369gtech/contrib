description: "Design for the next pattern of computing\n\nAfter 30-some-odd years, the smartphone has become the peak operating efficiency of the personal pattern of computing, but in many ways, it still falls short. Yet that tiny little device offers us a way to live a digital lifestyle – and even if it is a little awkward when it testifies against us in court, we immerse ourselves into these experiences constantly. Our desire to live in two worlds means we take our small computer devices everywhere, and this has set the stage for the next pattern of computing.\n\nIn this session, Jared Ficklin will look to the future to show a vision for the next pattern of computing and discuss how the coming changes will create a new class of products and how they are already impacting the way we design. The session will show work, and ways to work, when facing the challenge of a unique interaction model or digital experience. As this was a topic of the many interactive installations completed for last year’s frog party, there will be many examples from work done both for clients and for fun."
