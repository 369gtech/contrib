title: 'Designing for speech - CFS2011'
recordingDate: 1557279288
description: "Designing a natural language interface can be difficult, is the interface supposed to be able to interpret every single nuance of speech? and how about slang? Or should we aim more towards forced language and make our users learn how to interact with simple commands?\n \nAll the big companies are making huge investments in AI personal assistants. Amazon has Alexa, Google has Google assistant, Apple has Siri and Microsoft has Cortana to name a few. 40% of adults use voice commands at least once per day. But for most people talking to their devices still feels a bit strange at times. \nGet ready now, and your bots and apps will be a delight to talk to!"
