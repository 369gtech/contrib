description: 'So you have microservices. Your system has been up and running for a while now. You know youâ€™ve diligently employed every ounce of your experience and knowledge over time to help draw sensible boundaries. But time is now throwing new questions your way: Are my boundaries still sensible? Have any anti patterns crept in, do I have a dreaded SPOF anywhere? This talk looks at how you can apply network science techniques to help gain insight into, and explore some of these questions for your microservices architecture.'
