title: 'Exploring Pattern Matching in C# - Bill Wagner'
recordingDate: 1492584061
description: "Pattern Matching is one of the new features coming in C# 7. The ability to manage control flow using any property of an object will change how you write code.\nThe new syntax enables new paradigms. In this session, we'll spend an hour looking at the syntax enabled by pattern matching. We'll start with the basics of the new syntax, and then dive deep into how it can be used and mis-used. When we've finished, you'll have great power at your fingertips. More importantly, you'll know how to use it responsibly."
