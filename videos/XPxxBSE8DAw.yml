title: 'Răzvan Prichici - Build blazingly fast, ultra lightweight cloud native Java enterprise applications'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573504106
description: "In this session, Răzvan is going to talk about developing your own server using pure non-blocking Java API. Going from imperative, blocking code to a reactive programming model enables us to scale our apps in ways that aren’t possible with a thread scale-out approach, which is a good thing! But what about walking that extra mile and build ultra lightweight, cost effective cloud native services?\nTopics:\n– how reactive programing helps you create performant & scalable reactive microservices\n– message brokers & concurrency with LMAX Disruptor\n– introduction to Microservices with Undertow, an extremely lightweight and high-performance web server from JBoss\n– how to use different strategies and patterns to guarantee scaling, high availability and an outstanding performance in a distributed environment\n– how to use Kubernetes deployment strategies to ensure cost effective scalable cloud services."
