description: "Identifying Pokémon Cards by Hugo Peixoto\n\nI want my Pokémon TCG inventory to be digitized so I can search my cards and know which ones I still need. After building a tool to manually enter the cards, I decided to explore Computer Vision algorithms to automate part of the process. In this talk we'll go over some common algorithms used in this area and the roadblocks that I hit while learning."
