description: 'What is XBRL? How is it different than XML? Who is using it today? With the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandating it; stock exchanges around the world using it; and official support from the European Parliament as well as governments of the Netherlands, Australia, Japan and China--the Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) can certainly be considered a global standard for business reporting. In this webcast, Charlie Hoffman, the father of XBRL and Steve Levine, both of Ubmatrix, introduce XBRL and answer questions.'
