description: "Ближайшая конференция: \nHolyJS 2021 Piter — 20-23 апреля, онлайн.\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/2LbN8bH\n\n. The async pipe is boring! Understand the guts of Angulars change detection and why Zone.js is your biggest enemy. Learn the trick on template bindings, component rendering, and where you pay the biggest price. As the tip of the iceberg, you will learn how to identify and avoid blocking UIs by analyzing flame charts and leverage task scheduling. In the end, you will be able to build applications with zone-less performance even in a zone-full environment."
