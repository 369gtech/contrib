description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nFANTASTIC VOYAGE III: DESTINATION BEAM \nby Brian Troutwine\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nLet's \nGo \nDeeper. \n\nTALK LEVEL: Advanced\n\nABSTRACT\nIn 2017, Brian gave a keynote titled \"Piecemeal Into Space: Reliability, Safety and Erlang Principles\". In that talk, he discussed the high-level semantic model of Erlang, a slightly more concrete abstract representation of processes and their interaction with the schedulers and extrapolated this out into the application to spacecraft systems. \n\nIn this talk, we'll go deeper, discussing the concrete implementation of core Erlang concepts as reflected in the BEAM: the message process queue, the layout of a process and the structure the BEAM uses to associate names and PIDs.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/brian-troutwine/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BRIAN TROUTWINE\nLow-level systems engineer on the Dropbox Performance team. Has thoughts about spacecraft. \n\nBrian L. Troutwine is a software engineer with a focus on low-level and fault-tolerant systems. Brian also has thoughts about mega-engineering projects, both historical and theoretical.\n\nMore on Brian Troutwine: https://codesync.global/speaker/brian-troutwine/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync. Code BEAM SF 19 was sponsored by WhatsApp, The RealReal, Brex, Erlang Solutions, 2600Hz, PagerDuty, and aeternity.\n\nCODE SYNC \nWebsite: www.codesync.global\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/\nMail: info at codesync.global\n\n#Erlang #processes #CodeBEAMSF"
