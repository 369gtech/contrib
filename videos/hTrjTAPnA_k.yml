description: "\"Speaker: Bernat Gabor\n\nType hinting for Python (as a linter tool) came out in September 2015 as part of Python 3.5 (and was championed by Guido himself). Since then, variable annotations (plus, more recently, protocols) improved its capabilities even further. Over the last two years, tools, such as mypy, could build on top of it. Slowly, these annotations have emerged from a proof of concept state (e.g., mypy API planning) to becoming a stable feature.\n\nIn this presentation, I'll tell my story of using type hints for both adding type hinting and checking type correctness for a library supporting both Python 2 and 3 and reusing this information to insert type data into the generated Sphinx documentation automatically.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
