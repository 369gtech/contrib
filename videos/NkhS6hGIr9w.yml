description: "Our first contact with Parts Unlimited came when Erik Reid emailed us and asked if we were available for a video chat the very next day with Parts Unlimited CEO Steve Masters. We have a lot of respect for Erik and were pleased to make time in our schedule.\n\nThat first call with Steve was an eye-opener! He was extremely direct about the desperate shape of Parts Unlimited, their failure to keep up with changes in technology and customer demand, and how they had just made headlines with a disastrous failed release. He had been convinced by Erik that without a transformation of the “dysfunctional marriage” between IT and the rest of the business, they could not survive.\n\nOur view is that this kind of cultural transformation always involves a conversational transformation. The first step to an improved relationship is talking to each other in a different way. The challenge is that a whole bunch of cognitive biases make it hard for humans to be aware of their contributions to a good or bad conversation. And if you can’t see it, you can’t change it. The good news is there are tools you can use to learn to see your conversations in a new way, and to gain the skills required for productive conflict and psychological safety. Those are the tools we teach teams to use every day, and we could definitely see how Parts Unlimited could use them to underpin the changes they were aiming to make.\n\nDuring our call, we were able to introduce Steve to one of these tools—“The Four Rs”—and to help him use it in a live situation. Over the course of about 30 minutes, we were able to help Steve analyze some conversations he’d had with Bill Palmer, his VP of IT Operations. That was enough time for him to Record the conversation, to Reflect on his part of the dialog and identify improvements, to create a Revised dialog incorporating those changes, and even do a bit of Role Play to see how things could go better. At the end of this process, Steve was ready for his call with Bill, and he was also ready to hear how we could bring these skills to the rest of the company.\n\nAnd that was the start of our work with Parts Unlimited.\n\nFor the past year we’ve been excited to watch this company transform. The conversational transformation started with a leadership team offsite, which drove home for all executives the power of these skills to dramatically improve their collaboration. Over time, we’ve been extending the training through the cross-functional teams they’ve created to replace their traditional functional silos, and to embed it into the on-boarding plans for all new hires. There is now a shared language on The Five Conversations of effective teams: the Trust Conversation, the Fear Conversation, the Why Conversation, the Commitment Conversation, and the Accountability Conversation.\n\nThe results of the most recent company survey show a tremendous increase in mutual trust and respect between colleagues from where we started a year ago, and the free-form comments saw many people describe how changing conversations have changed the culture at the company. This change was most evident in the successful integration of the engine sensor project into the Service Station Direct Sales division, the first time a technology team has been fully embedded into a business division.\n\n-----------------\n\nDouglas Squirrel has been coding for forty years and has led software teams for twenty.
