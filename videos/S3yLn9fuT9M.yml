description: "RubyConf 2018 - Ruby for Makers: Designing Physical Products With Ruby by Andy Glass\n\nRubyists are creators. While weâ€™re traditionally tasked with building digital products, our skills can cross into the physical medium too. This talk demonstrates a non-typical way to use code to create products: building a Ruby program that generates dynamic plans for laser-cut physical products (e.g. laptop stands, picture frames, notebooks, etc). With size, fonts and patterns as variables, our app programs a system that allows a user, or a computer, to design an infinite number of variants. Attendees will leave inspired to explore new avenues to use their skills to do what we do best: create."
