title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2012: Ralf Neeb - Real-/Neartime analysis with Hadoop & VoltDB'
recordingDate: 1545060432
description: "Analyzing big data with Hadoop has become a de facto standard procedure in the recent years. When it comes to real-/neartime analysis, there are still new challenges arising, e.g. processing many small data (events) and providing the result in near time without having the need for high-end storage infrastructure. This talk is about real world use cases for real-/near time data analysis and how to combine Hadoop with VoltDB to scale out (horizontally).\n\nMore Info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/real-neartime-analysis-hadoop-voltdb\n\nDescription of Ralf Neeb: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/ralf-neeb"
