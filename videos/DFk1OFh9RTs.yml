recordingDate: 1622465050
description: "The Heart of Domain-Driven Design\nAndrew Harmel-Law, ThoughtWorks\n\nAbstract I strongly believe that Domain-Driven Design is one of the best thing to happen to software development in decades. It has within it the key to our hardest problems: how to slice up our software, how to write maintainable software, how to name things ... and most importantly of all, how to meet the needs of our users. But there's a problem. Despite all this, I see DDD going wrong everywhere.\n\nHaving used DDD for over ten years I think I know why, and that's what I want to share with you. The three core elements which I call the 'Heart of DDD' and which if you stay true to them will guarantee you succeed.\n\nThis talk will have three sections - the first will explain the 'heart' as Eric Evans described it. The second will go back to each and discuss them, and how they interact. The third will look at how they can drive a solid and intuitive Microservices architecture that's a pleasure to work with.\n\nRecorded: Tuesday 23 February 2021 kl. 12:00"
