description: "Getting software from a developer’s machine to a production environment without a fully automated process is time-consuming and error-prone. Continuous delivery enables building, testing, and deploying software through build pipelines with well-defined quality gates. This session discusses how to build an exemplary pipeline with the help of Gradle and Jenkins. With Jenkins as the centerpiece of the build pipeline in this session, you’ll experience modeling from build to deployment. The presentation starts by introducing a case study application and how to build it with Gradle. Step by step, it touches on topics such as developing unit, integration, and functional tests; incorporating popular OSS code-quality tools; and packaging, publishing, and deploying the deliverable.\n\n\nAuthor:\nBenjamin Muschko\nBenjamin Muschko is a senior software engineer with more than 10 years of experience in developing and delivering business applications.
