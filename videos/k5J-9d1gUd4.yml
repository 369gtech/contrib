description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nAccelerating Drug Discovery by Competitive Cooperation Through Open Source - Bill Mulligan, Kubermatic & Camille Marini, Owkin \n\nHistorically, pharmaceutical companies have kept their machine learning (ML) models and data strictly confidential. The EU/EFPIA IMI2 Joint Undertaking funded “MELLODDY” (Machine Learning Ledger Orchestration for Drug Discovery, Grant n° 831472) initiative, a 3 year 18.4M EUR effort, brings together 10 leading pharma companies and 7 tech partners to build a new collaborative ML platform that boosts drug discovery model development while addressing both security and privacy preservation concerns (including commercial confidentiality). Kubernetes provides the consistent computing infrastructure across companies ensuring that data owners maintain control while running the common ML software and sharing the resulting models. This project demonstrates the potential of Kubernetes to accelerate drug discovery and enable cooperative competition in IP-sensitive industries.  https://www.melloddy.eu/ https://www.imi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/melloddy\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZetX"
