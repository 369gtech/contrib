description: "Speaker: Sudarshan Reddy\r\n\r\nThis is a talk about how we used the power of `go generate` and templates to make our life slightly easier in Zalora.\r\n\r\nSudarshan is the lead engineer for Zalora's backend (mobile) team. I have about 8.5 years of Software Engineering experience. I started off as an Embedded engineer before moving to higher level programming. My go to languages at the moment are Go, Rust and Python. I like distributed systems, cryptography and systems programming.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/golangsg/events/269563409/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG"
