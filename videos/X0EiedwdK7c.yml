title: 'Continuous Deployment Made Easy with Skipper - Mark Pollack'
language: ""
recordingDate: 1513269137
description: "Spring Cloud Skipper is a continuous delivery platform that makes it easy to discover, install, upgrade, and rollback applications across multiple cloud platforms such as Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. Skipper stores a versioned history of application manifests that declaratively describe how your applications were deployed in the cloud. When upgrading a set of applications, Skipper only upgrades the applications that have changed and rolls out the new applications based on a customizable upgrade strategy. Skipper also maintains custom application metadata of deployed applications that can be used to support operational dashboards.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how to build continuous delivery pipelines using existing CI products and application repositories by adding Skipper. We will demonstrate how to take applications through initial deployment to QA, promotion to production, and rolling back across multiple cloud platforms.\n\nMark Pollack, Software Developer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
