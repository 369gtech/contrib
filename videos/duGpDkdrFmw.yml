description: "Lightning Talk: Cloud Native Application Management with the Stratos Console UI - Neil MacDougall & Richard Cox, SUSE\n\nIn this talk we introduce the Stratos UI for Cloud Foundry. This innovative open-source user interface allows application developers and system administrators alike to manage their Cloud Foundry instances and applications through an easy-to-use web-based interface.\n\nWe present the architecture of the UI, covering both the front-end (AngularJS) web-based application and the supporting back-end (Go) API server. We will outline how the architecture allows new components to be added to extend the capabilities of the UI as well as to modify its appearance and branding.\n\nWe will talk further about how the back-end API Server handles user token management and integrates with the Cloud Foundry UAA to automatically refresh access tokens and proxy API requests to the Cloud Foundry APIs. We will also discuss how our design can support other APIs and endpoint types in the future.\n\nOur goal with this talk is to both introduce the UI that we have built over the last 12 months in order that others can start to use it but more importantly to engage with the open-source community to work with us to contribute and build out its capabilities.\n\nAbout Richard Cox\nSoftware Developer, SUSE\n\nAbout Neil MacDougall\nSUSE"
