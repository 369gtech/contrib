title: 'UI profiling in examples. Where is my bottleneck? - Artur Badretdinov'
recordingDate: 1574260372
description: "You developed a feature, tested it yourself - everything works well. You send it to the internal testing, your managers... And they say it is slow!\n\nWe ran into the exact same situation and dug into the tools that may be used to make your Android app work on 60 frames per second.\n\nThis presentation is intended for the people who haven't dived into the UI performance yet. You will see some examples of easy and fast ways to check if your app works well and if it is not, how to find the potential problem."
