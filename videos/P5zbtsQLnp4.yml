title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: PHPUnit for Drupal Developers'
recordingDate: 1506608341
description: 'If you want to be sure that your software works correctly then you need to continuously test it. Automated tests save you from pressing F5 in the browser all the time as well as from using debug statements such as var_dump() in your code. They are also cheaper than manual tests and easier to implement than you may think. How do I test my code with as little effort as possible? How do I execute as few lines of code as possible to test what I am really interested in? And what does this have to do with clean code? Attendees of this session will learn why they should include PHPUnit into their set of development tools.'
