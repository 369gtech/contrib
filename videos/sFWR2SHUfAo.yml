description: "JavaServer Faces is still one of the most popular web application frameworks. JSF 2.2, the latest evolution of this popular framework, ships with Java EE 7. It includes a few major new features, plus several other enhancements and bug fixes. It’s easier than ever, with HTML5-friendly markup. Faces flows enable you to package up navigation, pages, and code into easy-to-manage modules. Enhanced cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection makes your applications more secure, and there’s a standard file upload component. Resource library contracts enable you to swap sets of templates, images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files across your application, simplifying customization for different clients or deployments. Come to this session to see demos of these and other features live, in action.\n\n\nAuthor:\nKito Mann\nKito D.
