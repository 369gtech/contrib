title: 'Location matters! Map Visualization for APEX developers'
language: English
recordingDate: 1600706784
description: "Location Data, visualized on a map, is a common requirement for application developers these days. Of course, this is also true for APEX apps: But what's the best way of creating them? In this session, you'll learn everything about the Oracle Maps technology and how to use it in APEX applications.\n\nWe will be joined by Honglei Zhu, who is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Oracle Spatial product development team, and Carsten Czarski from the APEX development team. Honglei will introduce Oracle Maps and demonstrate how to easily use its JavaScript API to visualize location and analytic data. Then it will be time to integrate this in the APEX application. One way is to use the APEX Plug-Ins contained in the Sample Geolocation Showcase packaged application: Provide a SQL query, configure map attributes and you're ready to go. After that, attendees will learn how to keep full control, by embedding the Oracle Maps JavaScript API, into the APEX application.\n\nThis session is for both new and existing APEX developers.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/  \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
