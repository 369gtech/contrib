description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nLightning Talk:  Observable Microservices Make Monitoring Simple\n\nMicroservices is not a buzz word but Observability is. With cloud native microservices architecture, the hard failures are almost eradicated, and we live in an era where soft-failures are new normal.  At the same time, we are also interested in reducing the soft failures. In order to do that, we need have observable microservices. So, what are observable microservices?  If we practice to design, develop, and release Microservices by continuously listening to feedback from the operational insights, then we know to deliver observable microservices. And is not a one time heavy lifting job as it requires continual investigation and improvement based on the changing needs. The session is targeted to highlight the key elements to be added in each stage both in Development and in Operation (Dev-Ops) cycles such observable microservices can be built and delivered. Building Observable Microservices enable better workflows for debugging, performance optimization, and fire fighting.\""
