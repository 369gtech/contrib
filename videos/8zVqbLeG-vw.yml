description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nTemplate engines are commonly found generating web pages, customer reports, or even source code. They take a source template and data model as input and generate some desired output.\n\nBoostache was started as the Library in a Week challenge from CppNow'14 with initial support for Mustache.\n\nToday Boostache supports multiple template formats and adapts automagically at compile time to user defined data models. Many of the techniques utilized in Boostache are the same that Ciere has employed in custom IDL compilers, Domain Specific Language systems, compilers, and runtimes.\n\nThis talk will briefly introduce Boostache and then delve into the internal architecture and design of the library. We will explore some implementation details of the parser, compiler, virtual machine, and generic data model infrastructure with the goal to expose useful techniques and patterns from this C++11 code base that can be used in your own libraries and applications.\n— \nMichael Caisse has been crafting code in C++ for nearly 25-years. He is a regular speaker at various conferences and is passionate about teaching and training. Michael is the owner of Ciere Consulting which provides software consulting and contracting services, C++ training, and Project Recovery for failing multidisciplinary engineering projects. \n\nWhen he isn't fighting with compilers or robots, he enjoys fencing with a sabre. :: ciere.com\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
