description: "Budding leaders often come from technical backgrounds. They are the best designers or coders or project managers. Though technical skills are necessary, a new set of skills is required to harness the technical skills of other in a team to do big things.\n\nToday, Albert wants to share a few lessons he’s learned about leading a team. In his case, designers, but this applies broadly to any team of actual human being. He didn’t learn these from a book, in a class, seminar, or even in the studio. He learned everything of practical value from wrangling young kids learning to play baseball.\n\nAlbert Poon\nhttps://twitter.com/DoorDash\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
