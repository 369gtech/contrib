description: "The average mobile website page weight is ~50% images. Toss in the complication of thousands of differently sized screens, and it might appear that efficient delivery of images to every device is an impossible task. But all is not lost! In this talk, we’ll examine strategies to send the perfect image to every device, ensuring a fast, beautiful rendering of your content. We’ll look at progressive images, placeholder images, lazy loading and other techniques and real world examples that will improve the usability of your site or app. Attendees will come away with an understanding of the current ‘state of the art’ for optimizing visual content on the web.\n\nEVENT:\n\nØredev 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDoug Sillars\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nØredev Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nØredev YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0XtR2kcXnqtfrGSsxM8oAg"
