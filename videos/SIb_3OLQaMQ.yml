description: 'Most of us have now adopted the agile way of working in their workplace. In many cases it has shown us how to bring structure into our work process and with each iteration helping us to improve the way we do things. More and more we are also seeing the Agile framework being adopted by other environments which are not always IT related. If this way of working is a success at our office and can also help improve processes in other environments, why not try it out within our own home? Hence, the start of the Agile Family.'
