description: "C# is a language of breadth. At one end it allows low-level programming with pointers and lock-free synchronization; at the other end, it sports high-level features such as closures, expressions trees and asynchronous functions.\n\nWhich leads us to a challenge: can we write a non-contrived program that uses all of the above? The answer is \"of course!\", and I'm going to walk you through a practical example: a high-speed communications library built on shared memory (and used in production!)\n\nCome and join the author of C# 7 in a Nutshell and LINQPad in an advanced session, where we step outside the box and play with all of C#'s best toys at once."
