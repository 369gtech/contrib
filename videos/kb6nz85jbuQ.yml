description: "Are you tired of null pointer exceptions, unintended side effects, SQL injections, concurrency errors, mistaken equality tests, and other runtime errors? Are your users tired of them in your code? This presentation shows you how to guarantee, at compile time, that these runtime exceptions cannot occur. You have nothing to lose but your bugs!\n\n\nAuthor:\nWerner Dietl\nWerner Dietl is an assistant professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada. His research agenda is to provide developers with sound help in eliminating latent defects. He combines theoretical results with practical tools so developers can create high-quality, trustworthy software and reduce the enormous impact of software defects.\n\nPreviously, he worked with Prof. Michael D. Ernst and the SE.CS and WASP research groups at the University of Washington.
