description: "Should we be fearful of artificial intelligence and the pace at which itâ€™s progressing? Or should we fear fear itself and the risk of it stifling innovation? \n\nWherever this may be heading, the march of progress shows fews signs of slowing down. Which companies and countries are leading the way?\n\nThe chief scientist for AI research at Google Cloud Fei-Fei Li, along with Sinovation Ventures CEO Kai-Fu Lee and Jennifer Zhu Scott of Radian Partners, weigh in. And Professor Rita Singh shares how AI-powered technology may not only shape our future, but also perhaps our understanding of the past.\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls1_tqlpMww"
