description: "Pattern matching is a killer feature in Scala. Those of you coming from a Java background might find this particularly interesting, because even with Java 8, thereâ€™s nothing like this in Java.\n\nCode samples and further resources: http://crcl.to/lwjzd\n\n**\nThe content in this tutorial is taken from NewCircle's Scala Courseware, which is a collaboration with Pearson Education, Inc. The material is adapted from Cay S. Horstmann's introductory Scala book, Scala for the Impatient."
