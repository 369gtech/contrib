A dream for every developer, admin or devops.\nBut can this dream really be true? You already might smell the rat :)\nThis talk wants to show what you better not shall do with serverless technologies, which pitfalls you should vastly avoid and how you prohibit your services from burning senseless money out of your pockets. But no worries! There will be a happy end with a bunch of hints and scenarios on how to get full bliss from our beloved Jeff ♥️"
