description: "Feedback loops are everywhere in software craftsmanship. Developing software heavily relies on effective feedback loops, but very few teams approach feedback systematically. With complex interdependent adaptive teams and organisations, feedback systems can be counterintuitive and confusing. \n\nIn this talk, Gojko explains the science behind feedback and how you can set up and benefit from feedback loops much more effectively, on all possible feedback levels.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2019, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
