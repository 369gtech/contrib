description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKeynote: Creating with Authenticity & Humility: A SPIFFE Origin Story - Sunil James, HPE\n\nFive years ago, a public Google document proselytized the reasons for SPIFFE's existence. This document, and the people involved in its creation, began a movement that brought together people who contemplated how to tackle a myriad of security challenges as they and their organization move \"into the cloud.\" However, this document didn't start from thin air. Like most great efforts, SPIFFE stands on the shoulders of its predecessors, and moves forward because of those who carry our story into the future. This presentation explores and celebrates the SPIFFE community: a band of authentic and humble engineers, product managers, UI/UX designers, documentation writers, marketers, and more."
