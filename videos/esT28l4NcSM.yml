title: '"A re-introduction to s3fs" - Andrew Gaul (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612098435
description: "Andrew Gaul\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/83/\n\nS3 file systems are a popular interface to object storage despite their leaky abstractions and performance pitfalls.  In this talk we will explore s3fs, one of the most popular FUSE file systems, and when it is an appropriate solution.  We will compare it with NFS and also discuss how s3fs has evolved over the last ten years.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSat Jan 23 16:15:00 2021 at Blemings Labs"
