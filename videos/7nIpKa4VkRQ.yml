description: "SREcon16 Europe - Next-generation Alerting and Fault Detection\n\nDieter Plaetinck, raintank\n\nThere is a common belief that in order to solve more [advanced] alerting cases and get more complete coverage, we need complex, often math-heavy solutions based on machine learning or stream processing.\nThis talk sets context and pro's/cons for such approaches, and provides anecdotal examples from the industry, nuancing the applicability of these methods.\n\nWe then explore how we can get dramatically better alerting, as well as make our lives a lot easier by optimizing workflow and machine-human interaction through an alerting IDE (exemplified by bosun), basic logic, basic math and metric metadata, even for solving complicated alerting problems such as detecting faults in seasonal timeseries data.\n\nView the full SREcon16 Europe Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program"
