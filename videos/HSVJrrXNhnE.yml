We'll cover new platform features, improvements to developer tooling, and what our improvements around privacy, accessibility, and other fundamentals mean for you.\n\n\nMicrosoft Learn -- https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nMicrosoft Docs -- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\nChannel 9 -- https://channel9.msdn.com/?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources\n@MSEdgeDev on Twitter -- https://twitter.com/msedgedev?WT.mc_id=Build2020_presentation_additionalresources"
