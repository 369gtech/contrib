description: "WebAssembly is a new low-level, high-performance complement to JavaScript on the Web. As an open standard developed by Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, WebAssembly runs everywhere that JavaScript does: in every major Web browser, and in runtimes like Node.js and Electron. This talk examines WebAssembly from a practical standpoint, answering why it was created, what it’s good for, how it works, and how you can use it today.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/dan-callahan/"
