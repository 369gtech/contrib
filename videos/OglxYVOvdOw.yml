description: "A very brief introduction to Rust and why it should be on your radar. Rust is a “systems” programming language that is designed to be a modern replacement for C++. It has an impressive out-of-the-box toolchain, an interesting approach to safe concurrency and easy integration with C and other languages. It’s certainly a powerful tool to have at your disposal.\n\n\nAbout Dan Webb\n\nDan is VP of Engineering at Deliveroo and former head of Twitter’s web team.
