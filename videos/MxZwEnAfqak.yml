title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Democratizing App Creation'
recordingDate: 1493239413
description: "Drupal brings together content authors, site builders, themers, and developers.\_That diversity of ability and experience lets great things happen.\_But the web isn't just about content anymore.\_It's an\_application runtime: the first truly portable, libre application runtime with global ubiquity. Yet all the leading tools for delivering app experiences on the web cater only to developers.\_\n\nWe can fix this problem and democratize the creation of a new generation of interactive apps.\n\nI will present ongoing open source work to bridge the gap between front-end developer communities (particularly Ember, which I know best) and the needs of themers, site-builders, and content creators.\n\nThis is a big-tent talk that's explicitly about bringing together diverse audiences, so there are no technical prerequisites."
