description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl),\n20th of September 2013, Krak√≥w\n\nDino Esposito - \"Mobile is over: Start Planning Multi-Device Web sites Today\"\n\nDescription:\n\"The definition of a \"smartphone\" is extremely fluid and dynamic. Like water, it takes the shape of the container and to make things more challenging the industry is constantly pouring water from one container to the next.\n\nMulti-device design is about defining classes of devices (i.e., smartphone or tablet) using a device description repository (DDR) like WURFL and then on the server select a responsive template to adjust it to the various sizes/capabilities of smartphones and tablets. In this way, you treat smartphones more or less as smart phones and tablets as mini-computers. But you stop treating smart phones like desktop computers or large screens which is currently the biggest pain with classic responsive web design.\n\nIn the session, I'll demo how to do multi-device design of a web site using ASP.NET MVC 4, Bootstrap and WURFL.\""
