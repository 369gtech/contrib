description: "Code tasks like linting and testing are critical pieces of a developerâ€™s workflow that help keep us sane\_by preventing syntax or style issues and hardening our core business logic. The only real flaw with\_this process is whether or not we remember to run them!\n\nCan we automate these tasks close to our development environment and let the robots do all of the hard work? Yes we can. In this webinar, you'll learn how you\_can use GitHub Actions to automate these tasks and keep your projects running smoothly.\n\nEnterpriseNG is a two-day, virtual conference focused on teaching developers and their teams to get the most out of Angular applications in the enterprise.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://enterprise.ng-conf.org/"
