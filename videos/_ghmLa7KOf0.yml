description: "Microservices are great, problems arise when you start to have two of them and when you want to deal with data :)\n\nPun aside, data and state is a big subject that is largely ignored when discussing Microservices.\n\nConundrum #1 : What is the aimed data architecture in a perfect Microservices architecture?\nConundrum #2 : How do you share state between instances of a given Microservice in a stateless 12 factor approach?\nConundrum #3 : how to echange state between Microservices that must remain independent?\nConundrum #4 : how do I go from my brownfield database to a fleet of Microservices IRL without a Big Bang? Conundrum #5 : with many Microservices touching many data sets, how do I guarantee uniformed security (GDPR anyone)?\nAnd the list goes on. This presentation is an opinionated answer to these questions. And yes we do demo these concepts.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
