description: "In what is being called the “third era of computing,” cognitive computing is revolutionizing the relationship between humans and computers. Internet of Things is only the beginning. Artificial Intelligence is finally sprouting out of science fiction and blossoming into palpable technology. Cognitive systems are able to learn independently, build upon pre-programmed knowledge, understand natural language, and interact with human beings with reasoning and logic.\n\nIn this session Mark will explore how, through the anthropomorphizing of machines, we are creating an environment of fabricated empathy that will change the human experience, and how we are asking machines to make ethical decisions that they’re grossly unprepared to do. He will also discuss why Artificial Intelligence won’t create an apocalypse of robots who take over the world. Maybe.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
