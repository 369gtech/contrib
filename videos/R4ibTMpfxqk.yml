description: "A Event-Handling System for Serverless Platforms - Julian Skupnjak & Simon Moser, IBM\n\nIoT devices are becoming ubiquitous in e.g car-, smarter home, and many other industries. Applications dealing with IoT devices need to react to events and serverless platforms are essentially designed for such workflows. More and more sensors are continuously sensing data, some – often the majority – of this data is more or less neglectable, and some of this data requires attention. The reception of an event on serverless platforms yields the execution of a (set of) function(s). The pricing model is activation based, i.e. the customer is only charged for code really running. As a conclusion, customers are charged for code activations based on irrelevant events.\n\nIn this talk, we will show a system build on top of Cloud Foundry, which brings together event management and serverless computing capabilities to do both: Filter (IoT) events and execute actions. The project was generally a PoC, which was implemented as microservice architecture with different technologies (e.g. Golang, Angular JS, NodeJS, Rabbit MQ, etc.). Its aim is to handle events, based on rules set by the user and trigger actions on a serverless platform for handled events only.\nWe will show our microservice architectural design and talk about problems we faced. Moreover, we will show a demonstration video of an end-to-end scenario using the event handling system. \n\nAbout Simon Moser\nSimon Moser has been at IBM since 2003, where he is currently the lead architect for the Cloud Foundry part of the IBM Cloud. He is interested in many aspects of clouds and distributed systems, emphasising on technologies that allow systems to manage themselves. After receiving his M.Eng., he started his career in various development roles around application servers and Business Process Management, and started his journey in Cloud Computing in 2010. Along the way, he has been chairing various program and steering committees (e.g. BPM and OASIS TOSCA), has been publishing many papers and given many talks at various international conferences. He’s listed as an inventor on a good dozen US patents, and has an adjunct lecturer appointment at University of Jena, Germany. In his spare time, he’s torturing various musical instruments. \n\nAbout Julian Skupnjak\nJulian Skupnjak is a software engineer at IBM Cloud. He joined IBM with a bachelor degree in 2015 and works as a member of the internal team for Cloud Foundry. Alongside his full-time activities as Software Engineer he continued his study on masters degree level. Recently, he completed his master degree with a thesis in the area of Container Placement Algorithms.\nBeside several IBM intern talks about Continuous Delivery, Golang, and tools to empower and enhance CI/CD flows, Julian gave a talk about Serverless Computing at the IoT Conference 2016 in Stuttgart."
