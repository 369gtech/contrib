description: "Academic Cloud Computing Research: Five Pitfalls and Five Opportunities\n\nAdam Barker, Blesson Varghese, Jonathan Stuart Ward, and Ian Sommerville, University of St Andrews\n\nThis discussion paper argues that there are five fundamental pitfalls, which can restrict academics from conducting cloud computing research at the infrastructure level, which is currently where the vast majority of academic research lies. Instead academics should be conducting higher risk research, in order to gain understanding and open up entirely new areas.\n\nWe call for a renewed mindset and argue that academic research should focus less upon physical infrastructure and embrace the abstractions provided by clouds through five opportunities: user driven research, new programming models, PaaS environments, and improved tools to support elasticity and large-scale debugging. The objective of this paper is to foster discussion, and to define a roadmap forward, which will allow academia to make longer-term impacts to the cloud computing community.\n\nView the full HotCloud '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotcloud14/workshop-program"
