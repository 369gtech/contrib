description: "APT groups always try to hide and be persistent inside their target environment. Although MITRE ATT&CK matrix try to collect knowledge of all adversary tactics and techniques, new techniques or skills will still show up. Recently, we found a new technique are being utilized in multiple operation and APT groups, including BlackTech, WINNTI and Operation ShadowHammer. Once while doing incident response, we found typing special URL path can trigger invisible webshell backdoor in the windows webserver without leaving any logs. The way this attack used let it hard to detect since it does not need to leave file inside webserver, it doesn’t have its own process and no log will be created. This kind of webshell backdoor can be used in any windows platform even if it doesn’t have webserver installed.\n\nIn this presentation we will show up the complete attack of this kind of backdoor cases, threat indicators, victims and disaster assessment.\n\nWhat kind of technique or special windows API they used to achieve fileless, logless, processless webshell?\n\nWhat should we do when doing incident response with this kind of invisible webshell?\n\nAnd furthermore, we also using some windows undocumented API to build a new tool trying to catch up this kind of backdoor from memory while doing incident response.\n\n=== \n\nDove is working at Trend Micro as a threat researcher now, has more than 8 years security experience in incident response and live forensics. He is also a speaker in some conferences, including HITCON, CloudSec and first technical colloquium.Dove\n\n--- \n\nTim Yeh, working at TrendMicro as a threat researcher, has more than 8 years cyber security experiences.
