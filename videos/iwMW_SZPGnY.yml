O\nn the other hand, Persistence an instance of plain old Java object (POJO) class that represents a table. When a POJO instance is in session scope, it is said to \nbe persistent i.e. Hibernate detects any changes made to that object and synchronizes it with database when the session is closed. Thus, persistence can be deemed \nas one of the ultimate features of the Hibernate framework.\n\nVideo gives a brief insight of following topics:\n\n1.What is Hibernate\n2.What is hibernate persistence\n3.What is Data\n4.What is database\n5.Database Constraints\n6.Database Normalization\n7.RDBMS\n8.Introduction to SQL\n9.What is ORM\n10.Features of ORM\n11.Why ORM\n12.Mapping Objects to RBD\n13.Object Reational Mapping\n14.What are Entity Beans\n15.Object Relational Impedance mismatch\n16.Transparent Persistence\n17.ORM with Hibernate \n18.Hibernate architecture \n\n\n\nRelated Blog :  http://www.edureka.co/blog/hibernate-the-ultimate-orm-framework?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hibernate-tut-1\n\n  http://www.edureka.co/blog/portal-development-and-text-searching-with-hibernate?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hibernate-tut-1\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would\nprefer a hassle free and self paced learning environment, accessible from any part of the world.\n\nThe topics related to Hibernate  have extensively been covered in our course 'Persistence with Hibernateâ€™.\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
