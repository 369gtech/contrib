description: "From function source code to running in Kubernetes in 5 minutes. That's the power some of the latest open source projects can bring to your fingertips. This perceived simplicity actually hides layers of abstractions underneath. In this deep dive, we'll explore all the technology behind the scenes, from Kubernetes, Istio, Knative, to riff and Spring Cloud function.\n\nWe'll explore how Istio and Knative extend Kubernetes via Custom Resource Definitions to provide support for higher level developer concerns such as microservices autoscaling, routing across revisions of an application, and a unified eventing bus to compose event-driven workloads. Building on top of this, we'll take a look at how riff has been replatformed to run on top of Knative, while preserving its scale-on-demand Function as a Service ease of use. Finally, to tie the platform from top to bottom, we'll dive into Spring Cloud Function to see how to use Function interface to create a function that can process both synchronous HTTP requests as well as event-based messages using riff and Knative.\n\nRay Tsang \nFrom Google\nRay is a Developer Advocate for the Google Cloud Platform. Ray had extensive hands on cross-industry enterprise systems integration delivery and management experiences during his time at Accenture, managed full stack application development, DevOps, and ITOps. Ray specialized in middleware, big data, and PaaS products during his time at Red Hat while contributing to open source projects, such as Infinispan. Aside from technology, Ray enjoys traveling and adventures.\n\nEric Bottard \nFrom Pivotal\nEric Bottard is a core committer on the riff project, working at Pivotal. After hacking on enterprise projects for more than ten years, embracing Spring from day one, he joined the soon-to-become Pivotal division at VMware, working on Cloud Foundry and then Spring Cloud Data Flow."
