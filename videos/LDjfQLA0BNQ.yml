recordingDate: 1484583308
description: "Amazon is very passionate about helping their customers grow to become the next Amazon, Netflix, IronSource or Waze. They learned so much from their own experience and from the experience of many of their customers, so they love to share this experience with others.\n\nMany small startups are growing very quickly and struggle to keep the startup (=innovation) mentality. There are also many big companies that are trying to learn from startups how to stay relevant in a competitive market. It is more about agility, independence, smart application, collaboration, and the culture and technologies that can support it.\n\nIn this lecture, Guy will share his personal experience and Amazon experience in solving scale problems. Machine learning is one of these scale solutions, and it is also the reason they broken down Amazon to very small two-pizza teams, and the tools that they give to these teams to have superpowers to innovate fast."
