recordingDate: 1558612528
description: "The world of technology never stops moving, and developers are frequently told that they have to be constantly learning in order to keep up. Entire industries are devoted to helping developers stay on the cutting edge, and they offer a multitude of options and formats: books, video, online interactive programs. There's live training, both on-site and remote, small groups and large, and mixes of all of the above. Your time is valuable, so how do you get the maximum return for your investment? You've probably heard about learning styles, but recent evidence indicates they're not as useful as previously believed. Preferences and ingrained habits have more effect on learning and retention than an inherent style.\n\nIn this session, I'll introduce you to the various learning formats available, and provide some advice on selecting the one that best fits your needs, or those of your team. Your needs may vary depending on the situation: The resources you need to learn a new programming language probably aren't the same as the ones you'd use to learn a new version control system. Know how to identify a format that isn't working for you, and when to change it up. Cost plays a factor too, of course.\n\n\n\nAttendees will learn: \n\nThe available forms of continuous learning\nSome sources for finding these products, and what they cost\nHow to identify the form that works best for you\nEvaluating whether education is working\nWith a little planning, you can make continuous learning something to get excited about.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
