description: "This is the third video in a 3-part series. In this video, Jarek Wilkiewicz builds on the previous two episodes to show you how to activate a small Knowledge Graph with Schema.org Actions (http://goo.gl/vw8rOJ). \n\nThe the first video in this series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9pRpSW_KqA) covers creating and processing linked data using Schema.org and JSON-LD. \n\n The second video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oOwrBEeQss) focuses on data loading and graph processing using Cayley, and open source graph database written in Go (https://github.com/google/cayley). \n\nAfter watching the videos you will have a solid foundation to embark upon the Google I/O 2014 Actions Codelab   (http://goo.gl/4ykgZ6).\n\nTo learn more about the concept of hypermedia APIs touched upon in this video, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkAt9XSOfaE.\n\nSpecial thanks to: https://www.youtube.com/user/dualcoremusic."
