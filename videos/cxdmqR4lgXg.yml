description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: AWS - Say goodbye to YAML engineering with the CDK for Kubernetes \n\nThe CDK for Kubernetes (cdk8s) is a new open-source software development framework for defining Kubernetes applications and resources using familiar programming languages.  In this session, we will show you how to define your first cdk8s application, define reusable components called “constructs” and generally say goodbye (and thank you very much) to writing in YAML. We’ll also introduce our construct library cdk8s+ and show you how you can accelerate application development and adoption using cdk8s for any Kubernetes cluster. \n\nhttps://sched.co/fezY"
