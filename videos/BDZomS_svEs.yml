Can we adapt existing practices to expose the inherent chaos in these systems? What are the limitations and new challenges that we need to consider?\n\nJoin us in this talk as Yan Cui shares his thought experiments, and actual experiments, in his pursuit to understand how we can apply the principles of chaos to a serverless architecture. A word of warning though, youâ€™re guaranteed to walk away with more questions than answers!\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/yan-cui/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - YAN CUI\nPrincipal Engineer at DAZN\n\nYan is an experienced engineer who has worked with AWS for nearly 10 years. He has been an architect and lead developer with a variety of industries ranging from investment banks, e-commerce, sports streaming to mobile gaming. In the last 2 years he has worked extensively with AWS Lambda in production, and he has been very active in sharing his experiences and the lessons he has learnt. Some of his work has even made their way into the Serverless Well-Architected whitepaper published by AWS. He is a regular speaker at user groups and conferences internationally, and he is also the author of Production-Ready Serverless and a co-author of F# Deep Dives. In his spare time he keeps an active blog at theburningmonk.com where he shares his thoughts on topics such as AWS, serverless, functional programming and chaos engineering.\n\nMore on Yan Cui: http://codesync.global/speaker/yan-cui/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
