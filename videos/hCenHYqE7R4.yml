description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotjs.io on December 5-6, 2019 in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nDaniel presents the TC39, the committee working on evolving the JavaScript language standard. Because JavaScript is both programmed by a diverse set of people and deployed in diverse settings, it is essential that its development be governed in a way that is inclusive to these various requirements. We are not there yet, but the TC39 is working on it, and this can be seen in the development of various new language features that are coming to JavaScript. The TC39 needs your help in bringing JavaScript to the next level, and Daniel explains how you can get involved."
