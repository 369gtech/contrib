title: 'What Visual Studio Code can do for Java Development by Ed Burns'
recordingDate: 1581886554
description: "Visual Studio Code has come a long way to become the preferred text editor of polyglot developers thanks to the ecosystem of extensions that enhance and enrich the experience, turning it into a super smart editor with IDE-ish capabilities while remaining ludicrously fast and lightweight. Extensions for editing, running, debugging and deploying Java applications are well stable and supporting latest releases of several components, tools and frameworks, like JDKs, Maven, JUnit and Spring. Other extensions take the experience to the next level: remote development environments through SSH, local or remote Docker containers, or even through the Windows Subsystem for Linux. In this presentation, we will take a look at the core capabilities for Cloud Native Java development and how Java developers can take advantage of them to really focus on what matters most: Java code.\n\nEd Burns\nMicrosoft\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
