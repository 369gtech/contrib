recordingDate: 1615744584
description: "MRTK-Unity is a Microsoft-driven project that provides a set of components and features, used to accelerate cross-platform MR app development in Unity.\n\nThis project provides an introductory lesson on the Spatial Awareness system. The Spatial Awareness system provides real-world environmental awareness in mixed reality applications.\n\nBelow is a description of each part of the video:\n\nConfigure Unity for WMR Development (00:00) - Learn how to setup your Unity environment for Windows Mixed Reality Development.\nImport MRTK into Unity (06:14) - Learn how to import the Mixed Reality Toolkit into Unity and configure the project with the Mixed Reality Toolkit.\nEnable Spatial Awareness System (09:51) - Learn how to enable the MRTK Spatial Awareness system in Unity.\nAdd a Spatial Observer (12:48) - Learn how to add a spatial observer to the configuration profile.\nAdd Objects to Scene (19:00) - Learn how to add objects to the scene. Also, learn how to add a button to make the objects active after mapping the environment with spatial mesh.\nAdd Button to Hide Spatial Mesh (30:46) - Learn how to add a button that hides the spatial mesh when pressed.\nDemo (36:44) - View a demo of the project with a HoloLens 2.\n \n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/aprilspeight/mrtk-spatial-awareness\n\nResources:\n\nMixed Reality Toolkit Repo: https://aka.ms/mrtk\nTools to Install for Windows Mixed Reality Development: https://aka.ms/install-the-tools\nSet up a mixed reality project in Unity with the Mixed Reality Toolkit: https://aka.ms/learn-mrtk-unity\nUX Guidance on Spatial Mesh: https://aka.ms/spatial-mesh\nMRTK Spatial Awareness System: https://aka.ms/mrtk-spatial-awareness\nMRTK Spatial Observer: https://aka.ms/mrtk-spatial-observers-code"
