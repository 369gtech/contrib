title: 'ClojureScript in Your Pocket - Dom Kiva-Meyer, Lily M. Goh'
language: English
recordingDate: 1490984761
description: "In this talk we’ll explore how we replaced a buggy iOS app and an outsourced and abandoned Android app with a single React Native and ClojureScript app.\n\nReact Native allowed us to write a single codebase; GraphQL allowed us to eliminate the data-syncing issues that plagued the iOS app; ClojureScript let us move fast and recreate, in a matter of months, what took almost two years to build in Swift and Java.\n\nWe’ll discuss the obstacles that we encountered, how we circumvented them, and where we think the mobile industry will move. This is an exciting time to be (or become!) a mobile app developer.\n\nDom Kiva-Meyer\nParen\nDom is ½ of Paren, a 2-person software consultancy based in San Francisco. He is the creator of Clojure routing library, Silk. He has long been a functional programming advocate and can talk about software architecture and trade-offs with you all day if you’d like. When he’s not coding, he reads.\n\nLily M. Goh\nParen\nLily is the other half of Paren. She is a passionate UX designer and engineer. She’s a fan of React and React Native. She enjoys coding in Clojure, Ruby, and JavaScript. When she’s not coding, she cooks."
