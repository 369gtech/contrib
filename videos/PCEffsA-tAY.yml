title: 'microXchg 2018 - On the bleeding edge: Running AWS Lambda ... - Oliver Gutperl'
language: English
recordingDate: 1521752343
description: "Now that everybody has written their first Lambda function, it is time to explore advanced use cases. \nAWS Lambda@Edge gives you a the opportunity to process HTTP requests with Lambda functions directly in CloudFront - without using API Gateway. This talk introduces the Lambda@Edge runtime model, outlines obvious use cases like cookie handling and redirects and maps common pitfalls. Additionally we dive deep into more experimental ideas that take maximum advantage of the opportunities that Serverless has to offer. The intended audience are software developers who have already written AWS Lambda functions and want to apply this knowledge to other areas of the serverless stack."
