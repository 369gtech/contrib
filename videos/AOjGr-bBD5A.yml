description: "Automated testing is a crucial step in modern software development. A quality automated test suite enables rapid development and deployment practices like CI/CD by providing a stable quality check before an application is delivered to the world. \n \n But how do you write a quality automated test suite in Java? In this presentation, weâ€™ll look at the practices and principles for writing reliable, accurate, and portable tests, and how they can be implemented using modern automated testing frameworks and libraries, including: JUnit 5, Mockito, Test Containers, and others. With this knowledge, you can become an automated testing superstar and help your team get to production faster!\n\nBilly Korando, Java Developer Advocate at Oracle\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/how-to-be-a-java-automated-testing-superstar"
