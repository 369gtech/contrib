description: "Have you ever wondered how new language features get into JavaScript? This talk will take TypedArrays, a seemingly simple JavaScript feature, and go down the rabbit hole of implementation and optimization in V8. You’ll get a behind-the-scenes look at how a feature goes from idea, to specification, to implementation and beyond. \nJavaScript is a constantly evolving language, and for browser vendors this means work. New features are regularly added or tweaked in the language specification, and it is down to the browser vendors to get these features to users as quickly as possible. Can you balance speed, correctness, and security in order to ship new features? This talk explains the trade-offs that are made and tells the story of the mistakes made and lessons learned writing a JavaScript compiler at Google.\n\n\nPeter Marshall\nPeter work on the V8 team at Google in Munich, focusing on performance of new language features and supporting Node.js.\n\n\nNordic.js is a single track conference with talks by internationally renowned speakers and rising stars in the JavaScript community.
