Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nGitOps Working Group Update - Cornelia Davis, Weaveworks & Chris Sanders, Microsoft\n\nIn late 2020 the GitOps Working Group was formed under the App Delivery SIG. The goal for the WG is to “provide companies and individuals with the skills, knowledge and competency to implement GitOps tooling and methodologies which simplify the operation and management of infrastructure and cloud native applications.” Within days of the announcement more than 60 individuals from more the 30 companies expressed an interest in participating and the working group was launched. The group is meeting these goals through content creation and evangelism – white papers, blog posts, sample applications, demonstrations and more. In this session we will give an update on the working group and we will evangelize. We’ll present agreed upon key principles and practices, and we’ll teach through demonstrations using a variety of CNCF and other OSS projects such as Flux, Argo, Tekton and more. Most importantly, we will present concrete steps that will help folks get started with cloud-native (Git)ops."
