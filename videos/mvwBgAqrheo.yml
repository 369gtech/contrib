description: "What does the field of Artificial Intelligence look like in 2040? It's a really hard question to answer since there are still so many unanswered questions about the nature of reality and computing. In this episode, I'll make my best predictions about AI hardware, AI software, and the societal impact of AI in 2040. We'll cover quantum mechanics, neuromorphic computing, DNA storage, decentralized computing, basic income, and mind-body machines.
