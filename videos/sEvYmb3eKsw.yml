In all languages, we rely heavily on standard containers and collections. Need fast insertion/lookup? Hashmap. Need a sorted data structure that stores unique values? Set. Duplicate values? Multiset. And so on.\n\nHowever, most software developers don't develop algorithm intuition quite as easily. Algorithms aren't taught as widely as data structures are, and aren't relied on as heavily. This talk aims to introduce some STL algorithms, show how they are commonly used, and show how by developing intuition about them (+ a little help from lambdas), you can unlock their true potential.\n— \nConor Hoekstra\nAmazon\nSoftware Development Engineer\nSan Francisco Bay Area\n\nConor is extremely passionate about programming languages, algorithms and beautiful code. He spent 5 years in Canada working on a large-scale C++\_codebase. In 2018, he moved down to Silicon Valley and has spent the last year working for Amazon using C++, Java, Python, Go, Perl and more. He is in the midst of falling in love with Haskell and functional programming. He also has a YouTube channel where\_he covers solutions to competitive programming problems and more.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
