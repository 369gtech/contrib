description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Elaine Dias Batista, SFEIR.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=175957\n\nThe Flutter framework provides some great features that have lured a lot of developers. In real life though, not everything is perfect. As professional developers, we can expect nothing less than great tooling, a strong support for enabling several environments, a robust way of managing resources and providing a great user experience. In this talk I'll explain the great features but I'll also cover several aspects that Flutter development is currently lacking, all of that from an Android developer perspective."
