recordingDate: 1571147486
description: "In this talk, I will present how Flink enables enterprise customers to unify their data processing systems by using Flink to query Hive data.\n\nUnification of streaming and batch is a main theme for Flink. Since 1.9.0, we have integrated Flink with Hive in a platform level. I will talk about:\n\n- what features we have released so far, and what they enable our customers to do\n\n- best practices to use Flink with Hive\n\n- what is the latest development status of Flink-Hive integration at the time of Flink Forward Berlin (Oct 2019), and what to look for in the next release (probably 1.11)"
