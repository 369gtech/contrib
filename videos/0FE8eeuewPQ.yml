title: 'Cloud Foundry Services on PKS with No Extra Code, "We bosh so you donâ€™t have to!"(Kibosh)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538585996
description: "Our team, Pivotal Cloud Foundry Platform Engineering, works with software vendors to help them integrate with Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). Using lessons we've learned from years of this integration work, we present Kibosh: a framework to deploy services to PKS/Kubernetes and make them available to applications. Kibosh will improve the PCF experience for software vendors, service administrators, operators, and application developers. For software vendors: we will take a deep-dive into how Kibosh will deploy Kubernetes Helm charts via an Ops Manager tile with flexible tenancy without writing any extra code or learning BOSH. It will also optionally produce an OSBAPI service broker for on-demand deployments. For service administrators: we explore generating a service configuration UI to tweak the service plans, and other service configuration. For operators: Kibosh provides an Ops Manager tile deployment and day 2 experience familiar to PCF operators. For application developers: they don't care (or even know) their service is running in PKS; they just `cf create-service`, `cf bind-service` as usual. We will demonstrate building a Kibosh tile in less than 10 minutes, creating an on-demand service instance, and binding it to an application. Finally, we will talk about our plans for future enhancements.\n\nSpeakers:\nJoe Eltgroth\nCloud Foundry Staff Engineer, Pivotal\nJeenal Shah\nPrincipal Software Engineer and Manager, Platform Engineering, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
