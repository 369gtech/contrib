description: "From the 2014 Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City.\n\nWhat possessed an architect to boil down the beauty of pasta to a few bare formulae? Pasta isn’t exactly big data, but to the average person it’s big enough: no one knows how many shapes there are out there, or what their exact name might be. To sort this set out, we need more than the local knowledge ethnographers possess. In this presentation, George L. Legendre, principal of IJP Architects and faculty at Harvard graduate School of Design, will show how the mathematical equations of pasta define the ultimate taxonomy of the genre.\n\nAbout George Legendre:\nGeorge is a principal of IJP, an architectural firm which explores the natural intersections between space, mathematics and computation. IJP has built Henderson Waves, a 1000-foot long bridge in Singapore designed with a single equation, and was shortlisted for the MoMA PS1 Young Architect program pavilion in 2011. George holds a Masters degree from Harvard Graduate School of Design and serves there as Associate Professor in Practice.\n\nHis work has been profiled in Wired, the New Scientist, the New York Times, The Financial Times, Frankfurter Allgemeine, The Wall Street Journal, GQ Russia, NPR, Oprah.com, and CBS on Sunday.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop World 2014: http://goo.gl/UUfrR7\nFind out more about the conference: http://strataconf.com/stratany2014\n\nDon't miss an upload!
