description: "Make writing tests more joyful\n\nTesting is still a topic that most developers would like to avoid. Even though it is crucial for working software, developing and maintaining tests takes certain time and effort — especially for distributed applications or when changes in existing functionality forces test scenarios to adapt. Omitting software tests can’t be the solution; therefore, how can we tackle enterprise tests in an effective and productive way?\n\nThis session shows what is necessary to effectively test Java Enterprise microservices in an automated way. We’ll see which approaches worked well in real-world projects, how to keep fast feedback and constant velocity in our development circle, how to manage complex test scenarios that involve multiple services, and how to verify our API contracts. It’s crucial for the development productivity to keep an immediate feedback loop, not only for unit but also integrative tests. We’ll see how container orchestration and service meshes support our tests in regard to distributed applications.\n\nOne of the key aspects will be how to write maintainable test code with high quality that embraces principles of software craftsmanship. All of the time will be spent live-coding typical test cases with different scopes using different technologies. While I’ll be focusing on Jakarta EE, the concepts and approaches hold true for all enterprise Java projects.\n\n\nSeven Principles of Productive Software Developers\n\nWhen working as a software developer, as well as in any other job, it’s important to be productive and to get things done. You want to focus on what adds value, increase your development speed, and cut out as many of the cumbersome, boring and repetitive tasks as possible.\n\nThis session shows seven principles how to accomplish the goal of being more effective and efficient as a Java developer. These principles include technical as well as self-organizational aspects. We’ll see how to implement them, especially how we can get the most out of our tools, why the invention of the mouse was a setback in productivity, and which mindsets to follow. This talk is not limited to specific tools or technologies yet it’ll provide examples and experiences, and it is brought to you by a German — from the country of efficiency."
