description: "#Rust #TensorProgramming #WebCrawler\r\n\nIn this video we build a Web crawler in Rust using Surf and Async-Std.  This video is meant to introduce the concept of Futures, async, await and tasks. \n\nSource Code: https://github.com/tensor-programming/crawler_example\n#Rust #TensorProgramming #OwnershipAndBorrowing\n\nIn this video we take a look at Rust's memory management model.  That is the Ownership and Borrowing Model.  We talk about the Stack and the Heap as well as Stack frames and pointers. \n\nSource Code: https://github.com/tensor-programming/Rust-ownership-and-borrowing\n\nGood Programming Laptops:\nLenovo ThinkPad E570: https://amzn.to/2TFEiVG\nDell XPS15: https://amzn.to/2RxyavP\nThe Rust Programming Language Book: https://amzn.to/2QQ00mE\n\nSupport the Channel and Join Patreon:\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/tensor_programming\n\nCheck out our Blog: http://www.tensor-programming.com/\nCheck out our Twitter: https://twitter.com/TensorProgram\nCheck out our Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Tensor-Programming-1197847143611799/\nCheck out our Steemit: https://steemit.com/@tensor"
