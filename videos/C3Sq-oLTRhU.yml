description: "http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/09/lisi-on-a-wiki.html (article and full transcript available)\r\n\r\nIn this ten-minute video, Lisi discusses one of his primary research tools - a Wiki. This presentation was delivered in the context of a larger discussion of Open Source Science at SciFoo coordinated by Cameron Neylon a Chemical Biologist at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK interested in developing a similarly open \"notebook\" for scientific research.\r\n\r\nYou can browse the Wiki that Garrett Lisi discusses in this presentation by visiting: http://deferentialgeometry.org/. If you are interested in how Open Source Science is developing, you may also want to read Cameron Neylon's blog \"Science in the Open\"."
