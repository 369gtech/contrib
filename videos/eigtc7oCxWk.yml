title: 'EActors: an actor-based programming framework for Intel SGX'
language: English
recordingDate: 1594969457
description: "by Vasily A. Sartakov\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.4.601/eactors.webm\n\nIn this talk I will present EActors, an actor framework that is tailored to SGX and offers a more seamless, flexible and efficient use of trusted execution â€“ especially for applications demanding multiple enclaves. EActors disentangles the interaction with enclaves and, among them, from costly execution mode transitions. It features lightweight fine-grained parallelism based on the concept of actors, thereby avoiding costly SGX SDK provided synchronisation constructs. Finally, EActors offers a high degree of freedom to execute actors, either untrusted or trusted, depending on security requirements and performance demands.\n\n\nPlease note that this talk was originally scheduled to begin at the later time of 12:25\n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 11:00:00"
