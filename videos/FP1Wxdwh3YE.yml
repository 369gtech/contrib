description: "Adam Johnson\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/DQM9JQ\n\nTesting frameworks do a lot of work for us, so much that they can even appear like magic. But if we go under the hood, we can find better ways of working with them. This talk looks at Django's testing framework and pytest together, so it can show the common features as well as the differences. The general test lifecycle will be examined, from start to finish. We'll then use this knowledge to write a couple of customizations.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 16:35:00 2020 at Obvious"
