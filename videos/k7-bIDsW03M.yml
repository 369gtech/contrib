description: "Kyle Cooper has directed and produced over 300 main title and visual effects sequences. Take an in depth look into the process of creating title sequences, from David Fincher’s Se7en, Gareth Edward’s Godzilla, to FX’s anthology series American Horror Story. The best title sequences conjure an emotional response and have an integral role in the story being told – that is the goal of every detail in Coopers’ works.\n\nKyle Cooper\nFounder, Prologue\nhttps://twitter.com/prologuefilms\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
