description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nChaos Mesh 2.0：让混沌工程更为简单 | Chaos Mesh 2.0: Make Chaos Engineering Easy - Cwen Yin, PingCAP\n\n混沌工程是一种通过模拟例外或破坏性条件来测试生产软件系统稳健性的方法。然而，对于许多人来说，从学习混沌工程到在自己的系统上着手实践的转变是令人怯步的。在本会话中，Cwen Yin 将分享 Chaos Mesh，一个开源的云原生混沌工程平台，在使混沌工程更为简单的目标下是如何实施和发展的。他还将介绍 Chaos Mesh 2.0 GA 版本的特性，如何使用它来快速地做第一个混沌实验，以及如何将混沌实验集成到自己的系统中。\n\nChaos Engineering is a way to test a production software system's robustness by simulating unusual or disruptive conditions. For many, however, the transition from learning Chaos Engineering to practicing it on their own systems is daunting. In this session, Cwen Yin will share how Chaos Mesh, an open source cloud native Chaos Engineering platform has been implemented and evolved with the goal to make Chaos Engineering easier. He will also cover the features in Chaos Mesh 2.0 GA version, how to do your first chaos experiments quickly with it, and how to integrate chaos experiments into your own system."
