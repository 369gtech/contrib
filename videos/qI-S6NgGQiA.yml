recordingDate: 1381948336
description: "http://velocityconf.com/velocityny2013/public/schedule/detail/32780\n\nEdgeCast is one of the busiest content delivery networks. So, performance is at the heart of everything the company does: whether selecting servers, making routing decisions, or developing and deploying core software and new products. Behind all that is a fleet of numbers and graphs that our technical teams live and breathe daily. We'll share several examples of how watching these numbers have translated into big performance wins for customers. Some examples include measuring and eliminating bottlenecks to improve global purge-from-edge time by 10x, tracking outliers during core cache/proxy engine deployments, and identifying and finding our way around quirks in the TCP stack after finding out we were measuring something different from what we thought. At this session, you'll learn how to measure and monitor a network that's operating at a very large scale, and hopefully we can also help you avoid a couple mistakes we've learned from along the way.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by EdgeCast"
