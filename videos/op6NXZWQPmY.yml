description: "Charles Kim\nOracle ACE Director\nViscosity North America\n\nJerry Ward\nManaging Partner\nViscosity North America\n\nKubernetes has become the go-to platform to manage and deliver solutions in the cloud. Will all the power Kubernetes provides comes a steep learning path, with all the concepts to all the parts to cover it can be difficult to determine what are the relevant parts to put attention to and when deciding to deploy a cluster into a cloud environment. In this session I will explore the use of Terraform, a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently and also an Oracle project called terraform-kubernetes-installer We will explore HA recommendations and also tasks such as deploying, and scaling up and down a Kubernetes cluster all this with the ability to keep track though versioning of all infrastructure changes."
