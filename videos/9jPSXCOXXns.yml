description: "Hacking the phone system : Development solutions which change how people communicate \nTom Morgan (@tomorgan)\n\nThe PBX is an endangered species! Around the world companies are replacing old-style phone systems with VOIP solutions. Microsoft’s VOIP offering is called Microsoft Lync and is changing how people work. In 2015 Lync will be renamed Skype for Business and will offer integration to the rest of the Skype ecosystem. The great news for developers is that there are a collection of well-maintained APIs to help you integrate communication into your company in ways you’ve only dreamed of! After a lightning-fast roundup of Lync’s features and capabilities, I’ll dig into the different APIs available, what you can do with them and how they can change how your organisation thinks and works, including code samples so you can see how easy it is. Always wanted to create a custom IVR system for your company to look up order information? We’ll cover that…and lots more. \n\nTom is an experienced .NET developer with over 10 years development experience. For the last 3 years he has worked at Modality Systems, a specialist provider of Universal Communications services, where he produces software which interacts with Microsoft Lync. \n\nAs a senior software engineer he is responsible for designing, developing and deploying development services projects for a varied client list including FTSE 100 companies, multi-national corporations, government organisations and charities, as well as maintaining and developing Modality’s product line of Communication Enabled Business Process (CEBP) applications. \n\nIn the past he has worked with Scott Hanselman (Microsoft) on a community project ( LyncAutoAnswer.com), and wrote a community tool (AutoAssist) which eventually was acquired by Modality Systems and turned into a commercial product. He blogs about Microsoft Lync development at ThoughtStuff (thoughtstuff.co.uk). In his spare time (when not blogging!) he is a PADI Scuba Diving Instructor and enjoys DIY. \n"
