title: 'Percy: Isomorphic Web Apps with Rust + WebAssembly — Chinedu Francis Nwafili'
language: English
recordingDate: 1543279266
description: "Percy is a modular toolkit for building frontend web applications in Rust. It supports serverside rendering out of the box.\n\nIn this talk we’ll dive into how Percy works under the hood, starting with a look into its Virtual DOM implementation.\n\nYou’ll hopefully walk away with an understanding of the pieces that power Percy - as well as a good sense of how to get started with using Percy to build your own web apps.\n\n---\n\nMy name is Chinedu Francis Nwafili and I’m a developer with a passion for the modularity and great tooling. When not chasing my unofficial goal of becoming a four star chef - you can find me working on open source modules, tweeting about graphics programming or blogging about building a 3d game in the browser."
