title: 'YOW! September Online 2020 - Adam Tornhill - Prioritizing Technical Debt as if Time and Money Matter'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624253153
description: "Prioritizing Technical Debt as if Time and Money Matters\n\nMany codebases contain code that is overly complicated, hard to understand and hence expensive to change and evolve. Prioritizing technical debt is a hard problem as modern systems might have millions of lines of code and multiple development teams â€” no-one has a holistic overview. In addition, there's always a trade-off between improving existing code versus adding new features so we need to use our time wisely. So what if we could mine the collective intelligence of all contributing programmers and start to make decisions based on information from how the organization actually works with the code?\nIn this talk, you'll see how easily obtained version-control data let you uncover the behaviour and patterns of the development organization. This language-neutral approach lets you prioritize the parts of your system that benefit the most from improvements so that you can balance short- and long-term goals guided by data. The specific examples are from real-world codebases like Android, the Linux Kernel, .Net Core Runtime and more. This new perspective on software development will change how you view code.\nAdam Tornhill is a programmer who combines degrees in engineering and psychology. He's the founder of Empear where he designs tools for software analysis. Adam is also the author of Software Design X-Rays, the best selling Your Code as a Crime Scene, Lisp for the Web, and Patterns in C.\nFor more information on YOW!
