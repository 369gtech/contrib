Creating an atmosphere that respects diversity increases engagement, encourages open communication and fosters accountability amongst every participant. People can collaborate better to open source project using the right collaboration and project management tools. Organizing meetings daily or weekly, asking questions, networking with coworkers, making suggestions, asking for feedbacks and guidance, sharing knowledge and assigning roles to everyone as a group or individually also ensures efficient collaboration. It is pertinent for everyone to communicate effectively and also respect peoples opinions in order to accomplish a successful open source collaboration.
