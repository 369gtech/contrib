description: 'Performance tuning: it''s not just for DBAs!  Many design decisions that are made early in the application lifecycle can have a dramatic impact on performance later on.  Once an application is in production, correcting these issues may be time-consuming or even impossible without a complete re-write!  In this session, we learn some of the considerations that you the developer should keep in mind when designing a new database application.  Learn about some T-SQL best practices as well as how things like choice of data type, caching, looping etc. can affect the performance of your application before you even write your first query.'
