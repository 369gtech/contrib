description: "SQL databases can do a lot. They are fantastic at making it easy to work with large amounts of data. One of the lesser-known capabilities of SQL databases is that they can be used to generate fractals!\n\n\nIn this talk, we’ll take a look at how you can use the SQL features provided by Postgres to generate fractals. Through the clever use of these features, you can generate a wide range of fractals including Sierpinski’s triangle, the Mandelbrot set, and Hilbert curves.\n\n\nEVENT:\n!!Con West 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nMichael Malis\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKoYIvMFnoQ"
