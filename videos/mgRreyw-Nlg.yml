title: '"Artisanal, machine-generated API libraries" by Richard Marmorstein'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634239457
description: "Stripe recently began generating API libraries in seven different programming languages, after maintaining them by hand for eight years. We wanted the generated code to offer just as good a user experience and be no less readable than the handcrafted code, while keeping breaking changes to a minimum, so we built a tool for this ourselves: a compiler of sorts. This talk is a deep dive into how we built our tool and lessons we learned along the way.\n\nRichard Marmorstein\nStripe\n@twitchard\n\nRichard Marmorstein is an autonomous, general-purpose problem solving and entertainment system, implemented chiefly in deoxyribonucleic acid, that exposes a rich natural language interface. He presently resides in New York and works as a software engineer on the API Experience team at Stripe. When he is not API Experiencing, he is hanging out with his two dogs, Mozzarella and Gouda.\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop 2021\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"
