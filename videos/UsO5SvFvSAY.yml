description: 'There’s no shortage of advice out there for transitioning veteran job seekers – unfortunately much of the advice tends to be cookie cutter tips focusing on the most basic of topics. This program will help transitioning veterans in the cyber security industry understand the hiring landscape, highlight the difference between the recruiters who put you in the service and ones working to help you land that first job as a civilian, as well as how to leverage job boards and job fairs, including virtual events. We’ll even put some special emphasis on how to really build your professional network and manage your transition from different geographical locations.'
