title: 'Michael Feathers - Asking, Telling and Modularity - Choices in Code'
recordingDate: 1557969222
description: 'Some functions are a way of asking a question - they return values to you. Other functions tell - you use them to tell an object or another part of the system to do something, or tell it about something that has been done. Whether to ask or tell is a basic design choice, but we don''t give it much attention. Most discussion about it assumes that we are making the choice universally - we are either programming in a pure functional or an OO style. In this talk, Michael Feathers will work through code examples that show  how to use of the tell/ask choice strategically to arrive at modularity that is durable and less prone to violation. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf3'
