description: "Evaluating Mobile Messengers for Implementation Vulnerabilities\n\nNatalie Silvanovich, Security Engineer, Google\n\nMobile Messaging applications are a valuable target for attackers because vulnerabilities in these applications have the potential to allow a mobile device to be compromised without any user interaction. This talk describes Project Zero's work evaluating mobile messaging applications for security-impacting bugs. It will share techniques for finding vulnerabilities in mobile applications and give some examples of the bugs discovered using them. It will also explain how design and development decisions impacted the frequency and severity of these vulnerabilities. It will then discuss the importance of considering implementation in design, and how academic researchers can give more consideration to the implementation aspects of new technologies.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '19 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/technical-sessions"
