description: "numpy and numba are popular Python libraries for processing large quantities of data. This talk explains how numpy/numba work under the hood and how they use vectorisation to process large amounts of data extremely quickly. We use these tools to reduce the processing time of a large, real 600GB dataset from one month to 40 minutes, even when the code is run on a single Macbook Pro.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData Warsaw 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nDonald Whyte\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nPyData YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjD18EJYcsBog4IozkF_7w"
