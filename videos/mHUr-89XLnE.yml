title: 'YOW! 2014 Todd L. Montgomery - Reactive, Message-driven and Scalable'
recordingDate: 1514469313
description: "Devices and applications that connect to each other and the rest of the world have a wealth of protocol options to choose from in terms of how best to perform that connectivity. The REST model, and HTTP, has dominated for a long time. However, REST is about to get an upgrade. HTTP/2 is imminent, WebSocket is here, the needs of applications are rapidly changing, and new IoT protocols are vying for attention amongst the noise. Now is the time for new models to emerge providing end users with new richer experiences, providers with new scaling options, and developers with different approaches.\n\nLetâ€™s take a hands on, deep dive into these new protocols and see exactly what a message-driven, reactive approach might hold to evolving and reimagining some long standing issues and challenge long held beliefs. Also, be some of the first to see some new open source projects in action that leverage these new protocols and approaches.\n\nTodd Montgomery is a networking hacker who has researched, designed, and built numerous protocols, messaging-oriented middleware systems, and real-time data systems, done research for NASA, contributed to the IETF and IEEE, and co-founded two startups. He currently works as an independent consultant on high performance systems and is active in several open source projects, including Agrona, Aeron, ReactiveSocket, and the FIX Simple Binary Encoding (SBE).\n\nFor more on YOW!
