He talks about the path it took to become the language it is today and some of the interesting challenges it's faced. He then dives headfirst into some of his favorite parts of the language.\n\nMore HTML5 resources: http://crcl.to/rq9am\nProfessional HTML5 training: http://crcl.to/sclf7\n\nFollow along with Kit's slides: http://crcl.to/1m5lj"
