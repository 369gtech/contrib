description: "There's an Erlang/Elixir myth that tail-recursive functions are much faster than body-recursive functions. In this talk we will first explore how Erlang terms are represented in bit level, and then take a closer look at this myth to understand what really happens with tail-recursive functions vs body-recursive functions. You will understand more about BEAM internals and Erlang's Efficiency Guide.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/boshan-sun/"
