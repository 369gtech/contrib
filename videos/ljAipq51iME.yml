description: "End-to-End Data Science on GPUs with RAPIDS\n\nJohn Zedlewski, NVIDIA\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the impact of GPUs on the complete workflow supporting data science, and how the open source RAPIDS stack unifies ETL, analytics, and model building all within GPU memory without round trips to CPU. We'll emphasize modern networking technologies, like Dask, UCX, and Infiniband that allow this stack to scale out.\n\nView the full OpML '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/opml20/program"
