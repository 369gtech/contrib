description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nBjørn Freeman-Benson - Software Psychologist & VP Engineering, New Relic\n\nABSTRACT\nYou have too much to do each day. In fact, you have too much to do even if you worked 24x7. The solution is both very simple to describe and very hard to implement in practice: Prioritize. The problem is that the easy stuff keeps taking precedence over the hard stuff. My advice is the same as many others' advice: Make Lists. The key to my advice is how to make those lists and how to establish the habit of using them.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
