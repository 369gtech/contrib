description: "The blockchain space has seen its fair share of issues in 2018. This technology enabled anyone, anywhere to create their own market programmatically. The result was incredible innovation, many high profile scams, and a lot of hard lessons on what doesn't work. I authored a book on this space because I believed in the potential for this technology and still do. I'm going to share my vision for 2019 using the lessons learned from 2018, then demonstrate some businesses who've provided real value to people using this technology.
