description: "Beauty in Code 2020 was a single-track full day IT-conference organized by Living IT, featuring five amazing speakers from three continents. It was hosted at the Malmö Live conference center on March 7, 2020.\n\nhttps://beautyincode.se\nhttps://livingit.se\n\nSession 1 of 6 by Alistair Cockburn (https://twitter.com/TotherAlistair)\n\"Getting Back To The Heart of Agile\"\nAgile has become overly decorated, with vocabulary and rules to make your head spin. It wasn’t intended that way. In this talk, Dr. Alistair Cockburn, one of the authors of the agile manifesto, shows how to abbreviate it all to just four words: Collaborate, Deliver, Reflect, Improve. Oddly, shortening it to those four words makes it easier to learn and more broadly applicable. Not only that, it helps us find new, relevant topics, such as guest leadership and solutions focus. What’s best, these four words apply to all initiatives, not just software or product development."
