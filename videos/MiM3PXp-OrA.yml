description: "I somehow got mixed up in Mobile DevOps a few years ago, and apparently not a lot of people do it, so I get to fly around helping people improve their processes and in-house apps.\nRacing against the clock, I'll show you how to setup a skeleton Continuous Delivery pipeline for iOS and Android enterprise mobile apps; from branching strategies, code quality, testing, build, release, more testing, analytics, and crash statistics; we'll do it all in 60 mins.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
