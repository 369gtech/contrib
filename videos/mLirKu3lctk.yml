description: "Only the footsteps of god will proceed. The three trials that guard the Grail of software development Part II.\n\nJavier Mart√≠nez, Software Craftsperson at Codurance, will give some examples of the most useful patterns in our daily work and present strategies and implementations on these.\n\nThe goal is to discover the situations where some patterns will make our life easier by simplifying processes. To reach that goal we will introduce some of the most useful patterns that we need to generate high quality code with specific focus on the features that python provides.\n\nTo catch up all our events and register for the third part of the Python series, please visit: https://codurance.com/events/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=b2d_webinar&utm_content=python."
