title: 'Agile Adria 2014 / Zsolt Fabok: The Road to a Fairly Predictable System'
recordingDate: 1400319136
description: "I see agile software development methodologies (Scrum and XP) and modern management methods (Kanban) as tools for predictability. The development organisation would like to know what is coming and whether it will be the right thing to do. On the other side, the management would like to know when the new features can hit the market. Both want predictability but in a different way. At Prezi, we are on the road to a fairly predictable system that can accurately tell us what the next right thing to do will be and also when it is going to be ready. We are far from a perfect system, we had our ups and downs, but after every down we are more up than before. In my talk, I'll share our experiences with you, focusing on practices -- from portfolio Kanban to Agile techniques -- we do to be more predictable.\n\nAbout Zsolt\nZsolt is a team leader and a blogger. He has always been curious about software development processes and how to bring the best in them and create better products. When he started to get familiar with the Agile, Lean and eXtreme Programming methodologies six years ago, he immediately became an enthusiast. He spent the last four years mastering Kanban and helping large and small organizations to successfully adapt its principles. He is the founder of the Budapest Lean and Kanban Meetup and the limitedwipsociety.hu groups.\n\nAbout Agile Adria conference\n(agileadria.com)\n\nThis video is recorded at Agile Adria conference.
