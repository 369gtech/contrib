But numbers don't actually speak for themselves -- people speak for them. The interpretive layer matters -- research is not design, but design is nothing without research. And when we're really trying to understand the how, the why, and the why not; when we need to inspire creative solutions and anticipate user needs, we need to talk to real people, even if it means we only talk to a few of them, and even when they might be \"lying\"."
