description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nAt some point in your career, you will need to teach someone something about C++. You might not be a lecturer or a trainer, but you could be helping a colleague with a problem that they're solving, presenting at a lunch-time session, or even at a conference! Perhaps you're someone who is helping to write your company's style guide or \"Intro to Our Repo\" manual. Correctly teaching C++ is a tough endeavour. C++ is often taught incorrectly at the university level, via online resources, and in books. Many resources are still outdated or refuse to change with the paradigm shift that the C++ community has been undergoing over the past two decades. \n\nWe should seek to convey correct information and provide resources that are factual. We should make learning C++ an enjoyable experience, and that stems from the way in which we teach it. \n\nThis talk digs into how we can achieve some of this, but it by no means provides all the answers, and may lead to more questions.\n— \nChristopher Di Bella, Codeplay Software\nStaff Software Engineer, ComputeCpp Runtime\n\nChristopher Di Bella is a Staff Software Engineer for Codeplay’s ComputeCpp Runtime Technology. He is a strong proponent for having the Concepts TS and the Ranges TS in C++20. Chris spends his days working on ComputeCpp, Codeplay’s implementation of SYCL; the Khronos implementation for the Parallel STL (using SYCL); and researching Parallel Ranges, which is an attempt to bring the aforementioned Ranges TS together with the parallel algorithms. He was previously a software developer for Nasdaq, and a tutor for UNSW Australia’s COMP6771 Advanced C++ Programming course in Sydney, Australia. In his spare time, Chris enjoys snowboarding, playing games, and watching films.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
