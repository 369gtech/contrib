description: "For years, most Web teams have designed for the desktop. Mobile, if it even happened, was a port off the desktop version, designed and built before anyone even considered the mobile experience. This made perfect sense for a while. Browsing the Web on mobile phones was painful; carriers controlled access to the Web on their devices; and mobile network speeds made everything often grind to a halt. Designing for mobile first can not only open up new opportunities for growth, it can lead to a better overall user experience for a Web site or application.\n\nIn this webcast presentation, Luke Wroblewski will dig into the three key reasons to consider mobile first:\n\nMobile is seeing explosive growth\nMobile forces you to focus\nMobile extends your capabilities\n\nAbout Luke Wroblewski\n\nLuke Wroblewski is an internationally recognized digital product leader who has designed or contributed to software used by more than 700 million people worldwide.\n\nLuke was Co-founder and Chief Product Officer (CPO) of Bagcheck which was acquired by Twitter Inc. just nine months after being launched publicly.
