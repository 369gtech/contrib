title: 'Open Source Workflows, Business Rules and Case Management live and in action by Bernd Rücker'
language: English
recordingDate: 1447314635
description: '" If you developers cannot deliver any faster and cheaper, we will simply buy an expensive zero code BPM Suite that will solve all our problems!" – famous last words of project managers (soon before they will hopefully get fired). However, there is an interesting alternative: With developer-friendly open source BPM platforms such as Camunda you get a workflow engine based on the BPMN 2.0 standard, business rule support based on the brand new DMN standard and case management based on CMMN. All this can be used embedded as a library but also in large scale scenarios, obviously also in SOA or microservice architectures. Leverage graphical but also executable notations for a new level of transparency in your development cycle as well as in operation. This talk will give you a hands-on introduction based on a real-life example as well as experiences from various projects. Live coding included – guaranteed developer-friendly!'
