description: "Nick Burch\nhttp://berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/other-apache-technologies-your-big-data-solution-needs\n\nYou've gone to the talks on Hadoop / SOLR / NoSQL / etc, and now you're ready to start building your own solution on top of that! Before you go diving in though, we want to make sure you don't accidently end up re-inventing the wheel while building your system...\n\nIn this talk, we'll take a look at a range of projects from the Apache Software Foundation that can help in building your big data solution, alongside the headline projects. While we can't cover every project at Apache (there are just too many these days!), we'll take a tour through some of the up-coming and lesser-known established projects out there that sould prove very helpful to you in building your big data solution. We'll see that Apache is more than just the webserver, Hadoop and Lucene, and with any luck point you at projects that'll save you time!\nAbout the speaker: \nNick is heavily involved in a number of Apache projects, such as Tika, POI and Chemistry, while having the fortune to know many of the people involved in the Apache Big Data and Search space! When not helping out with Apache things, Nick works as the CTO of Quanticate, a CRO, where he tries to make the best use of Open Source technologies to solve the business's problems. Nick is a big fan of many aspects of agile and extreme development, and rapid web development frameworks such as Django. Nick is often to be found attending or organising BarCamps, Geek Nights, or other such fun events dedicated to sharing what's great and new!"
