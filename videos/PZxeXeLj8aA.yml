title: 'AppSecCali 2019 - Automated Account Takeover: The Rise of Single Request Attacks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1552330460
description: "Account takeover is growing. Attackers swoop in after credential spills and use software to automatically match breached email addresses with the top 10 most common passwords. While this approach, known as a single request attack. may appear unsophisticated, attackers commonly use headless browsers, execute JavaScript like a legitimate human user, and present dynamic client and network fingerprints. This session reviews real-world case studies where ATOs have been scaled via single request attacks.\n\nThese case studies unpack the compounding effect caused when businesses use depreciated mitigation strategies and profiles the growing incentive attackers have across other use-cases and verticals. The session scrutinizes past approaches to curbing ATO and explains why single request attacks have increased and examines tested pathways toward mitigating and preventing single request attacks.\n\n\nSpeaker\n\nKevin Gosschalk\nFounder and CEO, Arkose Labs\nKevin Gosschalk is the CEO and Founder of Arkose Labs, where he leads a team of people focused on telling computers and humans apart on the Internet.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
