description: "Alexa, Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant ... voice assistants are in fashion and have come to stay. With them it is possible to do many actions that a few years ago seemed like science fiction: controlling the lights of the house, listening to our favorite music, knowing the weather tomorrow,... controlling everything with our voice!\nIn this talk we will talk about Amazon Echo and Alexa. You will learn how easy it is to develop new skills and deploy them to AWS Lambda without spending a euro.\nI'll bring an Echo Dot to the talk to show you the fun things you can do with it. I'm pretty sure that after this talk you can't wait to have one!"
