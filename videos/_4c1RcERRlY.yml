recordingDate: 1418927400
description: "Event originally aired on June 13, 2014.  We've seen lengthy discussions about the position of women in technology for the past several months, to the point where Wired is covering debates about civility on the LKML. While it's been useful to raise awareness of issues within the open source and technical communities, I haven't seen anyone discussing why evaluating and checking one's privilege is actually good for the individual. In this talk, I will discuss why it's worth your while to understand your own innate privilege - or, as I like to think of it, 'stuff' you get that other people don't - and how doing so will make you more successful in your career and as a human being.\n\nAmongst other matters, I'll discuss:\n\nUnderstanding bias - what it is, why it is and why it is worth examining your biases\nHow to handle it when other people are \"angry\"\nHow to be a useful ally and why this makes your way much smoother\nHow to ask for more information without being an uneducated jerk\nHow to have more useful conversations with each person you meet\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to reexamine the topic through the lens of concrete things individuals can do to check their privilege - and to put it to work serving themselves and others.\n\nAbout Leslie Hawthorn\n\nAn internationally known community manager, speaker and author, Leslie Hawthorn has spent the past decade creating, cultivating and enabling open source communities.
