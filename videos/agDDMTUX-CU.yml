description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/kubernetesize-your-java-application/\n\nDeploying your Java application in a Kubernetes cluster could feel like Alice in Wonderland. You keep going down the rabbit hole and don’t know how to make that ride comfortable. This no-slide and code-only session will explain how a Java application can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. Specifically, it will explain the following:\n\n– Package the application as Docker image\n– Create Kubernetes manifests\n– Create Helm charts\n– Test in a local k8s cluster\n– Debug pods using Java IDE\n– Observability using Istio\n– Canary and A/B testing\n– Migrate application from dev to prod environments\n– Deployment pipeline on desktop and in the cloud"
