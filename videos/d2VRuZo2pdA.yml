title: '"Nim Nuggets: Systems Programming & Metaprogramming Magic" by Aditya Siram'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634155817
description: "On the surface Nim (https://nim-lang.org/) is familiar, a fast statically typed highly productive language that looks like Python, but just below the surface are cutting edge features that put it at the forefront of systems programming, interop, metaprogramming, and static introspection.\n\nThis fast paced talk will target experienced programmers new to Nim. We will look at diverse and real world bite size examples that would be difficult if not impossible in most programming languages:\n\n* Type safe web routes ( with static overlap detection! )\n* Compile time memory and resource management similar to languages like Rust\n* Smooth interop with real world template heavy C++\n* Flexible and type safe APIs with static introspection\n* Metaprogramming with types for highly customizable compile time errors and warnings\n* and possibly more if time allows!\n\nAditya Siram\nLeapYear\n@deech\n\nI am a Haskell developer at LeapYear (https://leapyear.io/) and work on Nim by candlelight. I am interested in the intersection of programming language user experience, explorability, abstractions and performance.\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop 2021\nhttps://thestrangeloop.com"
