description: "Search and Discovery at SoundCloud\nPeter Bourgon\nhttp://berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/search-and-discovery-soundcloud\n\nA short talk describing the evolution of the search and discovery infrastructure at SoundCloud. A description of some of the problems we encountered in the original, organically-developed search architecture, and how they were solved via the greenfield development of a new architecture based on ElasticSearch. A description of how we perform relevance ranking for search results, and how we can extend that ranking for other product features. An overview of SoundCloud's Service-Oriented Architecture approach to building complex systems.\n\nIdeally, the talk would conclude with plenty of time for Q&A.\nAbout the speaker: \nPeter Bourgon is a distributed systems and backend engineer at SoundCloud."
