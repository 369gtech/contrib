title: 'GeeCON 2018: Aleksey ShipilÃ«v - Java Memory Model Unlearning Experience'
language: English
recordingDate: 1532330827
description: 'This talk is another attempt at explaining the Java Memory Model (JMM). This time we would assume people come to concurrency world with their preconceptions how the world works, and conjecture that is the major reason learning the low-level concurrency is hard for them. Therefore, rather than explaining what JMM *is*, we would try to see what JMM *is not*, and this should eliminate a few misconceptions about the Java concurrency at large. This would be the *unlearning* experience! The talk would try to build simple intuitive rules that we can use every day, and would try to outline the proofs one could employ to verify those rules. We shall also see surprising behaviors that are allowed by JMM, but not by naive (mis)interpretations of it. Prerequisites: the talk assumes the audience understands basic JMM, at least on the level of ''JMM Pragmatics'' (https://shipilev.net/blog/2014/jmm-pragmatics/) . Understanding more advanced topics, like the ones discussed in ''Close Encounters of The Java Memory Model Kind'' (https://shipilev.net/blog/2016/close-encounters-of-jmm-kind/) would be a plus.'
