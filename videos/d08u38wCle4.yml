description: "This session discusses some of the work being done for JavaFX 8 in the areas of text and internationalization. It covers details of the new rich text support, demonstrating different ways it can be used and best practices for top performance. In the internationalization area, it discusses the new node orientation support, JavaFX’s answer for right-to-left scripts such as Hebrew and Arabic, and how that works with layout and text. The presentation also goes under the hood to describe how JavaFX’s Prism graphics engine handles text, and it examines the initial results for the new native text rasterizer.\n\n\nAuthor:\nFelipe Heidrich\nFelipe is an engineer on the JavaFX team at Oracle.
