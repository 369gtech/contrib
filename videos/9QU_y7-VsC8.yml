title: 'Upgrading to .NET Core: Adding JWT Authentication to Our API - A TimCo Retail Manager video'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573146011
description: "Authentication in ASP.NET Core API is different than in WebAPI. In this video, we are going to implement a JWT system so that our new API will send tokens like our old system did. We will also implement Swagger and make some other system improvements.\n\nFull Course: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/timco-retail-manager/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List Signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nOne-off tutorials are awesome but they aren't the only thing you should be doing to learn C#. Another vital part of learning is learning how to put it all together. This interactive course is all about putting the pieces together. You can watch each video on its own or you can watch them in order and see a bigger picture. The choice is yours.\n\nThis course focuses on real-world development. As such, we are simulating that we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions on a brand new product, the TimCo Retail Manager. Just like in the real world, we are starting out with one set of requirements but know that over time they will change."
