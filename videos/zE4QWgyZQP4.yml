title: 'GopherCon UK 2018: Daniela Petruzalek - The Best Feature of Go'
recordingDate: 1535661927
description: 'The Go community is definitely the best feature of the language, but how may we engage with it and become more than just a bystander on the crowd? How do we contribute to the Go language OSS? Too much for you? What about a community built library? Contributing with code is too scary? What about building samples and documenting? Maybe you are a local leader and you can start a meetup, or join an active one… Do you like to write? Record videos? Literally the options are endless, so I want to explore some of those while sharing my personal experiences with the hopes of inspiring other people to engage with the community as well.'
