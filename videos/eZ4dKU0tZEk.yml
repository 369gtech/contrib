description: "riff is an open source, event-driven, function as a service platform that we introduced at last year’s SpringOne Platform. We since partnered with Google and other industry leaders on the Knative project, and replatformed riff on top of Knative, which in turn runs on Kubernetes.\n\nriff and Knative enable new models of event-driven, serverless workloads, including:\n\n- installing riff into a clean Kubernetes cluster\nusing Knative build to convert your function’s source code into runnable container images\n\n- using Knative serving to autoscale your function from 0 to N based on events\n\n- using Knative eventing to connect your function to other functions via channels\n\nIn this session, we’ll dive into the details and present demos that show how the developer experience is just as simple as before, if not simpler.\n\nSpeakers:\nScott Andrews\nStaff Engineer, Pivotal\n\nEric Bottard\nSoftware Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
