description: "Peter Jones, author of the new book Rosenfeld Media book: Design for Care: Innovating Healthcare Experience, presents a discussion of service design in healthcare as an integrated practice of empathic design. Designers are finally starting to make inroads in the practices of clinical healthcare, but are finding institutions have no context for their contributions. Clinicians, IT, health services and patients (people seeking health) tend to live and work in disconnected systems today, and the \"best fit\" of design practice has not yet been recognized. Designing for care complements clinical care practice, improving services and creating innovative and systemic responses to complex human system problems.\n\nThe webinar maps design practices and methods found effective in different contexts across the healthcare spectra (consumer, clinical, institutional), illustrated by current cases and design research. Brief design research studies are presented to prompt our rethinking of the meanings of care, of information sensemaking in care contexts, and designing for requisite complexity.\n\nAbout Peter Jones\n\nPeter is associate professor at Toronto's OCAD University, where he is a senior fellow of the Strategic Innovation Lab and teaches in the Strategic Foresight and Innovation MDes program. He completed his doctorate in design and innovation management at The Union Institute and holds a Master's in Human Factors Psychology at University of Dayton. Design for Care: Innovating Healthcare Experience is his third book. Peter also published We Tried to Warn You (Nimble Books, 2008) and Team Design (McGraw-Hill, revised in 2002). He has authored numerous research articles and whitepapers, available online at Design Dialogues.\n\nPeter founded the innovation research firm Redesign Research in 2001, now located in Toronto. Redesign conducts design research to mobilize strategic and service innovations to advance collaborative and knowledge practices in organizations, professional practice, and service systems. Peter has designed market-leading information services in healthcare, scientific, and legal practice, and advises product development and care providing organizations on use experience and service design and innovation strategy.\n\nPeter blogs at Design Dialogues when he has a moment, and shares on Twitter as @designforcare\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
