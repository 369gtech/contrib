title: 'Deadly Sins of  .NET Developers - lecture by PIotr Spikowski - Code Europe Spring 201'
recordingDate: 1499419166
description: ".NET is a large platform on which millions of developers create their solutions every day. Modern, fast, multi-language are only a few words which may come to your mind these days. You grab the latest library, check documentation, requirements and write your code. You aim for perfection but… are you absolutely sure that you have escaped from the ghosts of the past trying to sneak into your implementation? In this session, we’d like to present some of the mistakes and anti-patterns made by .NET developers which we hope will not haunt you. We will show some common categories of mistakes found in real and large-scale applications which can be classified as .NET deadly sins. Those sins can be code, design or even architecture related. For every sin redemption should be available, thus we will also present possible solutions and ways allowing you to avoid and not to repeat those sins. Join us to get inspired how to improve your code quality!\n\nThis spring over 9400 IT specialists took part in Code Europe, the largest programming conference in Poland!
