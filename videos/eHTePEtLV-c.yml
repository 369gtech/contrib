description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/robert-virding\n\nTo successfully utilise modern multi-core machines requires a rethink in the classic way games have been implemented. Having a central control loop and sharing mutable data are no longer viable as they definitely do not scale. This talk will present one possible solution to this problem. It will show an example and also look at the some of the problems which can arise and their solutions.\n\n\nAbout Robert\n\nRobert Virding is Principal Language Expert at Erlang Solutions Ltd. While at Ericsson AB, Robert was one of the original members of the Ericsson Computer Science Lab, and co-inventor of the Erlang language. He took part in the original system design and contributed much of the original libraries, as well as to the current compiler.\n\nWhile at the lab he also did a lot of work on the implementation of logic and functional languages and on garbage collection. He has also worked as an entrepreneur and was one of the co-founders of one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail). Robert also worked a number of years at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) Modelling and Simulations Group. He co-authored the first book (Prentice-Hall) on Erlang, and is regularly invited to teach and present throughout the world."
