description: "By creating physical interfaces that interact with a web server, or web page, new innovative ways to communicate ideas can be created. It allows users to interact with an application in new ways, and allows the digital and physical to be mixed and joined together.\n\nThis talk will be an introduction to what is possible by connecting an Arduino and a web server, the code involved for passing data between the two, and the basics of using an Arduino and electronic components.
