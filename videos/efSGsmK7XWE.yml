description: "JFuture 2019, Minsk â€“ November 16, 2019\n\nJVMs in Containers: Best Practices, David Delabassee\n\nJVMs and containers are like fries and mayonnaise: better together!\nThe JVM is a popular, robust and mature platform that hosts Java and a myriad of other programming languages. Using container technologies is now the de facto way to deploy applications. In addition, emerging platforms, projects, and tools such as Knative, Jib, and Fn Project either simplify or fully abstract away building container images, which, in turn, makes leveraging containers with Java natural.\n\nThis G session presents techniques, tools, and best practices for improving the cohabitation of JVM applications running in containers. You will understand how you can better leverage one of today's most used programming platforms (the JVM) with the most common tool for deploying apps (the container)!"
