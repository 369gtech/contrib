recordingDate: 1368036189
description: "Writing a modern web app these days can sometimes feel like a tedious process; frameworks, boilerplates, abstractions, dependency management, build processes..the list of requirements for a front-end workflow appear to grow each year. \n\nWhat if however, you could automate a lot of this? \n\nThis session introduces you to the Yeoman workflow, a combination of three tools working in harmony to keep you productive on the front-end. Whether you're using JavaScript or CoffeeScript, RequireJS or script tags, this workflow can help you spend less time on process and more time on what matters -  building great web apps.\n\nWe will walk-through how to use Yo - a scaffolding tool for creating apps, Bower - a package manager for client-side dependency management and Grunt - a popular task-based build tool."
