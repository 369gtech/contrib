description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nBeyond Features\n\nAgile planning has always been a hit-and-miss affair. At one end of the scale is the soul-crushing, multiple day workshops whose output is a list of hundreds of detailed features, many of which will never see the light of day. At the other end is the continual insertion of random demands into the product backlog, with the team constantly on the defensive, never knowing what is coming next and forever switching context. Maybe features aren't the point of delivery after all. Maybe there are other kinds of work that we could recognise, schedule and track as first class citizens. Maybe this could take some of the uncertainty out of the delivery process, and give us back our sanity. Maybe.\n\nDan North, Dan North & Associates Ltd\n\nDan North uses his deep technical and organisational knowledge to help CIOs, business and software teams to deliver quickly and successfully. He puts people first and finds simple, pragmatic solutions to business and technical problems, often using lean and agile techniques. He believes most technology problems are really about communication and feedback, which explains his interest in organisational design, systems thinking and how people learn. He has been consulting, coding and coaching for over 20 years, and he occasionally blogs at http://dannorth.net/blog"
