title: 'Chris Saxon - SQL Magic - Tricks to Demonstrate SQL Features You''ve Probably Never Used'
language: English
recordingDate: 1463636711
description: "In this fun session you’ll see SQL versions of classic magic tricks. These include the cup and balls trick, where rows inserted into one table magically reappear in another, a card trick where a randomly selected “card” (row) from a “deck” (table) floats to the top of the deck and the magically changing row trick where the value returned by a query changes just by issuing a select statement! \n\nUnlike real magicians however, I’ll show you how the tricks are done. This will enable you to perform your own SQL “magic” and apply these principles when building Oracle database applications. \nThis session is intended for developers, DBAs and data modelers looking to expand their SQL skills, highlighting features that are new to 12c as well as little used existing options."
