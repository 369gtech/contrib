description: "Check out https://g.co/aiexperiments to learn more.\n\nThis is a game built with machine learning. You draw, and a neural network tries to guess what you’re drawing. Of course, it doesn’t always work. But the more you play with it, the more it will learn. It’s just one example of how you can use machine learning in fun ways. \n\nBuilt by Jonas Jongejan, Henry Rowley, Takashi Kawashima, Jongmin Kim, with friends at Google Creative Lab and Data Arts Team."
