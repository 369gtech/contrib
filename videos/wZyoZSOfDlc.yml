description: "Deep Dive: Cloud Native Buildpacks - Terence Lee, Heroku & Stephen Levine, Pivotal \n\nLearn why you need a buildpack and how to create one. We'll write a simple Python buildpack we can use to build an image from a Django app. We'll take advantage of caching and Docker layers to speed up rebuilds and deploys. Unlike Dockerfiles, buildpacks are composable. We'll create a build pipeline with our Python buildpack and the Node.js buildpack, which we'll use to prepare asset bundles. Finally, you'll learn how to rebase your application layers on a new image. This allow operators to efficiently handle the delivery of OS-level dependency upgrades. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPj2"
