description: "Casey Rosenthal, Verica.io\n\nSoftware engineering is basically rocket science, so it comes as no surprise that we can learn a lot from that industry. For example, the Challenger explosion in 1986 is a fascinating subject for study. The details of the incident are well documented from a variety of angles (engineering, political, sociotechnical, ethnographical, etc) providing a rich dataset. Highlighting a few examples from this, we can empathize with the architecture considerations and organizational issues that engineers faced at NASA during that time. There are strong, informative parallels between the events that led up to that tragic incident and how software engineers think about reliability today. As Churchill allegedly quipped, \"Never let a good crisis go to waste.\"\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
