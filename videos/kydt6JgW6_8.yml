description: "Serverless and Event-driven Applications with Cloud Foundry and OpenWhisk - Andrei Yurkevich, Altoros & Andreas Nauerz, IBM\n\nCloud Foundry represents a great platform for developing cloud-native apps. OpenWhisk is an open source serverless platform that instantly launches and scales out lightweight microservices and terminates them when they are no longer needed. It can power event-driven apps that can react to user- or machine-generated triggers to address spikes in traffic or requirements, like HA, reliability, and scalability, without the need to keep overcapacities.\n\nIn their presentation, Andreas and Andrei will talk about the sweetspots of traditional Cloud Foundry and serverless models, as well as cases where both models complement each other to create highly efficient cloud-native architectures. OpenWhisk’s core concepts, programming model, and general value proposition will be presented. Andreas and Andrei will conclude their session with a demonstration of practical examples of OpenWhisk-based end-to-end applications.\n\nAbout Andreas Nauerz\nTechnical Product Manager, IBM\n\nAbout Andrei Yurkevich\nAndrei has grown Altoros’s engineering team from zero to 250 specialists across seven development centers around the world. Currently, he is building a portfolio of experts who bring \"software assembly lines\" into organizations through training, deployment, and integration of solutions offered by the Cloud Foundry ecosystem. The team is standing behind some of the world's largest CF deployments."
