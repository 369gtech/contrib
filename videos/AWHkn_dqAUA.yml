description: "Deep Dive: Network Service Mesh (NSM) - Nikolay Nikolaev, VMware & Frederick Kautz, Doc.ai \n\nNetwork Service Mesh (NSM) is a young and ambitious project, offering solutions to many current problems around Cloud-Native Networking Connectivity in the L2/L3 layers. In this talk, we walk the audience through the process of solving practical problems with NSM using three scenarios:\n\nEnabling an existing service-based solution to run on top of NSM with no code changes\n\nBuilding a Network Service with the existing tools, with minimum coding\n\nUsing composition to build complex Network Services out of a collection of simple ones\n\nThe focus is on explaining the principles and offering practical advice on how to design for and integrate with NSM. Some source code and YAML manifest excerpts may be shown to illustrate the ideas.\n\nFinally, a quick demo of a pre-implemented example will be show a link to all examples and materials will be shared for further exploration by the audience.\n\nhttps://sched.co/NxZi"
