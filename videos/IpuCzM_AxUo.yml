description: "\"You're the one with the accent\": How to build an inclusive distributed team\n\nBuilding a distributed team is hard. As you hire engineers in other locations, processes that used to work start to fall down: alignment suffers, code reviews slow down, teams start to block on decisions, and the only person who knows how to fix the bug is currently asleep!\nOf course, there's a better way. To make a distributed team successful requires commitment and thoughtfulness. Changes in behaviour are required by all parties, not just those outside HQ, i.e. those \"with the accent\".\nIn this talk, I will share experiences from being Google Australia's first engineering hire, cofounding Twitter's NYC engineering office, lessons learned building a distributed team at my previous startup, Lexy, and early insights from Canva's approach to global teams. I will discuss strategies to empower and include your distributed team, from communication style to engineering process to hiring.\n\nI am a hands-on technology leader and repeat startup founder / advisor.\n\nMy experience has spanned key roles in early-stage startups (including acquisitions by Twitter and Canva) through to global companies like Google and Twitter, between Sydney, SF and NYC.\n\nMy skills span building a software system from scratch, through to senior management for large teams. Technically, I have an extensive background throughout the tech stack: web, product, data, distributed systems, search / recommendations, NLP, and building systems at massive scale.\n\nI am passionate about empowering engineering teams, and solving real world problems with software. I thrive when I am surrounded by smart, self-driven, empathetic humans.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
