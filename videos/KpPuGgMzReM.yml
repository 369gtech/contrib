title: 'Pushing Java EE To Amazon ECS / ECR'
language: English
recordingDate: 1487063807
description: "Hard separation between the infrastructure and business code makes Java EE application servers particularly interesting for cloud deployments. In this screencast I created, built, pushed and run in the Amazon ECS cloud a stock Java EE \"full stack\" application based on CentOS, openJDK 1.8, Payara \"Full\" (I used an image from https://github.com/AdamBien/docklands).\n\nSee you at: http://workshops.adam-bien.com, http://javaeemicro.services or at least http://airhacks.tv"
