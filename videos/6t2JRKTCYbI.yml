title: 'How I learned to stop worrying and love the Polymer toolbox (Polymer Summit 2016)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1476728919
description: "Think of your favorite app. It's probably meowni.ca/emojillate (who can blame you), but if it isn't (and we need to talk) it probably has one, if not all, of these things: a database; a potential for disaster, with many users looking at and clicking on the same data; offline support, a responsive layout while preferably being faster than the average bear. Recreating this experience from scratch might sound like a terrifying experience, but I'm going to show you how the polymer toolbox and a few other already-built elements can help you go from zero to hero and build a PWA in no time.\n\nMissed the summit?
