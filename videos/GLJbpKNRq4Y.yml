title: 'Application Modernization: Migrating Mainframe Apps to the Cloud Using Spring'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632325415
description: "Mainframes have been the engine for data processing for over 50 years, but we have reached that time where we move our applications off of the mainframe to new infrastructure, to the cloud, or a hybrid approach. \n \n But what tools do we have at our disposal to migrate our COBOL applications from the mainframe to these new platforms? \n \n This is where the Spring ecosystem provides the tools to help with this migration. \n \n In this discussion, we will show you how Spring and its ecosystem can help with migrating applications from the mainframe to your new platform. \n \n Projects such as Spring Batch, Spring Cloud, and Spring Boot, can be used to simplify this migration process.\n\nGlenn Renfro, Spring Developer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/application-modernization-migrating-mainframe-apps-to-the-cloud-using-spring"
