description: "Python provides a powerful platform for working with data, but often the most straightforward data analysis can be painfully slow. When used effectively, though, Python can be as fast as even compiled languages like C. This talk presents an overview of how to effectively approach optimization of numerical code in Python, touching on tools like numpy, pandas, scipy, cython, numba, and more.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyCon 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJake VanderPlas\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video."
