title: '"Revisiting Cross-Stitch generation with a restricted palette" - Jill Rowling (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1578987031
description: "Jill Rowling\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/172/\n\nWould you use natural colours in your artwork? This brief talk will show a method to create and then use a restricted (sepia tone) palette with an existing python Cross Stitch generator, \"Experiment 626\" by Katie McLaughlin, to generate a graph for a cross-stitch artwork using natural alpaca fibre colours. This talk will mention some of the good, odd and strange things that happen, and some work-arounds.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 14:40:00 2020 at Room 5"
