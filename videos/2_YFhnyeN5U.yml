title: 'SQL Server 2019 Improves Scalar UDF Performance | Data Exposed: MVP Edition'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597161600
description: "Microsoft added several features to SQL Server 2019 that can improve performance without changes to code. One of these is T-SQL Scalar UDF Inlining. The use of UDFs is a red flag when tuning queries, but, in some cases, the engine will treat these as if the underlining code was added directly to the select statement. Tune in to this session with Kathi Kellenberger to see when this new feature will help, and, more importantly, when it won't.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:10 What are UDFs?\n1:47 Performance Issues\n2:30 UDF Scalar Inlining\n3:15 Demos\n11:40 Control when inling is used\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Resources:\nScalar UDF Inlining: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/user-defined-functions/scalar-udf-inlining?view=sql-server-ver15?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner\nGet Your Scalar UDFs to Run Faster Without Code Changes: https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/performance/get-your-scalar-udfs-to-run-faster-without-code-changes/?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner\n\nAbout Kathi Kellenberger:\nKathi Kellenberger is the editor of Simple Talk at Redgate and a Data Platform MVP.
