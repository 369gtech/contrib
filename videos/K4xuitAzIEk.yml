description: "Leveraging Web 2.0 Design Patterns For Enhanced Accessibility\r\nT. V. Raman (Google)\r\n\r\nHTML DOM+ JavaScript constitutes the assembly language of Web Applications. Access To Rich Internet Applications --- ARIA --- adds in a couple of additional op-codes for helping Web applications better communicate with adaptive technologies such as screenreaders. How do we now push the envelope with respect\r\nto Web applications and adaptive technologies such as screenreaders and self-voicing browsers in a manner similar to what we as Web developers have collectively achieved for the mainstream user?\r\n\r\nThis session will demonstrate programming techniques that help Web developers experiment with and build in the latest accessibility techniques into their Web applications. We will base this session on project Google-AxsJAX.\r\n\r\nDevelopers should know JavaScript, but session doesn't require deep AJAX hackery."
