language: English
recordingDate: 1433260078
description: "You have started to hear about microservices, evented async servers, and WebSocket. Now be prepared to jump in with Vert.x. This session presents a basic introduction to Vert.x and its architecture. The presenter spins up a Vert.x server in less than three minutes in the cloud and then shows how he built a WebSocket asset tracking application with Leaflet and a Vert.x back-end application. He builds an application that pushes real-time flight tracking data to all the browsers in the room. At the end of the session, you should be able to go home and start writing your own scalable, (a)synchronous, WebSocket-enabled map tracking application\n\n\nAuthor:\nSteven Pousty\nSteve is a Dad, Son, Partner, and PaaS Dust Spreader (aka developer evangelist) with OpenShift.
