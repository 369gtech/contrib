title: '"Shaping our children''s education in computing" by Simon Peyton Jones'
language: English
recordingDate: 1539201127
description: "Few things matter more to us than the education we give our children, to equip them for life in a rapidly changing world.\n\nIn our subject discipline, everything is in flux. England, for example, has radically overhauled the school computing curriculum, and is now facing the challenge of helping our teachers to teach an entirely new school subject. Most other countries are in the midst of a similar revolution.\n\nBut our childrens' education is much too important to leave to governments and policymakers. There is much to play for, and we need to roll up our sleeves and get involved. How can we do that? In my talk I'll share a bit about our journey in the UK, and talk about what we can do, including some concrete examples: Project Quantum, and Excel.\n\nSpeaker: Simon Peyton Jones"
