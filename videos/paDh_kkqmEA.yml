This established a philosophy of protecting data indefinitely, maximizing data, and championing more is better. Now overwhelmed and flooded with data, do we need a more balanced approach? Do we need an end for data?\nJoe Macleod talks about a recent project with Markus Buhmann and Ana Lopez Niharra, looking at ends in data. Sharing the benefits and opportunities of data purging as a solution for some of society's biggest problems. The talk provides arguments from a technical, business, and consumer experience perspective.\_It recommends a variety of techniques, models, and solutions to help balance the bomb-proof data obsession.\_\nJoe is founder of the worlds first customer ending business.
