recordingDate: 1380642225
description: "Go over GLEW and adding GLEW path/library to our project. Correcting program crash due to memory access violation that is caused by the nullification of OpenGL function pointer. The fix is for user who can't run the program shown in the Game Engine Development video 6. This video supplement the Game Engine Development video number 6.\n\nNOTE: I finally realized I need to enlarge the font size in VS so the code can be seen with clarity when recorded. \nPlease download the source file to this video. The source file contains the full algorithm from the Game Engine Development video #6 up to video #17 NOT including the Google test code. I mark clearly, by using comment, which code to use for which video. Sorry for the minor confusion.\nHere's the link to download the source: \nhttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-DD5Evwje27cWpqOXpsX3hHQUk/edit?usp=sharing"
