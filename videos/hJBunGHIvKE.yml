description: 'Most of us have knowledge of PCB construction. In the past reversing someone''s design was an easy task due to the simplicity of the PCB design. Now with BGA''s( Ball Grid Array''s), manufacturers using several plane layers cover the entire PCB design and obscuring the details of the PCB from view. Thru the use of X-Ray, we are able to reverse engineer virtually anything. Slides will be presented show several PCB designs and how easy it was to reverse engineer the PCB. Also presenting videos of live views and dynamic zoom; this will demonstrate the true power of the X-Ray and its ability to see sub-micron features within the PCB structure and devices while manipulating the PCB.'
