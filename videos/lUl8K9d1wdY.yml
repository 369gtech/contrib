description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKeynote: Securing Open Source - David A. Wheeler, Director, Open Source Supply Chain Security, The Linux Foundation\n\nThe subversion of SolarWinds’ Orion build system, dependency confusion attacks, and event-stream's subversion make it clear that attackers can successfully attack systems by attacking their supply chains, and attackers have not stopped attacking vulnerabilities in software developed & deployed. This talk will briefly discuss the software supply chain environment, some countermeasures, and some ongoing activities to reduce risks from software vulnerabilities and the software supply chain. The good news is that there are ways to counter such attacks, but they will require changes in how we do software development, selection, and deployment."
