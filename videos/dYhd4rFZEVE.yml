Feature flags can be your lifesaver!\nWe strive to get new features to the hands of our users as fast as we sustainably can. Some features can take longer to develop and touch other parts of the system. If not handled with care, these kinds of features can result in merge conflicts that keep developers up all night, not to mention the dreaded system failures following a big release. Equipped with feature flags, we can avoid this nightmare and continuously deploy code changes safely.\nThis talk consists of practical tips on how to use feature flags as release toggles.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 🏆 🏆  Platinum Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\n🏆 🏆  Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nHarness → https://harness.io/\nBuddy → https://buddy.works/\nSonarSource → https://www.sonarsource.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nSentry → https://sentry.io\n\n🏆  Silver Sponsors\nMoogsoft → https://www.moogsoft.com/"
