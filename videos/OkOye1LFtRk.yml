title: 'Ahmet Akdag - Tracking Agility with Agility Path Framework'
recordingDate: 1381523069
description: 'Agility became a "must have" rather than a "need or alternative". It''s a very effective way to survive in complex environments. As the Agile people, we''ve been coaching teams and consulting companies for Agility for years and yet organizations are still desperate to be Agile in the long term. Agility Path is a tool designed by Scrum.org upon John P. Cotter''s cultural change principles and is a framework to manage, sustain and improve Agility. Thus this presentation will be focusing on sustaining and maintaing the change while defining the need for Agility from a business perspective at beginning and digging into the IT organization''s Agility journey.'
