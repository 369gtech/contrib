title: 'YOW! Nights June 2015 Kevin Lynagh - Using ClojureScript w/ Heavy Industrial Equipment'
language: English
recordingDate: 1437002863
description: "Keming Labs, Kevin Lynagh’s company, was commissioned by a client in the energy sector to design and build a custom heavy equipment inspection tool. The tool was designed with Harel Statecharts and implemented with ClojureScript running on an Android device.\n\nIn this talk, Kevin will discuss this approach; in particular, how explicit immutable data yielded fast, on-device prototyping, easy-to-implement visual testing tools, and improved cohesion between developers, designers, and the end customers.\n\nKevin Lynagh is a Portland, Oregon-based designer and computerist. Kevin is also an active contributor to the Clojure/Clojure Script community and a popular UX, Clojure and Maker speaker. Kevin has contributed patches to the ClojureScript compiler itself and has build one of the first ClojureScript iPhone apps back in 2013 which striking design got him great press including on the New York Times, Guardian and Wired. Kevin has also designed software for wind turbine technicians, bioinformaticians, meteorologists, and manufacturers of hipster housewares."
