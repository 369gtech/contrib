title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Speedy Testing with Cypress'
recordingDate: 1523570737
description: "One of the biggest hurdles to testing your site is the time it takes to get a solid testing foundation in place. Cypress lets you hit the ground running with a complete open source solution that replaces the Selenium stack end-to-end.\n\nCypress is simple enough that you will write and run your first test in the first few minutes you use it. It uses a language you’re familiar with (JavaScript), a browser you trust (Chrome), a familiar assertion library, and creates easily consumable, readable errors. Tests run in front of you in real time and deliver debuggable results that make it easy to track down any point of failure.\n\nThis session will focus on:\n\n\n\nInstalling Cypress\nWriting and Running Basic Tests\nReviewing History on Completed Tests (it’s like time travel!)\nDebugging using DevTools\nRunning Cypress in Continuous Integration (CI)\nUsing the Cypress Dashboard to Record and Share Test Runs\n\n\nSession attendees should expect some technical demonstrations with coding but do not need to have experience with writing tests specifically."
