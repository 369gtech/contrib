Apache Flink provides many high and low level api’s for writing a wide breadth of stateful streaming applications. However, as applications get more complex they can become harder to understand and debug. This talk will discuss best practices for writing well tested streaming applications with an eye towards working with stateful operators and validating against failure. We will do this by walking through the world’s most thoroughly tested implementation of word count.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
