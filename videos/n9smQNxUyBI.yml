description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nThere's a formal process for sending proposals for the Kotlin language, and it's called KEEP (Kotlin Evolution and Enhancement Process).\n\nDuring this year we've been making good use of it from the Arrow maintainers team, since we've filed the KEEP-87, where we propose support for compile time validation and dependency resolution. But no fear! we'll not talk about FP here, just about the complete pipeline we went through to get it done. We've learned a lot during the process, and would love to share our experience.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn\n- What's the KEEP and why it's important.\n- Why and how to file a new proposal for the language.\n- The importance of having initial feedback before tackling the issue. (We got it from people in the Kotlin compiler team).\n- How the Kotlin repository is organized and where you should look at to implement your proposal.\n- Which pieces of code we needed to modify and how to achieve our goal (error loggers, argument generators ...etc.)\n- How to iterate over it once the initial draft is presented by getting in the JetBrains feedback loop.\n- Helping to maintain and evolve the language as a community effort.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenters:\nAmanda Hinchman-Dominguez is a Kotlin Engineer at 47 Degrees specializing in web development and Android. Currently, her primary focus is research on Kotlin meta-programming and maintaining the Arrow open-source library. As an active participant in the Kotlin community, Amanda organizes the Chicago KUG, writes tech blogs, and contributes to a variety of OSS projects. In her spare time, she practices hot yoga and enjoys hanging out with her three parakeets.\n\nRaquel M. Carmena is an experienced Software Engineer working for 47 Degrees in Spain. She currently serves as a maintainer of the Arrow open-source library designed to bring typed functional programming to Kotlin and is working on important research involving metaprogramming in the language. Her drive to enter the world of programming started when she discovered a punched card in a cookbook from her mother's career as a developer in the 70's."
