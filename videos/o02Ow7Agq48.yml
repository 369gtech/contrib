description: "Alice Yuan, Software Engineer Beginner Best Practices / Code Quality, Pinterest\n\nCOMMON POOR CODING PATTERNS AND HOW TO AVOID THEM\nBeginner / Best Practices / Code Quality / Talk\n\nEvery engineer has great intentions when diving into a codebase. You want to make the code beautiful easy to read and modular. However as time passes and new feature and quick bug fixes are put in somehow your android codebase turned into a mess of multiple levels of inheritance of views and fragments and you're stuck wondering how you ended up here in the first place. In my talk I will share with you common poor patterns that every developer first makes when developing in android and the alternative architecture patterns to ensuring clean code. All these mistakes previously existed within the Pinterest codebase! We will talk about listeners event driven paradigms and clean architecture."
