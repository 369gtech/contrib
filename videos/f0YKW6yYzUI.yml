description: "As a developer you don’t want to just build any app but build apps that are secure, scalable and most importantly, useful for your consumers. So, you use microservices architecture to de-couple your application and expose functionalities as APIs. But, how would know if your APIs are secure and scalable? Do you know who is using your APIs or if someone is even using them?\nJoin us to learn how to use APIs the right way to enhance the value of your microservices architecture. In this session, we will cover:\n1. How to manage end-to-end API lifecycle\n2. Don’t just build apps, build the right apps\n3. Accelerating the consumption of APIs built on Cloud Foundry\n\nSpeakers:\nPrithpal Bhogill\nProduct Manager, Google\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
