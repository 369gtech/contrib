title: 'Boris D''Amato - Networking the Kotlin way: Retrofit + Coroutines'
recordingDate: 1555576048
description: "You probably already know what Retrofit is and most likely you've been using it in conjunction with RxJava to handle asynchronous and concurrent network requests, but what if I told you there is an alternative and easier way?\n\nIn this talk we'll be looking at another combination: Retrofit + Kotlin's coroutines!\nWe'll be exploring why coroutines make a perfect match with Retrofit and how to migrate to them from an existing RxJava implementation with testing."
