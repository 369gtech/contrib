description: "Collecting input from a user is a very important part of building an app. In HTML, you use input elements to do so. Weâ€™ll show how to use the v-model directive to create a so-called double binding. This will allow us to sync between the UI and the Vue application and ensure any user input is stored in our component as state.\n\nSample code: https://github.com/microsoft/vue-beginners-videos \nLearn Path: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/vue-first-steps/  \nNode: https://nodejs.org/  \nNPM: https://www.npmjs.com/  \nVue CLI: https://cli.vuejs.org/"
