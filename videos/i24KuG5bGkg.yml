language: English
recordingDate: 1591129456
description: "Upgrading to a new release is one of the most disruptive operations we regularly inflict on our Kubernetes clusters. There are multiple strategies for doing an upgrade, but they all require rescheduling workloads and restarting cluster components.\n\nIn this talk we will share lessons from a year of automated Kubernetes upgrades: how we upgrade, what can go wrong, and tips for keeping your workloads running smoothly through this disruptive process. We hope these lessons will help others avoid pain in their Kubernetes upgrades.\n\nPresenter:\n\nAdam Wolfe Gordon, Senior Software Engineer @DigitalOcean"
