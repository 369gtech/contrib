title: '#HITBLockdown D2 - Documents Of Doom: Infecting Macos Via Office Macros - Patrick Wardle'
language: English
recordingDate: 1591140877
description: "In this talk, we will begin by analyzing recent macro-based attacks that target Apple’s desktop OS, highlighting their macOS-specific exploit code and payloads. Next, we’ll detail a novel exploit chain, that starts with CVE-2019-1457, leverages a new sandbox escape and a full bypass of Apple’s stringent notarization requirements. Triggered by simply opening a malicious (macro-laced) Office document, no other user interaction required, in order to persistently infect even a fully-patched macOS Catalina system.\n\n===\n\nPatrick Wardle is a Principle Security Researcher at Jamf and the founder of Objective-See. Having worked at NASA and the NSA, as well as presented at countless security conferences, he is intimately familiar with aliens, spies, and talking nerdy. Patrick is passionate about all things related to macOS security and thus spends his days finding Apple 0days, analyzing macOS malware and writing free open-source security tools to protect Mac users."
