description: "The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations 2020 Certified Associate exam shows that you understand the core concepts and terminologies of a cloud platform, such as identity access management, virtual cloud networks, compute and storage services.\n\nWhy should you get this certificate?\n--Expand your knowledge base and validate your skills to appeal to potential employers.\n--Improve your potential earning power to command a higher salary.\n--Learn to perform complex, hands-on activities through lab, study and practice sessions.\n--Access a secure digital badge you can add to your social media profiles.\n--Gain exposure to a wide variety of important features, functions and tasks to use on the job.\n--Command a higher average salary compared to non-certified colleagues.\n\nAnd here are some more surprising rewards:\n—Ideas for better solutions to your own job tasks\n—Networking with a team in order to pass the exam\n—Feeling of accomplishment\n—Insights into the world of online learning, which is a vast new frontier as the old model falls apart\n\nIt's proven that for many (if not all) of us, silly things like badges, certificates, diplomas and check marks actually give a dopamine hit. You may know people who play the academic game well, and keep going back for more degrees (though these days that’s an expensive pastime). Well, this is much easier. And cheaper!\n\nI'm Alexa Morales, a director of developer content for Oracle, and these are my non-technical tips for finding the right resources, in the right order, so you can prepare, review, and pass this exam!\n\nOracle Learning Pathway\nhttps://learn.oracle.com/ols/learning-path/understand-oci-foundations/35644/75258\n\nStudy Guide\nhttps://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/cloud/oci-foundations-associate-certification-2020-study-guide.pdf\n\nLive OCI Lab\nhttps://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?p180_id=648\n\nUdemy Course\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/ocifoundations/learn/quiz/4977772#overview\n\nTips from Review N Prep\nhttps://reviewnprep.com/certificate-review-details/299\n\nMore information from Oracle University\nhttps://learn.oracle.com/ols/course/prepare-for-oci-foundations-2020-associate-certification/35644/79056/108408\n\nFree Cloud Trial\nhttps://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/\nhttp://cloudtraining.oraclecorp.com/\n\nWatch these YouTube videos at the end of this post under “Finally”: https://reviewnprep.com/certificate-review-details/299."
