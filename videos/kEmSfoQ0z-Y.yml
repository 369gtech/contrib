description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #27\n11 September 2019\nSponsored and Hosted by Salesforce\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nPython is one of the top preferred languages for creating AI applications. The large number of frameworks and libraries available for machine learning, its flexibility and the big community are only part of the reasons why python is so popular among data scientists.\nAt the same time, more and more of these python-based AI applications are running in production and need to support large-scale data.\nBuilding python code that handles large scale while still keeping the code simple and concise is a complicated task.\nWe will describe the different challenges that we tackle with respect to scale and give concrete examples from Salesforce Einstein - a python-based AI solution dealing with massive amounts of data.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
