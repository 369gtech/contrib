description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nThis talk will focus on C++ function templates and such allied topics as compiler-synthesized function template declarations/signatures, overload resolution and partial ordering of these declarations, and compiler instantiation of function template definitions. \n\nWe’ll also look at function template specialization, explaining why to avoid explicit ones, and recommending what to do instead. \n\nFinally, time permitting, we’ll offer advice for customizing function templates in the standard library, especially in light of recent WG21 developments re customization points.\n— \nWalter E. Brown\nretired\nWith broad experience in industry, academia, consulting, and research, Dr. Walter E. Brown has been a C++ programmer for over thirty-five years, joining the C++ standards effort in 2000. Among numerous other contributions, he is responsible for introducing such now-standard C++ library features as cbegin/cend, common_type, gcd, and void_t, as well as headers ?random? and ?ratio?. He has also significantly impacted such core language features as alias templates, contextual conversions, variable templates, and static_assert. He conceived and served as project editor for the International Standard on Mathematical Special Functions in C++, now part of C++17.When not playing with his grandchildren, Dr. Brown is an Emeritus participant in the C++ standards process, with several more core and library proposals under consideration.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
