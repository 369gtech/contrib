description: "The design behind an equally clean and intuitive REST + JSON API is no easy feat. For one, you've got to worry about resources, collections of resources, pagination, query parameters, references to other resources, which HTTP Methods to use, HTTP Caching, security, and a lot more! You also have to make sure it lasts and doesn't break clients as you add features over time.\n\nThis in depth conversation from JAX Conf, with Les Hazlewood, addresses some of these tricky questions, sharing some of things he's learned while designing and implementing JSON-based REST APIs.\n\n**For more free Java resources: http://marakana.com/s/tags/java"
