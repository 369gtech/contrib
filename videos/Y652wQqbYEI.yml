description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nWith the current three-year pace of C++ releases, the next release is scheduled for 2020, C++20. This presentation gives an overview of what you can expect in the new standard. It starts with discussing the C++20 language features that will be added by the C++20 standard, such as concepts, coroutines, templated lambdas, the spaceship operator, pack expansion in lambda captures, string literals as template parameters, extra initializer for range-based for loop, modules, and more. Next, we'll delve into the new Standard Library features, such as ranges, std::span, atomic smart pointers, and more. Depending on the outcome of the next C++ Standard Committee meeting, the list of new features might include improved futures, task blocks, and text formatting. If you want a concise overview of what the C++20 standard will offer, then this presentation is for you.\n— \nMarc Gregoire\nNikon Metrology\nSoftware Architect\nBelgium\n\nMarc Gregoire is a software architect from Belgium.
