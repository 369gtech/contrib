title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays 58 - The road to Native Images – what can trip me up? With Dan Dobrin'
language: English
recordingDate: 1626062410
description: "Increased cloud adoption by deploying modern apps in K8s opens up entire new sets of use-cases for enterprises on a constant basis. Hence the need to create lightweight and efficient containers that start almost instantly and consume less memory and CPU by orders of magnitude.\n\nNative Images are the next chapter of Spring’s innovation journey in the K8s world. Can Spring Native with GraalVM make the migration to native images seamless? Is there anything that could potentially trip us up? What do we need to know when migrating apps to native? Can we learn to write better Java code in the process?\n\nLet’s answer these questions by looking into:\n\nHow does Just-in-time vs Ahead-of-time compilation compare?\nUnderstanding Runtime vs Build-Time Class Initialization for Spring Native Images\nAhead-of-time compilation limitations - what do I need to know and how is Spring Native helping me to mitigate them?\nWhat’s working differently for some of the Java’s features in Native Images?\nCan we learn to write better Java code in the process?\nAs developers we learn by example … let’s use some practical ones… then explore the topic further at our leisure with a comprehensive set as reference…\n\n---\nDan Dobrin is an architect in the VMware Tanzu team, helping developers, architects and enterprises adopt modern patterns, practices and technologies including Tanzu, Kubernetes, Spring, Event-driven Architecture, and CI/CD. Prior to joining Pivotal/VMware, he has built high-performance, flexible frameworks for security and financial services organizations. An avid learner, he’s always looking for the next practical idea to experiment and share with a client. When he leaves the gadgets behind, you’ll find him hiking with his children, running a marathon, biking on a trail or reading a good book.\nhttps://twitter.com/ddobrin"
