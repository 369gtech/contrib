description: "Value Stream Mapping: Streamline Processes and Release Faster\n\nAlexa Alley, DevOps Program Manager, Hearst\n\nValue Stream Mapping can streamline development processes and workflows. This talk will cover how Hearst has done internal Value Stream Mapping workshops to improve team collaboration and release times. \n\nIn this talk, I will discuss Value Stream Mapping and how it has helped transform internal processes for businesses within Hearst to adopt a DevOps culture. I’ll walk through the successes and learning experiences we’ve gained by holding VSM sessions at different businesses, in varying verticals at Hearst. We will review real examples of workflows, release times, benefits to the contributors and business, and how the collaboration has helped teams. While there are great successes, I will also share where we saw room for improvement and how we continually make changes to bring the most value to our teams. The most important value is how these have helped to start building a DevOps mindset in a company of over 25,000 employees.\n\nDOES16 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
