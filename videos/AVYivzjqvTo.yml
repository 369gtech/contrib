description: "Administrators are facing challenges trying to operationalize Kubernetes. Where do you start? Build a cluster from scratch? How hard is it to repeat? What steps and variables are involved in the process? How about security, networking, and storage concerns? Is it still easily manageable and scalable?\n\nThis session will dive in by creating our first Kubernetes cluster the open-source way. We'll review the choices one has to make when architecting a solution, then create our first cluster using the vSphere driver and Kubeadm. Then we'll evaluate how the VMware PKS Platform (Essential, Enterprise, and Cloud) can enhance the Kubernetes experience by examining all the angles of lifecycle management from repeatable cluster creation to ongoing operations.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2oUfP1V\n\nSpeakers: Kenny Coleman, Open Source Technical Product Manager, VMware\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/kubernetes-and-windows-at-scale-with-enterprise-pks"
