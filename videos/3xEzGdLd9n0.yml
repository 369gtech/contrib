description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/yiibu/muddling-through-the-mobile-web\n\nIn merely ten years we've gone from delivering basic WAP experiences on tiny monochrome screens, to crafting simply stunning content and applications for devices many of us imagined we'd only dream of. The fact that time-to-market for many of these devices is now measured in weeks instead of years, is simply mind-blowing. Add to that the renewed and rapid evolution of web standards, and it's become increasingly difficult to find solid ground from which to move forward.\n\nThis talk will pick up where \"Rethinking the Mobile Web\" left off, looking at the evolving device ecosystem, the inherent constraints of the current web, and the need for us to continue adapting our thinking when confronted with massive change.\n\nAbout Bryan: https://bryanrieger.com\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
