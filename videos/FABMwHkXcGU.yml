description: 'Security are happening every day. Some make it to the news, some don''t. The question is: do you want your company to be in the news? Guess not. Security can be enforced at multiple levels, but we will focus on the basic one: in the code. In the talk, Isabelle explains why developers need to care about security, which tools are their disposal and demo several approaches to basically hack yourself, because somebody (or something!) out there is already trying or planning to.'
