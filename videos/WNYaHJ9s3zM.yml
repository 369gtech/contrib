title: 'So You Wanna Do Security With Microservices, eh'
language: English
recordingDate: 1546114053
description: "Equifax, Yahoo, the NSA, IHG, Hyatt, Uber, and eBay are just a few of the over 100 companies that reported security and data privacy breaches in 2017. For many organizations, the perimeter firewall has been the only required security, but with the move to cloud, no longer can users rely on a firewall as the only means of defense. Instead, we need to adopt defense in depth and rethink the way we do security in microservices. Just like DevOps, this is a collaborative process that requires changes throughout the stack from developers, operators, security professionals, and executives.\n\nHackers are getting more sophisticated in their attacks. As a result, we need a strong recipe to reduce the threat of intrusion, a mechanism for detecting security breaches and anomalies, and a process for quickly responding to security incidents (“break glass”).\n\nSeth Vargo outlines the key principles for securing microservices and distributed systems in the modern world, where applications run in cloud or hybrid cloud infrastructure. You’ll learn the challenges associated with microservices and the principles of secure applications (think 12-factor apps, but for security); you’ll also discover how to implement time-based, limited-access controls and capture security practices and policy as code. \n\nEVENT:\n\nBuild Stuff 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSeth Vargo\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nBuild Stuff Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
