description: "Surviving the \"Script-apocalypse\"\n\nAvan Mathur, Product Manager, ElectricFlow, Electric Cloud \n\nScripts are not automation. But scripts are pretty much unavoidable in DevOps. From CI, provisioning VMs, test automation, deployment, monitoring – scripts are everywhere. \n\nLarge organizations often experience a “Script-apocalypse”, where teams are buried in – and spend a large portion of their time attending to – sprawled, spaghetti, snowflake, nested, ancient scripts. That seem to have a life of their own…\n\nThis problem is aggravated not just by the sheer scale of teams/releases that enterprises need to support, but because many of those involve legacy applications and legacy IT processes. This makes DevOps scripts’ sprawl a key bottleneck to getting to predictable IT processes and accelerating your delivery pipeline. While we don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water, maturing your use of DevOps scripts is critical to streamlining your processes and scaling DevOps throughout the organization.\n\nThis talk covers best practices and emerging patterns - covering DevOps automation, Pipeline design and Organizational design approaches  - gathered from large enterprises that have managed to climb out of scripting hell. Come learn tips and hard-won lessons for surviving your own “script-apocalypse”!\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
