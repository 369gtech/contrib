title: '#HITBCyberWeek D2T2 - RAMN: Resistant Automotive Miniature Network'
language: English
recordingDate: 1607243340
description: "We developed RAMN, an inexpensive open-source testbed the size of a credit card, that can be used for research and education in automotive security. RAMN is a CAN/CAN-FD network of four Electronic Control Units (ECU) that can be programmed to simulate an active automotive network in closed-loop with the autonomous driving simulator CARLA (also open-source). What happens in the virtual world has an impact on the physical CAN/CAN-FD bus, and vice-versa.\n\nRAMN is powered over USB and can act as a standard CAN/CAN-FD adapter: no other tools are needed to get started. It is contained within one PCB, using only two layers and hand-solderable components, making it accessible to students and beginners in electronics. With its small size, it can fit into most testing equipment, and is also perfect to work/study from home.\n\nRAMN is designed using mostly automotive grade components: it can resist temperatures in the range of -40 to 125 degrees Celsius. As such, it can operate in almost the same conditions as real ECUs (e.g. engine compartment). Researchers can easily add new functionalities using an Arduino-style pin header. As examples, we developed expansion boards for sensors/actuators, TPM, external memories and debuggers. Because it is inexpensive, researchers can own many testbeds to evaluate the impact of manufacturing tolerances, and perform potentially destructive attacks without worrying about their budget. RAMN can also easily be interfaced with popular tools such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, Chip Whisperer, etc.\n\nWe hope such a platform can be useful to automotive security enthusiasts and professionals, and eventually enable them to make a measurable positive impact on the automotive industry.\n\n\n=== \n\nSenior Researcher at Toyota Motor Corporation and Invited Researcher at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Japan). Camille has previous experience working as an automotive ECU designer and as an automotive penetration tester. He is currently working on innovative automotive security technologies, and on making it easier for hackers to contribute positively.\n\n--- \n\nTsuyoshi Toyama acquired his Ph.D in information science at Yokohama National University Graduate School in 2012. At the university, he studied information security as the main theme. After obtaining his Ph.D, he joined TOYOTA InfoTechnology Center (now part of Toyota Motor Corporation) in 2013 after undergoing research work at a university for one year. Current hot topics such as Connected Car and Autonomous Vehicle in the automotive industry bring high convenience to users; however, there is a possibility that the threats of Cyber Security are potentially hidden in any of them. He is not only working on existing threats, but also tackling future threats. His research products also have a possibility to be effective educational tools.\n\n---  \n\nHisashi Oguma received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan in 1997, 1999, and 2002 respectively. In 2002 he joined NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan, where he was engaged in research on ubiquitous services using sensor networks and mobile terminal security. In 2007 he joined Toyota InfoTechnology Center Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan (now part of Toyota Motor Corporation). He is currently a group leader of the cybersecurity group in the solution research division. His current research interests include cybersecurity technologies related to vehicular systems. He is a member of IPSJ."
