title: 'ScalaSphere: Journey to the holy grail – Scala faster and smaller by Rodrigo Fernandes'
recordingDate: 1571730625
description: "Scala development is notoriously plagued by its long compilation times and large deployment artifacts.\nThis gets even worse if you are using Docker, considering you need a full Java Runtime, your package can take almost 100 megabytes.\nIn the first quarter of 2018 Oracle publicly announced a project they had been working for 6 years called GraalVM.\nThis talk will take you in a small journey on how to make (especially short-lived​) Scala applications faster and smaller taking advantage of GraalVM native-image."
