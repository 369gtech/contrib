title: 'Keep It Simple with Scala'

description: "Many people probably wouldn’t describe Scala as  simple.  In three live coding demos (hopefully at least one will work), this presentation tries to convince you otherwise. You’ll see three scenarios in which, instead of complex code, Scala, with the help of some libraries, offers simple and elegant designs. The session covers\n\n&bull; Writing fully asynchronous code as if it were synchronous, using Futures and Scala Async\n\n&bull; Doing dependency injection without a framework, using MacWire\n\n&bull; Building and testing a REST server with Spray\n\n\nAuthor:\nAdam Warski\nI am one of the co-founders of SoftwareMill, a company specialising in delivering customised software solutions. I code mostly on the back-end using Scala, with an occasional foray into frontend/devops and other languages. I created a couple of open-source projects, such as Hibernate Envers, ElasticMQ, Veripacks and MacWire. I have been a speaker at major conferences, such as Devoxx, JavaZone, JFokus or Jazoon.\n\nApart from writing closed- and open-source software, I am interested in improving the way we use functional and object-oriented programming. When not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking in the mountains or playing tennis.\n\nI am also writing a technical blog (http://www.warski.org/blog) on a variety of interesting IT-related subjects.\nView more trainings by Adam Warski at https://www.parleys.com/author/adam-warski\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
