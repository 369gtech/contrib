description: "Can software development concepts overwhelm a 10-year-old? Apparently not! Minecraft, a multiplayer game about placing blocks in a 3-D environment, includes modifications (known as  mods ) written in Java that can alter the game. This session, presented by Oracleâ€™s Arun Gupta and James Weaver, consists of two parts:\n\n1. Gupta shares how his son taught him Minecraft and how he taught his son how to build a mod. In the process, Gupta taught his son several software development concepts.\n\n2. Weaver demonstrates a tool that he and Gupta developed in Java/JavaFX that facilitates creating Minecraft mods, and he dives into the code to discuss relevant concepts.\n\nViewers will learn a path that can be followed to introduce kids to programming in Java.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJames Weaver\nJames L.
