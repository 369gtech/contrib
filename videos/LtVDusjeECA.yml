description: "From the 2014 Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City.\n\nBecoming an organization that can make agile decisions from agile data requires agile analytics. Decision makers need to be able to shorten the length of time it takes from Question to Answer. This means analytics need to move closer to where the decisions are being made: The Board Room, a physician while he’s with a patient, TSA agent at an airport. Being able to quickly react as your customer changes behavior, your patient’s health declines, as new threats emerge. High performance analytics environments, like Hadoop, and dynamic visualizations take the analytics out of the back office and put them in the hands of the decision makers.\n\nThis session is sponsored by SAS.\n\nAbout Rachel Hawley:\nRachel assists customers in defining their business problems and objectives, and using SAS advanced analytics solutions to help them reach their goals. Her main focuses are SAS In-Memory Analytics solutions and SAS Decision Management. She holds a Bachelors in Mathematics from the University of Rochester and Masters in Operations Research from North Carolina State University.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop World 2014: http://goo.gl/UUfrR7\nFind out more about the conference: http://strataconf.com/stratany2014\n\nDon't miss an upload!
