title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Instant speed with Google AMP and Facebook Instant Articles'
recordingDate: 1506427471
description: "As the mobile web has overtaken desktop as the primary way people access content online, the way publications design and display webpages has taken on increasing importance. Mobile is a notoriously tricky platform. Limited data plans, fickle networks, and slower processing speeds mean that website owners need to be especially conscious of how their pages are built and displayed. Especially on mobile devices, poorly designed or slow-loading pages can dramatically increase bounce rates and result in lost ad revenue.\n\nIn 2015, Facebook and Google introduced initiatives designed to improve the mobile web experience for users. Both share the goal of making content load super fast and use less data than desktop pages would. But it's not all glory: some big publishers just stepped out due to lower profits or other reasons.\n\nBy attending my session, you'll learn:\n\nwhat Facebook Instant Articles and Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) are and how they compare;\nwhy it would be great to implement them (pros);\nwhy you might want to think again (cons);\nwhich one to pick if you had to choose, and why?\nAttendees will get a basic idea of the concept and how to implement it in their website. The session is platform-agnostic (I won't dive into the Drupal implementation) and it is relevant to everyone (business owners, developers, end-users and decision makers)."
