description: "KEYNOTE: Cultivating Empathy - The Most Important Feature You Can Provide to Your Team, Company and Customers - Leslie Hawthorn\n\nWithout empathy, teams with enormous technical skills can fail in their quest to deliver quality products to their users. Fail at empathy, and your chances of failing at everything skyrocket. Empathy is not something you're innately born with - it's a skill that can be learned, cultivated, refined and taught to others. In this Keynote, Leslie Hawthorn will discuss the value of empathy, how you can cultivate it in yourself and your organizational culture, and conclude with concrete steps for leveling up in your interactions with your fellow human beings."
