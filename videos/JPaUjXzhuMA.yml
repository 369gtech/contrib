description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Nick Butcher, Google.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=KOV-9403\n\nAnimations bring your app to life but often we write them as pre-canned sequences that once started can’t be interrupted or redirected. Modern Android apps are reactive to state changes… your animations should be as well. This talk looks at techniques for writing animations that work like state machines, that can be interrupted or retargeted while running. We’ll look at ways to architect your animations to achieve this, and libraries and classes that we can utilize.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
