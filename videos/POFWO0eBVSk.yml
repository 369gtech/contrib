title: 'CON3669 - Are You Aware of the /bin of Your JDK?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450130491
description: "A JDK installation includes many tools. You can often analyze issues relying only on these, without the need for (often expensive) third-party tools. Even better, being part of the JDK, they can be used as early as development and testing and for taking and analyzing memory dumps, stack traces of a particular system, GC activity, and more. This session iterates through several such tools, discusses their purpose and capabilities, and demonstrates their most common usages. Unleash the power of the tools you already have today!\n\nSpeaker:\nAndrzej Grzesik, (?°?°??? ???, _\nI like programming. I do it a lot, mostly on the JVM, creating backends for distributed systems. I also display a particular affection to continuous delivery.. UI, unless quickly hacked, is not my play ;-) I believe that most problems we deal with are people problems, so I mix and match tools with technologies to achieve my goals, make people happy and achieve world peace :-) I believe in software quality, and organize GeeCON, Polish JUG, Krakow Software Craftsmanship, Cracow Hadoop User Group. In my free time, I read paper books and cycle, a lot!"
