In this talk we will walk through a conceptual model for thinking about service mesh topologies, including how to think about networks, clusters, control planes, meshes, and federations of meshes. We will describe best practices for building a topology that can scale and grow with your organization, and discuss a number of different patterns that can be used to simplify your service mesh journey."
