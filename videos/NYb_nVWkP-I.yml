description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nBringing the Envoy Service Mesh to Mobile - Jose Nino & Michael Schore, Lyft  \n\n99.999% reliability on the server is meaningless if mobile apps are only able to complete the desired product flows a fraction of the time. Learn how Lyft built, and deployed Envoy Mobile (envoy-mobile.github.io) in their Swift/Kotlin apps and is benefitting from a single, consistent Envoy-based network stack across every platform.  Envoy Mobile was created to provide apps with the same network configurability, observability, and transport technologies that Envoy Proxy enables for the server - as if apps are simply another node on a service mesh. This unlocked a new tier of reliability on mobile and paved the way for many enhancements such as QUIC, request prioritization, and low connectivity handling. This talk will cover how this library was built, how Lyft tested it in their mobile apps, and what benefits theyâ€™ve already started to see. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaWW"
