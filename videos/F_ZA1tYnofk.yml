description: "This Week in Rust: 400 Issues and Counting! by Nell Shamrell-Harrington\n\nFor seven years and over 400 issues, This Week in Rust has brought the pulse of the Rust community to Rustaceans' inboxes. As we know from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, Rust is a beloved language. Each week the long list of blog posts, requests for comments, calls for participation, and more in This Week in Rust show WHY Rust is so loved. Rustaceans are not only dedicated to improving both the language itself and their skills with it, they are also committed to teaching others. Come to this talk for a look back through This Week in Rust's History, including the trends we have seen in community conversations around the language, stories from community members who's articles have been featured in the newsletters, and more. You will also get a behind the scenes look at how your editors bring the newsletter to you each week and learn how you can help too!"
