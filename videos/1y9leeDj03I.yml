description: "What do design and filmmaking have in common? Everything it turns out. Many rules and best practices of filmmaking and visual storytelling that have been honed and established in the hundred year existence of cinema can inform and inspire many facets of UX design. As part of this talk we will look at some of these rules and how they translate to decisions made in interface design. \n\nRay Noori is the CEO and Co-founder of Block Zero, a design and technology studio based in Malmö, Sweden. After a decade in various leadership roles within UX and technology companies such as TAT – The Astonishing Tribe and BlackBerry, he co-founded the design and technology studio Block Zero, working in such diverse fields as Smart Cities, E-Health and Fashion Tech.
