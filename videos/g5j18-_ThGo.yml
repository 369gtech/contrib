description: "Google TechTalks\nMay 31, 2006\n\nBill Jepson\n\nABSTRACT\nThe UCLA Urban Simulation Laboratory through many years of research has created a unique system and methodology for constructing real-time visual simulation models of large-scale urban environments. This system is both powerful, flexible and capable.  The Urban Simulation Laboratory has utilized this system and methodologies to create models of various areas within the City of Los Angeles that are at the leading edge in their scope, veracity and quality.  These models are completely malleable and are updated regularly with new and proposed projects."
