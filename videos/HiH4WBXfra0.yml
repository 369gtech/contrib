description: "My talk presents results from the FP7 Project MODUM that are developed in Erlang. \n\nThe European project develops a new approach for the pro-active demand-responsive management of traffic (cf.modum-project.eu). The developments focus on solutions assuming a high degree of participation by intelligent users. These users have an e-butler (i-butler when bought from Apple) that proactively manages their commuting and other displacements. Initial deployment of the developments will enable full utilization of the access-controlled parts of the infrastructure (e.g. bus lanes, parking spaces). The MODUM design predicts and prevents congestion in these access-controlled parts without sacrificing infrastructure utilization. \n\nTalk objectives: \n\n    To present and communicate an innovative system architecture. This architecture defines the system components, their responsibilities (within the application domain) and their interactions. It is a single-source-of-truth design that utilizes delegate multi-agent systems to collect, distribute and propagate information (not co-located with the source). \n    To reveal how OTP/Erlang is a unique technology that renders this possible, and more precisely, that renders an actual initial deployment feasible. \n    To present an example of how ICT may contribute beyond the borders of its computer network. In other words, an Internet of Things that treats its things as first-class citizens.\n\n\nTarget audience:\n\n    Persons that hate traffic jams.\n    People eager to learn how OTP/Erlang applications can have direct impact on the real world. \n    People interested to learn how to tackle developments that manage and coordinate real-world activities that utilize (and content for) valuable real-world resources.
