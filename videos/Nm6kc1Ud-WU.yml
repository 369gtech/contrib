title: 'Creating Polyglot Communication Between Kubernetes Clusters and Legacy Systems with an Event Mesh'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327349
description: "Incompatibilities of language and communication protocol have created complexity in building intersystem communication in increasingly distributed enterprises. DevOps can deploy, monitor, scale and manage application clusters, but they only gain utility when they can communicate events to one another.\n \n How can we build Spring and non-Spring-based communication between Kubernetes clusters and legacy systems in a way that accounts for different development languages and messaging protocols? By bringing Spring apps onto an event mesh, we can easily enable this communication, even with systems that don't support Spring's native messaging standards.\n \n In this session, you'll learn how to:\n \n - Enable real-time pub/sub communication between systems using any Spring messaging technology in an event-driven architecture.\n - Create a flexible architecture that can easily add and remove producing and subscribing applications without adverse effects.\n - Enable agile development processes, bridging old and new.\n\n Michael Hilmen, Principal Architect at Solace\n Robbie Jerrom, Principal SE - Office of the CTO at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/creating-polyglot-communication-between-kubernetes-clusters-and-legacy-systems-with-an-event-mesh"
