description: "What To Do When SRE is Just a New Job Title?\n\nBenjamin BÃ¼tikofer, Ricardo.ch\n\nWhen the SRE Book was published in 2016 the job title of SRE was not widely used outside Google. Fast-forward five years and it seems like every company is hiring SREs. Did the System Administrator and Operations jobs disappear or have their job titles simply changed?\n\nAt the end of the talk, you will know one way of transforming a disjoint team of engineers into a high-performing SRE team. If you are a manager of a team or you are interested in team building this talk is for you. This is not a technical talk; I will focus solely on how to set up a team for success.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
