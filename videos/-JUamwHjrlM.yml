description: 'You may ask yourself, what can be interesting in opening file? In Java? Welcome to the land of false assumptions, deadly dangerous illusions, superstitions and mis-believes, where ignorance is bliss. Modern OSs offer many ways to work with files, the only universal and ultimate abstraction, because everything is a file. During this talk I am going to walk us through how Java maps this behavior, how it treats file handles and which IO access patterns work is certain cases and why it sometimes explodes in the middle of the night. I can promise there will be a lot about syscalls, some performance numbers and little bit of JNI. If you think it is boring you can always go to another talk about hundred of ways how to inject object into object. If you have never heard about vectored IO, memory mapped files, direct IO or zero copy IO I am sure you will have loads of fun watching me trying compile all of examples.'
