description: "You run your SQL-centric infrastructure for 10 years and slowly starting to note you can’t do this way anymore – everything is getting too expensive but your business requires things which are simply impossible without radical cahnges.\n\nThis is exact situation we had 2 years before. So we’d like to shouw our experience:\n\n- Why and how we came into Big Data?\n- Why we choose Apache and Hadoop?\n- What to do and what is already done?\n- What lessans were learned?\n- Hadoop and relational databases: fight or synergy?\n- Reactive Big Data manifest."
