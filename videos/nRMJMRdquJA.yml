description: "https://2018.jsconf.is/speakers/nara-kasbergen/\n\n1 in 5 Americans are living with a mental illness such as depression, bipolar, anxiety, or ADHD. As a community, the single most damaging thing we can do is perpetuate the stigma against mental disorders. This talk will begin with an overview of key statistics about mental wellness, followed by the efforts of the non-profit organization Open Sourcing Mental Illness to gather more data about mental health in the tech industry, and conclude with the bulk of the talk focusing on ideas and strategies for making our tech workplaces more accommodating and inclusive."
