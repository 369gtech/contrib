description: "Deep Dive: Kubernetes (UI) SIG - Jeffrey Sica, University of Michigan & Sebastian Floreks, Loodse \n\nThe Kubernetes Dashboard is the primary way non-cloud-hosted Kubernetes clusters are managed and is a great introductory tool in a new cluster-admin's belt. The Dashboard, much like Kubernetes itself, is a complex beast with many moving parts. With a front-end written in Angular, and a back-end written in go, the project has a complex set of needs to support development. This session will dive into both the front-end and back-end development with the Dashboard as well as outline progress with the 2019 SIG-UI Roadmap. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPkX"
