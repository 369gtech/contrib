description: "Sara Chipps \n\nDeveloper, Girl Develop It\n\nSara Chipps is a JavaScript developer and she blogs at http://sarajchipps.com. She consults with early stage startups as an interim CTO, serving to walk teams through the difficult task of building their first web application.\n\nIn 2010, along with Vanessa Hurst, Data Scientist at Paperless Post, she started an organization called Girl Develop It which offers low cost software development classes geared towards women. Girl Develop It has had over 1000 unique students in New York City and now has 6 chapters around the world.\n\nIn late 2011 she launched a subscription based women's basics service with partner Melanie Moore. Elizabeth and Clarke develops, designs, and manufactures essentials that you need each season starting with the white shirt. Guaranteed to NEVER be: too see-though, too short, too long, too easily wrinkled, or too easily stained.\n\nShe enjoys speaking to and meeting with diverse groups from the Girl Scouts to straight up code junkies. Her goal is to inspire more females to see that working with software is fun and glamorous."
