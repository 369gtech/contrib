description: "We interviewed The Bay Citizen at the Google I/O Sandbox on May 11, 2011. They explained to us the benefits of using fusion tables on Google Maps to build infographics for their online newspaper. The Bay Citizen built the Bike Tracker Infographic to display the prevalence of bike accidents at points across San Francisco. View the bike tracker here: http://www.baycitizen.org/data/bike-accidents/\r\n\r\nFor more information about developing with Google Maps and fusion tables, visit: http://code.google.com/apis/maps\r\n\r\nFor more information on The Bay Citizan, visit: http://www.baycitizen.org/"
