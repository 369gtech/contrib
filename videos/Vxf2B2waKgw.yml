description: 'Cross Site Scripting (or client-side JavaScript injection) and other client-side risk are well known technical challenges that web application developers have faced for many years. While frameworks like React provide some automatic defenses to stop Cross Site Scripting; React developers still require specialized knowledge to build secure React applications. This presentation will review some of the necessary general purpose Cross Site Scripting defense recommendations as well as present specialized techniques that all React developers who wish to build secure React applications will benefit from.'
