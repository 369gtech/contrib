description: 'Concurrency: it’s way easier when values don’t change. True fact! But what else can we gain from making our data immutable? Let’s look at the benefits and tradeoffs--beyond concurrency--of applying the concept of immutability to real world programs. We''ll start by looking at the history of immutability in programming, both in the object-oriented and functional paradigms, and examine ways it can reduce our cognitive burden and improve readability. We''ll discuss some elegant and counter-intuitive outcomes of functional data structures that take advantage of immutable data. With those in mind, we’ll take a hard look at the performance of implementations of immutable collections in real-world programming languages. Finally, we''ll explore frameworks do exciting things with immutable data, from the database level (append-only DBs) to data processing (Samza) to front-end development (Facebook’s React & Om).'
