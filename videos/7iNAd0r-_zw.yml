title: 'Are you smarter than a Web Browser? - Yonatan Mevorach'
recordingDate: 1559043973
description: 'As web developers, we tend to think we understand how a web browser works, and write our code accordingly, but as it turns out there are cases where our mental model of how the browser works tends to be overly-simplistic. In this talk, Yonatan Mevorach, takes a look at some known web development best-practices, and explores why because of how modern browsers work, they might be anti-patterns causing more harm than good. Throughout the talk, we''ll gain a better understanding of the various optimizations that modern browsers perform like optimizing scrolling, preloading assets, etc., and pair each one with an innocuous piece of code that blocks the optimization which ends up hindering the user-experience.'
