description: "Google I/O 2010 - Fireside chat with the Google Wave team \r\n\r\nFireside Chats, Wave \r\n\r\nLars Rasmussen, Douwe Osinga, Jochen Bekmann, Alan Green, Pamela Fox, Dan Peterson, Stephanie Hannon \r\n\r\nJoin the Google Wave team around the campfire to chat about all things Wave: the product, the API platform, and the wave federation protocol. Come to learn about the new Wave API features, get tips on how to build the best extensions, discuss how to take advantage of the open source code available and hear more about what users are doing with the product. This is an excellent opportunity to ask the engineering team questions directly, and learn more about where Wave is heading. \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
