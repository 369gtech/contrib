description: "The modularization of the Java SE Platform in JDK 9 brings many benefits but also many changes. Existing code that uses only official Java SE Platform APIs and supported JDK-specific APIs should continue to work without change. Code that uses certain deprecated features or any JDK-internal APIs is likely to break, however. This session shows you how to prepare existing code for JDK 9 and takes a look at new features designed to help migration, such as JDK versioning, multirelease JARs, and enhanced deprecation.\n\n# Alan Bateman\nConsulting Member of Staff in the JDK team in Oracle. I'm currently focused on the Java Platform Module System and the Modular JDK that targets JDK 9. I'm an active member of the OpenJDK project and have a long history in the development of JDK."
