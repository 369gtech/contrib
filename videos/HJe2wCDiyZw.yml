description: 'We seem to have forgotten how the internet was made. It wasn''t built by a company trying to get rich quick. It fact, it wasn''t built with any business goal in mind at all. We''ve  collectively gone startup-crazy, assuming that if there is no money, there is clearly no value. This is madness. Will the internet will turn out to be a happy accident, a lovely utopean moment in time that we milk for every penny and then move on? There is a better way. It''s time  identify and create new open standards to revolutionize "the next internet."  If we don''t act fast, the future will be sold to us.'
