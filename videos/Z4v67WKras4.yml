title: 'Lessons Learned from the 737 Max by Ken Sipe'
recordingDate: 1581886371
description: "There were two fatal crashes of the Boeing 737 Max in the fall of 2018 and spring of 2019 grounding the airplane world-wide and begging the question why? In the end, it comes down to software but there is much more to that story. [Redacted], the presenter in this session is in the unique position of being an instrument-rated private pilot and a software engineer with experience working with remote teams, both will provide insight into lessons we will learn as we peel back the details of these tragic events.\n\nIn this session, you will learn about aircraft types and how they affect decisions of the airline industry from pilot scheduling, plane scheduling, innovation and profits. We will see how an airplane design from 1994 causes challenges in 2018-2019. We will learn how software becomes the solution to a hardware problem of design. We will continue with plane ratings and what \"in-type\" means and how it plays an affect. We will broach on the topic of the USA FAA relinquishing quality standards to Boeing because of man-power and costs. Last we will hone in on what a pilot does and expects and what the MCAS system did by design. The climax of the talk will center around software requirements and how disconnected remote teams without user experience in the problem space will write exactly what you agree on... which can be lethal.\n\nKen Sipe\nD2iQ\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
