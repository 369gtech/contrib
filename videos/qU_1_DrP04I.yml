description: "Spice up Your Web Apps with Google AJAX APIs\r\nMark Lucovsky (Google)\r\n\r\nIntegrating Google Search into a website can be simple using the Google AJAX APIs. Mark will show how a few lines of JavaScript can quickly add functionality like Video, Images, News, and Local Business data to a site. But it isn't just about search. He'll also show you how to download Atom and RSS feeds from any server using only JavaScript.\r\n\r\nParticipants should be familiar with JavaScript and dynamic web applications."
