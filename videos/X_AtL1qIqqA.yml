title: 'Will Serverless and Kubernetes Kill DevOps?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1527685801
description: "Thom Leggett\nDirector, Oracle Cloud product development.\nOracle\n\nThom Leggett from Oracle will take you on a guided climb up the modern application development stack. You will start at base-camp: the operating system, then proceed via containers and container orchestration to finally summit at serverless computing. With a panoramic view from the top of the stack you will learn how these emerging technologies can streamline your operations and engineering, saving you money and letting you focus on meeting your business needs instead of managing infrastructure. Along the way you will encounter such specimens as Oracle Linux, Docker, Kubernetes and serverless Functions-as-a-Service platforms such as the Fn Project. Finally, before descending to base-camp for a nice cup of tea, you will discover how native species such as the DevOps will have to adapt or die in this new habitat."
