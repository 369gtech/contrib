description: 'We are at the dawn of a new paradigm of human-computer interaction, where humans speak to computers in the cloud and the computers talk back. Amazon''s Alexa platform offers technologies for adding a voice interface to mobile applications. This talk will introduce an open source Clojure library (Boomhauer) that simplifies tying voice commands to service interfaces via the Alexa Skills Kit. With example code in Clojure running on AWS Lambda, this talk will give you a peek into how accessible voice interfaces can be and how easy it is to add another dimension of usability to your application. The next generation user interface is invisible.'
