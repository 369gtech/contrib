description: "Stephen P. Anderson is a speaker and consultant based out of Dallas, Texas. He spends unhealthy amounts of time thinking about design, psychology and leading intrapreneurial teams—topics he frequently speaks about at national and international events.\n\nStephen recently published the Mental Notes card deck (www.getmentalnotes.com), a tool to help businesses use psychology to design better experiences. And, he's currently writing a book on \"Seductive Interactions\" that will explore this topic of psychology and design in more detail; he also teaches a workshop on this same subject.\n\nPrior to venturing out on his own, Stephen spent more than a decade building and leading teams of information architects, interaction designers and UI developers. He's designed Web applications for businesses such as Nokia, Frito-Lay, Sabre Travel Network, and Chesapeake Energy as well as a number of smaller technology startups.\n\nStephen likes to believe that someday he'll have the time to start blogging again at poetpainter.com"
