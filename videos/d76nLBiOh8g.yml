description: "This video was recorded at the Munich Erlang Factory Lite 2013. Slides and additional info here: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/Munich2013/speakers/DarachEnnis\n\nTraditional messaging middleware is clean - data and producer/consumer agnostic. Data Distribution is dirty - it exploits unlawful carnal knowledge of data structures and client environments and constraints to deliver high value real time conversational services.\n\nUnleashing the corporate firehose over the web and to mobile, or accepting small data anywhere from any device requires something a little bit different. It's messaging, sort of, but we're not in Kansas any more and there are no red shoes.\"\n\nTalk objectives: Inspire debate and discussion on the relevance or not of traditional messaging in an increasingly mobile world where the Internet of Things, Bring Your Own Device and the increasing sophistication of mobile platforms intersects with the way we work.\n\nTarget audience: Technologists and professionals interested in distributed systems and streaming data across firewalls, and between organisations."
