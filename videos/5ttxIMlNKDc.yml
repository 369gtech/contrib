description: "Thanks to the ‚Äúboom‚Äù in the information security industry combined with the latest buzzwords, more and more large corporate companies are looking for the latest ‚Äúnext gen‚Äù anti-haxor services and technologies. In doing so they often go out publicly on tender and / or issue an RFP/RFQ in order to obtain the best possible solution to meet their requirements and budget (usually cost wins).\n\nDue to this and a lack of maturity in the field, companies issue public RFQs / RFPs that contain classified and confidential / secret information such as network diagrams, architectural designs, software versions etc. This type of information would usually require that an attacker spend an extensive amount of time performing enumeration and / or gaining access to the internal network first and taking a significant amount of time to learn about that environment. Targeting the procurement process of an organisation exposes a largely unexplored attack surface.\n\nThis new research and presentation aims to demystify the above and give practical examples of large international organisations, which unfortunately fail at the RFP/RFQ process badly. This opens a ‚Äúfree and easy‚Äù attack vector for attackers to exploit without even conducting extensive enumeration and fingerprinting, or anything close to intrusive attacks. As a result, an attacker often has access to an extensive amount confidential information about the organisation, which could be utilised to launch more targeted attacks. Depending on the type of information gathered, such attacks, could be likened to an attacker that has insider knowledge."
