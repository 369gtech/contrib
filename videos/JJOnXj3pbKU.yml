description: "The talk from DevOps Fest 2020 Online conference. \nPresentation: https://bit.ly/3hTOovB\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/DevOpsFest/\nWebsite: https://www.devopsfest.com.ua/\n\nI want to tell you a story, a story about an event that spanned 35 countries, reached 10.000 participants, involved 1.400 websites and databases, raised 8 disruptions on those websites and even caused Azure DevOps outages. In which we reached the limits of the cloud and still were able to spend only half of the budget. I will tell you how not only organize an event on this scale, but also how to automate it; from pipelines to deploy the Azure infrastructure, to the actual event day automation. What did we run into, what did we use and what have we learned."
