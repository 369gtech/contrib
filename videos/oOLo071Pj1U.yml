description: "When building a Conversation Action for the Google Assistant, consider that so-called “error events\"\" don't have to be treated as edge cases. Instead, these can become opportunities to forge meaningful exchanges that leverage users’ mental models of how everyday conversations unfold.  This talk will frame a new way of approaching fallback and repair, in which so-called errors become organic turns in the dialog. We will provide design tips for your action logic to allow the conversation to move forward naturally.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/D0D4VE\nWatch more Android talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/c0LWYl\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/Q1bFGY\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/pmO4Dr\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\n#io17 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2017"
