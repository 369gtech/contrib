description: "Each year, Comic Relief raises tens of millions of pounds to fight poverty. A significant proportion of this is received electronically over the 7 hours of primetime television coverage. A few minutes of downtime during this period could mean missing out on millions of pounds to help those that need it most. In this panel discussion from Google Next London 2017, speakers from Comic Relief, Pivotal and Armakuni share their experiences of building, scaling and running a mission-critical multi-cloud solution on Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Google Cloud Platform.\n\nSpeakers: \nZenon Hannick, CTO, Comic Relief\nTim Savage, Director, Armakuni\nDavid Laing, Engineering Director, Pivotal\nTom Grey, UK Head of Customer Engineering, Google"
