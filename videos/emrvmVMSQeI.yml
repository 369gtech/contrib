recordingDate: 1366299746
description: "Google Tech Talk\nMarch 26, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by Oliver Francis Koch (founder of Easy Bites), Ralph Benjamin Magnus (lead developer of Easy Bites)\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn this talk we narrate the story of Easy Bites, an internet start-up in post-war Iraq set to provide location-based food delivery services to the local community. The start-up was brought together through a close collaboration between international and local experts, motivated to tap into the significant growth of internet and mobile penetration in the region to provide innovative local services to the community. The talk will discuss and emphasize the team's lean and agile methodologies in product development. These agile methods helped to quickly and adequately overcome a series of challenges such as cultural localization of the service and infrastructural challenges (e.g. absence of physical addresses in Iraq)."
