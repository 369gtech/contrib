title: 'Enterprise Systems Built with Microservices are Designed to Expect Failures'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538670599
description: "Designing systems for failures between any service call is enshrined as a key principle in Microservices architecture. Implementing Circuit Breaker pattern helps reduce service call failures from cascading into entire system failure. And adopting an Eventual Consistency paradigm, with streaming platforms, helps by decoupling cross microservices communications. But we still need additional strategies to not only build resilient systems, but also systems that reduce transactional, or end-user experienced failures. We'll explore the use of caching frameworks to improve resilience and performance in enterprise microservices systems. Lets look at how Redis, Pivotal Cloud Cache, and Hazelcast can help system handle failures!\n\nSpeaker:\nDalia Borker\nVice President, JP Morgan Chase"
