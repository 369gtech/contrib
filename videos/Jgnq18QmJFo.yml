description: "Leila Verhaegen, Emma Delescolle\n\nMonday 17th, 15:30 (Assembly Room)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nThis session is about the story of two girls who decided to make a clock themselves after searching a lot on the internet and without finding what they were looking for.\n\nIn this talk we will tell you what we used and how we used it, we will also tell you how we made plans and then how we made circuits (timing, requirements, how difficult and fun it was)\n\nWe will finally tell you more about code and why exactly we wrote it like that (Spoiler: there was a module with the RTC we used but the memory of the trinket was to small to support the original code to do what exactly we wanted to do)\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for new programmers.\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for teachers."
