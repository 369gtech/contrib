Join Spring Test component lead Sam Brannen in this talk to discover what's new in Spring's testing support in 4.0 through 4.1.\n\nThis talk will provide attendees an overview of what's been deprecated, what's changed, and what's been introduced in Spring's testing support over the last two years, with real life examples and tips for best practices.
