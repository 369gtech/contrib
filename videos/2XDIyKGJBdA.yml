description: "We Come From a Land of Runtimes - Xiujiao Gao & Mike Ferris, Stark & Wayne\n\nYour organization has decided to run Cloud Foundry. Until recently, all apps pushed to cloud foundry would run within application runtime: Diego.

Now your organization is faced with a decision: which runtime, or runtimes, will your Cloud Foundry use to best fit your business model? In this talk, Dr. Gao and Mike Ferris outline the different runtime scenarios that are possible and then compare their benefits and drawbacks.
