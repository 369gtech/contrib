description: "You might have heard of Domain Driven Design. You may have heard DDD is a tool to write readable and change-ready code. You may have even heard DDD comes with a lot of talking, and modelling, and customers...\nStarting with DDD sounds big, and scary, doesn't it?\nBut getting started is not scary! Come find out what DDD can do for your code, tomorrow. We'll use value objects, entities and services to bring order to our mind and code. We'll see how naming things can guide us, but also trick us. We'll rework a piece of code together and improve what it means. And tomorrow you can tell your peers that, technically, you're doing DDD.\n\nEVENT:\n\nThe Dutch PHP Conference in 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nPim Elshoff\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpcNeeetijo"
