description: "With the move to .NET Core, IIS is no longer the default web server for ASP.NET deployments. Instead ASP.NET apps are self-hosted and by default run in Kestrel. Kestrel is fast, and like Node.JS is based off the libuv async I/O library. But it's also optimized to talk to Nginx, another web server. Why would you need two webservers? What is Nginx?\n\nIn this talk we will explain the mysteries of Nginx to you. We will focus particularly on its role as a reverse proxy in front of Kestrel, but also cover its use for load balancing.\nBy the end you should understand what Nginx is, when to use it, and how.\nYou will even learn how to pronounce Nginx."
