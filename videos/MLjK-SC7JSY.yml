title: 'Dataset Poisoning on the Industrial Scale'
language: English
recordingDate: 1622844073
description: "A Google TechTalk, 2020/7/29, presented by Tom Goldstein, University of Maryland\nABSTRACT:  Dataset poisoning is a security vulnerability in which a bad actor modifies the training data for a machine learning system in a way that allows them to control test time behavior.  In this talk, I discuss our recent work on \"clean-label\" data poisoning methods, in which poison images appear normal to a human, and are labeled correctly.  I present several ways to create such poisoning attacks, and show that they can be made effective against black-box industrial systems, including Google AutoML."
