title: 'Modifying events with the Google Calendar API (The G Suite Dev Show)'
language: English

description: "Developers may be aware they can use email markup or the Google Calendar API in their apps to insert events into their users’ calendars. This gives users a better experience because they no longer have to enter event details into their calendars manually. While this is good news, it’s only the first step. Developers should also enable their apps to be able to modify those events in case plans change, and they always do. While you can update events using markup, it’s limited as far as what you can do, so this video shows developers how to use the Calendar API to modify events, including the creation of repeating events.\n\nRelated links for this episode:\n“Modifying events with the Google Calendar API” deep dive Python code blog post: https://goo.gl/Bwu7bH\n“Creating great experiences with email markup” DevByte video: http://goo.gl/GuH3L4\nEmail markup documentation: https://goo.gl/vhdKTz\n“Creating events in Google Calendar” blog post & video: http://goo.gl/KuYMiq\nRFC 5545 recurrence rules (RRULEs): https://goo.gl/Juw6Jm\nCalendar API conditional modification: https://goo.gl/1a5YQF\nGoogle Calendar API documentation: https://goo.gl/1AXCMf\nCalendar API concepts & overview: https://goo.gl/QPyaYr\nCalendars & Events objects guide: https://goo.gl/tJhJz3\n“Setting up new Google API projects” DevByte video: http://goo.gl/RbyTFD\nGoogle Developers/Cloud Platform Console: http://console.developers.google.com\nGoogle APIs Client Libraries: https://goo.gl/HVx6wM\n“Common Python code walkthrough” DevByte video: http://goo.gl/KMfbeK\nG Suite Dev Show video series playlist: http://goo.gl/JpBQ40\nLaunchpad Online developer video series: http://goo.gl/kFMUa6\n\nGoogle Developers YouTube channel: http://youtube.com/GoogleDevelopers"
