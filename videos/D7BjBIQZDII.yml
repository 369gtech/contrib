title: 'Pivotal - Four Levels of High Availability in Cloud Foundry (Cloud Foundry Summit 2014)'
recordingDate: 1404417591
description: "Presenter: Cornelia Davis, Platform Engineer, Cloud Foundry, Pivotal\n\nPlatform as a Service is not just for the developer. It must provide equal or greater value to the application operator as well. The Cloud Foundry PaaS has four levels of HA built in! We'll explain each of them and show you how, collectively, they do an extraordinary job keeping application instances up and running in the face of failures. Your operators will spend less time on recovery and more time on innovation as a result."
