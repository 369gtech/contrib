description: '002 In this lesson, we meet the PDF and XD wireframe files. In Adobe XD we can use "CTRL + 0" to zoom the contents so all of them fit in the view area. CTR + 1 will zoom to 100%, which is the normal size. Holding the space bar down and clicking with the left mouse and dragging allows us to reposition the design/wireframe so we can see different sections or areas of the wireframe. We can also use zoom in or zoom out by holding the CTRL key down and using the Scroll Wheel of the mouse. Nice nice! So we have a mobile, tablet and desktop version as well.'
