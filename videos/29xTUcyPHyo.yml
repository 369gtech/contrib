title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: Turning Bigger Data Into Better Healthcare'
recordingDate: 1391798502
description: "We now have more health related data than ever, but to actually turn it into better healthcare we need better data technology.\n\nNot only must this technology scale to petabytes of clinical genomics data but it must weave together collaborative data management with cybersecurity, on-demand analysis, and data-driven decision support at the point of care. At the same time it must shield patients and healthcare providers from the nuts and bolts of managing complex data and mitigate institutional liability arising from protected health information.\n\nThis webcast presentation paints a picture of the direction clinical medicine is heading in the age of Big Data, highlighting ongoing data cyberinfrastructure development by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill based RENCI and key partners to enable the transition.\n\nAbout Michael Shoffner\n\nMichael Shoffner is a Senior Research Software Architect in the Data Sciences Group at RENCI, a UNC-based research institute that develops and deploys advanced technologies to enable research discoveries, and an adjunct faculty member in the UNC School of Information and Library Science (SILS). Previously he has been a technical architect, a member of an emerging technologies strategy group, and co-founder of an early area Internet technology consultancy with clients in the biomedical and education spaces. He co-authored one of the first trade books on the Java programming language and spearheaded the world's first online radio station simulcast."
