description: "The best ML model has little business value if it operates in a vacuum. The infrastructure used at Netflix enables data-scientists to quickly deploy their model as a microservice to perform inference or integrate with other systems. We demonstrate how we leverage a Python environment, familiar to data-scientists, as well as FaaS to remove infrastructure considerations and increase productivity.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
