description: 'You *are* smart enough! As Woody Allen said, 80% of life is showing up. Most of the people who are big contributors to Go got their start in very small ways. But they show up over and over again: reviewing patches, suggesting new features on the mailing list, and responding to bug reports. You see the big, brilliant patch, but you don''t see the decades spent reading the code, responding to bug reports, and submitting small changes. Doing those things will give you more experience. The main thing separating you from the people you see, are they show up over and over, and they have for a long time. In Kevinâ€™s talk, he will share how he went from being a part-time Go hacker to a contributor, and discuss how you can get started contributing to Go!'
