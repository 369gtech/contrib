description: "Join us on this week in our Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database, where Senior Oracle Cloud Engineer Bob Peulen, and Principal Cloud Specialist Engineer Maurits Dijkens will explain how to use the Oracle Digital Assistant with Oracle Machine Learning Services REST API, and demonstrate a simple use case of a Smart ChatBot that can request a scoring in real-time.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks offers an easy-to-use, interactive, multi-user, collaborative interface based on Apache Zeppelin notebook technology, and support SQL, PL/SQL, Python and Markdown interpreters.  It is available on all Autonomous Database versions and Tiers, including the always-free editions.\n\nOML includes AutoML, which provides automated machine learning algorithm features for algorithm selection, feature selection and model tuning, in addition to a specialized AutoML UI exclusive to the Autonomous Database.\n\nOML Services is also included in Autonomous Database, where you can deploy and manage native in-database OML models as well as ONNX ML models (for classification and regression) built using third-party engines, and can also invoke cognitive text analytics."
