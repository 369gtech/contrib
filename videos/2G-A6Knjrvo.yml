description: 'Containerising your applications with Docker gets more and more attraction. While managing your Docker containers on your developer machine or on a single server is not a big hassle, it can get uncomfortable very quickly when you want to deploy your containers in a cluster, no matter if in the cloud or on premises. How do you provide high availability, scaling and monitoring? Fortunately there is a rapidly growing ecosystem around docker, and there are tools available which support you with this. In this session I want to introduce you to Kubernetes, the Docker orchestration tool started and open sourced by Google. Based on the experience with their data centers, Google uses some interesting declarative concepts like pods, replication controllers and services in Kubernetes, which I will explain to you. While Kubernetes still is a quite young project, it reached its first stable version this summer, thanks to many contributions by Red Hat, Microsoft, IBM and many more.'
