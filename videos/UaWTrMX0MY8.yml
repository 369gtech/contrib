description: "When I became a developer evangelist in early 2012, I was told that an important part of my job was to support my local developer community. I threw myself into the role, eventually getting involved in organizing meetups, hackathons, conferences and even a coworking space in Seattle, WA.\n\nOne of the great ironies of the open source community is that very little information about how to bring people together and organize events is public knowledge. Everything I learned came from private conversations with other organizers or the school of hard knocks.\n\nI think that this is shame because our community is growing and we need more people to get involved as organizers, mentors and teachers. And in order to do this we, as organizers, need to open source what we know and lower the barriers to entry for anyone down the line who wants to help."
