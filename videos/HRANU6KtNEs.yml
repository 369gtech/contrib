description: "Welcome to Programming from A to Z! \n\n\"Programming from A to Z\" is a course I teach at ITP (http://itp.nyu.edu).  This playlist is anyone who would like to follow along online. Each week, I'll release videos on a new topic. \n\nHere is the course description.\n\nThis course focuses on programming strategies and techniques behind procedural analysis and generation of text-based data. We'll explore topics ranging from evaluating text according to its statistical properties to the automated production of text with probabilistic methods to text visualization. Students will learn server-side and client-side JavaScript programming and develop projects that can be shared and interacted with online. There will be weekly homework assignments as well as a final project. \n\nCourse url: http://shiffman.net/a2z/\n\nNext Video: https://youtu.be/d3OcFexe9Ik\n\nSupport this channel on Patreon: https://patreon.com/codingtrain\n\nSend me your questions and coding challenges!: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Topics\n\nContact: https://twitter.com/shiffman\n\nGitHub Repo with all the info for Programming from A to Z: https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F16\n\nLinks discussed in this video:\nITP from Tisch School of the Arts: https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp\n \nInfluences and Inspiration for the Programming from A to Z class:\nJackson Mac Low's Wikipedia Page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Mac_Low\nNick Montfort: http://nickm.com/\nAllison Parrish: http://www.decontextualize.com/\nKate Compton's Tracery: https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery\nAddie Wagenknecht: http://www.placesiveneverbeen.com/\nLynn Cherny: http://www.ghostweather.com/bio.html\nDarius Kazemi: http://tinysubversions.com/\nEyeo Festival on Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival\n\nSource Code for the all Video Lessons: https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code\n\np5.js: https://p5js.org/\nProcessing: https://processing.org\n\nFor More Programming from A to Z videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?shelf_id=11&view=50&sort=dd\n\nFor More Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/V91D/"
