description: "Lucas Jellema, CTO, AMIS Services BV\n\nData has been and will be the key ingredient to enterprise IT. What is changing is the nature, scope, and volume of data and its place in the IT architecture. Big data, unstructured data, and nonrelational data stored on Hadoop; NoSQL databases; and in Elasticsearch, caches, and message queues complements data in the enterprise RDBMS. Trends such as microservices that contain their own data, BASE, CQRS, and event sourcing have changed the way we store, share, and govern data. This session introduces patterns, technologies, and hypes for storing, processing, and retrieving data with products such as Oracle Database, Cassandra, MySQL, Neo4J, Kafka, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Hadoop/Spark—locally, in containers, and in the cloud."
