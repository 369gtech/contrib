description: "Low-saturation scrum, \"sort-of\" microservices, misinterpreted (or trivialised) DevOps, not-so-Continuous Integration, Definition of almost-Done: who (honestly) haven't encountered any of these? Companies become grotesque in their mindless chase to imitate industry unicorns & in many cases it's our (software crafts(wo)men) fault: our ambitions & desires tend to drown out common sense & pragmatic thinking. What is even worse, in many cases we don't learn from failure by adopting the conclusions, but fool ourselves with painting the grass green.\n\nThe idea of this talk is to present some war stories that involve modern development \"cargo cults\": emphasise errors made, underline the root causes of (partial or full) failure & suggest what could have been more successful (even if not so exciting / appealing ...). The goal is not to convince anyone that a rhino should stay a rhino, but that you probably should aim at being a unicorn at the top of your own league, if you want to advance further.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl) \n13-15 September 2017"
