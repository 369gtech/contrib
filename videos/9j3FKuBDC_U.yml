title: 'Mark Rendle - Automate Yourself Out Of a Job With Roslyn'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620208318
description: "Roslyn is Microsoft's \"compiler as a platform\" for C# and VB.NET. You can use it to read, analyze or modify existing code, or make squigglies in Visual Studio, or even generate and compile entirely new code at runtime because you're insane.\n\nIn this talk I'll introduce you to Roslyn, explain things like Workspaces, SyntaxTrees, SyntaxNodes, and symbols, and show you some of the fun things you can do with it, both in console applications and as Visual Studio extensions. If you also go to a talk on Machine Learning you will probably be able to create an artificial intelligence to write code for you and take the rest of your life off."
