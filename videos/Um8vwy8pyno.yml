description: "If you are a UX team of one, you may find yourself with some unique challenges. You probably care about your work, and want to do it well. But you may feel as if you are spread a bit thin. You might find yourself needing to evangelize UX to people who may or may not see its importance. You may be learning on the job. You're almost certainly working with constrained resources. And you're definitely charting your own course.\n\nAll of this leads to a unique set of challenges that go well beyond simply trying to do good design. It requires you to be efficient but also inclusive in how you conduct the UX process. It also makes skills like facilitation, critique, and inquiry central to your toolkit. This webcast lead by Leah Buley author of The User Experience Team of One, will explain the working conditions that a team of one often experiences, and provide specific methods and techniques that are optimized for success in this situation.\n\nIn this webcast you'll learn:\n\n    An adapted UX toolkit for people working as teams of one\n    How to get non-UX colleagues involved in the research and design process\n    Responses and approaches to use when encountering resistance to UX\n    Why UX teams of one are the most important people in UX today\n\nAbout Leah Buley\n\nLeah Buley is a user experience designer who has been making digital products for over 15 years. She is interested in how complex organizations can embrace and produce good design.\n\nLeah started her career in the late 1990s as an opinionated Web developer. Through self-taught tinkering, she gradually made the transition to user interface design. Leah spent the early 2000s as a UX team of one in a range of financial and information service companies. In 2007, she joined Adaptive Path, a pioneering user experience design consultancy. There, she learned the secret sauce of high-performing design teams, and began to ponder how this approach could be adapted for UX teams of one in challenging organizational environments.\n\nLeah writes and speaks regularly on this topic, and has presented repeatedly at conferences such as SXSW, UX Week, UX London, Agile, the IA Summit, and Webvisions. Her workshops and presentations have a reputation for being hands-on, high energy, and a little bit quirky—kind of like her.\n\nLeah is currently a design strategist at Intuit, where she works on the future of business and personal finance.
