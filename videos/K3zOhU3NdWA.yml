recordingDate: 1552460409
description: "Presented by John Austin, Founder / Technical Lead, A Stranger Gravity, Funomena\n\n\"Git is *the* source control system of the modern era. Yet, the vast majority of AAA game studios still use Perforce, SVN, and other more traditional systems. It’s not for a lack of desire, rather, game developers have a unique set of constraints and workflows that make Git unsuitable for the task.\n\nThis talk will illustrate how game workflows are unique, why Git doesn’t currently support these workflows (even with LFS), and introduce a new tool, Git Global Graph, that strives to build a path for even the largest AAA developer to use Git. We’ll explore constraints on Game Development workflows and introduce the Git Global Graph project, a tool designed to solve the above challenges without compromising on the fundamental structures and benefits of Git.\"\n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels. Git Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and to showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from contributors, maintainers and community managers around the world.
