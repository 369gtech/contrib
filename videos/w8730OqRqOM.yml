description: "\"How Did You Find That?\"\n\nSecurity… it’s important, right? For many people the answer would be “of course, why are you asking such a stupid question?” Well… if I didn’t, there wouldn’t be a session, would there?\n\nIn this talk, I will go through the internet, guiding you through its vast pipes and tubes, and showing you how to find everything from toilets to fuel dumps (see what I did there!).\n\nWe will wander into places you thought would never exist, and I will show you some of the “What were you thinking?!!!” moments online."
