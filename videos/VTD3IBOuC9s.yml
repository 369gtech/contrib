description: 'Agile SW development is becoming mainstream. The pattern repeats the same over and over. "A company develops SW products by means of expensive projects. Each project takes a long time to be finished and has usually a complex organization, with many roles involved. Meanwhile the market gets very turbulent and it becomes more and more difficult to predict long-term customer needs. At the same time customers cut down investments and a strong competition rises: customer capitalism age has come. The company finds themselves not equipped to navigate in a stormy sea. Until someone gets a great idea: let’s adopt Agile!" And here´s where the real challenge starts. Agile is not plug and play! It''s not a simple upgrade of the SW methodology currently in use in the company! Embracing Agile means much more than the mere application of a number of practices: it changes some of the basic assumptions and thoughts about how products get developed! So what is needed for an organization to really leverage on Agile SW development to deliver quality products in an effective way? The talk, based on the experience and the learning of the speaker as a coach at Ericsson in Italy and Sweden, will show what you cannot miss to set the foundation of a successful Agile enterprise transformation, whether you work in a big or small company.'
