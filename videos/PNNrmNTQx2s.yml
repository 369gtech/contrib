A database column? Over here, it's a field in a form. Over there, it's a parameter in a request. It's the thing we decorate in our views. It's the thing we filter in our controllers.\n\nWe call it an “attribute”, and it's all these things and more. We take it for granted, but this innocent little idea is a window into the beating heart of our web framework. Behind its magic are valuable lessons to be learned.\n\nJoin me as we delve beneath the surface of ActiveModel and ActiveRecord, to the complex abstractions that make attributes so powerful, and so elusive."
