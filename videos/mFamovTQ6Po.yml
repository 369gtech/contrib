description: "Options Galore to Get from Source Code to Container - Matthias Haeussler, Novatec\n\nA typical workflow in a modern software dev project can look like: Build code, put built artifact into container image, put container image into registry, deploy. Each step has it’s own requirements and pitfalls alike. Dockerfiles seems to be the choice with the highest adoption when it comes to containerizing code artifacts. However there are options, which might remove some of the pitfalls and standardize the entire process even more. The talk will give deeper insights by comparing (multi-stage) Dockerfiles to Cloud-Native Buildpacks (buildpacks.io/paketo.io) and Google’s JIB under the evaluation criteria of build time, build size, standardization, robustness and security. The intended take-away of the session is a better overview of container building and deployment options along with understanding of requirements, advantages and drawbacks.\n\nTo learn more about Cloud Foundry, The Proven Developer Experience For Kubernetes click here: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
