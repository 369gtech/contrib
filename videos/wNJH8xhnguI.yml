description: "droidcon Italy webinar\n29 September 2020 \nDaniele Mazzocchi, Senior Mobile Software Engineer, Accenture\n\nA Geolocated Journey\n\nAccess to our location is a fundamental feature resulting from various extremely complex positioning system projects. This talk will cover three main points. The first is to present the different positioning systems that allow us to access our position in our working and non-working lives. The second is to discuss the potential that Google Mobile Services offer us regarding positioning and how to replace them or combine them with the new Huawei Mobile Services. And finally we will go over how to run a proper test on a geolocation-dependent app by sharing a helpful support module to help developers and testers with testing their geolocated apps.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
