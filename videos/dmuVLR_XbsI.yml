description: "Speaker: Jaya Mathew\n\nWith the need to cater to a global audience, there is a growing demand for applications to support speech identification/translation/transliteration from one language to another. This session aims at introducing the audience to the topic and how to quickly use some of the readily available APIs to identify, translate or even transliterate speech/text within their application.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nOver the last few years, multitude of customers routinely come with various machine translation use cases. Here are a few examples:\n• Identify which language is being spoken/typed by the user.\n• How do I translate one language to another for the user?\n• Is there a way to transliterate text from one language to another?\nHard problems such as these and many more like them are now readily solved using advanced API’s that are readily available without having to reinvent the wheel.\nThis talk starts off with a brief introduction to the topic of Machine Translation, then it moves on to introduce some of the typical customer cases and finally ends with how to embed such functionality in your application. The talk will end with a Python based solution demo and introduce the audience to some resources and tools that could help them as they continue to explore the domain.\nOUTCOMES/CONCLUSION\nThe goal of this talk is to provide a robust means for the audience to discover opportunities and to learn how to quickly apply Machine Translation in their applications.\nWe will provide a framework for attendees to accomplish the following goals:\n• Improve their understanding of the domain of Machine Translation.\n• Qualify new opportunities and assess their fit for Machine Translation.\n• Smoothly embed Machine Translation using APIs in their applications."
