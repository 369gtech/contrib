recordingDate: 1392026697
description: "http://jdk.io/\n\nXtend is a flexible and expressive dialect of Java. It compiles to idiomatic source code that can be compiled and run an any JVM since Java5. Without any gap, you can use all you favorite Java libraries. The compiled Java source code is readable and pretty printed, runs as fast as handwritten code and can be processed by existing tools like annotation processors or static code analyzers.\n\nIf you want to become more productive and write beautiful code with powerful macros, lambdas, and many more modern language features, Xtend is the right choice. In this code centric session, you'll see it in action with real world examples using JavaFX, Android and other exciting frameworks."
