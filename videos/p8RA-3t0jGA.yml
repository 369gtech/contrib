description: "droidcon Italy webinar\n30 June 2020\nSebastiano Poggi, Software Engineer, JetBrains\n\nMost Android developers are familiar with Kotlin and use it every day with great success (and joy!). But the bloodline of the language extends well beyond Android! From cross-platform development, to the desktop, to the web, to backends, Kotlin’s pedigree as a versatile language puts all us developers in a great position to leverage existing knowledge for a variety of tasks outside a mobile engineer’s comfort zone. In this session we’ll use Kotlin, Ktor and coroutines to write a backend for our splendid fictional mobile app product: PushBeat.\n\nAfter learning the basics of a RESTful API, we’ll see what Ktor takes care of for us, what features may be helpful for our mobile projects, and how little we actually need to learn to be a productive backend engineer in no time!\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
