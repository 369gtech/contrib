title: 'GeeCON 2018: Michał Płachta - Building testable APIs using functions & meshes'
recordingDate: 1532330828
description: 'In this live coding talk you will learn about functional techniques that encourage separation of concerns. I will build a stateful HTTP API from highly isolated components that are easier to test than entangled spaghetti-like codebases. I will show you how tests can help us scaffold the architecture and how should we approach testing in the era of microservices. In the session I will use immutability, type parameters and function parameters as tools to implement a very practical example: Pac-Man game web server. I will code in Scala using Akka HTTP and deploy to Kubernetes with Istio service mesh.'
