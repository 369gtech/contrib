description: 'The Eclipse Collections framework is a feature-rich open source Java collections framework. This session explains the design of the framework and demonstrates many problems it solves. The session includes examples of object and primitive containers; the rich APIs available for eager and lazy iteration patterns; mutable and immutable collections; and additional container types not available in the JDK, such as Bag and Multimap.'
