recordingDate: 1468316258
description: "Everyone has heard about microservices. Someone tries to implement them in practice. And only the bravests of us have already used them in production environment. But then why so many people hype around microservices, if the idea is not quite new? What are microservices? What is the difference between it and good old SOA approach? How can developers create modern enterprise applications in Java easily with the help of this approach?\n\nOur guests should try to answer these questions and share their own experience related to live coding of imaginary startup ‘Hippos’.\n\nThe following topics will be covered:\n\n- What are microservices? Where is the theory, bro?\n- What kind of technologies should we choose? What have we chosen and why?\n- Why RPC is still competetive in REST-domination era?\n- How to pack and distribute microservices? How can SpringBoot and Docker help us to solve our problems?\n- Why is service discovery considered as one of the crucial components? How to cook Spring Cloud and what problems you may face in real life?\n- Security of microservices, API gateway and other.\n\nSpeakers will also cover other topics related to distributed system development."
