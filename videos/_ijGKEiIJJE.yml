description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSponsored Session: Palo Alto Networks - Reinforcing Your Defenses to Secure Cloud Native Applications \n\nMalicious actors are moving as quickly as development teams to exploit weaknesses in cloud native applications. Far too often we see common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations as the culprit of the latest security incident. Securing critical cloud native applications requires the ability to identify the root causes of these risks and the speed to mitigate them pre-production. In this talk we will cover the processes needed to stay ahead of the bad actors and tools needed to inject security throughout the development lifecycle.  1. How security and development teams can succeed together 2. Purpose built security tools that embed security checks directly into familiar DevOps tooling 3. The scanning of IaC templates, K8's manifests and container images in the CI/CD pipeline 4. Enforce zero trust posture and runtime security \n\nhttps://sched.co/fdjK"
