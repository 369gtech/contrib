title: 'CON3572   Gluon  JavaFX for the Mobile Enterprise'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449839114
description: "Gluon enables developers to create an end-to-end solution that offers a first-class user experience on desktop, mobile (iOS and Android), and embedded devices and that integrates with data synchronization and cloud services. The entirely Java-based technology allows for one code base for all devices. Gluon also provides IDE plugins and is responsible for continued development of the JavaFX Scene Builder tool to accelerate developersâ€™ work. This session shows how you can create enterprise JavaFX applications that run on a range of devices. Gluon technology is partially open source, so a large part of the presentation covers how developers can make use of this technology at no cost and how they can get involved.\n\nSpeakers:\nEugene Ryzhikov, CTO, Client Products, Gluon\nSoftware Architect at Nextera Energy, and co-founder of Gluon. Java , Scala and Desktop UI enthusiast. ControlsFX committer.\n\nJohan Vos, CTO Cloud Products, Gluon\nJohan Vos started to work with Java in 1995. He was part of the Blackdown team helping port Java to Linux. With LodgON, the company he co-founded, he is mainly working on Java based solutions for social networking software. In 2015, Johan co-founded Gluon, a company providing services and tools for Java Client development. Because he can't make a choice between embedded development and enterprise development, his main focus is on end-to-end Java, combining the strengths of back-end systems and embedded devices. His favourite technologies are currently Java EE / Glassfish at the backend and JavaFX at the front-end. Johan is a Java Champion, a member of the BeJUG steering group, the Devoxx steering group and he is a JCP member. He is the lead author of the Pro JavaFX 8 book, and he has been a speaker at numerous conferences on Java (including JavaOne and Devoxx).
