title: 'Four Productive Ways to Use Open Source JFR and JMC by Martin Klähn'
recordingDate: 1581886336
description: "With Java Flight Recorder and Java Mission Control now being open-sourced and usable for free by everyone, it is time to investigate uses besides the standard full-blown Java Mission Control client application. This session introduces you to four ways you can access and visualize Java Flight Recorder data: (1) from the console, which is interesting for all those microservices people who love terminal windows; (2) within your build process for test evaluation; (3) from within a simple standalone JavaFX application, for all those UI people; and (4) as a plugin for your favorite IDE. All examples are shown with live code and slides to explain the main points.\n\nMartin Klähn\nAirbus Defence and Space GmbH\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
