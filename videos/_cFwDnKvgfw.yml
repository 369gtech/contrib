description: "Suppose you need to write a new Java front end to an existing C or C++ back end. Or perhaps you plan to hand-code a critical part of your application in C. This presentation will help you use JNI or JNA to call native code from Java. It discusses how JNI and JNA work, their limitations, and their overheads. It also covers use of tools such as Oracle Solaris Studio to ensure that the code is both correct and efficient.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDarryl Gove\nDarryl Gove is a senior principal software engineer in the Solaris Studio team, working on optimising applications and benchmarks for current and future processors. He is also the author of the books Multicore Application Programming, The Developer's Edge, and Solaris Application Programming.
