description: "Filmed at http://2015.dotcss.io on December 4th in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\nCSS has focused a lot on layout issues and less on APIs or expanding its domain of use. After many years spent co-chairing the CSS Working Group, Daniel argues that it is time to fix that issue."
