description: "Ok, we've got M-models: ApplicationRecord.new \nWe've got C-controllers: ApplictionController.new \nAnd of course V-view: SWOOSH \nOk, we have some magic here inside Rails, but what can we use to have real view layer. ERB? That's just templates.\nI would like to make an overview of some solutions we already have.\n* Arbre / RABL as DSL to render \n* Presenters / Serializers / Grape-entities for logicless view-templates\n* Cells as View Component / Hanami-view / Dry-view with really similar approach of separation view-model from template."
