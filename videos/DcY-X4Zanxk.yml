recordingDate: 1553168047
description: "Machine learning is rapidly entering many domains in the SW industry - allowing us to automate and achieve capabilities we didnâ€™t envision as possible in the past. In this talk, Victoriya shares her journey of exploring machine learning capabilities and leveraging them for improving maintenance of actual machines.\n\nAs part of her role as R&D group lead at the Israeli Navy's technological unit, she had to deal a lot with vehicles, engines and machines. As part of her goal of improving machines maintenance efficiency, Victoriya explored and introduced predictive maintenance practices based on data science and machine learning solutions that were not part of our toolkit up-to that point.\n\nHopefully, this talk will ignite your imagination of additional arenas machine, software of human based where machine learning could help leap into the future.\n\nBio: Victoriya Kalmanovich is an R&D group lead at the Israeli Navy's technological unit.\nShe specializes in healing work environments, promotes and leads innovative and broad processes throughout the organization.\nIn her day-to-day experience, she deals with all technological issues, product management, budgets and client handling of her group."
