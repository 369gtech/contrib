description: "AngularJS was originally created in 2009 as an end-to-end solution for web designers wanting to build simple web apps. Over the last 6 years it has evolved into a component based MVC framework targeted at JavaScript developers. To maintain backward compatibility, Angular has had to hold onto many deprecated concepts. This has caused some of Angular’s APIs to be complex and easy to misuse. Angular 2 is a complete rewrite of Angular 1 which eliminates the outdated concepts and takes full advantage of modern web standards like ES6, TypeScript, and Web Components.\n\nIn this session you’ll learn which Angular 1 features to avoid and how to write an Angular 1 app that will be easy to migrate into Angular 2. We’ll go through the process of refactoring an Angular 1 app to prep it for migration. Then Rob will demonstrate how to incrementally migrate to Angular 2. You’ll come away from this session with a better understanding of what Angular 2 has to offer and how to start taking advantage of it.\n\nRob McDiarmid\nFull-Stack Developer, Konrad Group\nhttps://twitter.com/RobIanMcd\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
