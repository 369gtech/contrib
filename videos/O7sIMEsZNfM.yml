language: French
recordingDate: 1634026441
description: 'Itâ€™s (post) Java 11 time now. (Just in case your boss didnâ€™t notice ðŸ˜‰) In this talk, Iâ€™d like to tell you how I managed to migrate two real Java server apps to Java 11 and show some demos. Why was it done? How to convince the business? What and how was done? What wasnâ€™t required? Does anyone read licenses, manuals, and talksâ€™ descriptions? Where did I fail in the first approach? Was it worth it? Some hints for you.'
