description: "When you build an app, you typically need to choose agility with serverless or flexibility with containers but not both. But why does it have to be that way? Wouldn't it be nice to have the best of both worlds?\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore the open source project Knative and its managed version Cloud Run. Through a series of demos, we'll see how these projects enable you to deploy and manage containers in a serverless way on wherever you want, on-prem or in the cloud.\n\nOnce we understand the building blocks of Knative and Cloud Run, we'll look at a modernization case study where an old ASP.NET monolith was decomposed into a set of loosely-coupled, event-driven, Cloud Run microservices. We'll go through the transformation journey, explore the decision points, and deep dive into the final architecture with a discussion of pros/cons.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
