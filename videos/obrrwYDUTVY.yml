description: "On July 18th, 28 high school-aged girls arrived at Pivotal’s San Francisco offices for an immersive introduction to Pivotal’s agile software development and data science practices. As part of the Girls Who Code initiative, participants were given an opportunity to try out Pivotal’s pair programming approach while receiving guidance and mentorship from a number of Pivotal’s expert developers and data scientists.\n\nWatch this frank panel discussion featuring the participating Women of Pivotal, which includes Data Scientist, Sarah Aerni, developers Laura Kogler and Rachel Bobbins, designer Pam Dineva, and Elisabeth Hendrickson, Director of Quality Engineering for Cloud Foundry. The Pivotal women gave more insight into their own educational and professional paths, and identified what they love about their jobs, including working with smart people, travel, pair programming, and opportunities to solve real-world problems that matter. They took questions from the Girls Who Code participants, who asked the panelists what challenges they have faced in the industry because they are women.\n\nRead the full coverage here: \n\nhttp://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/features/pivotal-connects-girls-who-code-with-data-science-and-agile-software-development"
