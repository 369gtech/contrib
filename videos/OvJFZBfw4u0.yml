description: 'Our world is full of opportunities to learn from class rooms to communities to MOOCs, but it is difficult to take some sort of cross platform indicator of our achievements with us everywhere. Open Badges aims to give you recognition for skills you learn anywhere. Balázs will give a quick introduction to the Mozilla Open Badges project.'
