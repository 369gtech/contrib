description: "Holden Karau, Spark - Beyond Wordcount With Datasets & Scaling\n\nPresented on January 11, 2018, at the Nike Tech Talks\n\nApache Spark is one of the most popular big data systems, but once the shiny finish starts to wear off you can find yourself wondering if you've accidentally deployed a Ford Pinto into production. This talk will look at the challenges that come with scaling Spark jobs. Also, the talk will explore Spark's new(ish) Dataset/DataFrame API, as well as how it’s evolving in Spark 2.3 with improved Python support.\n \nIf you're already a Spark user, come to find out why it’s not all your fault. If you aren't already a Spark user, come to find out how to save yourself from some of the pitfalls once you move beyond the example code.\n \nCheck out Holden's newest book, High Performance Spark, for more information!\n\n---\n\nHolden is a transgender Canadian open source developer advocate with a focus on Apache Spark, BEAM, and related \"big data\" tools. She is the co-author of Learning Spark, High Performance Spark, and another Spark book that's a bit more out of date. She is a committer on the Apache Spark, SystemML, and Mahout projects. Prior to joining Google as a Developer Advocate she worked at IBM, Alpine, Databricks, Google (yes this is her second time), Foursquare, and Amazon.\n\nWhen not in San Francisco, Holden speaks internationally about different big data technologies (mostly Spark). She was tricked into the world of big data while trying to improve search and recommendation systems and has long since forgotten her original goal. Outside of work she enjoys playing with fire, riding scooters, and dancing."
