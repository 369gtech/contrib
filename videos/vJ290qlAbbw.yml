description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nThis course provides a survey of C++20 ranges and their application. Ranges are the largest revamp of the Standard Template Library (STL) in 20 years and will impact daily C++ programming dramatically. Some of the changes seem minor, but full utilization of ranges is much more transformational to coding practice.\n\nThe tutorial goes beyond the basics to explore what's behind the library. For example, understand the key differences between algorithms and views and when to apply them.\_ Chock full of example code this tutorial will bootstrap programmer's usage of std::ranges.\n— \nJeff Garland\nCrystalClear Software\nPhoenix, Az\nJeff Garland has worked on many large-scale, distributed software projects over the past 25+ years. The systems span many different domains including telephone switching, industrial process control, satellite ground control, ip-based communications, and financial systems. He has written C++ networked code for several large systems including the development high performance network servers and data distribution frameworks.Mr. Garland’s interest in Boost started in 2000 as a user. Since then he has developed Boost.date_time, become a moderator, served as a review manager for several libraries (including asio and serialization), administered the Boost wiki, and served as a mentor for Google Summer of Code. Mr. Garland holds a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University and a Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering from the University of Arizona. He is co-author of Large Scale Software Architecture: A Practical Guide Using UML. He is currently Principal Consultant for his own company: CrystalClear Software, Inc.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
