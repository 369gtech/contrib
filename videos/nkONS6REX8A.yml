The presentation will focus on the opportunities of using Splunk to make efficient the DevOps ecosystem and what steps you should do to get your infrastructure AI ready.\nThe beating heart of devops is automation. But often efficient automation is possible only if you can manage correctly feedbacks from processes, give them meaning, and apply real time remediation. Large infrastructures that adopt devops to deliver software have huge machine data that should be understood to take the correct decisions. These machines are useful to extract significant data and metrics that could lead to a better understanding of the system. The presentation shows what is the best design for devops infrastructures data driven, what are the relevant tools to adopt (Splunk) and what the way they works together."
