title: 'Build a 3D World in React with ThreeJS and React Three Fiber'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620516017
description: "This video starts with me talking about the diference between React and ReactDOM. React Three Fiber uses React to keep track of 3D objects that gets rendered in a webGL canvas via three.js . The result is the ability to code 3D environments the same way you are used to code a React Web Application. We can even add physics and animation to the 3D objects in the world. In this example we place a Box on a Plane inside a Skybox of stars. We then add physics to let the box fall on the plane and finally we interact with the box by attaching a click event to the box. For the physics we are using React hooks for  Cannon.js.Code for the video: https://github.com/danba340/react-three-fiber-exampleSay hi on twitter: https://twitter.com/barelydaniel​0:00​ React vs ReactDOM1:13​ React Three Fiber2:18​ Boilerplate3:20​ Creating a Box4:20​ Controlling the camera5:35​ Lights6:23​ SkyBox of Stars7:00​ Creating a Ground Plane9:00​ Physics with Cannon.js11:30​ Interacting via Click Event13:00​ Outro\n\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nDaniel Bark provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish his videos on Coding Tech YouTube channel. \n\n\n\nCREDITS: \nBarely Coding with Daniel Bark YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgUCptbp4T5saC5WXePe1sw\n\n\n***\n\n\nINTERESTED IN THE STOCK MARKET?\nI developed a profitable stock market trend following model.
