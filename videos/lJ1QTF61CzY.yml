description: "It’s strange but true: six years after the PDF reference was published as an ISO standard (ISO-32000-1), there are still developers who think that the Portable Document Format is a closed document format owned by Adobe. PDF is often perceived as a strange, impenetrable document format. It’s high time we bury that idea and take a look at what’s going on in the world of PDF today. Different ISO committees are currently working on new standards such as PDF 2.0 (to be released in 2015), XFDF, and ECMAScript for PDF. Substandards such as PDF/X, PDF/A, PDF/E, PDF/VT, and PDF/UA are updated on a regular basis. This tutorial uses Java to unlock some PDF mysteries and to guide developers through the standards via simple code samples.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBruno Lowagie\nundefined\nView more trainings by Bruno Lowagie at https://www.parleys.com/author/bruno-lowagie\n\n Raf Hens\nRaf Hens was born in Belgium on November 1, 1981.
