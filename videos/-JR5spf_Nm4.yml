description: "Fully Reactive - from Data to UI with OrientDB + Node.js + Socket.io - Luigi Dell Aquila - Codemotion Rome 2015\n\nHaving both a reactive application layer and front-end is just not enough anymore. Today's reality demands a fully reactive architecture where all the layers, including the database, are able to interact with each other using a paradigm. In this presentation, you'll learn how to build a fully reactive application in a few minutes with just a few lines of code resulting in every database change propagating asynchronously between the application layer and the front-end."
