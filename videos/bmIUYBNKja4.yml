description: "(Until YouTube allows replacing videos, audio issues are fixed at https://vimeo.com/302785171)\n\nLike it or not, a huge part of modern web development involves the use of third-party providers: fonts, analytics, ads, tracking, and more all have an impact of performance, and can leave us (or, more worryingly, our visitors) susceptible to performance degradation.\n\nIn this talk, we'll take a look at unruly or uninvited (third-)party guests: how to detect them, how to audit them, and how to manage them. We'll also look at the different tools available to help us stress-test and quantify the overhead these third parties bring, and what that means for users and businesses alike.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/its-my-third-party-and-ill-cry-if-i-want-to\nAbout Harry: https://csswizardry.com/\n\nMore about performance.now(); https://perfnow.nl or https://twitter.com/perfnowconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://perfnow.nl/subscribe"
