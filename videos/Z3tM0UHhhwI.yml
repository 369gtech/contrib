title: 'Domain-driven Design and Strategic Design Through the Looking Glass (Eberhard Wolff, INNOQ)'
language: German
recordingDate: 1589289876
description: "After 15 years, Domain-driven Design (DDD) is currently experiencing a renaissance: It is a promising approach to modularize large systems and microservices. In practice, however, misunderstandings and issues often arise. This presentation addresses the typical challenges in the field of strategic design and shows some possible solutions. Among others it deals with organizational implications, splitting a system into bounded contexts, possible relationships between bounded contexts and also data consistency between bounded contexts.\n\nSPEAKER: Eberhard Wolff – https://twitter.com/ewolff\n\nFellow at INNOQ\n\nEberhard Wolff has 15+ years of experience as an architect and consultant - often on the intersection of business and technology. He is a Fellow at INNOQ in Germany. As a speaker, he has given talks at international conferences and as an author, he has written more than 100 articles and books e.g. about Microservices and Continuous Delivery. His technological focus is on modern architectures – often involving Cloud, Continuous Delivery, DevOps, or Microservices."
