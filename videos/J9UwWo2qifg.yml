title: 'Cyrille Martraire: Crafting monoids in your software - SCLConf 2018'
language: English
recordingDate: 1539176170
description: "You probably cannot imagine that Monoids (not monads) are so simple maths creatures that you can understand them in just a few minutes. But you probably don't imagine either that they can help you craft elegant and powerful code that pushes composability to the max. And composability is good! Through many examples and a demonstration with glasses of beers, you will discover how monoids are an important tool in your toolbox. Even in languages like Java or C#, this talk will influence your coding style forever!\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2018, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
