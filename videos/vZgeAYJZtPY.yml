description: "A Google TechTalk, presented by Federico Fusco, 2021/09/21\nABSTRACT: An Algorithms TechTalk.  Abstract. Bilateral trade, a fundamental topic in economics, models the problem of intermediating between two strategic agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to trade a good for which they hold private valuations. Despite the simplicity of this problem, a classical result by Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983) affirms the impossibility of designing a mechanism which is simultaneously efficient, incentive compatible, individually rational, and budget balanced.\n\nThis impossibility result fostered an intense investigation of meaningful trade-offs between these desired properties. Much work has focused on approximately efficient fixed-price mechanisms, i.e., Blumrosen and Dobzinski (2014; 2016), Colini-Baldeschi et al. (2016), which have been shown to fully characterize strong budget balanced and ex-post individually rational direct revelation mechanisms. All these results, however, either assume some knowledge on the priors of the seller/buyer valuations, or a black box access to some samples of the distributions, as in Dütting et al. (2021).\n\nIn this paper, we cast for the first time the bilateral trade problem in a regret minimization framework over T rounds of seller/buyer interactions, with no prior knowledge on the private seller/buyer valuations. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of the regret regimes for fixed-price mechanisms with different models of feedback and private valuations, using as benchmark the best fixed price in hindsight.\n\nBased on a joint work with Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Tommaso R. Cesari, Roberto Colomboni and Stefano Leonardi appeared at EC 2021.\narXiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08754.pdf\n\nAbout the speaker: Federico is a third year PhD student at Sapienza University of Rome under the supervision of Stefano Leonardi.
