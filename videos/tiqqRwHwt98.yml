description: "Spring I/O 2017 - 18 -19 May, Barcelona\n\nSpring 5 is almost here! One of the most exciting introductions in this release is support for reactive programming, building on Pivotal's Project Reactor to support message-driven, elastic, resilient, and responsive services. Spring 5 integrates an MVC-like component model adapted to support reactive processing and a new type of web endpoint, functional reactive endpoints. In this talk, we'll look at the net-new Netty-based web runtime and how to integrate it with existing Spring-stack technologies."
