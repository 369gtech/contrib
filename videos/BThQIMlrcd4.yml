description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTOpia Europe 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOpia\nhttp://gotopia.eu\n\nPhil Winder - Phil masters the hard art of backing theory by real-life experience. There is always more to learn about data and reinforcement learning\n\nABSTRACT\nReinforcement learning (RL), a sub-discipline of machine learning, has been gaining academic and media notoriety after hyped marketing \"reveals\" of agents playing various games. But these hide the fact that RL is immensely useful in many practical, industrial situations where hand-coding strategies or policies would be impractical or sub-optimal.\nFollowing the theme of Phil's new book Reinforcement Learning, Phil will present a rebuttal to the hyperbole by analyzing five different industrial case studies from a variety of sectors.\nYou will learn where RL can be applied, how to spot challenges that fit inside the RL paradigm [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:36 Reinforcement learning\n08:06 How can RL help?\n11:50 What do I need?\n17:23 Manufacturing (i.e. Robotics)\n28:32 Tech\n32:24 Transport\n33:44 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotopia.eu/2020/sessions/1457/industrial-applications-of-reinforcement-learning\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Data #ReinforcementLearning #RL #MachineLearning #ArtificialIntelligence\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
