description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Cornelia Davis\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/running-your-spring-apps-in-the-cloud\nThe Spring Trader application was debuted at SpringOne 2GX in 2012 and presented an application that demonstrates a multitude of Pivotal Application Fabric components working together – tcServer, RabbitMQ, SQLFire and Gemfire. In this session we will take that application and make (a few) modifications (mostly to config) to get it running on the same components in the cloud, specifically on the Cloud Foundry PaaS. We’ll show you how to use the Spring Cloud project to configure the deployment, how to leverage a cloud services catalog, how to implement a cross-site scripting solution (and why), how to do session state caching and we’ll discuss (the dangers of) auto reconfiguration. If you bring a laptop you can have your own instance of the app running by the end of the session."
