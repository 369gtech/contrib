description: "(Pre-recorded GDC content)\n\nTired of fighting to fit your textures on disk? Too many bad reviews on long download times? Fix it! Don't settle for putting your raw DXT files in a ZIP, instead, compress your DXT textures by an extra 50%-70%! This talk will cover various ways to increase the compression of your game textures to allow for smaller distributables without introducing error, and allowing for fast on-demand decompression at run time. We'll cover how to losslessly squeeze your data with Huffman, block expansion, vector quantization, and we'll even take a look at what MegaTexture is doing too. If you've ever fought to fit textures into memory, this is the talk for you.\n\nSpeaker: Colt McAnlis"
