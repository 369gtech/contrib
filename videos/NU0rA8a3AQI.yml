description: "This talk was recorded at CukenFest London 2018\n\nhttp://cukenfest.cucumber.io/\n\nWait. I know what you're probably thinking. This is just another rehash of BDD and that you have heard it all before…\n\nBut, empathy on its own has a strong, immediate effect.  Put in an agile context, it’s a powerful tool that has the ability to change the face of software design.  I’ll talk about why empathy is a gift, that keeps on giving.  How it can be used in not just testing but throughout the whole development cycle.  From drawing up empathic driven design pieces to writing automation code that not only puts the end user at heart but how the user feels at a particular step. \n\nBut it’s more than this.\n\nNo matter what field you work in, the challenges faced and the obstacles to overcome will be the same.  Whether you’re a scrum master wanting to have constructive retrospectives to a developer thinking about what scenarios to automate.  The use of empathy is translucent, shedding light on areas such as neurodiversity which is often overlooked.\n\nI would like to share my experiences on how using empathy has helped me to overcome challenges in the workplace, be it technical or non-technical.  Along with the stories I’ve heard where empathy has made an impact and as such needs to be passed on.\n\nWe have an innate ability within us that requires no programming language to learn or pattern to follow.  This talk aims to unleash this."
