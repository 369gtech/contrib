Weâ€™ll also see Vincent live code a contribution to an open source chatbot that allows you to ask anything about pokemon.\n\nVincent is helping out the research and developer advocacy teams at rasa.com. This means that you can ask him anything related to NLP and chatbots. He also helped start PyData Amsterdam, which has been described as \"simply the best data conference in the Netherlands.\"\n\n\n----------------------------\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
