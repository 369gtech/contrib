description: "Dana Shoushan-Whol, Initiator of the Citizenship field, global R&D center @ Microsoft Israel\n\nWe keep hearing the mantra, calling out for equality between men and women in the high-tech industry. But when trying to run backwards down each gender’s career funnel, we realize the one that women go through just isn’t wide enough, and to be honest, it never was.\nHow can we change that equation? Does it require a different set of actions and activities than the ones implemented on the boy’s group? \n\nMicrosoft is investing in both research and field operated programs to locate the genome of this challenge. The company is consolidating their activities to fit girls in all age groups starting at the age of 8 and up. Working hard to bring into the room a mixture of career paths, motivation criteria, high end technology, and a lot of honesty via personal relationships.\n\nIn this lecture, we get to know Microsoft’s efforts to change the equation. We will also understand how we can work side by side, parents, educators, and future employers to jointly promote answers to this complex situation."
