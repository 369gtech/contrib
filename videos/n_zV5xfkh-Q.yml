description: 'In a world of open source, open ideas, and open collaboration, incredible opportunity exists for programmers that know how to grasp it. Participating in open source and the worldwide discussion of ideas can be a powerful way to boost your career, improve your skills, and lead a more fulfilling programming life. Succeeding in this world can be a struggle â€“ the well-known phrase "build it and they will come" could not be more false. Success requires you to grow in many new ways. For those willing to push their boundaries, the rewards are worth the effort a hundred times over.'
