language: English
recordingDate: 1632164398
description: 'This. Is. Jeopardy. ICS-style. Join our intrepid contestants in a full round of the iconic game show Jeopardy as they test their knowledge of the various categories every good cybersecurity expert should know—including historical ICS incidents, nerdy fiction and random trivia—all the while performing on-the-spot asset identification (aka: figuring out the remote buzzer system because we''re still in a pandemic.) Tune in to watch Maggie Morganti of Schneider Electric, Chris Sistrunk of Mandiant, and Tatyana Bolton of the R Street Institute battle it out to win one of three, appropriately mediocre, prizes.'
