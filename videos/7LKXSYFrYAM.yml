description: "Mobile app hacking peaked in 2015 with tools like keychain-dumper & ssl-kill-switch released but requiring jailbroken/rooted devices. Back then, wresting the power to understand & modify apps on our devices from dystopian looking mega corps was our cause. As jailbreaks became infrequent, the hackers’ arsenal was left behind. While this is progress against dark uses of hacking, done to protect our freedom fighters, how can hackers still hold power to account? Can we still find flaws in apps/devices & live up to the protections the technology promises?\n\nEnter runtime binary instrumentation with Frida. It’s possible to analyze apps in their final state when executed on real hardware running the latest iOS/Android with no jailbreaks. This fills a gap between source analysis & debuggers. But, simply enumerating app classes requires studying multiple blogs & a deep read of the docs. We created Objection to simplify this & hide the boilerplate so hackers could focus on unravelling apps. But, many people still rely on simple hacks & automation & rarely use new advanced techniques such as reflectively inspecting live heap objects, canary execution tracing, runtime memory edits and filesystem exploration.\n\nWe’ll show hackers, malware researchers & security engineers how to use these advanced mobile hacking techniques.\n\nLeon Jacobs\nLeon has been hacking for over a decade. He’s plied his trade at SensePost for the last three having previously worked for a bank and ISP in South Africa. Leon spends most of his daytime hours hacking large networks or web and mobile applications. Leon spends most of his nighttime hours building hacking tools and techniques to contribute back to the community.\n\nTwitter: @leonjza"
