description: "Speaker(s):\nTomer Sharon\n\nDescription:\nApp developers ask themselves excellent questions about their users: Do people need my app? Can people use my app? Why do people sign up and then not use my app? However, app developers answer their excellent questions in invalid and unreliable ways. It is shocking to see how much effort app developers put in writing elegantly structured, refactored code, with good unit test coverage in an agile environment, and yet, their apps fail miserably. \nThis talk will inspire developers to implement valid and reliable ways to answer their most burning questions. It'll help them validate or invalidate their assumptions on their ownâ€”cheaply, and quickly, by using simple user research techniques with a main goal in mind: developing apps people need, want, and enjoy.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
