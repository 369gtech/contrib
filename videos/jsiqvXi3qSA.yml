title: 'High Performance JavaScript with Trevor Norris'
language: English
recordingDate: 1409705491
description: "Back in my early days web pages were optimized, for performance reasons, to reduce the number of client to server requests. For the most part those days are dead, and have been replaced with web pages that stay in constant communication with the server. The implications have changed the landscape of how to optimally build performant websites. Node.js can be one of the most powerful tools in this new world, but only if used wisely. We'll cover how to optimally handle large numbers of connections and the best ways to rapidly send many smaller packets to the client, what trade-offs there are, and expose when immediately streaming data is actually slower.\n\nAbout Trevor Norris\n\nTrevor Norris (@trevnorris) is a self-professed performance freak. He is a Node.js Core Contributor and is responsible for improving runtime performance and visibility. Trevor's background is in front-end development for enterprise level implementations, but now spends most of his time making JavaScript on the server blazing fast and predictable, plumbing the depths of V8 and libuv, and writing C/C++. Trevor's work on benchmarking, performance tuning and optimizing Node.js have changed the face of Node.js and how developers approach serverside JavaScript."
