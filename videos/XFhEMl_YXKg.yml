description: "Using Cloud Foundry Container Runtime to Run Your Kubernetes Clusters - Oleksandr Slynko, Pivotal & Kaiting Chen, VMware\n\n Cloud Foundry Container Runtime (CFCR and formerly Kubo) is an OSS project developed jointly by Vmware, Pivotal and Google. It provides an uniform way to instantiate, deploy, and manage highly available vanilla Kubernetes clusters using BOSH - on GCE, vSphere, AWS, Openstack and Azure.\n\nUsing BOSH and CFCR to manage Kubernetes gives self healing, easily upgradeable clusters with managed secrets rotation. Cluster creation is simplified to the point where clusters can be created and destroyed for use in development or sandbox environments.\n\nIn this presentation, Oleksandr and Kaiting will demonstrate deployment across multiple IAASes, cluster healing, cluster upgrade and cluster creation.\n\nAbout Kaiting Chen\nKaiting is a staff engineer at VMware. He is an active contributor to Cloud Foundry Container Runtime, working alongside with the Pivotal engineers.\n\nPreviously, Kaiting was the CTO and co-founder of a fintech patent-pending startup, developing an exchange for the transaction of illiquid securities initially intended for crowdfunded equity.\n\nAbout Oleksandr Slynko\nOleksandr is the anchor of Pivotal Container Service project. Before he was working on Cloud Foundry Container Runtime since the project inception. | Oleksandr has a background in automation and working on high available cloud solutions."
