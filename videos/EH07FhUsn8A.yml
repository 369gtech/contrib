description: "With so many AR/MR/VR devices out there, and the price range dropping, we are all able to take a leap into the virtual world with our apps.\nThis also means there are new ways to interact with your application, controllers, hands or even voice. But how do you design your apps and games? Do you look at movies like Minority report or Iron Man, to get ideas? What are the design pitfalls of Virtual, Augmented and Mixed realities and what do you need to think about? VR - Vommit Reality? In this space a bad user experience can actually make you nauseous. I will go through the differences in AR/MR/VR, where we can go wrong, how to fix it and a few pointers to keep in mind."
