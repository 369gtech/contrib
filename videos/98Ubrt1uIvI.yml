description: "Spring I/O 2018 - Barcelona, 24-25 May\n\nThe adoption of DevOps and Continuous Delivery provides tangible benefits such as higher quality, stability, and faster release cadence. One of the most important issues within this adoption is related to security quality tasks that have been traditionally implemented manually.\n\nThe talk will demonstrate the security integration of Spring ecosystem demo applications with the Jenkins CI server to jump start continuous and in-depth security testing into the DevOps CI/CD pipeline, via automation and orchestration."
