description: 'A quick introduction to Selenide (if my full session will not be accepted) Automated testing is a must nowadays. The bad news is that developers often skip writing UI tests because it''s tricky and boring. The good news is that there is a simple and powerful tool that makes writing UI tests really effective. This tool is Selenide - a free open-source library for writing concise and stable UI tests in Java. With Selenide you can forget all these timing issues, Ajax and browser whims. You can concentrate on business logic. During my session, I will demonstrate how you can easily write readable and stable tests that assure your application works after any changes and serve as an executable documentation. Target audience: beginner'
