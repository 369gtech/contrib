description: "Reinforcement learning has enjoyed its recent prominence with its combination with the class of rich function approximators known as deep neural networks. The combination, referred as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have demonstrated to perform on complex tasks from Atari games to robotics to self-driving cars. This tutorial dives into how to frame and solve DRL problem with python.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData London 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nImran Rashid\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permissions to republish PyData talks"
