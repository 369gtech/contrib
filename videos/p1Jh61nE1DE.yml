description: "Java applications are increasingly running in cloud environments. In a dynamic environment such as the cloud, we can no longer assume that the resources are\nstatically available. This session explores ways for Java applications to\nbe more in tune with the dynamic nature of the underlying resources. It also looks at what this means for developers and offers tips and techniques for making the most of running Java in the cloud.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDinakar Guniguntala\nDinakar Guniguntala is senior technical lead at the Java Technology Center,\nIBM India Software Labs and has been at IBM for over 16 years. He has extensively worked on Virtualization, Server Consolidation, and in his current role aims to make Java run more efficiently in the cloud.\nPrior to Java he has worked extensively on Operating Systems Development on OS/2 and Linux where he has worked in the areas of Embedded Linux, Threading (NPTL), Enterprise Real-Time and Linux scalability. He has several publications including in IEEE computer, IBM Systems Journal and IBM Developer Works.\nView more trainings by Dinakar Guniguntala at https://www.parleys.com/author/dinakar-guniguntala\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
