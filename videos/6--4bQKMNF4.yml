description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nZero Downtime Data Relocation with Vitess - Liz van Dijk & Deepthi Sigireddi, PlanetScale \n\nVitess has a flexible sharding architecture and natively supports \"cells\" which correspond to infrastructure located in multiple locations. This allows for the creation of jurisdiction-aware database clusters that solve data locality without having to re-architect your application. Also, Vitess's built-in support for resharding workflows makes migrating from existing databases into databases resident in multiple locations easy. In this talk the speakers will show how to build a custom sharding scheme in Vitess that respects data locality requirements. They will then demonstrate a database cluster built using this scheme that enables transfer of existing data belonging to people from 8 different countries from one jurisdiction to four(4) separate jurisdictions with zero downtime at the application level.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeoD"
