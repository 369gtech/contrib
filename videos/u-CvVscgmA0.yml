description: "The Twelve Factor Function - Desmond Rawls, Pivotal\n\nPaaS, CaaS, or FaaS? Every year brings more options for where to run a piece of code. As application developers, we follow guidelines like The 12 Factor App to make sure our apps can run anywhere. But what about our functions? How do we make sure our functions can run anywhere?\n\nIn this demonstration, I will migrate functionality from within an application on Cloud Foundry Application Runtime to a collection of functions running as services on Riff. In the process, I will highlight how well-known concepts like referential transparency and the interface segregation principle free us from caring where our software deploys to.\n\nAbout Desmond Pompa Alarcon Rawls\nSince joining Pivotal three years ago, Desmond has developed dozens of web apps. Recently, he rotated onto the Cloud Foundry infrastructure team, where he experiences first-hand the challenges of building a platform. After a long time using it, he can finally satisfy his curiosity about how Cloud Foundry actually works. This kind of change in perspective is the part of software that Desmond enjoys the most.\n\nWhen he lived in New York, Desmond organized Pivotal's Tuesday tech talk series. He has also spoken himself at many meetups and at the XP 2017 conference."
