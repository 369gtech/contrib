description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nMulti Cluster and Multi Mesh Patterns - Christian Posta, Solo.io \n\nThe more services connected by a mesh, the more value in consistent observability, security, and routing can be achieved. In today's complex heterogeneous environments, deploying everything into a single cluster and single mesh can be impossible. In this talk we look at some of the options and challenges for adopting a service mesh across multiple clusters and potentially across multiple meshes. We look at the challenges such as federating identity, single pane of glass for observability, developing policies et. al, as well as ways to solve these challenges. The patterns discussed here are not mesh specific and will use Istio, Linkerd, and App Mesh as examples. \n\nhttps://sched.co/abc9"
