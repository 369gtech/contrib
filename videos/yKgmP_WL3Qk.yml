description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nFirst Principles of Cloud Native Technology - Ronald Petty, RX-M LLC\n\nHave you ever inherited a system? If you ever feel unclear the system's purpose, it's time to break it down into first principles. With so many Cloud Native tools available it can be overwhelming to decide which tools are most directly solving the problem (or could solve it). We will take a systematic approach to enumerating and grouping core issues and how the related tools solve them. We start with a review of core operating concepts, basic data and network models. From there we contrast OS level solutions to these problems and their challenges. We next enter the Cloud Native layer and see how they leverage OS level concepts to solve these problems. Finally, we compare potential solutions to core issues at different levels (OS or Cloud Native). This talk is focused on how to break down tools into functional areas and contrast them to each other. Leaving this session you will have more techniques to reason about these tools and model solutions."
