description: "How far have you gotten with learning about the cloud? Got your head around platform as a service? Understand what IaaS means? Know how to spell Docker? It’s easy to focus on learning new technology, but it’s time to take a step back and look at what the technical implications are when an application is heading to the cloud. In the world of the cloud, the benefits are high but the economics (financial and technical) can be radically different. Learn about these new realities and how they can change application design, deployment, and support. Cloud technologies and their rapid adoption are creating new opportunities and challenges. Whether you’re a designer, developer, or tester, this session will help you start thinking differently about Java and the cloud.\n\nSpeaker:\nSteve Poole, Lead Engineer IBM Cloud and Development Platforms, IBM\nSteve Poole is a DevOps practitioner (leading a large team of engineers on cutting edge DevOps exploitation) and a long time IBM Java developer, leader and evangelist. He’s been working on IBM Java SDKs and JVMs since Java was less than 1.
