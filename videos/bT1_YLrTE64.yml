Increasingly, this software is based on the AUTOSAR standard, drawn up by a consortium including Toyota, Ford, GM, and most of the world's other major car manufacturers. AUTOSAR defines the \"basic software\" which should run on each processor, providing a standardised environment enabling AUTOSAR applications to be distributed freely around the processors in the car.\n\nSuch is the theory. In practice, the basic software is supplied by multiple vendors, and follows the standard to a greater or lesser degree. Mixing software from different vendors can lead to unexpected failures as a result. For the last year Quviq has been working with Volvo to model AUTOSAR basic software components using Erlang, and test them for compliance using QuickCheck. I'll present some of the challenges and results--which may help make your car more reliable in the future!\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter @Erlangfactory  https://twitter.com/#!/erlangfactory \nJoin our group on Linkedin Erlang Factory  http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Erlang-Factory-2003110?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr"
