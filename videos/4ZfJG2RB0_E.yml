language: English
recordingDate: 1630507219
description: "This session is from NDC Sydney 2020\n\nHow do I let my systems talk with each other in the Cloud or let's say in Azure? Well, Microsoft's answer to that is Azure Integration Services (AIS) - consisting of Logic Apps, API Management, Event Grid and the Service Bus. With these components, you can build solutions in Azure to facilitate communication between on-premise systems, SaaS systems or Azure services or what is known as integration.\n\nAIS allows you to build various types of integration solutions leveraging different messaging mechanisms and ways of 'loose coupling'. Furthermore, AIS can help in automating your business processes whether or not in combination with the Power Platform component - Power Automate.\n\nIn this session, we shall discuss the AIS Components, the options for a solution architecture to allow systems to talk, best practices, real-world use cases, and combing AIS with Power Automate to facilitate business process automation."
