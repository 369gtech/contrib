title: 'YOW! 2016 Ines Sombra - Architectural Patterns of Resilient Distributed Systems'
recordingDate: 1483400588
description: "Modern systems can fail in spectacular ways. Failure isn’t a question of if, but when. Resilient systems can endure and gracefully recover from failures, but ensuring your system has these properties requires thought and some deliberate architectural decisions. Join me in this talk as I attempt to find answers in academic research and industry to build a more robust system. I will also share the lessons learned while applying these patterns at Fastly and key takeaways that you can carry to your own systems.\n\nInes Sombra is a Distributed Systems Engineer at Fastly, where she spends her time helping the Web go faster. Ines holds an M.S. in Computology with an emphasis on Cheesy 80’s Rock Ballads. She has a fondness for steak, fernet, and a pug named Gordo. In a previous life, she was a Data Engineer.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
