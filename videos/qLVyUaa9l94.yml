description: "Azure DevOps is the ultimate set of DevOps services for any language and any platform. Let's take a tour of each of those services to see how they can help you deliver value to your end users, whether you're a team of one, or an enterprise of thousands.\r\n\r\nWe'll take a look at the source control features of Azure Repos, and how to plan your work with Azure Boards. I'll show you the endless capabilities for continuous integration and continuous delivery with Azure Pipelines, and we'll look at Azure Artifacts for storing your build results, and Azure Test Plans for managing your QA efforts. Along the way, I'll highlight the many integration points that make it easy to work with your existing tools."
