description: "Bursting at the Seams\r by David McDonald\n\nOur industry remains in its infancy but we've had many important contributions to how we all think and talk about design. In order to tighten the existing gap between where theory and practice meet, we need to continue to add to our shared vocabulary. With this aim, I want to underline one of the more accessible and oft-overlooked concepts from software's past: seams. Seams are easy to identify, and point to crucial incisions in our code. Learning to see code in terms of seams will improve your existing codebases, help you write better tests, and aid as you develop greenfield projects.\n\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
