title: 'Kevlin Henney - Refactoring Is Not Just Clickbait'
recordingDate: 1624607771
description: "For many people, refactoring is a simple code transformation they click on in a context menu or via a keyboard shortcut. They can extract, inline, replace, move, rename, etc. at will. The widespread availability of automated refactoring should have made oversized classes and long-winded functions a thing of the past. But it hasn't.\n\nHaving a tool is only part of the solution: knowing what to do with it and how to use it well is what makes the bigger difference. In this talk, we'll revisit what refactoring is (and isn't), examine what practical and social obstacles refactoring faces, explore the idea that refactoring should be considered a design process and not just a clean-up click, and that most interesting refactorings are not necessarily automated.\n\n## About Kevlin\n\nI'm an independent consultant, speaker, writer and trainer. My software development interests are in programming, people and practice.\n\nI've been a columnist for various magazines and websites. I'm co-author of A Pattern Language for Distributed Computing and On Patterns and Pattern Languages, two volumes in the Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture series, and editor of 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know and co-editor of 97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know.\n\nI also write short fiction, with a particular emphasis on flash fiction, and perform at spoken word events.
