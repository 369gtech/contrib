description: "After a quick intro to the problem of bad quality code itself, we walk  through 6 specific examples of broken applications from a performance, scalability and architectural perspective. Each example highlights the impact of quality, the root cause and the technical metric to look at before checking in code to avoid these problems.\n\nMore resources for Java developers: http://bit.ly/1KWDCjb\n\nThis talk was delivered by Andreas Grabner for SF Java: http://www.meetup.com/sfjava/"
