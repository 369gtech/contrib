He has shot just about everything there is to shoot, war, journalism, fashion, racing of cars and Motorcycles...but what he loves most is wildlife photography. Especially if it's in the water. And he has become world-famous at it. So much so, in fact, that he has been asked to lead National Geographic expedition teams with Dr. Eugenie Clark, Dr. Sylvia Earle, and astronaut Buzz Aldrin. He has co-produced documentaries with Stan Waterman, and he was the team leader for National Geographic's Red Sea, Great White Shark, and Killer Whale photo expeditions.\n\nHis commitment to wildlife led him to co-found Israel's Marine National Park on the Red Sea. He works tirelessly to bring attention to some of the most fragile regions of the underwater realm, with preservation of the environment foremost in every encounter.\n\nAmos's photos and essays have appeared in hundreds of publications around the globe, including National Geographic, Time, Life, The New York Times, Cond√© Nast Traveler, Le Figaro, Terra Sauvage, Airone, Mondo Somerso, Der Spiegel, Unterwasser, and many more.\n\nHis work has also been included in the books The Living Ocean, The World of Nature, and Oceans. He has been profiled in television appearances on National Geographic Explorer, Today, and Good Morning America, as well as featured in People, Esquire, and Money magazines.\n\nAmos's photography has won Nikon, Communication Arts, Lucie award and twice the BBC Wildlife Photographer of the Year awards. His clients include Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Discovery Channel, Armani, Disney, and Colombia Pictures.\n\nBased in San Francisco, California, Amos operates and leads the cutting-edge adventure-travel program Big Animals Expeditions. His voyages take him and his guests all over the world to observe, photograph, understand and revere the most magnificent creatures on the planet, their pattern of behavior and survival. Therefore he is called \"the Ambassador of the BigAnimals\" \n\nTill today Amos camera is the only one that escaped the Jaws of the Great White, the deadly hug of Anconda, the pursuit of Polar Bear, the hunting skill of Leopard Seal and the sharp bill of the sailfish and Striped Marlins-- only to share these unique images with everyone that want to be thrilled...moved...and informed.\n\nwww.biganimals.com"
