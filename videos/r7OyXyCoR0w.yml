language: English
recordingDate: 1609866619
description: "Talk \nStreamlit is a fantastic new tool that lets you create powerful and highly-interactive web apps for your machine learning projects with deceptively simple Python scripts. The best thing about Streamlit is that it doesn’t require any knowledge of web development. If you know Python, you’re good to go!\n\n\nSpeaker \nSteven is a Computer Science Undergrad in his penultimate year, with skillset in the intersection between Data Science and Software Engineering…So he is, most times, a Machine Learning Engineer.\n\nSteven is big on community development, passionate about helping tech muggles find their feet, and on a path to become a Developer Advocate. He is a regular meetups’ facilitator and has given talks at several high profile events like PyCon Africa and PyData Global. He is currently the Acting AI City Lead for DSN AI+ Abeokuta, deputy Campus Lead of AI+ FUNAAB, a core team member of DSC-FUNAAB, and NaijaHacks Campus Ambassador for FUNAAB.\n\nSteven has been trying to gain new hobbies (outside tech) recently. For instance, watching dance tutorials on YouTube, but he has failed miserably so far.\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
