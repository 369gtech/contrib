description: "I would like to share my experience on managing engineering teams. Forming, storming, norming and performing stages for engineering teams are different from other teams. And we also need to do adjourning more frequently. As I have experience to manage teams in different geographical locations I would also like to share the cultural aspect of managing a team. Will also touch on Agile, Lean management aspects on managing software development teams.\n\nMohammad Nazmuz Salehin\nI am working as a Senior Engineering Manager in PayPal. I have completed Masters in Computer Science and MBA. I have over 15 years of work experience and over 8 years experience to manage engineering teams in multiple locations like Bangladesh, Singapore and USA."
