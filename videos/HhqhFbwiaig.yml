description: "Tensorflow is a popular open source machine learning library released by Google that allows developers to build ML models easily. How are you supposed to build an AI business using Tensorflow? There are so many startups and companies using Tensorflow in production environments with sometimes millions of users relying on the software. In this video, I'm going to explain how all the different tools in the Tensorflow ecosystem (Serving, Lite, Imperative Programming, Visualizations, etc.) work together to allow the developer to use an end to end pipeline for developing and deploying AI software. We'll go over code, theory, and we'll think through two business use cases for applying AI to a problem. Hope you like it!\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Make_Money_with_Tensorflow\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like. And comment. That's what keeps me going. \n\nWant more education?
