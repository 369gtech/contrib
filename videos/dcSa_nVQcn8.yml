description: "Clusters as Cattle - Wrangling Clusters Not Just Nodes - Illya Chekrygin, Upbound \n\nKubernetes has fulfilled its promise at wrangling nodes and providing a self-healing, self-scaling, self-everything experience. Nodes can come and go and be automatically scaled using node scalers. But what if node scaling is not enough, and you need to scale clusters too? What if you want to separate types of workloads across different clusters for performance, isolation, geographic distribution, compliance or management reasons? Behold, the future is here! In this talk we’ll explore how Kubernetes can automatically deploy and manage other clusters dynamically and on as needed basis. We’ll show a demo of an application that is able to dynamically provision clusters across regions and schedule workloads across them. We’ll explore the benefits and challenges of this approach. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrWN"
