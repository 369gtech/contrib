title: 'Purely Functional Data Structures'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433507754
description: "Immutable or &quot;purely functional&quot; data structures, the focus of Chris Okasaki’s 1996 Ph.D. thesis and the subject of ongoing exploration in the FP community, are not just for &quot;purely functional&quot; developers. Immutable data structures can also be of immense benefit in imperative-style object-oriented programs. This presentation derives implementations of some commonly used immutable data structures such as lists, queues, and vectors and discusses the code simplifications and performance benefits they offer in an imperative setting.\n\n\nAuthor:\nDan Rosen\nDan Rosen is an engineer who tries to learn things and, on occasion, succeeds enough to turn around and teach them. He just joined the API team at Twitter and, as usual, has a lot to learn there. Prior to Twitter, Dan worked as an instructor at Marakana, developing and teaching courses on Scala development, REST service design and other Java stuff. Dan is also a recovering C   addict who, prior to making the leap to the JVM, contributed to products ranging from web browsers to static source code analyzers. Dan and his dog Tesla are proud residents of Oakland, California.\n\nView more trainings by Dan Rosen at https://www.parleys.com/author/dan-rosen\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
