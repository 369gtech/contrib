title: 'CSSconf EU 2018 | Lara Schenck: The Algorithms of CSS'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531123729
description: "“CSS isn’t a ‘real’ programming language,” we CSS developers are often reminded — we don’t write programs, we describe presentation. Algorithms and CSS, then, don’t exactly go hand-in-hand … or do they?\n\nFrom the cascade to Grid Layout to our own design systems, we may not write algorithms in the same fashion as other programming languages, but we sure do use them!\n\nThis talk documents a self-taught developer’s mission to bridge the gap between CSS and Computer Science by way of algorithms. True, CSS is not a programming language like the others, but an understanding of the fundamentals can benefit our code just the same.\n\nCSSconf EU will be back on May 31st 2019: \nhttps://2019.cssconf.eu/"
