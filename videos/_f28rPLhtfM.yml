description: "Mark leads the national consortium for XML business reporting standards and started XBRL US Labs, a research and innovation center focused on XBRL  (eXtensible Business Reporting Language), an open-source, royalty-free language being adopted globally to provide transparency and global access to the documents and data that drive markets, regulation, and business information sharing.\n\nHired in 2006 to oversee the startup of the non-profit XBRL US when the US Securities and Exchange (SEC) adopted XBRL as the standard for tagging regulatory reports by publicly traded companies, mutual funds, and credit rating agencies, Mark has spent twenty-five years as a chief technologist/CIO in Washington for organizations such as the MD-IPA (now United Health), The Board of Trade, and the Council on Foundations. In the first two years of operation, XBRL US assembled a small but effective team and successfully crowd-sourced a 15,000-element XBRL taxonomy for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP); these tags are now required by SEC rules for regulatory compliance, and the data is now flowing on the SEC EDGAR system.\n\nSince then, Bolgiano has been instrumental in taking the XBRL movement beyond accounting standards and capital markets to the policy, legal, and government domains. His Congressional testimony last year on the use of standards for transparency. XBRL US Labs research partnerships with data infrastructure giants DTCC and SWIFT have produced the world's firt ISO-aligned taxonomies, and with the NIEM framework for information sharing for the Federal sector, have advanced the cause of open standards harmonization and promises to bridge the world of documents, which he refers to as the \"first mile\", with free, universally accessible, structured data in the \"last mile\"."
