description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nMigrating Enterprise Microservices From Cloud Foundry to Kubernetes – Tony Erwin & Jonathan Schweikhart, IBM\n\nHistorically, the forty microservices making up the IBM Cloud UI have been deployed as apps on Cloud Foundry (CF), an open source PaaS. But, recently, this enterprise microservice system has been migrated to run on Kubernetes to take advantage of improved orchestration, higher availability, and better performance. Tony Erwin & Jonathan Schweikhart will discuss their journey and provide insights into the advantages of Kube over CF. Even more importantly, they will describe approaches to solving new problems that took the place of old ones, such as: 1) adapting PaaS apps to run as containers on Kube, 2) enabling geo load balancing between the different platforms (to vet Kube before entirely replacing CF), 3) integrating tools like Prometheus into existing monitoring systems, and more! Their team's experiences will help you avoid pitfalls as you look to perform your own migrations to Kube!\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/H2GT"
