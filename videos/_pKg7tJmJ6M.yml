description: "It’s one thing to make design that’s easy on the eyes – but how about designs that are easy on the brain? How we see the world is incredibly complex – very little of the world is in focus at any one time, and our brain is required to do a lot of the heavy lifting to let us see what we see. Have you ever wondered why certain colours work together better than others? how irritating it is when two things aren’t perfectly aligned? or why yours eye goes straight to that flashing icon in the bottom of the screen? To take in the vast amount of information our eyes provide to our brain it’s had to come up with some quick shortcuts that let it make sense of what we’re seeing – In this session we’ll dive into those shortcuts and examine how we can improve our designs by using them to our advantage.\n\nRyan Coleman\nLead Technology Experience Strategist, BMO\nhttps://twitter.com/ryancoleman\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
