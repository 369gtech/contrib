description: "CenturyLink is multinational communications company that has built and acquired applications and services that help them stay on the leading edge of the communications and cloud services market.\n\nHowever, as their portfolio of services has expanded, so has their need to manage inter-product dependencies and deal with “snowflake” platforms, middleware and other technology requirements.\n\nLearn how CenturyLink evolved their ad-hoc and disparate CI and CD processes across disparate legacy applications by adopting DevOps principles, embracing data-driven automation, versioning and shared repositories to allow a consistent and reliable pathway to production."
