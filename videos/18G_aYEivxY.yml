title: 'YOW! Data 2021 - Sid Anand - Building & Operating Autonomous Data Streams'
language: English
recordingDate: 1621927345
description: "The world we live in today is fed by data. From self-driving cars and route planning to fraud prevention to content and network recommendations to ranking and bidding, the world we live in today not only consumes low-latency data streams, it adapts to changing conditions modeled by that data. \n\nWhile the world of software engineering has settled on best practices for developing and managing both stateless service architectures and database systems, the larger world of data infrastructure still presents a greenfield opportunity. To thrive, this field borrows from several disciplines : distributed systems, database systems, operating systems, control systems, and software engineering to name a few. \n \nOf particular interest to me is the sub field of data streams, specifically regarding how to build high-fidelity nearline data streams as a service within a lean team. To build such systems, human operations is a non-starter. All aspects of operating streaming data pipelines must be automated. Come to this talk to learn how to build such a system soup-to-nuts.\n\nSid Anand currently serves as the Chief Architect for Datazoom. Prior to joining Datazoom, Sid served as PayPal's Chief Data Engineer, focusing on ways to realize the value of data. Prior to joining PayPal, he held several positions including Agari's Data Architect, a Technical Lead in Search @ LinkedIn, Netflix’s Cloud Data Architect, Etsy’s VP of Engineering, and several technical roles at eBay. Sid earned his BS and MS degrees in CS from Cornell University, where he focused on Distributed Systems. Outside of work, Sid is a maintainer/committer on Apache Airflow and advises a series of conferences (QCon, Data Council, and various conferences under Skills Matter). \n\nFor more information on YOW!
