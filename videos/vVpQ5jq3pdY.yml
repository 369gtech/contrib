In this talk, we present a practical architecture for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) apps, its benefits, consequences and the main pitfalls to avoid. We will use the open source DataPeps SDK to automate the implementation of cryptography and apply DataPeps to secure a sample note-taking app with the implementation of E2EE. In doing so, we will not change the user experience the slightest. The Note app we chose has a backend implemented in Go and a frontend implemented in JavaScript, but similar code can be used with other programming languages. Fifty minutes is all we need to detail how to create a secure session in which data is automatically encrypted and decrypted on the client-side, and use that session to protect individual notes and share notes between different users.\n \nHenri Binsztok \nFrom Wallix\nHenri Binsztok is the Chief Innovation Officer at WALLIX (Bloomberg: ALLIX:FP), which he joined after the acquisition of MLstate in 2016, a company he founded and led for 8 years.

He created multiple software projects, including awless, a CLI for AWS that is a Winner of InfoWorld Best of Open Source Award 2017 and Top Developer Tool at StackShare; DataPeps, an easy-to-use End-to-End Encryption platform and the Opa language which pioneered several aspects of modern web application programming. Henri holds a PhD in Computer Science from Sorbonne in Paris, France. He received the French Ministry of Research Innovation Award in 2008."
