description: "You may have heard that Machine Learning is eating the world. Advancements in processing power and data availability have made AI progressing at an unprecedented pace. It beats humans in games in which humans were once unbeatable. It recognises cats from dogs. It helps win elections. You're probably getting an impression that with all of those complex equations it's too hard for a developer like you.\n\nIn this talk, I'll try to combat this impression. We'll look into the current state of Machine Learning, build and train basic prediction model and understand how it works. We'll also look at some cloud solutions that can be used withouth writing a line of code. Join me to see that you don't need to be a mathematician to use ML. I'll show you that you can incorporate it into your current projects right away without massive effort.\n\nDevConf 2017 (http://devconf.pl)\n13-15 September 2017"
