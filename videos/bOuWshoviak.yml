description: "Enabling .NET Applications with Performance Monitoring and Management on Cloud Foundry - Dave Tillman, Pivotal\n\n Applications with complex distributed architectures typically have dozens of dependencies which at times fail or become unresponsive. Detecting these problems in a timely fashion and then troubleshooting them in a distributed environment can pose a significant challenge.\nThis developer level talk we will explore how you can use the Steeltoe Management frameworks to enable your .NET application with performance monitoring, management diagnostic endpoints, and distributed tracing all of which seamlessly integrate with Cloud Foundry. We will use a polyglot based micro-services sample application (i.e. Java and .NET) together with Pivotal Apps Manager and Pivotal Cloud Foundry Metrics to illustrate how all these tools integrate and can be used in detecting and diagnosing a failing application.\n\nAbout Dave Tillman\nDave Tillman is the lead engineer on the Steeltoe open source project. He has many years of experience as both a Java and a .NET developer and currently works for Pivotal."
