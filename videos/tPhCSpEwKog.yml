description: "The use of open source software is ubiquitous worldwide because of the economic and time-to-market benefits it delivers. Simply put, open source is the way application are developed today.\n\nSecuring and managing the open source in applications is more critical than ever because applications are the #1 attack target and open source often comprises 50% or more of the code in an application.\n\nIncreasingly organizations are recognizing that open source vulnerabilities represent their greatest application security risk and are seeking innovative solutions to reduce that risk profile."
