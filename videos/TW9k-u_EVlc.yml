description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Divya jain, Gametime.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=176235\n\nCamera development has been quite a painful task. But now comes the new Jetpack library : CameraX. With a use case based lifecycle aware approach, it provides a consistent & easy to use API. In the talk, I will talk about:\r\nOverview & architecture\r\nLibrary structure with 3 main abstracted handles \r\nBinding the use cases to the Lifecycle\r\nPrimary benefits \r\nSample app code to demonstrate how to get started\r\nThe goal is to help everyone understand how this library aims to strike a balance between abstracting away the difficult bits of managing the camera while allowing flexibility and customization. The “Click of a camera” has just become easier!"
