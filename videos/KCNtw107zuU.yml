title: 'CON7718   JPA in Reverse   Pushing Database Events to Java EE Applications in Real Time'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450303989
description: "Cache invalidation in response to database transactions is an age-old problem hampering the use of caching in Java EE applications, whether within object-relational mapping tools or, more recently, within in-memory data grids. This session evaluates known approaches to refreshing shared caches in Java EE applications as underlying database transactions occur, highlighting a new technique using database replication technology. The presentation also explores the nuances of JPA in reverse, when events updating application object models are driven by database transactions, instead of Java EE applications controlling the reading or writing of objects mapped to a database. You’ll learn techniques for keeping caches up to date with a volatile shared database.\n\nSpeakers:\nJean-Philippe Laroche, Coherence integration architect, Kafeine Consulting Inc.\nJean-Philippe has been working in the field of Java development since 1998 and as a freelance IT consultant since 2001.
