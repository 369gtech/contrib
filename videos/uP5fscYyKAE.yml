What were the takeaways from the solution?\n- React Native is being widely used by companies that already have a native mobile application to share certain pieces of the UI across platforms or to eventually migrate to it, by replacing screen after screen on a production application. What kind of challenges do you see in that area these days and what would you advise someone who is looking into migrating a native application?\n- What is your typical workflow when working on a new app? Do you rather build something your own using low-level primitives or you pull in community libraries, such as react-native-paper?\n\nThis video is a part of The React Native Show Podcast Ep 2: \"React Native EU 2020 Conference Q&A Panel\" \nWatch the full episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHSe66Dhs7M"
