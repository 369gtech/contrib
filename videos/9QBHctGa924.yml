recordingDate: 1596870250
description: "by Ondřej Surý\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.1309/dns_bind9_codequality.webm\n\nBIND 9 consists of a huge and old codebase. In this talk, I would like you to show all the available tools that we use on regular basis to improve, refactor and make the BIND 9 code safer. I'll show the examples of various Google/LLVM Sanitizers, cppcheck, LLVM scan-build and semantic patching using coccinelle.\n\nRoom: H.1309 (Van Rijn)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 11:35:00"
