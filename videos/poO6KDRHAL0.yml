description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nArchitectural Caching Patterns for Kubernetes - Rafał Leszko, Hazelcast \n\nKubernetes brings new ideas of how to organize the caching layer for your applications. You can still use the old-but-good client-server topology, but now there is much more than that. This session will start with the known distributed caching topologies: embedded, client-server, and cloud. Then, I'll present Kubernetes-only caching strategies, including: - Sidecar Caching - Reverse Proxy Caching with Nginx - Reverse Proxy Sidecar Caching with Hazelcast - Envoy-level caching with Service Mesh  In this session you'll see: - A walk-through of all caching topologies you can use in Kubernetes - Pros and Cons of each solution - The future of caching in container-based environments\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZerY"
