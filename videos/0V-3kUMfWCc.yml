title: 'Spring Framework 5.0 on JDK 8 & 9  by Juergen Hoeller'
recordingDate: 1522158605
description: 'Spring Framework 5.0 is the first generation of the core framework explicitly targeting JDK 8 as well as JDK 9, fully embracing Java 8 at all levels and allowing a smooth early-adopter upgrade to Java 9. This talk illustrates the benefits of a JDK 8 baseline and the general compatibility challenges for frameworks on JDK 9, with lessons learned from Spring Framework 5.0â€™s development. It provides concrete advice for upgrading Spring applications to JDK 9, on the classpath as well as on the module path (Jigsaw), highlighting the benefits and the tradeoffs involved.'
