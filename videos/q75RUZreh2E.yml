title: 'Sustainable Angular Architectures with Monorepos and Strategic Domain Driven Design | Manfred Steyer'

description: "https://ng-poland.pl\nSustainable Angular Architectures with Monorepos and Strategic Domain Driven Design\nMonorepos allow to subdivide huge enterprise applications into tiny and maintainable libraries. However, this is only one side of the coin: Prior to this, we need to find criteria for slicing our application into those tiny parts. Also, we must establish rules for the communication between them.\nTo provide a solution, this session looks into Strategic Domain Driven Design. Using an Angular based case study, we investigate the idea of the ubiquitous language, the bounded context, and context mapping. After this, you learn how to implement those ideas for Angular using a mono repo. Along the way, we also discuss approaches for reducing coupling between the specific parts of our mono repo.\nAt the end you have both, a technical solution as well as an appropriate methodology to build sustainable Angular solutions.\n\nManfred Steyer - SOFTWAREarchitekt.at, Google Developer Expert and Microsoft MVP | Austria\nTrainer and Consultant with focus on Angular.
