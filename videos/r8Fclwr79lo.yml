description: 'Many people believe that DevOps is a fresh name for the operations team in your organization or the toolbox you use in order to manage your systems. We believe that DevOps is more than that- it''s all about the culture. In this talk, I''ll present the problems of the traditional, most common development pipeline and how we solved them at Wix from my perspective as a developer. I will also give you some proven techniques and tools from our experience, in order to improve the agility and quality of your organization.'
