description: "Check out this concert featuring musician 88bit from GDC Summer! 88bit is the alter ego of Cleveland-based pianist Rob Kovacs, where he performs note-for-note piano arrangements of classic video game soundtracks from the original Nintendo Entertainment System. Kovacsâ€™ performances are unique in that they recreate early electronic music that was never intended to be performed by humans, stretching the limits of traditional piano playing.\n\nThis performance is presented by Video Games In Concert (https://gamemusic.rocks/). VGIC brings live performances of video game music in a diverse range of genres to events all over the world.\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
