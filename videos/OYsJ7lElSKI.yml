title: 'RubyConfBY 2018: Mikhail Bortnyk "Ruby JIT Compilation"'
recordingDate: 1525773206
description: "Reviewing just-in-time compilation as a possible future way to speed up Ruby 3.0, comparisons of implementations and different benchmarking ways.\n\nI will tell a little about JIT theory and a lot about existing implementations (starting from JRuby+Truffle, ending up with MJIT and LLRB).\n\nWarning: a lot of graphs, benchmarks, LLVM, JVM and Ruby source code."
