description: "Building and Deploying a Privacy Preserving Data Analysis Platform\n\nFrederick Jansen, Boston University\n\nThis talk focuses on our experience building and deploying various iterations of a web-based secure multi-party computation (MPC) platform. Our experience demonstrates that secure computations can add value to questions of social good when otherwise constrained by legal, ethical, or privacy restrictions, and that it is feasible to deploy MPC solutions today. \n\nView the full PEPR '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr20/conference-program"
