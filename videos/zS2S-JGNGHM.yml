language: English
recordingDate: 1617887046
description: "Operating a satellite is not a simple task, even more so operating 100+ of them. Using agile aerospace principles, a lot of smart automation and exploiting data analysis using tools like Python it is certainly possible and scalable. This talk will walk you through how at Planet we operate the largest constellation of Earth imaging satellites.\n\nKattia Flores Pozo is the lead of the Space Operations team for Planet in Berlin. With a background in Telecommunications engineering, but a passion for Space, she has been working in Space Operations for the last 7 years. From doing operations for a constellation of 5 satellites, to scaling operations for a fast growing fleet, with more than 300 satellites launched to date.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
