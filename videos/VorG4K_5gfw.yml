description: "How do we find success and fulfillment as software developers? We learn to code, we learn to use code as a tool to solve difficult problems, we get better at both coding and problem-solving, and then... what's next?\nBeyond technical growth, how do you find fulfillment in your work? If you've ever struggled to picture what your career could look like in 5 years, this talk is for you. Discover how learning continuously, teaching others, caring for yourself, and asking the right questions can get you where you want to go (even if you aren't sure where that is yet). This talk will explore what comes after code: digging into new challenges, expanding perspective, and turning fears into pathways for growth."
