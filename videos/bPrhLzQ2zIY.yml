title: 'Connecting the Eclipse IDE to the Cloud-Based Era of Developer Tooling'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433261549
description: "Desktop IDEs are great, but theyâ€™re also often old-fashioned and heavyweight applications. In contrast, new projects are working toward cloud-based developer tooling. Although those new approaches look promising, they are usually completely disconnected from the existing desktop-class IDEs and are still light-years away from working well for Java developers. This session describes a new open source project that aims to bridge this gap. It is built around a new cloud-based architecture for developer tooling that integrates with desktop IDEs (such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans) but enables developers to move toward lightweight cloud-based tooling at the same time. Live demos in the session include impressive Java language tooling running in the browser.\n\n\nAuthors:\n John Arthorne\nJohn has worked on the Eclipse and Equinox projects for the past decade in many different areas.
