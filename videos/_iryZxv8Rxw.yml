title: 'C# Logging with Serilog and Seq - Structured Logging Made Easy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573473595
description: "Structured event logging is so much more than just writing a message to a file. Since .NET Core natively supports structured event logging, I wanted to introduce a logger that takes advantage of these additional features. Serilog is an easy to configure and easy to use logging system that you can plug into a .NET Core project within minutes. Today we are going to configure Serilog, see how to use it in a basic logging scenario, then take advantage of the structured logging by hooking up a visual event sink called Seq.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List: https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\nIntro to Logging: https://youtu.be/oXNslgIXIbQ\nGetting Started with Docker: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/getting-started-with-docker/\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=LoggingWithSerilog"
