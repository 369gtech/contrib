title: 'Migrate and Modernize with Kubernetes and Windows Containers - Vishwas Lele'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603267925
description: "We will begin this session by discussing the \"traditional\" approaches for migrating workloads to the cloud: (1) Rehost (lift-n-shift), (2) Refactor (PaaS approach), and (3) Reimagine (cloud-native rewrite). Each of these traditional approaches has pros and cons.\n\nWe will then move to how the recently announced Windows support in Kubernetes provides an opportunity to rethink traditional approaches to cloud migration fundamentally. Leveraging Kubernetes with Windows container offers a compelling option for migrating Windows apps to Azure\n\nIn this demo-heavy session, we will provide many examples of this approach in practice with discussion along the way. If your customer/organization is looking to migrate your existing Windows workloads to the cloud, while minimizing code changes and taking advantage of innovative cloud-native technologies, this is a session you want to attend.\n\nCheck out more of our talks\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcoslo.com/"
