description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012\nSpeaker:  Andy Clement, Martin Lippert, Andrew Eisenberg\nThis session will present a case study focusing on the development of a robust, horizontally scalable, enterprise CRM system at Dealer.com built primarily upon a Spring technology stack. Using a foundation of Groovy, Grails, and Spring Integration, our application has also incorporated elements of Spring AMQP, Spring Data, and a highly customized extension of Spring MVC's validation layer. In addition to these Spring staples, we've incorporated the cutting edge of other web application technology, such as MongoDB, ElasticSearch, and RabbitMQ. Furthermore, our CRM has been developed as part of a company-wide software platform powered by Grails and Spring Security.\n\nThis session will present a case study focusing on the development of a robust, horizontally scalable, enterprise CRM system at Dealer.com built primarily upon a Spring technology stack.
