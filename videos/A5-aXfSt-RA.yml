description: 'Because of Chromium''s multi-process architecture, painting within Chromium is far from typical.  In this talk, Brett Wilson starts from the Skia and the WebKit render tree, follows the bits across the process boundaries, and continues all the way to your screen. He also details many of the differences in painting between platforms, how things work in test shell, and interesting corner cases like resizing.'
