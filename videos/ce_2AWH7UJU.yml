title: 'Safety: off --- How not to shoot yourself in the foot with C++ atomics - Anthony Williams'
recordingDate: 1470313831
description: "If you're writing multithreaded code, it is tempting to use atomics to optimize the inter-thread synchronization and access to shared state.\nHowever, this is not always easy, and can all too often lead to code that appears to work but is subtly broken. I will show tools and techniques for using atomics safely in C++, as well as discussing scalability and lock-freedom."
