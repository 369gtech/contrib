description: "In this video, we'll use a Game of Thrones dataset to create word vectors. Then we'll map these word vectors out on a graph and use them to tell us related words that we input. We'll learn how to process a dataset from scratch, go over the word vectorization process, and visualization techniques all in one session.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/word_vectors_game_of_thrones-LIVE\n\nJoin us in our Slack channel:\nhttp://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nMore learning resources:\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec/\nhttps://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/details/part-1-for-beginners-bag-of-words\nhttp://sebastianruder.com/word-embeddings-1/\nhttp://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-1-vectors/\n\nPlease subscribe.
