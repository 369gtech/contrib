language: English
recordingDate: 1575291600
description: "Have you ever found yourself starting a file out the same way every time in Visual Studio? Maybe you always add an empty constructor or you set it to public. Maybe you start a WPF item out by adding in rows and columns. Instead of repeating yourself, you can create a custom item template that works just the way you want. Doing so can save you a lot of time and make sure you get things started right. In this video, we are going to create a few custom item templates and see how to use them.\n\nSource Code: https://leadmagnets.app/?Resource=CustomItemTemplates\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/"
