description: "Beyond Access: Using Abac Frameworks to Implement Privacy and Security Policies\n\nAmanda Walker, Nuna, Inc.\n\nOver the last several decades, access control systems have evolved steadily from a single bits (“write protect”) through identity and role based approaches to complex, abstract frameworks such as Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC). However, in use they are most often used to answer traditional question of read and write access. In this talk, I will explore how frameworks like ABAC can be used to implement more abstract controls and policies such as purpose constraints and other data handling policies that need to depend on attributes of the data, the code, and surrounding context.\n\nView the full PEPR '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr20/conference-program"
