description: "by Adam Wulkiewicz\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.126/boostgeometry_rtree_speeding_up_geographical_computation.webm\n\nWhat is a spatial index? How does R-tree work? How to create one in C++ and how to use it with geographical data in order to solve a problem on the surface of ellipsoid?\n\n\nWe give answers to these questions and show solutions using utilities provided by Boost.Geometry library, the library that is currently being used to provide GIS support to MySQL. We discuss properties of the R-tree and show differences between variants of this spatial index. This is a practical talk presenting a set of example problems and various solutions to these problems. The complexity and performance of the algorithms is discussed to allow the listener to choose the best solution for a specific purpose.\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 10:40:00"
