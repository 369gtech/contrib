description: "** Machine Learning Training with Python: https://www.edureka.co/python **\nThis Linear Regression Algorithm video is designed in a way that you learn about the algorithm in depth. This video is designed in a way that in the first part you will learn about the algorithm from scratch with its mathematical implementation, then you will drill down to the coding part and implement linear regression using python. Below are the topics covered in this tutorial: \n\n1. What is Regression?\n2. Regression Use-case\n3. Types of Regression – Linear vs Logistic Regression\n4. What is Linear Regression?\n5. Finding best-fit regression line using Least Square Method\n6. Checking goodness of fit using R squared Method\n7. Implementation of  Linear Regression Algorithm using Python (from scratch)\n8. Implementation of  Linear Regression Algorithm using Python (scikit lib)\n\nCheck out our playlist for more videos: http://bit.ly/2taym8X\n\nSubscribe to our channel to get video updates.

This is a 5 Week Instructor led Online Course,40 hours of assignment and 20 hours of project work\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n3. At the end of the training you will be working on a real time project for which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAbout the Course\n\n\nEdureka’s Machine Learning Course using Python is designed to make you grab the concepts of Machine Learning. The Machine Learning training will provide deep understanding of Machine Learning and its mechanism. As a Data Scientist, you will be learning the importance of Machine Learning and its implementation in python programming language. Furthermore, you will be taught Reinforcement Learning which in turn is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence. You will be able to automate real life scenarios using Machine Learning Algorithms. Towards the end of the course, we will be discussing various practical use cases of Machine Learning in python programming language to enhance your learning experience.\n\nAfter completing this Machine Learning Certification Training using Python, you should be able to:\nGain insight into the 'Roles' played by a Machine Learning Engineer\nAutomate data analysis using python\nDescribe Machine Learning\nWork with real-time data\nLearn tools and techniques for predictive modeling\nDiscuss Machine Learning algorithms and their implementation\nValidate Machine Learning algorithms\nExplain Time Series and it’s related concepts\nGain expertise to handle business in future, living the present\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nWhy learn Machine Learning with Python?\n\nData Science is a set of techniques that enable the computers to learn the desired behavior from data without explicitly being programmed. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science. This course exposes you to different classes of machine learning algorithms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms. This course imparts you the necessary skills like data pre-processing, dimensional reduction, model evaluation and also exposes you to different machine learning algorithms like regression, clustering, decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes and Q-Learning.\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: +18336900808 (Toll Free) or India: +918861301699\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka"
