description: "\"Fueled by the emergence of cloud, digital technologies, and agile methodologies, the pace of technology innovation is accelerating dramatically. More adaptive, service-based architectures have emerged, employing companies to deliver more innovative, customer-focused solutions and operate more sustainably and securely as well. Many organizations begin the journey, but fail to show real progress. The roadblock? A lack of balance between business and technology values/drivers.\n \nThis session will cover Accentureâ€™s application assessment and modernization approach and real-world examples of creating a balance between the business and IT to deliver real value at speed.\"\n\nRyan Johnson, Associate Director at Accenture\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/making-the-business-a-firstclass-citizen-during-the-application-modernization-journey"
