description: 'This talk is a story about complete redesign of one data structure from Dropwizard Metrics library to achieve some way of measuring histogram without outliers, approximations and with acceptable performance. We will talk about hard and controversial decisions programmer should make to design fast, concise but in the same time very simple data structures. You will learn about: memory consumption optimizations, minimizing allocations, decresing GC preasure, achieving thread safety.'
