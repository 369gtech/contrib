title: 'YOW! Perth 2019 - Martin Thompson - Interaction Protocols: It''s All About Good Manners'
recordingDate: 1571115601
description: "Distributed and concurrent systems can be considered a social group which collaborate to achieve collective goals. In order to collaborate a system of rules must be applied that affords good hygiene, fault tolerance, and effective communication to coordinate, share knowledge, and provide feedback in a trusted manner. These rules form a number of protocols which enable the group to act as a system that is greater than the sum of the individual components.\n\nIn this talk we will explore the history of protocols and their application when building distributed systems. Protocols provide the foundation on which the quality attributes are delivered. Qualities such as performance, resilience, and security.\n\nMartin is a Java Champion with over 2 decades of experience building complex and high-performance computing systems. He is most recently known for his work on Aeron and SBE. Previously at LMAX he was the co-founder and CTO when he created the Disruptor. Prior to LMAX Martin worked for Betfair, content companies with the world largest catalogues, and some of the most significant C++ and Java systems of the 1990s.\n\nHe blogs at mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com, and can be found giving training courses on performance, concurrency, and distributed systems when he is not cutting code to make systems better.\n\nFor more on YOW!
