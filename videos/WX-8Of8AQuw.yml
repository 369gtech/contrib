description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nBuilding a Software-Defined-Network Using K8s API Machinery and Controllers - Matteo Olivi, Independent \n\nKubernetes controller pattern and API machinery are being used to build systems other than Kubernetes itself. As a result, they are put to the test with new, original challenges, and strengths and weaknesses emerge. This talk describes the lessons learned building an SDN with Kubernetes controller pattern and API machinery, as well as some interesting and general problems that arose: locking and allocation of IPs without multi-object transactions, enforcement of invariants between API objects of the same kind, managing a dynamic set of informers on API objects of the same kind to eagerly and efficiently disseminate guest -  host mappings. The audience will also learn how to apply the controller pattern to their own problems and how doing so automatically handles for them the (hard) details of building a reliable control plane, freeing them to focus on the specifics of their problems.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZenR"
