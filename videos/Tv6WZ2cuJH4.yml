description: "In this session we will talk about how to design a good API. In this era of modern development, APIs are a very important element in our development, both for consuming and for creating and publishing them. Either we are APIs consumers or we are APIs producers we need to engage them and use them, that is why a good design is critical for the success in their usage and in their development. We also need to differentiate what an API is, and understand what is their relationship with Services, Microservices, Web Services, etc. In that differentiation is where we need to be very clear and therefore have design principles to build a good, stable, scalable, versionable, secure API. We will share with u design principles for APIs development.\n\nRolando Carrasco\nFusion Middleware Director\nSERVICES & PROCESSES SOLUTIONS SA DE CV\nRolando is a former Oracle employee who founded a company by the name S&P Solutions that is focused on Integration, API Management, Services Oriented Solutions (Microservices and SOA), Chatbots, Continous Integration and modern development.
