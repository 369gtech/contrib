Is it just another form of ivory tower architecture that quickly becomes out-of-date and nobody cares about? Or is technology strategy a vision that helps teams in large organisations to stay aligned, making decisions in the best interest of the organisation as a whole instead of becoming locally-optimising silos? And is there any point in strategy now we’re all agile and everything is constantly changing?\n\nProponents argue that, when implemented correctly, a technology strategy improves team autonomy and agility even in constantly-changing, digital environments. They argue that technology strategy clarifies key business capabilities. They argue that technology strategy identifies platform deficiencies that need to be addressed in order for teams to build and manage services at greater speed and with reduced costs. They also argue there are lots of other benefits to technology strategy, but should we believe them?\n\nIn this talk we’re going to explore technology strategy. We’re going to look at some real examples of tech strategy and understand exactly what it is. After this talk, you’ll know whether technology strategy is something you should be paying more attention to, or whether it’s something you can happily ignore and focus on shipping stuff instead.\n\nBiography \n\nScott Millett is the Director of IT for Iglu.com, and has been working with .NET since version 1.0.
