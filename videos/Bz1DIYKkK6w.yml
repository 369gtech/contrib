description: "Advancing the Future of CI/CD Together How the Continuous Delivery Foundation is working to advance CI/CD\nby Tracy Miranda\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UB4.136/continuous_delivery_foundry.webm\n\nThe Continuous Delivery Foundation was launched in 2019 as the new home to FOSS projects Jenkins, Jenkins, Spinnaker and Tekton.\nThe foundation is also a community to advance adoption of CI/CD best practices and tools. This talk outlines the initiatives and ways to get involved so we can all work together to accelerate CI/CD adoption.\n\n\nPlease note that this talk replaces one entitled \"Infrastructure CICD with KubeVirt and Tekton\" that was due to have been given by Tyler Auerbeck, who unfortunately wasn't able to travel to FOSDEM.\nThe Continuous Delivery Foundation hosts key CI/CD projects. This talk gives a brief overview of those projects and how we are working toward interoperability between them.\nWe also look at the goals of the CDF and key initiatives such as CI/CD landscape, security, diversity and MLOPs. This talk will share how you can get involved so we can all work together in open source to drive forward the direction of CI/CD and make software delivery better for everyone.\n\nRoom: UB4.136\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 11:00:00"
