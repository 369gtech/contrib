description: 'eCustoms SOA based project for Tajikistan which took 2 years. Project has been finished successfully (not on time but with larger scope). Client was very pleased with a results and is willing to continue cooperation in other projects. This was our first attempt to use full Scrum methodology in such project. Project was done by 8 distributed teams: 2 teams in Lithuania, 2 teams in Belarus, 2 teams in Kazakhstan, 1 Team in Azerbaijan and 1 team in Tajikistan. Team faced and had to make tough choices: from political flavor to unwillingness cooperate among other teams or use Agile practices. Team which worked according to Scrum stayed focused and in healthy condition despite all obstacles it faced.'
