description: "In the aftermath of the massive earthquake that hit Mexico in 2017, a group of developers and DBAs banded together to rapidly develop an open-source project that would improve the coordination of rescue and recovery efforts. In this interview recorded at ODTUG Kscope 2018, Oracle ACE and Pythian database consultant Rene Antunez, one of the volunteers in that effort, talks about the challenges of developing that solution. \n\nThe project is ongoing, and available on Github: \nhttps://github.com/CodeandoMexico/terremoto-cdmx\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
