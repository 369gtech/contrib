description: "by Bob Dahlberg\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UA2.118/kotlin_communication_break_down_coroutines.webm\n\nCoroutines are great, I think we all agree on that. But as the async, and possibly parallel, programming becomes easier the risk of sharing mutable variables between coroutines arises.\n\n\nWhen the boundaries are abstracted away we should rely on safe ways to communicate between our coroutines.\n\n\nIn this session, I will go through safe and unsafe ways of communication between different coroutines, and why it's not safe to think of them purely as threads.\n\nRoom: UA2.118 (Henriot)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 11:00:00"
