description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nWhat's the use of sophisticated machine learning models if you can't interpret them? This workshop covers two recent model interpretability techniques that are essentials in your data scientist toolbox: LIME and SHAP. You will learn how to apply these techniques in Python on a real-world data science problem.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
