description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nMulti-Cluster Service Deployments with Operators and KubeCarrier - Rastislav Szabó, Kubermatic\n\nComplex application services consisting of multiple interconnected components can benefit from deployment in multiple Kubernetes clusters: Examples include for instance running the application core at a cloud provider and the database with sensitive data in a on-premises cluster or running computational-intensive tasks in a cluster with specialized hardware resources (e.g. GPUs) at the same time. This approach however brings several challenges. How can we interconnect the clusters so that the applications in different clusters can communicate with each other easily? How to allow for multi-tenancy and easily spin up multiple instances of such services in the same clusters? In this talk, you will learn how such a deployment may look like with the help of Kubernetes operators, the KubeCarrier service hub and the Submariner cross-cluster connectivity provider."
