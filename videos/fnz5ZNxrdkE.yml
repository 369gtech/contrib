title: 'Berlin Buzzwords 2012: Christian Gügi - Using HBase Coprocessors to implement prospective search'
recordingDate: 1545060707
description: "With the HBase 0.92 release it is now possible to embed code directly into HBase server processes. Coprocessors offer a very flexible extension model to move functionality closer to the data. This presentation explains the key concepts and shows how coprocessors have been used in our social media monitoring system to accomplish the alert feature implemented with prospective search. It allows users to formulate a query by which they will be instantly notified via email about every newly detected document matching the terms. This session aims to help people interested in coprocessors understand how coprocessors can be adapted to their own use cases and how to develop coprocessor extensions.\n\nMore info: https://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/using-hbase-coprocessors-implement-prospective-search\n\nDescription of Chrstian Guegi: \nhttps://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/content/christian-gügi"
