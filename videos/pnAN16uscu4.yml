Ask anyone who \"gets it\". As someone who has taught Akka Cluster courses many times over, I was always left unsatisfied after explaining the key concepts behind it in front of a white board. What I will explain and demonstrate live using a 5-node Raspberry-Pi based Akka Cluster, is how a powerful visualisation of the state of the nodes in a cluster can transform this complicated topic into one that is easy to grasp for anyone. Not only that: my personal experience has shown that it can actually transform a rather passive observer into someone who starts asking questions that demonstrate the fact that they fully grasp it. The fact that we use a physical cluster to demo and explain Akka Cluster is instrumental for this. I will conclude the talk by giving an overview how the Raspberry-Pi cluster is built along with the tooling that is used to put the demos together.\n\n \nEric Loots \nFrom Lightbend Inc.\nEric's a Scala & Akka champion, a global course instructor for Lightbend. Eric began programming in various machine languages some odd 35 years ago, subsequently passing via C and Java to Scala and Akka. Eric's glad with the coming of age of Reactive Systems and enjoys helping others learn to build them."
