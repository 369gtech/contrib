CSS code splitting is one of our many efforts where we constantly improve the performance of the application. Li Hau will present how his team came to realisation of the issue, some of the decisions they made, and a couple of problems they encountered.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/SingaporeCSS/events/259235986/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/oL77/"
