description: "by Benny Siegert\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.3.401/netbsd_update.webm\n\n\nThere have been a number of exciting developments in NetBSD and pkgsrc in the last year.\nThis talk will give an overview over some cool recent developments, new features and show some exciting hardware to run NetBSD and/or pkgsrc on. NetBSD 8 has been released, and perhaps there will be a -9 release in time for FOSDEM! \n\n64-bit ARM support is improving quickly. There is exciting new hardware (such as the Pinebook) to use NetBSD on, plus ARM cloud instances on Scaleway and EC2. \n\npkgsrc has gotten a lot more packages, of course, but there have been other improvements. \n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:00:00+01"
