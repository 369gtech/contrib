description: "Lambdas were announced as a new language feature for Java in 2010 and will soon be available in Java SE 8. This session introduces the Java SE 8 language changes and takes a detailed look at their use by the planned parallel streams libraries. The new parallel data libraries will offer Java developers efficient and powerful tools for building highly scalable concurrent applications that fully utilize modern multicore systems.\n\n\nAuthors:\nPaul Sandoz\nPaul Sandoz is the co-spec lead and implementation lead for JSR 311: Java API for RESTful Web Services.
