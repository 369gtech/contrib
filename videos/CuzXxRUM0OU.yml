description: 'Payments in the generosity sector and people who makes those payments follow very different rules to traditional transactions for goods and services. When people are unable to give "in the moment" they may not give at all! Even if you don''t work in the Generosity sector, the lessons learned from trying to ensure payments continue to be handled and processed in spite of failing gateways, network outages & misconfiguration (and how you can turn this into a competitive advantage) is applicable to anyone processing payments from end-users.'
