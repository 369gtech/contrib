language: English
recordingDate: 1433261665
description: "This session explores one of the newest APIs for Java EE 7: JSR 352, Batch Applications for the Java Platform. Batch processing is found in nearly every industry for executing noninteractive, bulk-oriented, and long-running operation tasks. In the session, the presenters live-code a real-life example batch application, starting with a simple task, and than evolve it with the advanced APIs until they have a full parallel and checkpointing reader-processor-writer batch. By the end of the session, the attendees should be able to understand the use cases of JSR 352, when to apply it, and how to develop a full Java EE batch application.\n\n\nAuthors:\nIvan Ivanov\nIvan St. Ivanov is development architect at SAP Labs Bulgaria.
