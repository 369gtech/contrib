description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nBUILDING A SOLAR POWERED WEATHER STATION WITH NERVES\nby John Oxford\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nNerves, IoT, Elixir\n\nABSTRACT\nIf you aren't familiar with the Nerves tooling system, or haven't used it yet, then this talk will show you how easy it is to write Elixir code for your tiny Linux powered devices (Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone). We'll briefly hear about the GPIO and I2C protocol and how you write code to program with them using the Elixir Circuits Libraries. Finally we'll see how easy it is to build a solar panel to charge a battery to keep a Nerves powered system running 24/7.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/john-oxford/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JOHN OXFORD\nTagline: Dad-gineer who loves to over complicate solutions --- Achievements: Self-taught programmer and Elixir enthusiast\n\nJohn Oxford is a Software Engineer at PowerSecure who lives in the Metro Atlanta region. In his spare time he works on Elixir, Nerves, and various IoT projects.\n\nMore on John Oxford: https://codesync.global/speaker/john-oxford/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
