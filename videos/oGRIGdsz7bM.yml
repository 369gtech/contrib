description: "CatBoost - the new generation of Gradient Boosting\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - PyCharm [PyData]]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Anna Veronika Dorogush\n\nGradient boosting is a powerful machine-learning technique that achieves state-of-the-art results\nin a variety of practical tasks. For a number of years, it has remained the primary method for\nlearning problems with heterogeneous features, noisy data, and complex dependencies: web search,\nrecommendation systems, weather forecasting, and many others.\nCatBoost (http://catboost.yandex) is a new open-source gradient boosting library, that outperforms existing publicly available implementations of gradient boosting in terms of quality. It has a set of addional advantages.\n\nCatBoost is able to incorporate categorical features in your data (like music genre, URL, search query, etc.) in predictive models with no additional preprocessing. For more details on our approach please refer to our NIPS 2017 ML Systems Workshop paper (http://learningsys.org/nips17/assets/papers/paper_11.pdf).\nCatBoost inference is 20-60 times faster then in other open-source gradient boosting libraries, which makes it possible to use CatBoost for latency-critical tasks.\nCatBoost has the fastest GPU and multi GPU training implementations of all the openly available gradient boosting libraries.\nCatBoost requires no hyperparameter tunning in order to get a model with good quality.\nCatBoost is highly scalable and can be efficiently trained using hundreds of machines\n\n\nThe talk will cover a broad description of gradient boosting and its areas of usage and the differences between CatBoost and other gradient boosting libraries. We will also briefly explain the details of the proprietary algorithm that leads to a boost in quality.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
