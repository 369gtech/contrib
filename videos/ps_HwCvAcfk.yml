description: "At the Climate Corporation, we have a great demand for storing large amounts of raster-based data, and an even greater demand to retrieve small amounts of it quickly. Doc Brown is our distributed, immutable, versioned database for storing big multidimensional data.\n\nIn this talk, we'll take a look at the library design and features, the engineering challenges of managing versions, indexes, caching, while making it fast to ingest and to query data. We will also walk through an example of how to do quick development and validation of data."
