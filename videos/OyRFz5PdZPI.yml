Since then, PHP's capabilites have grown significantly,\_so a new Plugin system has been built from scratch leveraging PHP7. It takes a \"lessons learned\" approach to shortcomings of Drupal 8's plugin system and adopts many of the new language features found in PHP 5.6 and 7 including:\n\nscalar type hints\ntyped returns\nvariadics\nCome\_dig into some serious PHP & plugin-theory\_as we\_discuss the benefits of adopting these new language features and compare Drupal 8's\_plugins with this new system.\n\nStuff you should expect to see:\n\nNumerous working examples of the plugin system in the wild\nA breakdown of how to do configuration\nUsing composer to bring in\_additional plugins\nAn honest evaluation of missing parts when compared to Drupal 8\nThe PHP Plugin tool can be found here:\_https://github.com/eclipsegc/plugins\nThe Plugins Annotation utility can be found here:\_https://github.com/eclipsegc/pluginsannotation"
