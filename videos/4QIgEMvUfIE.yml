description: "What can you do in Scala that you can’t do in Java? Why are streams and lambdas not enough for functional programming? What are the practical uses of more advanced language features?\n\nWe’ll cover specific language features with their uses cases:\n\nFunction composition as an alternative to layered architectures\nFunctional approaches to implement dependency injection\nWriting reusable code with higher kinded types\nAvoiding mutability with expressions\nAbstracting with type classes\nAs well as posing some higher level questions about language features:\n\nWhy do we embrace runtime reflection frameworks but fear compile time implicit parameters?\nEase of initial understanding vs long term productivity of a language\nSimple vs familiar language features and patterns\nThe goal of this talk is for you to learn some specifics about language features not yet in Java as well as to get you excited about programing languages in general"
