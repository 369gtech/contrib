description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSIG Scheduling Deep Dive - Aldo Culquicondor, Google & Mike Dame, Red Hat \n\nKube-Scheduler is the component of Kubernetes that assigns pods to nodes based on the configured scheduling requirements. These requirements can be high availability, resource efficiency and other policies and heuristics. This talk will provide an overview of the new and upcoming features in the scheduler, including the scheduler framework, and the new component config API that enables scheduling profiles. In addition, we'll present updates on other sig-scheduling projects like the Descheduler. We will dedicate about half of the time of the presentation to audience questions and users' feedback.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeuJ"
