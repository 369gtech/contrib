description: "Event driven have never left the main stage, but with the advent of cloud-native, distributed architectures (such as microservices) it has become more popular than ever.\n\nBut it is a broad category that covers a variety of use cases, ranging from enterprise integration to data streaming. So, how to make sense of them all, and especially, what are the best tool for the task?\n\nIn this presentation we will provide an overview of the various types of event-driven architectures, and how the different message-oriented components of the Spring portfolio (Spring Kafka, Spring AMQP, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud Stream) fit into the picture.\n\nOleg Zhurakousky, Software Engineer, Pivotal\nGary Russell, Sr. Principal Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
