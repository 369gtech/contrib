description: "Justin Haugh,  Guido van Rossum\r\n\r\nDuring this talk, we'll discuss how to write highly scalable apps on App Engine. We'll describe how an app is granted more instances as traffic grows, and the importance of low latency, low memory usage, concurrency, async APIs, load testing, and profiling. We'll also help you avoid common pitfalls, like entity contention and hot tablets."
