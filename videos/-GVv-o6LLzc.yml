description: "Project 42 - Making CI/CD a First Class Citizen in Cloud Foundry - Christian Brinker, evoila & Benjamin Gandon, Gstack \n\nCloud Foundry's most significant achievement is the 'cf push'-experience which simplifies the developers life in so many ways. But at day two this experience gets lost because it gets well hidden in some CI/CD pipeline. Writing CI/CD pipelines can be hard and cumbersome.  Wouldn't it be nice to have the same experience of 'cf push' with CI/CD? But is that possible? But every CI/CD pipeline is different.&nbsp;  With buildpacks we solved the same problem for application runtimes to get 'cf push'. So why do not do the same thing with CI/CD and fully integrate it in Cloud Foundry?  In their talk Benjamin Gandon and Christian Brinker present their work on project 42, their Cloud Foundry North America Summit's hackathon winning approach, until now. They show how easily CI/CD can be made a first class citizen in Cloud Foundry and start to open the discussion around the project to the CF community. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
