description: "Andy is a futurist. He’s been a digital native since 1994, when he wrote a documentary called “Secrets of the Internet.” Along with his love of digital, scientists inspire him: Brilliant people who make extraordinary discoveries and work to transform reality. After many years in the games, interactive TV, and mobile industries Andy now leads Fjord in the US. Here he helps some of the world’s biggest brands transform their businesses through design innovation.\n\nThe earliest mark he made was the creation of the first iTV services in the UK with Sky Interactive, where he was head of design. Andy and his team developed the first pay-to-play games suite for TV, which made millions of pounds in their first few weeks after launch. They have gone on to be the single most profitable and best-loved element of Sky’s iTV offering.\n\nOn the back of this success Andy moved to the games industry, where he oversaw the development of pan-European cross-platform games services that broke new ground in quality and technical ambition. Andy was responsible for managing large-scale complex projects with multiple stakeholders from the TV and digital industries, and for delivering services that were profitable and exceeded customer expectation. Since 2004 Andy has specialised in mobile and cross-platform convergent services, working on strategic projects for companies such as Telefonica, Ericsson, Vodafone, Orange, Nokia, and Samsung.\n\nAs one of the pioneers of the service design industry, he is forever looking beyond the interface to create service experiences that shape the world in which people are beginning to live. He joined Fjord in London in early 2008, where he was director of service design. In October 2009 he became MD of Fjord’s new studio in Madrid, which has rapidly become one of the most in-demand suppliers in the Spanish market, and has the reputation as a transformer of the digital banking business, for clients such as BBVA, Barclays, Santander, Banco Sabadell, and Bankinter. Most recently he has moved to New York to oversee the US operation.\n\nAndy is a frequent speaker at global conferences and events, including SxSW, Interaction13, TED Talent Search, TEDx Madrid, and Mobile 2.0. His writing on emerging technology has been published in numerous magazines and books. When Andy isn’t thinking about the future, he still tries to emulate great scientists, but his experimentation isn’t in a lab. It’s in the kitchen, where he is working on the perfect curry recipe.\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreilly\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
