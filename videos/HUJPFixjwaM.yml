description: "\"Find your tribe.\"\n\nShe's a super networker who works in networking. Keiloni took the Leap into a competitive apprenticeship program. Now, she oversees server installations around the world for one of the company's busiest platforms. She always wanted to be a college professor – until she got to college. Instead, Keiloni settled for four degrees.\n\nCompassion is important to her and something she'd like to see more of in discussions about race."
