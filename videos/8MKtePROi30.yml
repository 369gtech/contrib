title: 'End to end application development and DevOps on Azure Kubernetes Service - BRK3039'
recordingDate: 1557272154
description: 'By itself, Kubernetes is not necessarily a developer-friendly platform. Building, deploying, and testing microservice-oriented applications involves a lot of manual work and copious amounts of YAML. Thankfully, Azure has the tools you need and makes Kubernetes approachable and productive for developers. In this session, we’ll cover how to design and build microservice applications that can run on the Azure Kubernetes Service, including how to navigate from an app to a container to a Helm package and how to deploy into Kubernetes in a continuous way using Azure DevOps. We’ll also cover how you can use Azure Dev Spaces to develop an app that includes a couple of microservices to one which includes dozens or hundreds.'
