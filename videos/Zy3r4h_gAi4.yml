But the most important part of building a successful data-driven business often isn't tools or technologies - it's the people who use them.\n\nThis presentation will outline what those analysts and data scientists need to be successful. Consistently, leading data companies focus on helping people rapidly answer questions that constantly evolve, while teams that struggle think more about data over people, technology over business needs, and the current world over where the world might be. - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/channel/JUMjvCF2ucj"
