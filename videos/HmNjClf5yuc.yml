description: "Talk \nThe UBI Center is a think tank researching universal basic income (UBI) policies using open source technologies. We start with open data, simulate UBI policy reforms with open source economic modeling software, and share the results on our open source website with tools like Jupyter-Book. This talk shares how three of our projects contribute to both open science and public policy understanding.\n\nSpeaker \nMax Ghenis is the founder and president of the UBI Center, an open source think tank researching universal basic income policies. Prior to the UBI Center, he was a data scientist at Google. Max has a master’s degree in Data, Economics, and Development Policy from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a bachelor’s degree in operations research from the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
