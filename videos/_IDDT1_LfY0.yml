description: "For a period of time, most of the mainstream frontend frameworks have converged on a class-or-semi-class-based model for declaring components. However, in the past year, we are seeing some new ideas emerging regarding how stateful logic inside components are declared, managed and composed.\n\n\nEvan examines three different approaches: React Hooks, Vue Composition API, and Svelte 3. They share a common departure from the class-based models, but also have fundamental differences due to the trade-offs in their respective designs, which he discusses in this talk.\n\n\nEVENT:\ndotJS 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nEvan You\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\n\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOdfo5SmQc8"
