description: "Earthquakes, Forest Fires, and Your Next Production Incident\n\nAlex Hidalgo, Squarespace\n\nThe Incident Command System is a decades-old tool used for responding to real-world incidents and emergencies, and some form of it has been adopted by many operational teams. However, most don’t know the origins of the system, how it grew to what it is today or why it’s as useful for computer systems as it is for hurricane response. Come learn about the history of the ICS, its successes and failures, and how you can adopt the best aspects of it for your emergencies, today!\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
