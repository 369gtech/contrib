recordingDate: 1555663748
description: "You‚Äôve heard, seen or witnessed the buzz around MotionLayout. But what does it really look like in real life? What are some of its current limitations? How easy is it to use? Are the demos that we‚Äôve seen actually possible? Or is it all a ruse and they‚Äôve been created in Adobe After Effects?\n\nIn this talk, you‚Äôll learn some of the fundamentals of MotionLayout through the development of an animation taken straight from one of those crazy Dribbble shots. A shot that you see and then doubt whether it‚Äôs even possible on Android. Throughout this talk, you‚Äôll see some animated goodness and you‚Äôll learn how MotionLayout works, the basics for creating a layout using it, what a MotionScene is, what KeyFrames are and more!\n\nYou will leave this talk armed with the basic knowledge required to start having fun with MotionLayout and creating your own animations and transitions. And you'll realise that the mad animations or transitions that your designers give you are now possible!\n\nTo never saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to designers again*! üçª\n\n* Ok, sometimes you‚Äôll still have to say no."
