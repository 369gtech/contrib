language: English
recordingDate: 1632325434
description: "Joris provides a peek under the hood of the integration platform that Trifork developed for the Dutch Lotteries. It integrates clients like websites and mobile apps with a slew of backends that make up the IT landscape of the biggest Dutch lottery operator. \n \n He'll show how a microservices architecture was built using state-of-the-art Spring Boot and Cloud components running as Docker services on AWS using technologies such as:\n \n - Custom autoconfiguration to consistently apply settings for security, error handling, logging, metrics and HTTP clients\n - Observability using micrometer.io-provided metrics and Sleuth-based tracing\n - Integrations with AWS services such as Cognito, SQS, and the Parameter Store\n - Reliability based on things like circuit breakers, including the experience of migrating away from the deprecated Netflix stack.\n \n If you're using Spring to build microservices, then this is a talk you don't want to miss! \n\nJoris Kuipers, CTO at Trifork\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/winning-the-lottery-with-spring-a-microservices-case-study-for-the-dutch-lotteries"
