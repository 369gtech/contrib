description: "by Zeeshan Ali\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/K.3.401/rust_dbus_library.webm\n\nIn this talk, I will present zbus, a D-Bus crate written from scratch. D-Bus is an inter-process communication mechanism, available and used on almost all modern Linux desktops and many embedded systems. I will start with why I felt the need to take this huge undertaking on my shoulders, followed by the design goals, the challenges faced and how I overcame them during the development.\n\nRoom: K.3.401\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 15:10:00"
