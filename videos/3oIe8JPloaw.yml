title: 'David Bernstein - Unit Tests as Specifications'
recordingDate: 1558057901
description: 'In this session, we’ll cover effective techniques for doing TDD that support building useful tests and quality code. You’ll learn how to instrument unit tests, so they also act as specifications that make a test’s intention clear. You’ll also learn how to approach TDD in a way that yields the right number and kind of tests that allow you to refactor code later without breaking tests. Working through a few code examples, we’ll see how many assertions are required to specify a linear range, exceptions, and other boundary conditions. We’ll look at how to write tests that don’t need to be changed when the code is refactored while still keeping test coverage high. If you’ve struggled to apply TDD on a project, or are just not sure how to start, then this session is for you. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/craftconf with the Ustream Mobile App'
