title: 'JDK IO 2014 - Writing more concise and flexible code with Java 8 - Raoul-Gabriel Urma'
recordingDate: 1392022935
description: "http://jdk.io/\n\nJava 8, to be released in March 2014, brings the largest update to the language since the introduction of generics in 2004. This new version of Java incorporate features popular in many other programming languages: the ability to represent a piece of behaviour in a concise form (called lambda expressions) and sql-like operations on collections (called the new Stream API). In this talk, we introduce these new features and show how you can benefit from them to write code that is more readable and more flexible to requirement changes. Be ready to hear about behaviour as data, lambdas, method references, and streams. Code speaks a thousand words so the the talk will be heavily example driven!"
