language: English
recordingDate: 1571240944
description: "In this talk, we'll explore how Spring Cloud Stream and its support for Apache Kafka can streamline the process of developing event-driven microservices that use Apache Kafka and its high-throughput capabilities as a backbone. In this hands-on session, we'll examine the general Kafka support provided by Spring Cloud Stream, as well as the building blocks it provides for developing stateful stream processing applications through its support for Kafka Streams library.\n\nAlong the way, we'll explore various concepts like streams, tables, stream-table duality, interactive queries in stateful stream processing, etc. We'll also venture into seeing how the new functional programming model in Spring Cloud Stream makes it easier to write Kafka- and Kafka Streams-based applications.\n\nSpeakers: Soby Chacko, Principal Software Engineer, Pivotal; Oleg Zhurakousky, Developer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/streaming-with-spring-cloud-stream-and-apache-kafka"
