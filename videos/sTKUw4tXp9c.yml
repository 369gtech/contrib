description: 'What do you do once you''ve changed the world? You do it again. That''s what the world''s open source innovators, builders, and pioneers did as they gathered again at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, Oregon, sharing their expertise and experience, exploring new ideas, and inspiring each other. In this event wrap-up, OSCON co-chairs Edd Dumbill, Sarah Novotny, and Laurel Ruma will identify and discuss the trends and announcements that emerged from the event and how these will impact the tech world in the year to come. We''ll build plenty of time for interaction, so bring your own ideas, insights and questions, from both the conference and beyond.'
