description: "Monsur Hossain, Joe Gregorio,  Anton Lopyrev\r\n\r\nAlthough Google offers client libraries to access our APIs for a variety of languages, there are some languages out there that don't yet have client library. In this session, we will demonstrate how you can easily build a client library for your favorite language using the new API Discovery service. Join us and learn how you can make it even easier to use Google APIs in your preferred programming environment"
