description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMartin Thompson - High-Performance Computing Specialist\n\nABSTRACT\nWhat does it really mean for a system to scale? How do we know we have built a system that scales to meet the business requirements in a cost effective manner? With ever increasing transaction and data volumes we need to take such questions a lot more seriously. It is now becoming critical for many businesses to focus in on the IT costs per user; otherwise they are not profitable. \"Just throw hardware at the problem\", is getting tired and just does not wash for many organisations.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
