description: "Google Tech Talk\nFebruary 8, 2011\n\nPresented by Prof. Inez Fung, UC Berkeley.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe first successful numerical weather forecast was made on the ENIAC (with fewer than 10 words memory) in 1950. This talk traces the development of atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs) for weather forecasting, to Global Climate Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models (ESMs) to illustrate the guts and gore of the huge codes. If we cannot predict the weather beyond 2 weeks, what do we mean by climate projections for the next century?"
