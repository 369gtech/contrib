description: 'I spend a lot of time working from my car. It''s a lot of fun but sometimes it can be very lonely. The Raspberry Pi 3 is an amazing piece of kit, and with the help of some friends you can do very interesting things with it. Like build yourself an personal digital assistant for your car.'
