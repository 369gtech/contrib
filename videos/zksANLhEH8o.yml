title: 'Harry Tormey - React Native Brownfield: Lessons from the Trenches'
recordingDate: 1536932526
description: "Hot reloading--the ability to push over the air updates to published apps and the promise of having your app “just work” out of the box on Android as well as iOS--make React Native a tempting proposition for frontend developers. But what do you do when you have to integrate React Native into a large existing native code base?\n\nThis talk is from the perspective of an experienced native iOS developer who has worked with React Native to ship several cross-platform Greenfield and brownfield apps.\n\n\nThings I will talk about: \n- Overview of the challenges involved in integrating React Native into an existing app\n- A real life case study integrating React Native into a native app with millions of users\n- Strategies for passing data and events in a brownfield app\n- Strategies for deciding what’s a good candidate to port to React Native and what’s not\n- Working with build systems like CocoaPods\n- Dealing with an existing navigation system\n- How to do CodePush in a brownfield app\n- How to handle navigation in a brownfield app\n- Best practices for working with Native engineers\n- Example brownfield application\nExtra notes: This is a new talk based on work I did for a client with a large existing native app used by millions of users."
