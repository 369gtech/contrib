recordingDate: 1513003330
description: "You may have heard that Machine Learning is setting the world alight. The advancements in processing power and data availability have made AI progress at an unprecedented pace. It beats humans in games in which humans were once unbeatable. It recognises cats from dogs. It helps win elections. So, you're probably getting the impression that with all these complex equations that it's too hard for a developer like you? Read on\n\nIn this talk, Micha? ?usiak will do his very best to combat that impression. He'll be looking into the current state of Machine Learning. Then he'll build and train a basic prediction model to understand how it all works. He will also look at some cloud solutions that can be used without writing a single line of code.\n\nSo, come and join Micha? to see that you don't need to be a mathematician to use ML. He will show you that you can incorporate it into your current projects right away without major effort.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
