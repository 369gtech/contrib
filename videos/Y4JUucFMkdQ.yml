title: 'Displaying dynamic data in a Django function view [19 of 24] | Beginner''s Series to: Django'
language: English
recordingDate: 1626354026
description: "Most views you create in Django will interact with data in your database. You can either write the code to interact with the object-relational-mapper (ORM) directly, or use some built-in generic views. In this video we will demonstrate how to manually use the ORM to retrieve data, and see how we can pass dynamic data into a Django template for display for the user.\n\nUseful Links:\nhttps://aka.ms/CreateWebsitesWithDjango \nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=batisteo.vscode-django\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/beginners-django"
