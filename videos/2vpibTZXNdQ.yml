The one and half hour Interactive live class covers overview of the HDFS High Availability (HA) feature and how to configure and manage an HA HDFS cluster, using the Quorum Journal Manager (QJM) feature. This also covers in brief main features of Hadoop 2.x and What has changed in Hadoop 2.x over Hadoop 1.x? We also understand the details of Hadoop Distributed File System ( HDFS). The Tutorial covers in detail about Name Node, Data Nodes, Secondary Name Node, Active-Passive NameNode, YARN, MRv2 and MRv1, Resource and Node Manager and Hadoop Cluster Configuration. It goes into the details of Hadoop 2.x, Hadoop Configuration Files, Plan your Hadoop Cluster: Hardware and software Considerations, Popular Hadoop Distributions. More details are below:\nWelcome, Let's Get Going on our Hadoop Journey...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nHow it Works?\n\n1. This is a 6 Week Instructor led Online Course.\n2. We have a 3-hour Live and Interactive Sessions every Sunday.\n\n3. We have 3 hours of Practical Work involving Lab Assignments, Case Studies and Projects every week which can be done at your own pace. \n4. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n\n5. At the end of the training you will have to undergo a 2-hour LIVE Practical Exam based on which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nAbout the Course\n\nThe Hadoop Cluster Administration course at Edureka starts with the fundamental concepts of Apache Hadoop and Hadoop Cluster. It covers topics to deploy, manage, monitor, and secure a Hadoop Cluster. You will learn to configure backup options, diagnose and recover node failures in a Hadoop Cluster. The course will also cover HBase Administration. There will be many challenging, practical and focused hands-on exercises for the learners. Software professionals new to Hadoop can quickly learn the cluster administration through technical sessions and hands-on labs. By the end of this six week Hadoop Cluster Administration training, you will be prepared to understand and solve real world problems that you may come across while working on Hadoop Cluster.\n\nNEW!\nOur course now covers Hadoop 2.0 Administration. The course content, quizzes, assignment, labs, and hands on practical's have been updated to cover new features in Hadoop 2.0, namely YARN, NameNode High Availability, HDFS Federation, Snapshot and so forth.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nCourse Objectives\nAfter the completion of 'Hadoop Administration' course at Edureka, you should be able to: \n-- Get a clear understanding of Apache Hadoop, HDFS, Hadoop Cluster and Hadoop Administration.\n-- Hadoop 2.0, Name Node High Availability, HDFS Federation, YARN, MapReduce v2.\n-- Plan and Deploy a Hadoop Cluster.\n-- Load Data and Run Applications.\n-- Configuration and Performance Tuning.\n-- Manage, Maintain, Monitor and Troubleshoot a Hadoop Cluster.\n-- Secure a deployment and understand Backup and Recovery.\n-- Learn what Oozie, Hcatalog/Hive, and HBase Administration is all about.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nWho should go for this course?\nStudents, DBAs, System Administrators, Software Architects, Data Warehouse Professionals, IT Managers, and Software Developers interested in learning Hadoop Cluster Administration should go for this course.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nOpportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on.
