title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Continuously Test Your Drupal Distribution'
recordingDate: 1506593279
description: "Everyone dreams about own Drupal Distribution within team or company. And a lot of us were working on own distribution because there are a lot of benefits in this. However at some point it’s really important to keep the distribution stable and usable, even though you have limited resources and it’s being used on various projects.\n\nContinuous Testing may help you to do so! We are doing this for the OpenY Distribution and we want to share our experience and show you our setup of CI that automates a lot of things.\n\nI’m going to tell you a story how to get from the first commit to the sustainable distribution that will be covered by various tests. Sessions based on own experience are definitely more interesting and fun, so I guarantee that you won't have any regrets about joining us that day.\n\n\n\nIn this session I'm going to cover:\n\nHow many environments do you really need to cover major parts of the distribution\nWhy do we need vanilla build, Upgrade Path build and build for installation steps\nHow we trigger behat tests\nHow we check code for standards and sniffers\nHow we apply accessibility sniffers\nHow lazy builders helps us to speed up the development process\nYeah! We developed tests to check every single module in the distribution for decoupling\nHow to integrate Test Drived Development using Unit Tests on live database\n\nFrom this session you’ll have everything in order to not only build the distribution, but also keep it stable, decoupled and well tested. Technical people - welcome to attend!"
