title: '"Kicad for software developers" - David Tulloh (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579213061
description: "David Tulloh\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/43/\n\nThis tutorial will take you through the process of designing a circuit and PCB using Kicad. \r\n\r\nWe will design a watering system relay controller, with wireless communication and solar power. From block diagram, to circuit, to PCB.\r\n\r\nThis will be a guided journey, a Disney on rail adventure where the story, components and design have been prechosen for a cultivated, time controlled, experience. The focus will be on the use of the tools, eeschema to design the circuit and pcbnew to layout the PCB.\r\n\r\nYou will be shown each technique then given time to practice it by finishing off the other elements while I circulate to assist. Awkward silences will be filled by discussions of the design decisions that have been taken, amusing anecdotes and opinionated advice on what consists of good design. Checkpoints with preprepared files for catchup will be provided in case you struggle in any particular area\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you have Kicad 5 installed and have tested that it runs, we will not have time during the session to fix faulty installs. You will also need an internet connection to be able to download preprepared files and pdf datasheets.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
