description: "The CRUD mentality made its way into our industry over the past few years, often being looked to as the solution to all our architectural needs.\n\nBut it turns out this model doesn't always fit. It's often the case that the systems we work on are just a representation of the real world events that are happening within the business we are modelling. This isn't a problem that CRUD is very good at solving. In this talk I'll discuss the advantages of looking at your system as a distinct series of events and how doing so can help you better model your domain. I'll also talk about how this will change the way you write the software, how it changes the way your users will use the software and how it can ultimately lead to a better experience all around."
