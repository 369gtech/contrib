description: "Bankwest is undertaking an Enterprise wide Transformation to be agile & responsive, customer obsessed and digitally empowered.\n\nIn undertaking the transformation program we initially broke many of the rules we espoused - we created the strategy in secret, designed a high level operating model with an external agency and a small number to internal employees over an extended period of time and expected leadership buy-in when we revealed our \"Ta-Da\" moment!\n\nQuickly positioning the Bankwest journey, we'll laser focus into our A-Ha moment and how we quickly changed our approach - creating a leader \"immersion event\", the need to create psychological safety, generating ownership through co-design and how this created buy-in and accelerated pace of change.\n\nPaul is an experienced corporate leader with a unique blend of entrepreneurial skills and enterprise transformation experience. He strongly believes in putting people first, enabling the future of work, through an awesome employee value proposition and consistently enhanced customer experience.\n\nWith 12 years of proven track record within the corporate banking sector, he is devoted to bringing common sense and practical experience, from launching his own small business start-ups, to corporate leadership. His current focus at Bankwest is on Enterprise Agility and he maintains a steady focus on how to improve customer and employee experiences through transformation.\n\nFor more on YOW!
