I am a passionate engineer and open source enthusiast. At Nordea I manage several teams of talented engineers who work on critical applications which empower Nordea’s business. Being a developer myself I am involved in many aspects of technical design, setting the vision and building the strategy. Big part of my work is around culture. Engineering culture. I am a big fan of “loosely coupled and highly aligned” teams’ model with good communication, common sense and overall smartness being the key components.\n\nFollow infoShare:\nhttps://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://www.instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
