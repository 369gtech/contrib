description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nWe – attendees at CppCon – are all teachers. Some teach for a living; many occasionally teach a course or give a lecture; essentially all give advice about how to learn C++ or how to use C++. The communities we address are incredibly diverse.\n\nWhat do we teach, and why? Who do we teach, and how? What is “modern C++”? How do we avoid pushing our own mistakes onto innocent learners?\n\nTeaching C++ implies a view of what C++ is; there is no value-neutral teaching. What teaching tools and support do we need? Consider libraries, compiler support, and tools for learners. This talk asks a lot of questions and offers a few answers. Its aim is to start a discussion, so the Q&A will be relatively long.\n— \nBjarne Stroustrup - Managing Director,, Morgan Stanley\nC++: history, design, use, standardization, future; performance, reliability; software developer education; | distributed systems\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
