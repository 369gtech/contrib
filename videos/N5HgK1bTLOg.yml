I decided to teach C++ through problem solving. This first video covers preprocessor directives, main, cout, if, terminal arguments, for, data types, variables, constants, printf, strings, getline, cin, conversions, and much more.\n\nThis tutorial is light on problems, but for each forward I'll try to include at least 3 progressively complex problems for you to solve. I hope you enjoy it."
