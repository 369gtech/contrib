description: "Hannah Hazi \n\n\n\nLet's learn about virtual environments - why it's useful, how it works, getting started.\n\nWhat are virtual environments? How can they help us when developing in Python? In this session we'll find out how to get started and then dig down into how virtualenv works under the hood. There will also be a whistle-stop tour of the various options for package management in Python, and a chance to learn from my mistakes!\n\nThis session is mainly intended for people who haven't used a virtual environment before or those who want to learn about how they work."
