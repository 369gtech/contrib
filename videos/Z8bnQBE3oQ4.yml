description: "Panel: Learning from Adaptations to Coronavirus\n\nModerator: Nora Jones, Jeli.io\nPanelists: Fred Hebert, Postmates; Lorin Hochstein, Netflix; Vanessa Huerta Granda, Enova\n\nWe are all in the middle of a worldwide incident in which we are all incident responders in some way. The large-scale disruption that Covid-19 has introduced to day-to-day functioning of society has profound implications for the software systems that are a part of daily life. And the experts tasked with keeping those systems running are no exception.\n‚Äç\nIn this panel, we will talk through the 5 key themes that emerged from a series of two facilitated video calls with engineers and managers from several different organizations, along with expert suggestions on how to adapt to some of these problems, all backed up by research. We will interview 3 participants from organizations that had to unexpectedly scale and adjust during this time and how they managed this.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
