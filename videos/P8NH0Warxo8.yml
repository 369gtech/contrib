description: 'Amazon EC2 allows you to bid for and run spare EC2 capacity, known as Spot instances, in a dynamically priced market.

In this session, we dive into how to design scalable, cloud-friendly application architectures can leverage new Spot features to realize immediate cost savings while maintaining availability.
