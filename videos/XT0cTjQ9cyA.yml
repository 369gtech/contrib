recordingDate: 1577305377
description: "Kubernetes is the most popular orchestrator for large microservices system. It provides possibility for automating application deployment, scaling and management. But does it really a magic wand, which may solve all your problems, or it would be better to use another solutions? We will compare two giant players in the orchestration and clusters building area: DC/OS (aka. Mesosphere) and Kubernetes from the developer point of view. Can you predict who will win? So, let the fight begin!\n\nThe authors of this “battle” have come a long way from DC/OS to Kubernetes and will try to convey their experience to the audience."
