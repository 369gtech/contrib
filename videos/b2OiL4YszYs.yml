description: 'Picking up a second, third… etc. programming language is always easier because you have a reference to a language you already know. But language tutorials are rarely made assuming one language, and worse yet most PowerShell intros are for non-programmers. This talk would be a great opportunity for efficient learning(visualize that scene in the Matrix where Neo wakes up and says “I know Kung-Fu” I will step through all the necessary info one would need to start programming in PowerShell in about 40 minutes. I plan to open with 5 minutes on background and advertising why one might want to consider PowerShell, and end with a list of resources and a take away cheatsheet and Q&A.'
