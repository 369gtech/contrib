description: "Titel: Practical Auth in a Serverless World\n\nIt became essential for businesses to protect their applications, services and customer data from attackers. If you want to stay competitive, knowing how to efficiently and easily apply security and auth while being aware of the most common pitfalls is key in today's serverless world.\n\nTraditional machine-to-machine auth approaches where you can rely on a stateful environment fall short in a modern serverless and thus stateless world.\nAfter a short recap of some auth fundamentals, you'll learn how to efficiently apply authentication to Azure Functions without compromising security - using an external Identity Provider like Auth0, OAuth 2, JWT, the secrets management system Azure Key Vault and Azure Managed Identities.\n\nSpeaker: Andreas Grimm - Auth Hero, Serverless/Serviceful Proponent, DDD/CQRS/ES enthusiast\n\nAndreas is an expert in Identity & Access Management and a proponent of serverless/serviceful architectures.\nBeing aware of the fact that having a shared understanding with the business is even more important than technical solutions, he's into aproaches like Domain Driven Design, EventStorming, CQRS and EventSourcing.\nHe's from the community for the community and organizes several meetup groups in Berlin like @DDDBER and @fullstack_JS"
