description: "The Cloud Foundry Dojo Experience — How to Become a Contributor - Cornelius Schumacher, SUSE Linux & Michael Trestman, Pivotal Cloud Foundry\n\nThe Dojo is Cloud Foundry's unique way of ramping up new contributors. Participants join existing core teams on site for six to ten weeks, and get introduced to technology, culture, and community by working as part of the team, pair programming all day. \n\nThe Dojo experience immerses participants in the extreme programming culture practiced at Pivotal, as well as a wide range of tools and technologies. The Dojo embodies the values of transparency and openness, prevents siloing of project expertise within Pivotal, and ensures that Cloud Foundry development is accessible to the greater community. \n\nThis presentation will give a first hand experience report about the Dojo from the perspectives of a new participant joining the BOSH core team and a full-time member of the project, and situate this in the broader context of Cloud Foundry software development.\n\nAbout Cornelius Schumacher\nCornelius works as engineering manager in the cloud and systems management department at SUSE Linux, which is working on projects such as OpenStack, Docker, and a variety of systems management tools. Cornelius is driving SUSE's technical involvement with Cloud Foundry, in particular the work on the BOSH OpenStack Cloud Provider Interface. He is a long time contributor to many open source projects for more than a decade, such as KDE, openSUSE, the Open Build Service, or Machinery. Cornelius is a regular speaker at Linux and open source events, mostly in Europe, but also in the US or in Brazil.\n\nAbout Michael Trestman\nMichael Trestman is a software engineer on the BOSH core team at Pivotal Cloud Foundry."
