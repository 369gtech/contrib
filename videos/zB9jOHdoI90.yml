recordingDate: 1433253684
description: "Ceylon is a new modern, elegant programming language for the JVM and the JavaScript VM, designed for teamwork. But it’s more than that: it is a full platform with modularity, an SDK, tools, and IDEs. This session presents Ceylon the language, the platform, and its ecosystem. You will see everything from starting a new project in the IDE to publishing it on Herd, Ceylon’s module repository, including using the SDK. The presentation also discusses ongoing Ceylon projects such as the build system; Vert.x integration; and Cayla, the new web framework. Finally, it looks at the plans for Ceylon 1.1, 1.2, and further.\n\n\nAuthor:\n Stephane Epardaud\nFrom deep into the Nice mountains, Stephane works for Red Hat on the Ceylon project.\n\nPassionate hacker in Java, C, Perl or Scheme.
