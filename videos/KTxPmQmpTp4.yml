description: "When engineers start developing on node.js, they'll quickly start using a framework like Express, Hapi, Koa, etc. As their applications mature, they'll realize that their framework becomes more of a burden than a blessing. This talk will discuss:\n\n- The history behind Express, Connect, and Koa, which I helped maintain for a while\n- How they work with node.js' http servers\n- Their underlying libraries in jshttp and pillarjs (The Build-Your-Own-Framework Framework)\n- How you could build your own framework with these libraries\n- Examples of feature requests that should not be part of the framework\n- Examples of composing applications of different frameworks"
