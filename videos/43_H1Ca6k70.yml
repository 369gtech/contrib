recordingDate: 1376330425
description: "O'Reilly Webcast with Rosenfeld Media\n\nInterviewing users is undeniably one of the most valuable and commonly used user research tools. Yet sometimes we forget that it's a skill we need to learn, because:\nIt's based on skills we think we have (talking or even listening)\nIt's not taught or reflected on\n\nPeople tend to 'wing it' rather than develop their skills. Without good interviewing skills, insights may be inaccurate or reveal nothing new, suggesting the wrong design or business responses, or they may miss the crucial nuance that points to innovative breakthrough opportunities.\n\nThis webcast will look at how to frame the research problem so it has the most impact on the team and their design. We will explore:\n\n    Importance of rapport-building and listening\n    Techniques\n    Review different types of questions\n    Why you need to have a range of question types\n    What type of participants to recruit and how to find them\n\nAbout Steve Portigal\n\nSteve Portigal is the founder of Portigal Consulting, a bite-sized firm that helps clients to discover and act on new insights about themselves and their customers.
