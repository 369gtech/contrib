description: "Mobile moves fast, and so do you. To meet your deadlines, you want to build the right thing, at the right time; every time. Your continuous integration pipeline allows you to do this, but can it do more? - How can you enforce coding formatting, styling conventions, and best practices? - Do you build everything on every commit? Do you have a daily build or customize your build per branch? - What do you record and analyze? Are your tests passing? Do your screens look correct? Is your apk getting too large? - How do you distribute your apk for testing and release? - How do you track, record, and notify quickly when issues arise?
