description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeakers: Talya Gendler and Lyor Goldstein\nSpring Insight is a technology that gives visibility into an application's runtime performance and behavior. Originally intended to be used by developers and designed to be integrated with the VMware vFabric tc Server, it has long developed beyond that point. Presently, it is already used for real-live applications monitoring and is integrated with most of the current application servers in the market -- such as Tomcat, JBoss and WebLogic -- via a command line Java installer. As part of the development process, a lot of experience has been gained by the Spring Insight development team regarding the process of integrating an application server with the instrumentation and monitoring framework.\n\nThe purpose of this session is to describe the basic requirements from such integration and provide some insight into how one would approach such a task for a new application server"
