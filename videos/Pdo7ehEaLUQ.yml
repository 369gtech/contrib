description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nMicroservices: From dream to reality in forty five minutes\n\nAre microservices a wonder-pattern for rescuing intractably complex applications? Or are they just a restatement of the software engineering best practices we all should be following anyway? Or something in between? How do they work? How should they be written? What are the pitfalls? What are the underpinning technologies? Using a pile of tiny computers, cables, and code, I'll demonstrate writing, deploying - and managing - a polyglot microservices application. Since there are limits on how much traffic the data-centre-in-a-handbag server topology can handle, I'll also demonstrate scaling up, out, and away to the cloud.\n\nHolly Cummins, IBM\n\nHolly Cummins is the delivery lead for IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile.
