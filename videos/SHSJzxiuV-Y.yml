Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nLeitMotif: An Abstraction for Debugging Distributed Applications - Mania Abdi, Northeastern University \n\nAbstractions, such as APIs, allow developers to build complex distributed applications out of smaller building blocks. In contrast, there are very few abstractions available to limit the amount of complexity engineers must deal with when diagnosing problems in production applications. This mismatch means that diagnosis will continue to become more challenging as systems continue to scale. We present the workflow motif abstraction, instantiations of which capture frequent or important processing patterns observed in the workflow of requests. We argue that use of motifs can make existing diagnosis techniques more powerful and enable new use cases. We discuss features needed from distributed tracing infrastructures to generate useful motifs, progress on modifying frequent-subgraph mining algorithms to identify motifs from traces, and initial experiences using motifs to debug problems."
