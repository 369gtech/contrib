The goal is to build an accurate production-ready machine learning model when there is either no data or insufficient data available to train a model - the so-called cold start. In this case methods like transfer learning are proved to be valuable by using a model that was trained on a different but related task.In his talk Sergey will guide through a real-world cold start problem he was working on in payment fraud detection at Zalando. The business case aims at building a payment fraud detection model for a new market, where there is no historical data available. The challenge is how to combine the data from existing markets in an elaborate way so that it generalizes to a new market.  - Captured Live on Ustream at https://www.ustream.tv/channel/JUMjvCF2ucj"
