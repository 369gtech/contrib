description: "The Web becomes increasingly centralized. We trust our private data to be stored in data centers despite news about data leaks. We exchange our messages and they are handled to three-letter agencies without you knowing about it. Can we do better and return the Web to its decentralized roots? A combination of proven and emerging technologies like WebRTC can help us. In this talk weâ€™ll learn about the building blocks and basic principles of decentralized networks on real-world examples, using WebRTC, Kademlia DHT, and BitTorrent (which is useful way beyond just file sharing).\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/nikita-baksalyar/"
