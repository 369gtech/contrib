description: "Join this course on CQRS, Domain Events, Event Sourcing and how to apply DDD with Greg Young!\nThe largest problem many run into with Domain Driven Design is in getting the abstract concepts implemented in a concrete way. Many of the stereotypical architectures people use actually make it impossible to apply DDD.\nThis CQRS course will help you avoid this. You will learn all about Command Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS), Domain Events, Event Sourcing and how to effectively apply DDD within an organisation."
