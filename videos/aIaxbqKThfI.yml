recordingDate: 1510222808
description: "Mandi Walls, a huge fan of DevOps movement and Technical Community Manager (EMEA) at Chef. She travels the world helping technology organizations increase their effectiveness using configuration management and modern IT practices. She is a regular speaker at technical conferences and is the author of the whitepaper “Building a DevOps Culture” published by O’Reilly. \nMandi has a great interest in how the internet and access to information can transform lives and provide the underserved or ostracized with community and opportunities. She is interested in the emergence of new tools and workflows to make the task of operating large complex computing systems more approachable. Her specialities include Web application operations, DevOps and Large-scale web.\n\nInSpec is an open-source testing framework for infrastructure with a human- and machine-readable language for specifying compliance, security, and policy requirements. Using a combination of command-line and remote-execution tools, InSpec can help you keep your infrastructure aligned with security and compliance guidelines on an ongoing basis, rather than waiting for and then remediating from arduous annual audits. InSpec’s flexibility makes it a key tool choice for incorporating security into a complete continuous delivery workflow, reducing the risk of new features and releases breaking established host-based security guidelines. This talk covers the basics of working with InSpec, writing tests to reflect your organization’s security guidelines, and managing InSpec as part of a high-velocity workflow."
