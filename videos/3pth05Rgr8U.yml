description: "In todayâ€™s session, we are delighted to have Trisha Gee, Java Advocacy Team Lead from JetBrains, talking about such an essential and important thing as Code Review.\n\nThe aim of this webinar is to know how to identify the best practices and envision the path to maximise the value and minimise the pain of the code review, as Trisha said. She has already writen a book on the things to look for when code reviewing (http://jb.gg/book/codereview) but in addition, she gives us an in-depth overview of the different types of code reviews depending on the situation and the reason for it.\n\nIn order to know what to look for when code reviewing, it is necessary to give and answer to questions such as why, when, who and where first. \n\nThank you Trisha for an amazing talk and for your interesting answers to our participants questions about reviewing tools and workflows. We hope to have you at Codurance again soon!\n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
