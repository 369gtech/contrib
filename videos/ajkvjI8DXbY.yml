title: 'Math for Game Developers - Constant Speed Movement'
recordingDate: 1462474800
description: 'We have a curve that we want to move e.g. a camera along. However, the objects on the curve speed up and slow down depending on where the control points are placed. So in this video we develop an arc length formula that we are going to use to reparameterize the cubic spline curve so that it is constant velocity.'
