description: "The ability to deliver software is no longer a differentiator. In fact, it is a basic requirement for survival. Companies that embrace cloud native patterns of software delivery will survive; companies that don’t - will not.\n\nThis webinar looks at the common patterns that distinguish cloud native companies and the architectures that they employ, shows that an opinionated platform, one that stretches from the infrastructure all the way to the application framework, rather than ad-hoc automation, is an essential component to an enterprise's cloud native journey and that that the combination of Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Spring is the complete cloud native platform.\n\nPresenter: Matt Stine, Senior Product Manager, Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Pivotal"
