recordingDate: 1631118058
description: "Ближайшая конференция: \nDotNext 2021 Moscow — 21-22 октября, онлайн.\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/3BTQype\n\n. This talk shows how to write a 2D game using the MonoGame framework with C# that runs on Windows, Linux, Android, and other platforms supported by MonoGame.\n\nMonoGame is a framework originally modeled after the XNA framework discontinued by Microsoft. It supports 2D and 3D game development, and yet is simple enough to be very accessible to C# developers. We'll see how to build a game from start to (almost) finish, looking at the main game components and techniques, including sprites, graphics, game mechanics, sound, and more.\n\nAt the end of the session you'll have a good overview of game development in general, and MonoGame in particular so you can start building your games!"
