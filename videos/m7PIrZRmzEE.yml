description: "Sean Phillips, Principal Software Engineer, a.i. Solutions Inc\n\nJohan Vos, CTO, Gluon\n\nHumanity is turning its gaze beyond Earth orbit, seeking to become a multiworld species. NASA missions to Earth’s moon, Mars, and moons of nearby planets are in development and scheduled for launch. The complexities of the trajectory design for these missions present an overwhelming design space. The JavaFX-based Deep Space Trajectory Explorer provides custom 2D/3D visualizations. The design space, however, demands more computing power than what’s available on a single system. Gluon CloudLink provisioning provides a crucial yet elegant bridge to Oracle Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, enabling mission success. This session presents a demonstration including data from the EM-1 and EM-2 manned lunar surface excursion missions via the planned deep space human habitat."
