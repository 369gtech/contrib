description: "Cloud functions and the future of software architecture\n\nThere's a fundamental shift underway toward serverless cloud architectures. With the release of function-execution-as-a-service technologies such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions -- developers are now building entirely serverless platforms at scale. In these new architectures, traditional back-end servers are replaced with cloud functions acting as discrete single-purpose services. These stateless functions are used to perform protected actions, execute business logic and orchestrate interactions with a vast array of powerful cloud services. By composing and combining these functions together in a loose orchestration developers can build complex, yet easy to understand systems.\nWe've spent the past year building a completely serverless online platform that connects 50,000+ users in real-time, using AWS Lambda, Firebase and a huge array of 3rd party cloud services. There's no web or database servers to maintain, and the platform has scaled effortlessly from day 1.\n\nIn this talk we'll explain the concepts and principles of serverless architectures, and walk through real-world examples of how to construct such systems. As with anything, a serverless approach can yield a lot of compelling benefits, but it's also not a silver bullet for all scenarios. We'll give advice on areas where serverless approaches can be beneficial and areas where you're better off sticking with a traditional approach.\n\nExpect to hear about AWS Lambda, Firebase, Auth0, Cloud Search, Elastic Transcoder, S3, CloudFront CDN and lots of JavaScript!\n\nOur walkthroughs are focused on AWS Lambda, but exactly the same patterns and architectures can be applied to Azure Functions."
