description: "http://2017.cssconf.eu/speakers/patricia-realini.html\n\nFor centuries the visual arts have been used to tell stories, warn people about dangers and invoke emotion. Today we use the internet for all those purposes and more. Just as the Vatican employed painters to spread their message – it will be the developers and designers who will lead us into the next Renaissance. But there is still a lot to learn from the great masters. In this talk, we will flexbox the Golden Ratio with Leonardo DaVinci, up the pixel ratio for our devices with the Impressionists & ”inspect elements” of some iconic works of art to make the web a more beautiful place."
