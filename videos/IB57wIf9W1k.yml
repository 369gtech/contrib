My hobby is to encourage compilers to do more of this, programmers to rely on it, and hardware vendors to give us new atomic toys to optimize with. Oh, and standardize yet more close-to-the-metal concurrency and parallelism tools. \n\nBut, you say, surely volatile always means volatile, there’s nothing wrong with my benign races, nothing could even go wrong with non-temporal accesses, and who needs 6 memory orderings anyways? I’m glad you asked, let me tell you about my hobby…\n— \nJF Bastien\nJest-in-Time Compiler, template\nJF Bastien is a compiler engineer, currently focusing on performance and security to bring portable, fast and secure code to the Web. JF is a member of the C++ standards committee, where his mechanical engineering degree serves little purpose. He’s worked on startup incubators, business jets, flight simulators, CPUs, dynamic binary translation, systems, and compilers.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
