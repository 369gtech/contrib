Indexes are one of the most detailed metadata sets available for your content, and can be used to search, recommend, explore, and create buyers for your publications.\n\nWe'll talk about:\n\nbaseline metadata\nsemantic markup\nwhether you need controlled vocabularies across multiple publications\ndisplaying mashups of multiple indexes\nincorporating social input\n\nAbout Pilar Wyman\n\nPilar Wyman is the President of the American Society for Indexing (ASI), the voice of excellence in indexing. A veteran freelance indexer with her own successful business, she is also an active member of the ASI Digital Trends Task Force, which was formed in 2011 to address the continuing and rapidly increasing evolution of book publishing from traditional print to eBook formats.
