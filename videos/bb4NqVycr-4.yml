title: 'Styling HTML5 Form Validation Messages with CSS3'
language: English
recordingDate: 1354319573
description: "In this screencast I demonstrate a hidden CSS3 feature of webkit, that allows us to override the default styling of the validation bubbles. You would think adjusting the CSS of the validation bubbles would be straight forward, and that you could jump into chrome developer tools and monkey around with the way they look.\n \nUnfortunately not. :(\n \nThese CSS3 features are not so openly documented and as easy to modify as we would like. Basically it requires a little \"under the hood monkey wrenching\", however, luckily for us these validation bubbles are completely customizable.\n \nAs long as you have some basic CSS styling chops, and know which \"hidden selectors\" do the all magic, you can make theses things look exactly as you want them to.\n\n- For all the project files, head to http://bit.ly/css3forms\n- Check out Marakana's HTML5 and other training courses here: http://mrkn.co/j6rti"
