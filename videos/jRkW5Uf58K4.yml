description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nThe rapidly growing size of data has broadened the role of data scientists. Instead of creating models for one-off analysis, it's becoming common to use prototypes in real-world applications. Spotify Luigi helps to enable such scenarios, without having to learn a whole bunch of new technologies. We will explore Luigi's concepts and learn how to code solutions for common problems in data pipelines.\n\nSlides: http://plainpixels.work/resources/production-ready-datascience.slides#/\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
