description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeakers: Craig Walls and Roy Clarkson\nThe modern web no longer is limited to desktop browsers. Smart phones and tablets have become an integral part of our daily lives. Web sites that may look good on a 22\" monitor usually do not format and display well on a much smaller screen. Additionally, network speeds can limit the performance of a web site on mobile devices. Because of these reasons many developers and organizations are considering how to make their web sites accessible to all the various devices and screen sizes for which people are using. In this session, we will explore the functionality provided within the Spring Mobile project, and how you can use it to extend your Spring MVC application onto mobile and tablet devices. We'll then continue the discussion by demonstrating how you can leverage some of the popular mobile JavaScript frameworks in combination with Spring Mobile to provide a first class experience for your users on mobile devices."
