This session takes you through the history of Android app distribution, including the APK internals, app signing and Play improvements that ultimately lead to the where we are now. You will learn about the technologies that enabled Google Play Dynamic Delivery using the new bundle format, including for the first time letting developers dynamically load optional modules, containing code and resources, at runtime."
