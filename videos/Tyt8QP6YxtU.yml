description: "In this talk, Paul will demonstrate why writing infrastructure in general programming languages is a better way to is a better choice for infrastructure management. Pulumi is an open source tool that allows users to write their infrastructure code in TypeScript, Python, DotNet or Go.\n\nGeneral purpose languages allow infrastructure code to have integrated testing, compile time checks as well as being able to create infrastructure APIs and is more suited to infrastructure management than DSLs, JSON or YAML. In addition, he will demonstrate how to build infrastructure that manages Serverless, Kubernetes, PaaS and IaaS systems across multiple cloud providers."
