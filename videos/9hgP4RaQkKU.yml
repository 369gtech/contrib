description: "POMAC: Properly Ofﬂoading Mobile Applications to Clouds\n\nMohammed A. Hassan, George Mason University; Kshitiz Bhattarai, SAP Lab; Qi Wei and Songqing Chen, George Mason University\n\nPrior research on mobile computation offloading has mainly focused on how to offload as well as what to offload. However, the problem of whether the offloading should be done attracted much less attention. In addition, existing offloading schemes either require special compilation or modification to the applications’ source code or binary, making them difficult to be deployed in practice. In this work, we introduce POMAC, a framework to enable dynamic and transparent mobile application offloading to clouds. A prototype has been implemented on the Dalvik virtual machine and our preliminary evaluations show that POMAC can outperform existing schemes significantly and work with real-world applications seamlessly.\n\nView the full HotCloud '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotcloud14/workshop-program"
