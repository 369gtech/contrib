Other could be , Developers must have certain labels be present in all deployment definitions identifying the business unit to chargeback to.\n\nJoin us as we take you through configuring and deploying custom policies using the Open Policy Agent. We will cover some common policies used in enterprises and walk you through how to implement them in OPA using Rego. Rego is OPAâ€™s native query language."
