description: "Tiramisu: Fast Multilayer Network Verification\n\nAnubhavnidhi Abhashkumar, University of Wisconsin - Madison; Aaron Gember-Jacobson, Colgate University; Aditya Akella, University of Wisconsin - Madison\n\nToday's distributed network control planes are highly sophisticated, with multiple interacting protocols operating at layers 2 and 3. The complexity makes network configurations highly complex and bug-prone. State-of-the-art tools that check if control plane bugs can lead to violations of key properties are either too slow, or do not model common network features. We develop a new, general multilayer graph control plane model that enables using fast, property-customized verification algorithms. Our tool, Tiramisu can verify if policies hold under failures for various real-world and synthetic configurations in  0.08s in small networks and  2.2s in large networks. Tiramisu is 2-600X faster than state-of-the-art without losing generality.\n\nView the full NSDI '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/technical-sessions"
