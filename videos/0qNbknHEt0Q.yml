description: "Switch on/off English subtitles by clicking on the CC icon.\n\nIn this video, I use the Lokalschriftartenzugriffsapplikationsprogrammierschnittstelle (Local Font Access API)  to explain how new browser APIs can be used as progressive enhancement and where these APIs developed in the context of Project Fugu come from.
