description: "RubyConf 2018 - Running a Government Department on Ruby for over 13 Years by Jeremy Evans\n\nIn this presentation, I will be sharing my experiences running the programming unit for a government department for the over 15 years, using Ruby almost exclusively for the last 13. I will discuss our approach of having developers working directly with stakeholders to determine requirements, how we prioritize requests for new features, how we use Ruby for all types of applications, and our unique web application stack and how it uses defense-in-depth approaches to prevent and contain attacks."
