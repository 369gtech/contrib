description: 'The Internet has changed everything and surviving and thriving in the chaotic, open and uncertain environment requires a new kind of innovation. Innovation happens on the edges in ecosystems where standards are developed in non-governmental bodies, where intellectual property can become more of a burden to agility than an asset and where planning can cost more than doing. We know from the VC and startup scene that small companies thrive and can disrupt large incumbents with their agility and speed, but what is the role of academic institutions like the MIT Media Lab and is that an academic equivalent to the Silicon Valley startup scene.'
