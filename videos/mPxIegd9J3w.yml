description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nIn this presentation we will talk about the new C++ concurrency features that have been included in the Concurrency Technical Specification. \n\nThe TS should be of interest to anyone writing concurrent code in C++. The proposal includes improved futures for wait-free composition of asynchronous operations (including their relationship with C++ 'await'), new synchronization constructs as well as atomic smart pointers.\n— \nArtur Laksberg is a software design engineer at Microsoft. His interests include concurrency, programming language and library design, and modern C++. Artur is a regular participant in the work of the Concurrency Study Group in the ISO C++ Committee, serving as the editor of the Concurrency Technical Specification. He is one of the co-authors of the proposal to improve std::future (currently part of the Concurrency TS) and also a contributor to the Parallelism TS.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
