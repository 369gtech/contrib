language: Spanish
recordingDate: 1635201236
description: "Users on mobile devices benefit the most from appropriate system keyboard suggestions and help, but they're also the same users who often suffer the most when form fields are deployed built poorly. In this talk, we'll learn how to build mobile-friendly forms, to improve accessibility and to reduce user frustration and bounce rate.\n\nWe'll cover basics, like input type, as well as a number of more advanced HTML attributes to control iOS/Android features for user convenience. You'll leave this talk equipped to build form fields that are tailored for mobile accessibility."
