title: 'O''Reilly Webcast: Who Killed My Battery - Analyzing Mobile Browser Energy Consumption'
language: English
recordingDate: 1371165208
description: "Despite the explosive growth of smartphones and growing popularity of mobile web browsing, the energy consumed by a phone browser while surfing the web is poorly understood. While web pages are often optimized for speed and beauty, little attention is given to the amount of energy needed to download and render the page.\n\nIn this webcast presentation, we present an infrastructure for measuring the precise energy used by a mobile browser to render web pages. We then measure the energy needed to render financial, e-commerce, email, blogging, news and social networking sites. Our tools are sufficiently precise to measure the energy needed to render individual web elements, such as cascade style sheets (CSS), Javascript, images, and plug-in objects. Our results show that for popular sites, downloading and parsing cascade style sheets and Javascript consumes a significant fraction of the total energy needed to render the page. Using the data we collected we make concrete recommendations on how to design web pages so as to minimize the energy needed to render the page. We conclude by estimating the point at which offloading browser computations to a remote proxy can save energy on the phone. Our approach gives another dimension for evaluating mobile web sites and helps web developers build more energy efficient sites and improve user experience.\n\nAbout Dr. Angela Nicoara:\n\nDr. Angela Nicoara is a Senior Research Scientist at Deutsche Telekom Innovation Laboratories, Silicon Valley Innovation Center, USA since 2008.
