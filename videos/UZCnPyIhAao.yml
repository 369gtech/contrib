description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nMany of us are telling stories on the web- whether it be expressing concepts with data visualization, the story of how our product works, or simply writing good documentation. JavaScript is insanely powerful for gradually revealing information through animation, manipulating graphics with SVG, Canvas, and WebGL, or allowing users to guide themselves through interaction. In this talk, we’ll explore how our minds work on the web and how JavaScript can reach to new heights of composing experiences that attach to our limbic system and captivate us. We’ll dive deep into some of the how’s about these type of implementations and create live demos that bring these concepts to life.\n\nSarah Drasner\nWeb Technologies Consultant, Sarah Drasner Design\nhttps://twitter.com/sarah_edo\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
