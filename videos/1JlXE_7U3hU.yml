title: 'A tour of xbar code. Mat Ryer'
recordingDate: 1619810845
description: 'Mat Ryer takes you through the xbar project monorepo explaining key technical decisions and why they were made. All the way from the front end code that delivers the native app UI, through the service layers and native API integration, down to the xbar data APIs that power the app, and the website. Mat will explain how the focus on pragmatism and minimalism allowed him to deliver the new project within a couple of months.'
