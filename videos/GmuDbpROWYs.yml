description: "#AskTHAT Live with J.D. Hillen - Failures, Productivity, and Mindfulness\n\nHailing from the heart of Kansas City’s Silicon Prairie, J.D. Hillen is a Front-End / Interactive Developer for the experiential design firm, Dimensional Innovations. Since the age of 15, he's been fascinated with the connection between creativity and code. This love for all things tech has allowed him to work for a wide variety of advertising agencies, marketing firms and even the craft beer industry. When he’s not coding, you’ll find him at home spending time with his wife and two boys or in the pit of a metal show.\n\nLinks:\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/jdhillen\nGitHub - https://github.com/jdhillen\nWebsite - http://jdhillen.com\n\nItems mentions in the show:\n* Evernote - https://evernote.com/\n* Wunderlist - https://www.wunderlist.com/\n* Anylist - https://www.anylist.com/\n* How I Work - https://lifehacker.com/c/how-i-work\n* Meister Task - https://www.meistertask.com\n* Greg Baugues - Devs & Depression - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6x9wmlFz_c"
