language: English
recordingDate: 1539106280
description: "We would like to portray our journey to Cloud-Native and Microservices architecture. During this journey, we set our minds to transform a legacy monolith application in charge of all batch execution running in Intel Data Centers across the world. This mission critical system operates in 50 different data centers across the world, scheduling 1,000,000+ jobs per hour. In this presentation, we will focus on sharing our journey from what was initially a cloud vision - to a complete Cloud-Native Platform as a Service we have created based on Spring Cloud projects. This platform was created to allow software development teams to focus on business value creation rather than operational efforts.\nSpeakers:\nLiel Chayoun\nInfrastructure & Cloud Native Platform developer, Intel\nRoi Ezra\nInfrastructure & Cloud Native Platform team lead, Intel"
