description: "Aaron Krauss will be giving an introduction to game development using plain JavaScript, meaning no libraries or plugins. He'll be live-coding a single-player pong game, and discussing how to take it to the next level by turning it into a full-blown breakout game (often called brick-breaker). This talk is very introductory - no previous experience necessary. We'll discuss how core game mechanics work in the browser, collision detection, the game loop, and more! At the end, he'll review some of the popular game libraries available today, and how you can start to get your feet wet with JavaScript game development too!\n\nEVENT:\n\nOKC.js 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAaron Krauss\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nTechlahoma Events Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nTechlahoma YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnLf0pfqIpSfKuPZ0e9iiNQ\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl0749z7wSQ&t=24s"
