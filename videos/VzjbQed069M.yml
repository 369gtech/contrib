description: "Speaker: Omer Iqbal\n\nSegfaults, Buffer Overflows, Data Races and Memory Leaks cross over unprotected memory with ease. They steal our jobs, crash our code, cause vulnerabilities in openssl. We need to be tough. The liberals from C and C++ have kept these borders open for too long. It's time to build a wall... \n\nRust is a systems programming language designed for speed, safety, concurrency and hype. It features a radical memory model that gives YOU control, rather than those pesky garbage collectors, while still maintaining compile time safety gurantees. \n\nThis talk will introduce Rust, focusing on the fabled memory model, the motivations behind its design and the consequences. \n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Rust-Meetup/events/236868826/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/3tpA/"
