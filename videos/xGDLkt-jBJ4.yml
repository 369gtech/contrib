We'll cover the two fundamental strategies used by the standard smart pointers: unique ownership transfer and reference-counting. We'll show how shared_ptr uses control blocks to implement reference-counting of arbitrary objects, and how to use weak_ptr in conjunction with shared_ptr. We'll explain the convenience functions make_shared and make_unique, and demonstrate how they are more than just conveniences. Finally, we'll motivate, implement, and demystify the curiously recurring template enable_shared_from_this＜T＞.\n\nAttendees will leave this session with a clear understanding of how C++11's smart pointers work under the hood.\n— \nArthur O'Dwyer\nNew York\n\nArthur O'Dwyer is the author of \"Colossal Cave: The Board Game,\" \"Mastering the C++17 STL\" (the book), and \"The STL From Scratch\" (the training course).
