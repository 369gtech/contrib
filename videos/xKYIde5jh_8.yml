description: "Blockchain adaptation has reached a fever pitch, andthe community is late to the game of securing these platforms against attack. With the open source community enamored with the success of Ethereum, the enterprise community has been quietly building the next generation of distributed trustless applications on permissioned blockchain technologies. As of early 2018, an estimated half of these blockchain projects relied on the Hyperledger Fabric platform.\n\nIn this talk we will discuss tools and techniques attackers can use to target Fabric. To this end we are demoing and releasing a new attack suite, Tineola, capable of performing network reconnaissance of a Hyperledger deployment, adding evil network peers to this deployment, using existing trusted peers for lateral network movement with reverse shells, and fuzzing application code deployed on Fabric.\n\nAs George Orwell said: \"Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.\" This talk will demonstrate how a sufficiently armed red team can modify the blockchain past to control our digital future."
