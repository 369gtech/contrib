description: 'The talk would aim to give an overview of the tools we have to increase the security of applications before publishing them on the market or distribute the apk. These could be talking points: -Static and dynamic analysis application code for detecting potential vulnerabilities. -Development security in android components -New permissions model from version 6 where the user can allow or deny permissions in runtime -Libraries that allow encrypted data, for example SQLCipher to encrypt a SQLite database or to encrypt xml preferences files like securePreferences'
