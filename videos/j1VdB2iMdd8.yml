description: "Combining dataflow and functional paradigms to create ultimate data processing solution\n\nData Flow Programming has been a research topic for software engineers since the `70s.\nRecently, in the time of multicore CPU and GPU breakthrough, Data Flow paradigm is getting more popular than ever.\nDuring the presentation, I will talk about how we can fuse Data Flow with Functional and Visual Programming ideologies in order to create an ultimate data processing solution.\nSuch combination can bring us a lot of benefits, like high performance, great flexibility and increased program logic clarity."
