description: "DevOps in a Data Warehouse: Inside Out\n\nAndy Burgin, Lead DevOps Engineer, Sky Betting & Gaming \n\nYour organisation may be a high flying technology driven company, providing highly available reliable services to your customers. You may be mature in your devops adoption, maybe your local tech press refers to you as a unicorn. But somewhere in that organisation there may be some pockets resistance where the devops adoption didn't reach.\n\nThis is a story of how devops was brought into one such pocket, not by a top down strategic move but by a team of frustrated engineers who could see the benefits the rest of the company was enjoying. We proved even in a non traditional devops environment such as Data Warehousing and CRM it could still happen, this is how we did it.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
