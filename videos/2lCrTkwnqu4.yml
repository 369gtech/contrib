description: "Nishant Srivastava, Sr. Android Engineer, Soundbrenner\n\nTHE A, B AND C OF LIFECYCLE COMPONENTS\nIntermediate / Android Architecture / Talk\n\nIf you've been developing Android applications for a while now, you know the pain of handling the lifecycle just right.Itâ€™s a pain-point that has existed since the advent of Android, up until recently when Google released Architecture components. As an Android developer you are bugged by handling activity/fragment lifecycle and flow of data in tandem to the lifecycle changes day in and out. Making your code aware about the lifecycle of the process/activity/fragment makes you more confident as a developer and enables faster development. This session would enable you to understand Lifecycle components (ProcessLifecycleOwner, LifecycleOwner, LifecycleObserver) and how they are leveraged in other architecture components like LiveData and ViewModel. By the end of the session you will be able to build your own custom Lifecycle aware Android apps and libraries."
