description: "Jim Grisanzio talks with Jason Lowe about his experiences at the Hackmakers World Innovation Day​ Hackathon in April 2021. Developers and non-developers alike came together to work on projects to help support the people in need around the world -- and in the process they learned valuable new skills they can use in their careers. Oracle and other organizations sponsored the event in collaboration with UNESCO and UNEP. The areas of focus for the projects included health, education, and work -- all based on the larger list of United Nations world development goals. #hackathon​ #oracle​ #worldinnovationday\n\nJason  Lowe, Master Cloud Specialist Engineer, Oracle\nhttps://twitter.com/jlowe000\n\nJim Grisanzio, Sr. Community Manager, Oracle\nhttps://twitter.com/jimgris\n\nHackmakers\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/hackmakers/\nhttps://hackmakers.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9FhYWj0R7LtXLlTE1gZ0Jw"
