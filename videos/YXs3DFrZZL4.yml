It is almost commonplace to learn that a spacecraft hit bullseye to within a few seconds after over a decade of space travel. How do we do that? What does it entail to design and operate the trajectory of a spacecraft? Newton, Kepler, Einstein, Tsiolkovsky, Battin and many others gave us beautiful mathematical models of the universe. Beautiful, yes, but also perversely complex. \n\nWithout hope for analytical solutions, we must rely on numerical methods. Initially, numerical methods were executed by hand (people known as \"The Computers\"). Eventually we adopted electronic computers, and entered a multi-decade period of Fortran domination. \n\nOver the last decade, we have been experiencing increased adoption of C++. Organizations feel attracted to C++'s uncompromising performance, and its ability to abstract away the overwhelming complexity of spacecraft trajectory calculations. But it has not been an easy move! For example: luminaries of the field are stuck in Fortran, and current Engineering schools seldom offer any C++ education. \n\nAs advanced scientific concepts require increasingly complex spacecraft trajectories, we see a bright future for C++ in this field. But we must be proactive in attracting, accommodating, and educating the current generation of engineers and scientists.\n— \nJuan Arrieta: Nabla Zero Labs, CEO\n\nJuan holds a BSc (2002) in chemical engineering from Universidad Iberoamericana (Mexico City, Mexico) and a PhD (2007) from Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, USA), where his work focused on numerical optimization applied to spacecraft trajectory design.\n\nUpon concluding his PhD, Juan joined McKinsey & Company as an associate management consultant, where he served clients in various industries, including automotive, oil and gas, banking, and local government.\n\nIn 2009, Juan left McKinsey to pursue his life-long dream of working for NASA, and joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. From 2009 through 2012 Juan served JPL as a Navigation Engineer with the Flight Path Control Group, where his responsibilities included the design, analysis, and optimization of orbit trim maneuvers for the Cassini Spacecraft. In 2012 he transitioned roles and became a Mission Design Engineer with the Outer Planet Mission Analysis Group, where his responsibilities included the design of trajectories for NASA’s upcoming mission to Europa.\n\nIn 2016 Juan left JPL and founded Nabla Zero Labs: An independent research, development, and engineering services firm.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
