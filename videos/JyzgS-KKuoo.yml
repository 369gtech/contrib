Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nHow to Backup and Restore Your Kubernetes Cluster - Annette Clewett & Dylan Murray, Red Hat \n\nOperating Kubernetes clusters introduces many new practices, but does not change the need to be able to backup and recover your applications and data. Yet traditional methods of server backup work poorly with Kubernetes clusters. How can you make sure your cluster is protected? How can persistent data get saved in a manner so there is minimal or no corruption to the application if recovery is required?     In this session we will explore how to use open-source disaster recovery tools you can use today such as Velero and Restic. Weâ€™ll also discuss how to use the Noobaa S3 API to reliably save and store backups for all resources including snapshots housed in Rook-Ceph. To prove this is not just smoke and mirrors, we will demonstrate in a live Kubernetes cluster deleting everything in a namespace and then continue on to show complete recovery of all resources and data. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaZN"
