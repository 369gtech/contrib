description: "Shubhie Panicker & Houssein Djirden (Google Chrome Team). \n \nWe are a team in Chrome with a mission of enabling web developers to build compelling experiences on the web, where excellent UX & performance is a side-effect of using a well refined tech stack. Given the popularity of React, we are partnering with Next.js and React to bring the power of strong defaults to the React ecosystem, with the goal of providing a tooling foundation for excellent outcomes. This talk covers our journey â€“ how we are working towards this goal, a number of features landing in Next.js and what's coming down the pipeline."
