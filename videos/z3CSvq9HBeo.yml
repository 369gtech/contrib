language: English
recordingDate: 1442132295
description: "The talk will focus on building a Linux Operating System for your IoT platform, discussing some of the choices we made along the way at Ninja Blocks, issues with hardware and the quality of SDKs provided by vendors, then running through how we did software packaging and release management.\n\nWe will highlight what worked and what didnâ€™t with our approach and how it overlaps with devops choices in relation to cloud environments around deployment, packaging and containerisation, Continuous Integration/deployment systems we used, how we produced and delivered 1000s of system packages to devices, and where we were going with containerisation of services and support for third party applications.\n\nMark Wolfe was up until recently CTO of Ninja Blocks, an Internet of Things (IoT) startup based in Sydney, now he is a maker at large. He is an avid open source developer having maintained and contributed to a wide array of projects over the 15 years, mostly in and around continuous integration, automation and distributed systems.\n\nMark helps to organise the golang meetup in Melbourne, and regularly speaks at meetups around Melbourne about micro services, devops, networking, Javascript and IoT.\n\nPrior to entering the world of startups Mark was a consultant working in the Telecommunications and Government sectors.\n\nFor more on YOW!
