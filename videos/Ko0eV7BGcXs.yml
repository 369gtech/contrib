title: 'SOLID Revisited : The State of the Matter - Phil Nash - NDC TechTown 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1635864869
description: 'The SOLID principles were first grouped together by Robert Martin over two decades ago - but the principles themselves are much older. A solid basis for good design (pun intended)? Perhaps. But in recent years there has been increasing talk that they are internally redundant, too focused on OO, or just missing the mark in other ways. So are they still useful? Is it worth teaching them? Is there a better set to go by? Do we need a new acronym, perhaps referencing a different state? After a brief history, and a refresher on what the SOLID principles actually are, weâ€™ll weigh up some of the criticisms that have been levelled by others, maybe add some new ones, then look at some ideas for a way forward. Bring your opinions - let''s have a bit of a discussion, too!'
