description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nGreg Young - Independent Consultant & Entrepreneur\n\nABSTRACT\nWe are forced to solve many problems with respect to handling data. Many concepts work in our current models, many do not. Picking the wrong model can lead to massive amounts of accidental complexity. This talk will look at how to reach the point where you stop thinking about how to force your problem into your predefined thinking and how to reach a place where you focus on how to choose the right model for the problem! \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
