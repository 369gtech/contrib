title: 'The Language of Actors by Vaughn Vernon'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502440215
description: "Is the Actor Model just a new \"shiny object\" for developers to chase after, a fad soon to be abandoned? Actually the Actor Model is almost as old as the formal definition of object-oriented programming, and addresses the long-term direction of computing and software development. This talk explains why actors are so vital to the future of software development, and why actors are so exceptionally well suited for use with Domain-Driven Design. Find out how actors speak the Ubiquitous Language of your core business domain and help you reactively scale your systems to today's and tomorrow's concurrency demands. Also join my 3-hour hands-on workshop for implementation guidance on the same subject.\n\nVaughn Vernon is a software developer and architect with more than 30 years of experience in a broad range of business domains. He consults and teaches around Domain-Driven Design and reactive software development, helping teams and organizations realize the potential of business-driven and reactive systems as they transition from technology-driven legacy web implementation approaches. As he does so, he puts strong emphasis on embracing simplicity whenever possible. Vaughn is the author of three books: Implementing Domain-Driven Design, Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model, and Domain-Driven Design Distilled, all published by Addison-Wesley."
