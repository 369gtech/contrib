description: "One of the largest issues with building rich client-side applications is the inevitable sharing of logic, as well as performance issues that arise after the initial beta phase is passed. We’ve done well to choose cohesion over a separation of technology with React, and we can go a step further with building Universal Applications (also called ‘Isomorphic Applications’). Here we will discuss building universal apps with React, Redux, and Node.js. From sharing small bits of logic, to sharing the entire application runtime, we will see first how to do it, and the benefits it has for engineering, reusability, performance and SEO.\n\nEvent sponsored by Rangle http://rangle.io/ and Microsoft Canada \n\nStepan Parunashvili\nhttps://twitter.com/stopachka\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
