description: "Opaque Data Structures provide a very nice technique to structure systems and they are particularly useful within the functional programming paradigm. With the addition of maps and the opaque attribute for modules, Erlang is now perfectly suited to get the best of these structures, if you use it properly.\n\nIn this talk, Brujo will show what opaque data structures are, how to use them and why they are so useful, even more so if you're developing an open-source library. This talk will be conceptual, but it won't be 100% theoretical.\n\nBrujo will also present examples and tools that assist us in making better use of these techiques.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/brujo-benavides/"
