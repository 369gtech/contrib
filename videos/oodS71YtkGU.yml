recordingDate: 1340765927
description: "Facebook faces huge infrastructure challenges every day. It has global scale, serving more than 800 million users. It has a highly interconnected service, in which rendering a single page often involves hundreds of machines examining tens of thousands of pieces of data from dozens of different servers. And it does all this in a matter of milliseconds, day in and day out. What's more, the Facebook product team iterates very quickly, and sometimes takes big leaps forward with products like Timeline — which means Facebook's infrastructure needs to be highly flexible as well.\n\nIn this talk, Jay Parikh — who leads the Facebook infrastructure team — will share key learnings from the company's efforts to meet these challenges. Jay will delve into topics including the infra development process for products like Timeline, the innovative approach Facebook has taken to its data centers and servers, and the unique tools and team structures Facebook employs as it builds for a billion users and beyond.\n\nJay Parikh\n\nFacebook\n\nJay Parikh is the VP of Infrastructure Engineering at Facebook, where he oversees infrastructure engineering and operations.
