description: "The JSR 107 JCache—Java Temporary Caching—API was finally approved in March of this year and is likely to be part of Java EE 8. JSR 107 provides a standard API for accessing caches and in-memory data grids from Java as well as providing advanced capabilities such as on-grid processing and eventing. Attend this tutorial to get firsthand experience with the new API. The session starts with the basics of cache access and graduates to the exciting new capabilities delivered by JSR 107: on-grid parallel computation using EntryProcessors and event-driven solutions using cache events.\n\n\nAuthor:\nSteve Millidge\nSteve Millidge is the founder of the London GlassFish User Group and Technical Director at C2B2, Expert Group member for JSR 286 (Portals), JSR 347 (Data Grids) and JSR 107 (Caching).
