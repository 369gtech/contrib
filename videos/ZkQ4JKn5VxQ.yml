description: "Race conditions and intermittent failures, daylight savings time, time zones, leap seconds, overload conditions - time is a factor in many of the most annoying problems in computer systems. Data engineering is not exempt from problems caused by time, but also has a slew of unique problems. In this presentation, we will enumerate the time-related problems that we have seen cause trouble in data processing system components, including data collection, batch processing, workflow orchestration, and stream processing. We will also provide a handful of tools and tricks to avoid timing issues in data processing systems.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
