description: "Day Two Kubernetes: Tools for Operability - Bridget Kromhout & Zachary Deptawa, Microsoft \n\nArtisanally hand-crafting our own container hosting solutions can be a fun learning experience, but for repeatable production use, we want to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters in a reproducible fashion. Using open source tools like Helm, Draft, Brigade, and Terraform, we can deploy and update our Kubernetes clusters via a trusted, versioned, repeatable process. Weâ€™ll discuss what containers and Kubernetes clusters are at a high level, look into the practical application of open source tools to simplify cluster management, and show you how to deploy Kubernetes clusters in a repeatable and portable fashion. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrY7"
