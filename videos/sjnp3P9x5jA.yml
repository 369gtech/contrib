description: "http://CppCon.org\nMatthias Gehre & Gabor Horvath “Implementing the C++ Core Guidelines’ Lifetime Safety Profile in Clang”\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nThis is an experience report with talks, demos, and Q&A by the authors of the Clang-based implementation of Herb Sutter’s Lifetime safety profile for the C++ Core Guidelines, available online at cppx.godbolt.org.\n\nWe will cover the kinds of diagnoses supported by the checker and how they are implemented using Clang’s type trees and control flow graphs, including use-after-invalidation (dangling) and null-dereference compile-time diagnostics for pointers, iterators, views, and more. We will also summarize early experience with performance against real-world code bases, including compile time performance and initial analysis results from compiling LLVM sources with the checker.\n\nAlso, if you try the online compiler and have questions about why any examples are flagged or not flagged, you can bring them and ask the implementers!\n— \nMatthias Gehre, Silexica\nSenior C++ Developer\n\nMatthias maintains the Clang-based implementation of Herb Sutter’s Lifetime safety profile for the C++ Core Guidelines, available online at https://github.com/mgehre/clang and cppx.godbolt.org.\nHe is currently working as a Senior C++ Developer at Silexica. With its headquarters in Germany and offices in the US and Japan, Silexica provides development tooling that combines source code analysis with instrumentation and tracing to help understand and optimize C/C++ applications.\nMatthias got his Ph.D. in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the University of Bremen, Germany. He is involved in multiple open source projects and loves spending time on his home automation electronics.\n\nGabor Horvath, Eotvos Lorand University\nPhD Student\n\nGabor started a Ph.D. in 2016. He is a contributor to research projects related to static analysis since 2012. He is a clang contributor, participated in Google Summer of Code twice as a student and twice as a mentor, interned for Apple and Microsoft. He teaches C++ and compiler construction to undergrads at Eotvos Lorand University.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
