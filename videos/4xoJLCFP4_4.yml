recordingDate: 1621960234
description: "In this video, we’ll introduce you to the Azure SDK for Python. We’ll authenticate with Azure and integrate Azure storage, messaging, and artificial intelligence into a cloud solution. We’ll walk through a sample health care document processing scenario that uploads and extracts text from invoices and record PDF files and uploads them to Azure Blob Storage.  We’ll also have a look at install packages from both PyPI and Conda.\n\nGet the Azure SDKs: https://azure.com/sdk\nFollow @AzureSDK on Twitter: https://twitter.com/azuresdk\nAzure SDK blog: https://aka.ms/azsdk/blog"
