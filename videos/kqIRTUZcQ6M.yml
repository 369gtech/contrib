description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2019 by Elaine Dias Batista, SFEIR.\n\nMore info: http://androidmakers.fr/schedule/?sessionId=AFF-5103\n\nThe fact that \"apps\" for the Google Assistant and for Android are both available on Android smartphones can be the cause of some confusion. Do I have to go to the Play Store to download and install an \"app\" for the Google Assistant? Can I launch a Google Assistant experience from an Android app? How to integrate advanced voice recognition (NLP or other) on existing apps? What experience should I offer on my app?  In this talk I will answer these questions, do a comparison of the ecosystems and how they can work together.\n\nAlex Karp Production"
