title: 'Fluent 2012: Steve Souders, "Your Script Just Killed My Site"'
recordingDate: 1338475992
description: "Hiccup. We all get them occasionally. So does the Web. When an Internet or server hiccup causes a script, stylesheet, or font file to timeout, the result can be devastating -- the containing web page is likely to appear completely white for a minute or more. What's worse -- your monitors are unlikely to register this outage. Don't worry -- this probably won't happen to your website. Or will it?\n\nSteve Souders\n\nGoogle\n\nSteve works at Google on web performance and open source initiatives. He previously served as Chief Performance Yahoo!.
