description: "At Google I/O 2016, Timothy Jordan, host of The Developer Show, takes  a tour of the Android Experiments Sandbox with Android Developer Advocate Rich Hyndman. Android Experiments is encouraging more developers to challenge how we interact with the devices we use every day. Each experiment is submitted by the creator, and all kinds are welcomeâ€”no matter your skill level, the framework it uses or the device it runs on. \n\nSubmit your own Android experiment at https://www.androidexperiments.com/submit\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\nSubscribe to the Android Developers channel at http://goo.gl/GEh1ds"
