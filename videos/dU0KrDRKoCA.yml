description: "While Java has grown enormously over the years, the fundamentals have stagnated.\n\nThe motivation for this talk and underlying project, was the following question: why is Java, with it’s 20 years of age, and (at least)6 billion running JVM’s not a major player in the video-game development universe?\n\nTL;DR;\nSo everybody knows the Doom games, right? Every new installment brought brand new ideas, and groundbreaking graphics. But more importantly, they brought the source code of the prior installment to the public eye.\n\nNaturally people have played and hacked the code to oblivion, as much as they played the games themselves. And I have the honor to be one of those people.\n\nI (naively) endeavored to port the Doom 3 C++ code to our fantabulous Java. In doing so, I hoped to learn, among other things, more about 3D graphics. ...what I didn't expect though, was for djoom3(cool name huh!) to teach me more about Java!?\n\nAside from the basic game development intro, this talk focuses on the following:\n\nSome areas where Java should learn from it's nemesis, C++\nOther areas where the student(Java) becomes the master(C++)\nAnd some promises that were made, but never kept"
