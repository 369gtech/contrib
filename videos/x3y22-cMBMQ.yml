description: "This video was recorded at a pre-conference meet-up of Lambda Days, which took place on 4th February 2021 - https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2021/#free-meetup\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nDependent Types - salvation or plague\nrun by\nJohn Hughes with Stephanie Weirich, Edwin Brady, Adam Chlipala and Thorsten Altenkirch\nintroduced by Michał Ślaski\n\nABSTRACT\nDoes the future belong to dependent types… or not? Are they a cute toy, or the Next Big Thing? Should you be planning to use them in your next project (or the next but ten), and if so, where and how should you start? What are the swings and roundabouts you should be aware of? Our panelists are leading the adoption of dependent types in a variety of programming languages, and have deep insights into how they scale in practice. Join us to learn if dependent types will be a part of your future!\n\nNeed a refresher? We’ll be starting at the beginning, but we will be going fast—if you’d like to prepare a little in advance, I recommend watching Thorsten Altenkirch’s video “The power of Π” (from last year’s Lambda Days): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zT5eVHpQwA\n\n---\n\nTHE HOST - John Hughes\n\nJohn Hughes has been a functional programming enthusiast for more than thirty years, at the Universities of Oxford, Glasgow, and since 1992 Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden. He served on the Haskell design committee, co-chairing the committee for Haskell 98, and is the author of more than 100 papers, including \"Why Functional Programming Matters\", one of the classics of the area. With Koen Claessen, he created QuickCheck, the most popular testing tool among Haskell programmers, and in 2006 he founded Quviq to commercialise the technology using Erlang. In 2018 he became an ACM Fellow.\n\nTHE PANELISTS\nAdam Chlipala - Associate Professor of Computer Science, MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab\nEdwin Brady - Creator of the Idris programming language, University of St Andrews\nNiki Vazou - Research Assistant Professor, IMDEA\nStephanie Weirich - Professor of Computer Science, University of Pennsylvania\nThorsten Altenkirch - Professor of Computer Science, University of Nottingham\n\n---\n\nLambda Days\nWebsite: https://www.lambdadays.org\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LambdaDays"
