recordingDate: 1452289356
description: 'Learn how one of the most risk conscious and regulated industries implements Continuous Delivery. The Financial Services industry is subject to more restrictions, regulations and constraints that most other industries, within that context, examining the maturing Continuous Delivery model at ETRADE may yield insights to those facing similar challenges and will offer a new point of view to those working in areas with less rigid restrictions: If we can do it, you can too! Industry regulations, large legacy systems and even a business culture of risk minimization are not anathema to the advancement of Continuous Delivery practices. This talk will focus on four specific areas: (1) Configuration Management, (2) Change Propagation, (3) Software Engineering disciplines and (4) Automation. Specific processes and tools are examined in each of those four areas. During the last area (Automation) ElectricCommader patterns developed at ETRADE will be showcased. These patterns have helped speed up the build, test and deploy cycle at ETRADE by 1,200 %.'
