description: "Code is Here: http://goo.gl/TqrMI\n\nBest Design Patterns Book : http://goo.gl/W0wyie\n\nHere is my Strategy design patterns tutorial. You use this pattern if you need to dynamically change an algorithm used by an object at run time. Don't worry, just watch the video and you'll get it.\n\nThe pattern also allows you to eliminate code duplication. It separates behavior from super and subclasses. It is a super design pattern and is often the first one taught."
