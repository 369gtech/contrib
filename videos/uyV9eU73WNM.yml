We can, but we will not get a real-time game. Can we use WebSockets / TCP? Of course, we can and we should! However, developing API on top of WebSocket is another challenge that no one wants to solve, but everyone does. Existing libraries do not give us a required variety of communication models. Today we will show you the way to tackle this â€“ using RSocket. RSocket is an application protocol that makes developing any networked application as easy as pie. To prove that, we are going to build a multiplayer Pac-Man, and during the process compare different ways of making a multiplayer game."
