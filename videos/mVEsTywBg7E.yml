description: "Lightning Talk: Monitoring Kubernetes with BPF and Prometheus - Jonathan Perry, Flowtune \n\nKubernetes has made it incredibly easy to build distributed applications out of large numbers of microservices. But monitoring, or even accurately tracking, the interaction between each of these services can be a challenge.  In this talk, we will explain how BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) can be used to monitor your Kubernetes cluster and its services without any per-service code changes or instrumentation. Specifically, weâ€™ll show you how network flows between pods gathered with BPF and captured with Prometheus can be used to visualize service dependencies and identify issues in your distributed applications. \n\nTo learn more: https://sched.co/GrV7"
