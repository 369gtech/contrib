title: 'Offline First Applications In React Native Done Well'
language: English
recordingDate: 1515821705
description: "This talk will present the concepts of Offline first applications, Optimistic UI Updates, “Transaction management” in redux. Humanly speaking, I will explain how your app should behave in our always kinda connected world (kinda, because you loose the network in the Subway, in your bathroom or in the elevator) to avoid frustrating your users, let them use your application even when they don’t have network and access data loaded in a previous session when they need it most (you know, when you have 1% battery left and turned on Airplane mode to keep your phone going just for the time to come home or find a plug somewhere). I will present some code examples of using awesome libraries to do that easily and talk about the local storage alternatives (AsyncStorage, SQLite and Realm) available to React Native.\n\nEVENT:\n\nReact Native EU 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAdrien Thiery\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nReact Native EU Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7u4sgRF9-k"
