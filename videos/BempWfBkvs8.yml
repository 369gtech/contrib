description: "Holden Karau\n\nhttp://lca2018.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/36/\n\nThe first external person contributing to our project is amazing, but when that 1 snowballs to 1,000 life can get a little bit stressful. All of these fine lovely people want to help, but somehow no one seems to want to help you deal with all of the code reviews, proposed documentation changes, or keeping your testing infrastructure alive (or three people want to help in different directions).\r\n\r\nThis talk explores what happens as a community grows using the speakers experience in her own personal projects (which have much less than 1k contributors) as well as larger projects, like Apache Spark.\r\n\r\nCome for the being told its not your fault, stay for the techniques to avoid pissing everyone off.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nIf the speaker is behind on reviewing one of your pull requests she is very sorry and would like to offer you a sticker and hope this talk explains some of why she is late.\n\nThis talk was given at Linux.conf.au 2018 (LCA2018) which was held on 22-26 January 2018 in Sydney Australia.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
