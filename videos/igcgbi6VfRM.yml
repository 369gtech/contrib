description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nKubernetes SIG Architecture Intro and Update - Derek Carr, Red Hat & Davanum Srinivas, VMware \n\nSIG Architecture maintains and evolves the design principles of Kubernetes, and provides a consistent body of expertise necessary to ensure architectural consistency over time. The SIG takes care of evolution of conformance definitions, API definitions/conventions, deprecation policy, design principles, and other cross-cutting concerns.  In this talk, we will provide an introduction to SIG architecture, including its role and the various subprojects that support its activities. Additionally, we will provide a community update on the status of those efforts.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeyZ"
