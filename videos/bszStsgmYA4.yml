recordingDate: 1475227161
description: 'GORM has evolved far beyond its original humble beginnings as a set of metaprogramming routines ontop of Hibernate. Now providing support for MongoDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, Redis as well as Hibernate, GORM is the complete persistence solution. This session will cover some of the inner workings of GORM and help increase understanding of the project as a whole.'
