description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch,  5 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\"A revolutionary charity.\" -- Oprah Winfrey\n\n\"This new philanthropy system is turning traditional philanthropy on its head.\" -- ABC World News Tonight\n\n\"I encourage everybody to go on and make donations...let's make a difference.\" -- Stephen Colbert\n\n\"The results are powerful.\" -- BusinessWeek\n\n\"I think the capacity to expand is infinite.\" -- Bill Clinton\n\nDonorsChoose.org's Founder and CTO will introduce the org, and discuss this example of real micro-philanthropy in action through the lens of the site's transactional data, usage trends, web marketing, user generated content, and underlying technologies.\n\nMore about DonorsChoose.org: Founded in 2000 by a young public high school teacher in the Bronx, citizen philanthropists from all 50 states and 10 countries have already funded more than 45,000 public school classroom projects at DonorsChoose.org, channeling over $19 million of resources to students in low-income communities. At DonorsChoose.org, someone giving $10 enjoys the same choice, impact, and vivid feedback that-until now-have been reserved for millionaire benefactors. Recognition of DonorsChoose.org includes the Nonprofit Innovation Award given by Stanford Business School and Amazon.com; the Fast Company Social Capitalist Award; a Global Technology Laureate from the TECH Museum of Innovation; and selection by Ashoka. Major supporters include eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, Yahoo! co-founder David Filo, venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, and Netflix founder Reed Hastings.\n\nSpeaker: Charles Best\nCEO & Founder of DonorsChoose\n\nCharles Best founded DonorsChoose.org at Wings Academy, a public high school in the Bronx where he was a social studies teacher for five years. He thought up DonorsChoose.org during a lunch conversation with colleagues, and his students volunteered to help start the organization. To entice his fellow teachers to try out the new website, Charles offered them his mother's famous pear dessert. DonorsChoose.org has been growing since.\n\nSpeaker: Oliver Hurst-Hiller\nCTO DonorsChoose\n\nOliver leads the DonorsChoose.org engineering team and is responsible for the technology systems that power DonorsChoose.org's unique philanthropic marketplace.
