description: "Presented by Ben Greenberg, Developer Advocate, Nexmo\n\n\"A coding education that not only incorporates Git into its education but forms its educational program around Git produces more resilient and more capable developers who can enter a business landscape and grapple with complex challenges. How does structuring an educational program around Git accomplish that?\n\nAs a former technical coach at the Flatiron School I have helped numerous emerging programmers learn the fundamentals of software development and, more importantly, grapple with breaking a problem down into its smallest parts and have done so through using a \"Git approach\". This not only teaches good version control but cultivates a genuine trouble shooting mindset that can tackle multifaceted problems and issues, both in the code and in the logic underlying a program. Come and discover how Git is not only the premier version control software but is also a powerful educational tool.\"\n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels. Git Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and to showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from contributors, maintainers and community managers around the world.
