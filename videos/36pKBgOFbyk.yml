description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\ncontainerd Introduction and Deep Dive - Phil Estes, Amazon; Maksym Pavlenko & Derek McGowan, Apple; Mike Brown, IBM\n\nJoin containerd maintainers for an introduction and deep dive into the latest updates on containerd. This last year has seen tremendous growth in both project usage and contribution. From end user CLI to low level runtime implementations, there have been exciting developments and proposals toward making containerd more stable and shaping the next generation of container use cases. The maintainers will go over internal changes to containerd which help make the core project interfaces cleaner and easier to integrate with from different components and plugins. For Kubernetes use cases, we will cover related changes happening in containerd including updates in the CRI implementation. Finally, the maintainers will cover exciting new features and sub-projects such as nerdctl, lazy-pulling (stargz), shim plugability, and more."
