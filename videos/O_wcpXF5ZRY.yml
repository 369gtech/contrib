description: "This tutorial walks you through building and booting the simplest possible Linux system, first under QEMU and then on real hardware. We cover kernel configuration and building, native vs cross compiling, initramfs creation (and other root filesystem options), installing and booting, the init process and system bringup, running an app, adding an example server (sshd), and finally we'll add a native toolchain to compile \"hello world\" on the target.\n\nTalk from Rob Landley, se-instruments.com. Talk given at the Embedded Linux Conference.\n\nThis talk is under the creative commons license. freeCodeCamp is not associated with this talk.
