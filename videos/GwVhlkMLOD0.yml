You are now an API call away from being in control of your money! In this session, Julien will create a voice-controlled bot that will allow Google or Alexa to send money to friends!\n\nAfter a short introduction to the PSD2 landscape and how voice assistants work, we will dive head-first into my IDE and create a bot together.\n\nAt the end of this talk you will:\n- Understand PSD2, and why it is interesting for you as customers.\n- Be able to create a simple voice assistant application.\n- Have your fingers itching to try more at home :)"
