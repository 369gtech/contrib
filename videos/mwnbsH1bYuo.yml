description: "Matias Bj√∏rling, Western Digital\n\nOpen-Channel Solid State Drive architectures are adopted rapidly by hyper-scales, all-flash array vendors, and large storage system vendors. The versatile storage interface admits solid state drive to expose essential knobs to control latency, I/O predictability, and I/O isolation. The rapid adoption has created a diverse set of different Open-Channel SSD drive specs that each solves the need of a single or few users. However, the specifications are yet to be standardized.\n\nThe Zoned Namespaces (ZNS) Technical Proposal in the NVMe workgroup is developing an industry standardization for these types of interfaces. Creating a foundation on which we can build a robust software eco-system on top and streamline implementation efforts.\n\nThis talk covers the motivation, characteristics of Zoned Namespaces, possible software improvements, and early results to show off the effectiveness of these types of drives.\n\nView the full Vault '19 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/vault19/program"
