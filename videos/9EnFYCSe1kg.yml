description: "A GIF-filled enthusiastic presentation of all things creative. Gavin plots his creative journey through his time in the design and film industry, picking it apart and extracting the lessons and learnings from it all. He’ll also move around quite vigorously and gesticulate wildly the whole time. It’s loud, silly and hopefully energizing. He wants to get you excited to make more of the stuff that makes your heart sing.\n\nGavin Strange\njam-factory.com\nhttps://twitter.com/jamfactory\nhttps://twitter.com/boikzmoind\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttps://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at https://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description"
