description: "Design systems are a popular way for teams to flavor their design and development workflow. However, an often-missing ingredient in many design systems is a focus on accessibility best practices — especially when component libraries are involved. In this talk, we’ll take a look at how you can mix some commonly-used React components with the ingredients of accessibility. Pair this with best practices guidance in your documentation, and you’ll have the recipe for a delectably inclusive design system.\n\nAbout:\nKathleen McMahon, Senior Frontend Engineer - O'Reilly Media\n\nKathleen works at O’Reilly Media as a Senior Frontend Engineer, where she leads the accessibility initiative for the O’Reilly Design System.
