description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nDariusz Kuc - Principal Software Engineer and Top-rated Kotlin Speaker\n\nABSTRACT\nGraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. In the GraphQL world, the schema plays a central role as it defines all the fields and types that can be queried by the clients. This makes GraphQL APIs extremely powerful as clients use this information to custom tailor their queries to only ask for the data they need.\nKotlin strong types and null safety makes it an excellent choice for implementing GraphQL schemas.\nIn this talk I'll show you how graphql-kotlin can transform this potentially tedious schema generation process into a breeze. With code-only, or resolver-first, approach graphql-kotlin generates schemas directly from the source code making it the single source of truth for defining your GraphQL APIs. Using this approach, your Kotlin classes, properties and functions are mapped to corresponding GraphQL types and fields. Furthermore, since the GraphQL queries are resolved by invoking underlying Kotlin functions we can also utilize the power of Kotlin coroutines to asynchronously process all of our requests!\nLearn how to utilize the power of Spring Boot together with graphql-kotlin to easily [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:51 Spring Boot\n01:22 GraphQL\n01:51 Kotlin\n02:51 graphql-kotlin\n03:34 Demo - live coding\n17:57 Conclusion\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1256/bootiful-graphql-with-kotlin\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Kotlin #GraphQL #Programming #APIs #Frontend #Backend #SpringBoot #GraphQLKotlin #LiveCoding\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
