description: "Darren Chan\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/137/\nHave you ever felt annoyed looking at a document or website because it was \r\ndifficult to find the information you wanted? Thereâ€™s a good chance that poor \r\ninformation architecture was to blame. \r\n\r\nInformation architecture is the art and science of organizing and structuring\r\ncontent. I will talk about why information architecture is important, factors \r\nthat result in bad information architecture, and resources to further understand\r\nand apply information architecture to your content."
