description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThe BDE libraries, https://github.com/bloomberg/bde, provide a wide range of \nuseful functionality and also showcase the design and testing principles long \nadvocated by John Lakos (see Lakos '96, CppCpon 201[456]): \nFine-grained, hierarchical reusable (physical) components \nFocused component purposes based on well-defined class categories. \nUse of library facilities to implement effective Defensive Programming. \nUbiquitous support for a user-supplied memory--allocation mechanisms. \nDesign by (appropriately narrow) contracts. \nAfter an outline of the functionality provided (e.g., date/time classes, \nlogging), this talk recaps the above Lakosian ideas, and shows, through BDE \ndocumentation and code examples, how the ideas above influence the use of BDE libraries in applications.\n— \nSteven Breitstein\nEngineer, Bloomberg LP\nProfessional Experience | Bloomberg, 10 years | Bell Labs, 20 years | Education | Graduate: M.I.T. | Undergraduate: City College of New York\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
