title: 'Roman Yurchak- Pyodide Scientific Python Compiled to Webassembly Optimized| PyData Global 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609866572
description: "Talk \nThe Pyodide project compiles the scientific Python stack to WebAssembly, so that it can be run in the browser. It supports data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, parts of scipy and scikit-learn. In this talk I will outline the current capabilities and existing challenges. I will then illustrate how to use pyodide to run ML models in the browser and compare it with other existing approaches.\n\nSpeaker\nRoman Yurchak has a background in computational physics, and is currently working as data scientist at Symerio. He is also an open source contributor and scikit-learn core developer.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
