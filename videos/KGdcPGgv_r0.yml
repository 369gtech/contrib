recordingDate: 1525344949
description: "Held on April 23 2018\n\nOracle Database with Sharding is a globally distributed multi-model (relational & document) cloud-native (and on-premises) DBMS. It is built on shared-nothing architecture where data is horizontally partitioned across databases that share no hardware or software. It provides linear scalability, fault isolation and geographic data distribution for shard-amenable applications. Sharding does all this while rendering strong consistency, full power of SQL, and the Oracle Database ecosystem. In this session, Nagesh Battula, Product Manager, shows how to deploy a sharded DB and elastically scale your transactions, database capacity and concurrent users.\n\n1.52 – Introduction to Oracle Sharding\n4:08 – Benefits of Sharding\n6:28 – Architecture and Key Features \n21:02 – Data Modeling and Application Considerations for a Sharded Database (SDB)\n29.51 -  Sharded Schema Creation\n36:14 – Direct Routing against an SDB\n41:23 – Proxy Routing for reporting workload\n48:35 – Results of Oracle Sharding Scalability Characterization study\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit\n\n\nmusic: bensound.com"
