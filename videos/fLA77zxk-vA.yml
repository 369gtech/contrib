description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nJune 14, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis paper presents a significant new way of networking and data handling globally. This data centric network is likely to revolutionise the IT industry in a very positive fashion. Index Terms—security, freedom, privacy, DHT, encryption\r\nIntroduction This paper describes a method of distributing information in a controlled non-owned grid.\r\n\r\nThe main elements of the system are:\r\n- anonymous or self authentication\r\n- self healing network (perpetual data)\r\n- globally distributed Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)\r\n- self encryption\r\n- duplicate prevention (rather than data de-duplication)\r\n\r\nThe Problems Addressed by this Paper\r\n- Privacy of network individuals\r\n- Anonymity of browsing and using digital resources\r\n- Security of data (both retention and theft prevention)\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nTaking computers and linking them in a way in which everyone benefits and does not\r\nnecessarily have to pay any price would be seen as not only acceptable but as a significant benefit. To allow people to add data, whatever it may be, and be assured that their data is secure and perpetual for as long as they want it is not possible today with any reality (as we see from the data loss stories so prevalent in the media).\r\n\r\nWe will discuss in particular:\r\n- privacy of network individuals\r\n- anonymity of browsing and using digital resources\r\n- security of data (both retention and theft prevention)\r\nBy using some of the this space to store authentication records created by the users themselves, we could allow self-authentication. By allowing self-authentication, people would be free of corporate controls or risks regarding their data protection. This could be achieved by users placing random data only they know the name of and password protecting that data for later re-validation. People would prefer to be in control of their own digital assets and not to leave this to corporations. Interestingly in this design any disk space you donate or are required to provide to the network will not store your data. Therefore\r\nyou give up space for backup and the network stores none of your data in that space. In the maidsafe network, the network will self-heal, perform data de-duplication and duplicate prevention. Data will move around the network to reduce bandwidth usage, remove defunct hardware from the network and also to reduce any load on individual nodes. Also in this network and perhaps one of the most important facts is that a truly distributed PKI network will be created, enabling people to validate who they are and who they are communicating with.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: David Irvine\r\nDavid Irvine is a Scottish Engineer and innovator who has spent the last 12 years researching ways to make computers function in a better way. Inventor listed on 11 patent submissions and designer of one of the world's largest private networks as well as consultant to many large corporations, he is an experienced project manager. With too much time to work, he rarely stops working on algorithms and problems. He also enjoys sailing (lives on a yacht) and is a keen lifeboat crew/helm who can be sure to take\r\non the worst weather to help others.\r\n\r\nSlides for this talk are available at http://groups.google.com/group/seattle-scalability-conference"
