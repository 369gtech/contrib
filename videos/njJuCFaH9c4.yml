description: "TestCon Vilnius 2016. Software Testing & QA Conference. \nOctober 21, 2016 | www.testcon.lt\n\nGamification and board games are two emergent trends. Both appeal to the human curiousity to explore and discover. Testing is also about exploring and discovering so the game is an excellent medium to learn testing skills.\n\nIn this speech, Nicholas would like to describe how games can be used in the testing community, using three concrete examples that have been successfully applied at SQS.\n\n– Find the Bug! lets the players analyze a system, identify risk areas and literally find the bug.\n– Find the Bug – Agile! lets the players practice test-driven development by creating test cases and execute them.\n– SQS Test Lead School lets the players take on the roles of test leads and be rewarded based on how well they plan their work and responds to challenges."
