description: "Wayne Piekarski introduces Messaging on Android Auto. Google and Android Auto enable you to extend your existing messaging applications for use in the car, with a voice controlled interface. Android Auto takes care of all the hard parts of speech recognition for you; you just need to add a few lines of code to your app, and +WaynePiekarski shows you how in this DevByte. With messaging for Android Auto, you can extend apps to the car in a way thats more efficient for the driver. So drivers can stay connected, but with their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road.\n\nAndroid Auto Messaging documentation: http://developer.android.com/training/auto/messaging/index.html\nCode sample: http://developer.android.com/samples/MessagingService/project.html\nG+ Community: http://g.co/androidautodev\nWayne Piekarski: http://google.com/+WaynePiekarski"
