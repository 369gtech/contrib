title: 'Velocity 2013: Jonathan LeBlanc, "Optimizing Development Efficiency Through API Design"'
recordingDate: 1371762076
description: "http://velocityconf.com\nBuilding an efficient and scalable API design can mean the life or death of your developer community. While technical efficiency is a key factor in proper optimization, following a pragmatist approach to specification implementation and security can lead your API design down a path to certain doom. Without taking into account the developer community, or how to design to help the developers implementing your products, you will have a secure, highly optimized API that no one wants to use.\n\nThis is the path that the PayPal Developer APIs took as they were rebuilt from the ground up. The needs of the developer community become the primary focus to redesigning our systems, going from a monolithic, harrowing design to one that is streamlined for developer integration. Through these practical experiences, we will look at how to build your APIs around a developer focused design.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by PayPal\n\nhttp://velocityconf.com/velocity2013/public/schedule/speaker/74565"
