title: 'Tanzu Tuesdays - The Practical Architect With Nate Schutta'
language: English
recordingDate: 1588180376
description: "Rich Hickey once said programmers know the benefits of everything and the trade offs of nothing…an approach that can lead a project down a path of frustrated developers and unhappy customers. As architects though, we must consider the trade offs of every new library, language, pattern or approach and quickly make decisions often with incomplete information. How should we think about the inevitable technology choices we have to make on a project? How do we balance competing agendas? How do we keep our team happy and excited without chasing every new thing that someone finds on the inner webs?\n\nAs architects it is our responsibility to effectively guide our teams on the technology journey. In this talk I will outline the importance of trade offs, how we can analyze new technologies and how we can effectively capture the inevitable architectural decisions we will make. I will also explore the value of fitness functions as a way of ensuring the decisions we make are actually reflected in the code base.\n\nGuests:\n\nNathaniel T. Schutta is a software architect focused on cloud computing and building usable applications. A proponent of polyglot programming, Nate has written multiple books and appeared in various videos. Nate is a seasoned speaker regularly presenting at conferences worldwide, No Fluff Just Stuff symposia, meetups, universities, and user groups. In addition to his day job, Nate is an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota where he teaches students to embrace (and evaluate) technical change. Driven to rid the world of bad presentations, Nate coauthored the book Presentation Patterns with Neal Ford and Matthew McCullough. Nate recently published Thinking Architecturally available as a free download from VMware.\n\nHosts:\n\nBob Brindley\n\nBob travels the world spreading the good word according to Tanzu and Spring to any and all that will hear.\n\nHe has been a developer advocate for 5 years and still smells terrific.\n\n\n \nTiffany Jernigan\n\nTiffany is a senior developer advocate at VMware and is focused on the realm of Kubernetes. She mostly recently was working as a software developer and developer advocate (nerd whisperer) for containers at Amazon. She also formerly worked at Docker and Intel. Prior to that, she graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in electrical engineering. In her free time she likes to spend time with her fiancé, family, and friends as well as dabble in photography. You can find her on twitter @tiffanyfayj.\n\n\n \nPaul Czarkowski\n\nPaul Czarkowski is a long time practitioner of the dark arts of DevOps. Hailing from Australia he moved to Austin Texas to help build and run one of the largest and most successful online games. Now at VMWare, Paul works to improve the Operator experience by taking Cloud Native software development concepts and applying them to Operations to create platforms that reduce toil and improve software delivery."
