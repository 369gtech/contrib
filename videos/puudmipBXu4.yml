recordingDate: 1546423849
description: "It is exciting to imagine a programming world where boundaries between different programming languages would stop existing, and GraalVM polyglotism feature helps us to cross them. But does it come with a cost? Will we be actually able to create seamless applications, choosing the best programming language for each of our tasks, without the overhead? Together, we try to answer these questions and look at some cases.\n\nMilda started her career with Python, working in couple Vilnius-based startups, but quickly moved to Scala and NodeJS. Currently working in Wix.com - company that creates a leading web development platform.\nShe is interested in quality code, test-driven development, and coding as a form of self expression.\n\nJava.IL - the Israeli Java Community:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/JavaIL"
