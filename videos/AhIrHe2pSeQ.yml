title: 'YOW! Connected 2017 Shipra Mahindra / Jeames Bone - Internationalisation 101'
recordingDate: 1510714800
description: "id you know that less than 30% of the internet population speaks English? And this percentage is slowly decreasing as cheaper smartphones become ubiquitous and new users from Brazil, Russia, India and China come online everyday. If you want to reach this global market, it is important to translate your mobile apps into your user's native language. This is why Canva decided to build a localised app from the get go.\nIn this talk, we will present a quick introduction to internationalisation and the key things to consider when localising your mobile app. You will learn about the various tools available to enable translations at scale and how those integrate with your app. You will also get some hands-on, practical information about the unique development challenges presented by languages that have different pluralisation rules to English and languages that are written from right-to-left. We will show some examples of our internationalisation approach in our iOS app. Lastly, we will wrap up with how this fits into our Feature development and Release process. Expect lots of practical advice that will help you get started on localising your own mobile app.\n\nAs a Product Manager for Canvaâ€™s mobile products, Shipra has helped to reach more than half a million monthly active users on the iPhone app. As part of her role, she work closely with the founders and the mobile team to realise the best app offering, to ship continuous value to our users and grow the active user base. Having completed an MBA at UNSW and having experience as a software developer allows me to effectively bridge the gap between business goals, user needs and, engineering deliverables.\n\nJeames Bone. iOS Engineer, sock wearer, and lover of podcasts. By day, Jeames is creating amazing design experiences for mobile apps at Canva.
