description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nThe ABI (Application Binary Interface) has a huge impact on C++ libraries. But what does that mean concretely?\n\nThis talk will explain what we mean by the ABI in the context of C++. Starting from the ground up and focusing on the Itanium C++ ABI specification, we will understand what is part of the ABI and how changes in your C++ source code can result in changes to the ABI. We will also cover what ABI stability means, what use cases ABI stability enables, and what some of the costs of maintaining ABI stability are.\n\nKeeping the point of view of a library implementer, we will see how one can control what is part of a library's ABI, using both standard and non-standard techniques like attributes. Finally, we will also see some tools that can be used to inspect parts of the ABI of a built program and detect changes to it.\n— \nLouis Dionne\nApple\nC++ Standard Library Engineer\nQuebec, Canada\n\nLouis is a math and computer science enthusiast who got swallowed by the C++ monster when he was a naive, unsuspecting student. He now works for Apple, where he is responsible for libc++, the Standard Library shipped with LLVM/Clang. He is a member of the C++ Standards Committee and of the Boost community, where he authored the Boost.Hana metaprogramming library.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
