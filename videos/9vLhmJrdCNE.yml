title: 'There''s so much more to Ratpack than non-blocking  (Marcin Erdmann)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1459618544
description: "A lot has been already said about the biggest strength of Ratpack which is that it makes writing non-blocking and thus highly performant and resource-efficient web applications easy. In this talk I will totally ignore that part of Ratpack and explain what I believe to be the features that make the day to day life of a developer more pleasant and productive.\n\nWe will look into: • testability of Ratpack apps • usefulness of the toolkit when testing other applications • configuration mechanism and its extensibility • deploying into the cloud • development time reloading • parsers, renderers and services • the built in http client • http session implementation • the \"integrate over abstract\" strategy"
