description: "Video with transcript included: http://bit.ly/2pQqudQ\n\nYuri Shkuro presents a methodology that uses data mining to learn the typical behavior of the system from massive amounts of distributed traces, compares it with pathological behavior during outages, and uses complexity reduction and intuitive visualizations to guide the user towards actionable insights about the root cause of the outages.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon New York 2019: http://bit.ly/2KFk7SO\n\nThe next QCon is Qcon San Francisco 2019 – Nov 11-13, 2019: http://bit.ly/2ZFJW9S \n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQ’s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#Uber #DistributedTracing #Microservices"
