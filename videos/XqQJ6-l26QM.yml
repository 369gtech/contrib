More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nMany modern apps need to make 10s or even 100s or network calls just to populate the home screen. And they'll likely be calling multiple different APIs, all requiring different authentication methods, JSON parsing and aggregation. Not only does this increase battery drain and frustration for users on slow and unreliable networks, it places a huge burden on the developer that isn't easy to update or iterate on quickly. \n\nTim looks at the Backend for Frontend pattern and how we can leverage Swift in both our iOS applications and server applications to share code and make development faster. He shows clear examples of how BFFs can dramatically simplify your networking code and how a BFF in Swift can help you develop iOS applications quicker by reducing context switching and being able to share code."
