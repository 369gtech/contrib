description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\nThis is for everybody who needs masterfully and visually communicate important messages, enhance meetings, project works and the creation of strategies. If you need to provide overview and shared understanding for teams and groups in all sizes, collaborate purposefully, communicate effectively and navigate in complexity. It will be hands-on talk or workshop which means that I will make everybody to draw with me. I encourage the participants to draw and use simpler drawing techniques in professional life. Additionally, we learn to piece the drawings together in strategic contexts, how a picture can support important texts and how to create complete visuals- the templates. For that I use Chaordic Stepping Stones ( the Dee Hock chaos and order theory for leading and managing changes)"
