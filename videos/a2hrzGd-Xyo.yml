description: "“I don’t deserve this; I’m just lucky. I shouldn’t bother; others are better. It’s only a matter of time before they figure out I don’t belong.” Sounds like you? “Imposter syndrome” is a common phenomenon among countless professionals.\n\nSpeaker: Neha Batra, Pivotal \n\nImposter Syndrome is the psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments, or when you're trying to \"fake it 'til you make it\" but you've already made it.\n\nIt is amazing how common this phenomenon is in the tech industry (and many others) and how little it is discussed, especially with respect to actionable advice for our own imposter syndromes and how to improve our environments for others.\n\nAs someone who experiences imposter syndrome on a regular basis, this talk shares one perspective of what imposter syndrome looks and sounds like and what someone can do about it. More specifically, we'll explore how to rewire your thinking so that what you feel (like an imposter) and what you do (things people never think they're capable of) don’t affect each other. This process, inspired by cognitive behavioral therapy, gets broken down into a 6 step process:\n1) Recognize\n2) Separate\n3) Analyze\n4) Rewire\n5) Do it\n6) Reflect\n\nWe also discusses how to promote an open environment both at work and in other settings by improving: initiative, availability, and support. If you're looking for examples on how people attack their own imposter syndrome and enable others in the same shoes, this is a great beginner talk."
