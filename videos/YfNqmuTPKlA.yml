description: "In the Developer Keynote, Jason Titus, VP of Engineering at Google talked about the influence of Google Developer Groups, and all the latest developer updates across Google. \n\nThe Android Developer platform continues to evolve for all users. From making apps smaller to reach a broader, more global audience, to adding AI powered predictive features, such as Actions / Slices to Android P. The Android platform continues to show strong growth with an expanding user base. The Google Assistant team is adding even more ways to keep users engaged on the Assistant and is helping developers create more intuitive Actions. Announcements from the Chrome team include additional browser support for Service Worker, tools such as Lighthouse 3.0 to help you improve your site speed, and Chrome OS can now run Linux apps. Designing with everyone in mind across our developer platforms remains a key aspect for Google Design. Check out all the Material Design updates, including new theming and tools for easier customization. Google Cloud unveiled its next generation TPU, ML comes to mobile development with a new SDK, and Firebase now gets the ML kit built into its platform. To increase the AR experience, we have rolled out new updates with the release of ARCore 1.2. Learn about the latest from Google AR including Augmented Images, which bring images to life just by pointing your phone at them, and Cloud Anchors, which lets you share your real world AR experience on the cloud with multiple Android or iOS  users at the same time.
