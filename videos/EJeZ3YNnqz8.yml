title: 'implementing authorization in web applications and APIs - Dominick Baier & Brock Allen'

recordingDate: 1499244426
description: "Authentication is easy – authorization is the hard part. This might sound daunting, but since every application is different, there is no single recipe for how authorization has to work.\n\nDominick & Brock walk you through a couple of approaches and pitfalls and use the new ASP.NET Core authorization API (which has been back-ported to standard .NET) as an example of a decent abstraction layer for clean authorization for your applications. But we will also learn that that regardless of your approach, there is no one size that fits all – that’s why it important to understand your options."
