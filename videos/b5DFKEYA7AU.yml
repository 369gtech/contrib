description: "Speaker: Daniel Bovensiepen, Senior Research Scientist, Siemens\n\nWhat would you do if you end up in a Wheelchair after an accident and you are not satisfied with the feature-set of the chair? You could buy a better one... Or you put Ruby on it and add the features you are missing.

Let's put Ruby on a Wheelchair!\n\nSpeaker's Bio\n\nDaniel is a research scientist in the field of industrial automation and manufacturing. He empowers Ruby in areas nobody has seen it before.
