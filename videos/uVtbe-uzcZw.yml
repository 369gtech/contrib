description: "Marcus Hirt, Consulting Member of Technical Staff, Oracle\n\nMission Control is now part of the OpenJDK, so it is now possible to contribute to its development and add all those features youâ€™ve been wanting for so long. This session discusses how to download the source and build and get started doing Mission Control development. It also addresses the different locations for downloading official development builds and releases, where to discuss changes, and how to go about producing patches. You will also get a brief overview of the various bundles available and will see a standalone example of extending the core bundles in Mission Control with new headless automated analysis capabilities."
