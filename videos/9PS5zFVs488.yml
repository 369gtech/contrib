description: "Google TechTalks\nMarch 1, 2006\n\nPhilip Rosedale and Cory Ondrejka\n\nABSTRACT\nLinden Lab is the producer of Second Life, an online world with a growing population of subscribers (or \"residents\"); currently, the community has well over 140,000 residents from 91 countries. By providing residents with robust building and scripting tools, Linden Lab enables them to create a vast array of in-world objects, installations and programs. Since its early stages, Linden Lab has allowed its residents to retain full IP rights over their own creations, thereby insuring that their contributions to the community remain truly their own."
