description: 'Machine Learning is easy; solving problems with machine learning is hard. In the last 10 years, I approached dozens of real-world problems with machine learning and deep learning, with varying degrees of success. In the process I made many mistakes and eventually learned how to avoid them. I noticed that many of these mistakes are pretty common among novice practitioners, so this talk might save you some time.'
