description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nPresenter: Mark Pollack\nBig Data Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-xd-today-and-tomorrow\nIn this talk we will cover the major new features added to Spring XD since last year as well as upcoming changes for the next major version. Key integrations driven by the Big Data ecosystem at large such as Kafka, Spark, functional programming, integration with Python, and designer/monitoring UIs will be introduced and demonstrated. The next major version of XD will shift to a foundation based on Cloud-Native architectural principles, where each individual module will be a standalone executable message-based microservice application based on Spring Boot. This allows us to more easily take advantage of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud functionality as well as map more natively onto runtime environments such as YARN, Lattice and Cloud Foundry."
