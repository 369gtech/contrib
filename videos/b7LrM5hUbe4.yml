description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nStream processing still evolves and changes at a speed that can make it hard to keep up with the developments. Being at the forefront of stream processing technology, the evolution of Apache Flink has mirrored many of these developments and continues to do so.\n\nWe will take you on a journey through the major milestones of stream processing technology in past years, diving into the latest additions that Apache Flink and other communities introduced to the stream processing landscape, such as Streamng SQL, Time Versioned Tables, cluster-library-duality, language portability, etc.\nWe will take a sneak peek into our crystal ball and present in what the Flink community is working on next.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
