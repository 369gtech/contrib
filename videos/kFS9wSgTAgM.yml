recordingDate: 1403711578
description: "Overview\n\nAt Shutterstock we like to try occasional unorthodox ideas and see if they will fly. During one of our quarterly hackathons we came up with a surprisingly fast template service that we currently call \"Swig As A Service\". After we wrote the service we integrated it into Dancer.\n\nAfter that, we then took this hack and bundled it up and put it on\nGithub. As part of this talk I would like to cover the following:\n\n* Go over what SaaS is and why it could be useful for the next web\napplication one might build.\n\n* Explain why we chose to run this in Node.js and a little bit about Swig.js\n\n* Talk briefly about some of our challenges, why this is even a sane idea.\n\n* Recruit people to start taking it for a spin.\n\nLength of Presentation:\n\n20 Minutes\n\nMinimum Level of Knowledge:\n\nInterest in exploring different ways of serving up HTML Experience\nwith Dancer would be beneficial. Beginner to intermediate level of web programming.\n\nRequirements:\n\nJust a projector and a sense of humor.\n\nAbout Speaker\n\nMy name is Logan Bell and I am a lead software developer at Shutterstock. I hack a lot in Perl and think all should either work\nremotely or commute via unicycle.\n\nhttp://www.loganbell.org/images/loganbell_unicycle.jpg\nhttp://www.loganbell.org/images/loganbell.jpg"
