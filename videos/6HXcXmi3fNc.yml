description: "Dan Sanderson \n\nThe Google Developers website, aka developers.google.com, is one of thousands of Google applications that run on App Engine.  In this talk, we walk through the real-world use cases and design patterns that drive the site's content management system, and discuss implementation techniques that have worked, and a few that haven't.  As a bonus, we'll consider several of the newest App Engine features in the context of this app, and how they change the way we think about application architecture.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live"
