description: "PyData London Meetup #48\nTuesday, September 4, 2018\n\nOften, data scientists are faced with unlabelled datasets. While unsupervised machine learning methods exist, they often don’t achieve performance close to what supervised learning methods achieve. One way of meeting halfway is semi-supervised learning. A particularly intuitive subdomain of semi-supervised learning is called active learning, where the algorithm requests new data points to be labelled. Active learning employs the same classification models as supervised learning, which are iteratively improved by labelling data points which are the most useful for the algorithm. This means that a human sitting down to label datapoints only needs to label the points that are actually useful - not the ones the algorithm is already sure about. In this talk, I want to go through the rationale behind active learning, and demonstrate how it can be done in the interactive python ecosystem. I’ll also outline how to use the superintendent (https://github.com/janfreyberg/superintendent) package, specifically designed for active learning.\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
