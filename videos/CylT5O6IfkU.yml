title: 'Introducing Knative (S1P2018)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538634244
description: "Knative extends Kubernetes via Custom Resource Definitions to provide support for higher level developer concerns such as autoscaling and routing across revisions of an application. In addition to those “serving” concerns, Knative also provides support for pluggable build strategies and an eventing model for connecting publishers to subscribers. Google launched the project earlier this year, and Pivotal is actively contributing. In this session, we will take a tour of Knative with demos along the way.\n\nSpeakers\nMark Fisher\nSenior Lead, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
