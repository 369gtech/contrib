description: "When confronted with a working system, there are two opposite views that are often thrown around: either work within the limits of the system, or just throw everything away and start over. But the seasoned engineer will often propose a third way: reinforce the weak points of the system and keep improving it. Technical debt is paid over time instead of accumulating; the results can be astounding in just a few months.\nIn this webinar we will see how to refactor the architecture of your system while it is running and everyone is working on it. We will also review a couple of first-hand practical cases to see how it is done in practice."
