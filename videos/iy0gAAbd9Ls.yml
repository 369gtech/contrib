title: 'micro.sphere.it #2:Type Proofs and Functional Programming for the Kotlin Type System by Raul Raja'

description: "Many thanks to Munich Kotlin User Group for providing us with a recording of Raul's talk, as we were unable to publish the presentation from micro.sphere.it due to some technical difficulties.\n\nType Proofs is a new compiler plugin built on Arrow Meta enabling new features in the Kotlin type system, such as Type Classes, Union Types, Type Refinements, and many other extensions that make Functional Programming easier in Kotlin.\n\nType Proofs propositions are expressed as extension functions that unlock new relationships between types ad-hoc whilst remaining fully compatible with subtype polymorphism and the existing inheritance type system.\n\nThis talk demonstrates some of the new features the Arrow team is introducing in Arrow at the type level and IDE and how others can benefit from them when building libraries and applications."
