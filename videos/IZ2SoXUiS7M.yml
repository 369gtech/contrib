title: 'Guide to "Reactive" for Spring MVC Developers'

description: "Having a modern, reactive, non-blocking, web stack in Spring Framework 5.0, along with reactive Spring Data repositories, is of great strategic importance, providing a range of new options for a category of applications. What if you're not ready for a full reactive stack, either because you don't need the level of scale and concurrency, or because you're using blocking dependencies (e.g. JDBC, JPA), or simply have other issues vying for precious time and attention? One of the strengths of the Spring Framework has always been to provide an incremental range of options, so applications can choose what's best for them, and the async, non-blocking space is no exception. This talk is a guide for Spring MVC developers to understand the reactive features available to them to add value to existing applications. We'll discuss the use of a reactive data repository layer, orchestrating remote service calls, response streaming, testing, and more. We'll take a look at how using reactive libraries changes the way you write and debug applications. We'll also discuss the limits of what you can do in Spring MVC and what more you can do with a full reactive stack and Spring WebFlux.\nSpeaker:\nRossen Stoyanchev\nSenior Staff, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
