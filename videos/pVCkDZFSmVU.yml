title: 'YOW! West 2014 - Parametricity, Types, Documentation, Code Readability - Tony Morris'
recordingDate: 1422348833
description: "Parametricity builds on the work of Philip Wadler and Danielsson et al. It is a robust, ubiquitous technique to improve code readability in all programming environments.\n\nThis talk will explore the specific details of parametricity. Some of the theoretical underpinnings will be examined with a heavier focus placed on their practical application. We will be using several programming languages; Haskell, Java and C#.\n\nAfter this talk, expect to have a clear understanding of the reasoning process that is increasingly used by professional programmers. You will also learn why there is consistent dismissal of degenerate methods of code comprehension. You will see why so many open-source projects are able to work so well with many committers who have such diverse insights. We all agree on one unifying point; parametricity is how to achieve robustness and we won't give it up for anything.\n\nYou too, can achieve this goal in your project\n\nFor more on YOW!
