language: English
recordingDate: 1450129012
description: "Using software modules today is the default way of working in most systems and frameworks. With the advent of many software languages and OSS frameworks, new module systems are constantly created and new module ecosystems start to prevail. This trend is horizontal and covers operating system packages, language libraries, and application modules (plugins). But even though some module systems are nicer to use, others are repeating past mistakes and are a daily source for developer agony and pain. This session looks at some of them, including Docker, npm, Maven, Bower, and more.\n\nSpeaker:\nYoav Landman, CTO, JFrog\nYoav is the CTO of JFrog, the Artifactory Binary Repository creators, JavaOne 2011 and 2013 Duke Choice Awards winner; Yoav laid the foundation to JFrog's flagship product in 2006 when he founded Artifactory as an open source project.
