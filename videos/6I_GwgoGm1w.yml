title: 'Choosing a JavaScript Framework - Rob Eisenberg'
language: English
recordingDate: 1465982574
description: "In the last couple of years there has been an explosion in JavaScript frameworks. How is a developer or business to make a wise choice? What are the advantages, trade-offs and differences? In this talk we’ll compare and contrast six popular front-end frameworks: Angular 1, Angular 2, Polymer, React, Ember and Aurelia. We’ll look at the same “Hello World” example in each framework so we can see, side-by-side, the differences in development strategy and philosophy.\nWe’ll also discuss how these frameworks stack up against a set of both technical and non-technical key evaluators so that you can get beyond the hype and finally make a solid technical and business decision."
