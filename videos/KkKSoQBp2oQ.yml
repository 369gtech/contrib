Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nDeveloper Experience on CD: Build a CD Platform to K8s that Developers Love - Euccas Chen & Tobi Ogunnaike, Pinterest \n\nApplication Deployment on K8S can be quite convoluted, especially for an organization that operates thousands of microservices. Pinterest is a visual discovery engine that serves over 250MM users. For successful adoption of K8S, it is imperative to provide a well integrated self-serve CI/CD platform that abstracts K8S complexities & offers a simple path of migration for existing workloads. This talk will discuss how we build a Continuous Delivery system for Kubernetes at Pinterest, and how we help engineering teams to deploy and migrate their services onto Kubernetes. Topics include: Kubernetes and deployments at Pinterest Introducing Hermez and the Continuous Delivery experience on K8S   How do we design and build the CD system, and lessons we learned Our journey of onboarding and migrating services to the new CD system and K8S \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaXd"
