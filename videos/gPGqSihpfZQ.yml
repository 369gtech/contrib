description: "Speaker: Hedren Sum\n\nResearch and scholarship are constantly evolving, becoming more collaborative and interdisciplinary. Supporting an interactive media-rich environment, WordPress is a versatile and easy to use platform to document and showcase interdisciplinary research that produces various types of research output.\n\nIn this talk, we will be sharing about a digital archive developed for the Digital Intangible Heritage of Asia (DIHA) research cluster at NTU College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences.\n\nThis DIHA archive helps to engage different interest groups on intangible heritage which covers languages, festivals, cuisines and traditional craftsmanship. The research outputs, which include publications, photographs and datasets, are captured, organised, annotated and preserved in the digital archive.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nHedren Sum is a New Media and Art Librarian at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)’s Libraries. He works very closely with faculty in several curatorial and research teams as a collaborator, providing research assistance and building digital collections. Hedren can also be recognised for using an array of digital tools in his work to visualise and communicate information.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.singapore.wordcamp.org/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VfF0/"
