recordingDate: 1435592285
description: "From Solid Conference 2015: Similar to the way in which we use fabs to build microprocessors and software to program them, the field of synthetic biology offers the prospect of re-programming biological organisms to enable a wide range of new applications, from chemicals to food to pharmaceuticals.\n\nAbout Joe Jacobson (MIT Media Lab):\nJoseph Jacobson is head of the MIT Media Lab Molecular Machines group. He received a PhD in physics from MIT and was a postdoctoral fellow in physics at Stanford. As a graduate student researching femtosecond lasers, he set the record for the shortest pulse ever generated by a laser (in optical cycles). He is the recipient of a Technology Review TR100 Award for the top 100 Innovators under 35, the Gutenberg Prize, a Discover Award, and the 2013 Exner Medal. Jacobson was a co-founder of E Ink and Gen9 Corporations and a founding director of One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)."
