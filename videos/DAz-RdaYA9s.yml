description: "Because design is about making things better, as designers we’re always looking for the good in the world. In this talk I will share some of the product strategy framework Helpfully uses to build elegance into products — simple, powerful, coherent, and inventive in their application of constraints. I’ll explain through case studies how to design elegance into your product or service. Constraints are fed by deep customer understanding, so I’ll share how to find customer problems, unpack mental models, and clarify habit loops. I’ll help you solve product problems with more elegant structures and, in your way, to create a world that’s just a little bit better. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/impact\n\nimpact-conf.com"
