description: "Elvira is a creative director at Local Projects, the experience design studio behind the 9/11 Memorial Museum, the Immersion Room at Cooper Hewitt, and many more. She also leads the department for visual experience design at the firm. In this talk, Elle will delve into what it means to be a creative leader, how to build and mentor design teams, and how to spearhead projects at the intersection of architecture, design, content and technology. She will use her recently completed project for the ARoS Art Museum in Denmark to provide attendees with a behind-the-scenes look at Local Project’s “Prototype First” approach, and will show how they broke all the rules to make art social, and deliver towards the mandate of a “Mental Fitness Center.”\n\nElvira Barriga\nCreative Director, Director of Visual Experience Design, Local Projects\nhttps://www.instagram.com/_e__ll__e_\n\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
