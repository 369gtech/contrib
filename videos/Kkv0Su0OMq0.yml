title: '"Everything Awesome about GPU Drivers" - Daniel Vetter (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579268117
description: "Daniel Vetter\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/86/\n\nAbout 10 years ago the first kernel modesetting drivers landed in upstream, with promise that this will usher in a new era in GPU drivers: Multi-application rendering, new compositors and maybe even working suspend/resume support. Then years later it is time to take stock and see were we are.\r\n\r\nSpoiler: Things are really, really good!\r\n\r\nCome and hear about the story of a community that grew massively: A subsystem with drivers spanning from the tiniest with less than a thousand lines to the largest with over 2 million. About how to create some really good shader compilers. And everything in between. Plus a few attempts at explaining how this success was possible.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nWed Jan 15 11:40:00 2020 at Room 5"
