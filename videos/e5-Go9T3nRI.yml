Dr. Julian Hosp, who just completed an 80m dollar ICO with his company TenX shares about his opinion on how to do a “tokensale” the proper way.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nOriginally being from Austria, 31 year old Dr. Julian Hosp was a professional kitesurfer in his early years, ranking among the top 10 in the world. He studied medicine and worked as a trauma surgeon. Missing the freedoms he had as a professional athlete, he decided to quit his medical career and move to Asia to start his own business. Having heard about Bitcoin the first time in 2011 from a patient, he co-founded the Singapore based Fintech company TenX in 2015. He is considered as one of the most valued speakers and influencers in the blockchain ecosystem and was named as one of the top Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Experts to Follow by Influencive in 2017.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/blockchain-nightsginnovate-tickets-35871523693\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/9BJ6/"
