This talk will make you comfortable with that idea of letting go and give examples of ways in which we realized that creating metrics becomes a journey, and not a destination.\n\nAudience Takeaways:\n\nChanging metrics often isn't being shifty; its a good idea.\nBulletproof Metrics eventually begin to fail over a larger time period\nEngineers 'game' metrics. Shake things up to refocus.\nSome metrics flat-line and shouldn't be improved just for the sake of it\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
