Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nThe Elephant in the Kubernetes Room: Team Interactions at Scale - Manuel Pais, Independent  \n\nKubernetes helps us tame sprawling microservices architectures and address increased operational complexity. Kubernetes gives developers abstractions and APIs to deploy and run their services.     Yet, the elephant in the room is that to run, maintain and evolve Kubernetes clusters, we need more ops expertise and most likely a dedicated team to do so.    The question that begs to be asked is if we risk going back to pre-DevOps isolation between Dev and Ops teams? Is the tradeoff between better operational tools and introducing a new dependency layer on the path to production for application teams worthwhile? Are we making life easier for application teams or instead reducing their end-to-end ownership?     Manuel will then introduce Team Topologies, a balanced approach for thinking about teams responsibilities and interactions which can help get the most value out of your Kubernetes adoption. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uadp"
