title: 'Next Generation Asynchronous Patterns in JavaScript by Jonathan Mills'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510303650
description: "With ES6 and ESNext we are no longer limited to simple callbacks when dealing with our asynchronous JavaScript code. This session will walk through four options for async patterns, addressing when to use each one and identifying the problems they solve. We will start with a discussion of ES6 Promises and generators, continue with ESNext Async/Await, and close with a conversation about RxJS. Broaden your understanding of the available tools and start writing better asynchronous JavaScript today.\n\n# Jonathan Mills\nJon is a Pluralsight author, ASP.NET insider, and international speaker focusing on JavaScript both in the browser and on the server. Jonathan Mills is a JavaScript and Node.js expert working in the mean stack with individuals and companies to help build their technical skills to cope with the constantly changing landscape of software development."
