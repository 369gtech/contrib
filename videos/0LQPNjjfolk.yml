title: 'Don’t use Reactive Streams in Java 9+ - Jacek Kunicki'
language: English
recordingDate: 1636711200
description: "Reactive Streams is a standard for asynchronous data processing in a streaming fashion with non-blocking backpressure. Starting from Java 9, they have become a part of the JDK in the form of the java.util.concurrent.Flow interfaces.\n\nHaving the interfaces at hand may tempt you to write your own implementations. Surprising as it may seem, that’s not what they are in the JDK for.\n\nIn this session we’re going to go through the basic concepts of reactive stream processing and see how (not) to use the APIs included in JDK 9+.\n\nPresented by Jacek Kunicki\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://youtube.pl/c/DevoxxPoland?sub_confirmation=1\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
