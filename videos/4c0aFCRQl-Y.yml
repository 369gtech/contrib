description: "Progressive Web Apps are one of the hottest things to come to the web platform in years, but how much of it is just hot air? When can you actually start shipping these things? Decades ago! In a hands on presentation, I'll show how PWAs are truly meant to be progressive - building on an evolution of web technologies nearly as old as the web itself, and still let you ship one of the most performant and cutting edge web apps around.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/PatrickKettner1/progressive-what-apps\nAbout Patrick: https://twitter.com/patrickkettner\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
