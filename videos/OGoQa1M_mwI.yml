description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/the-dark-side-of-java-8/\n\nJava 8 was one of the most important Java releases ever… but still wasn’t free of bugs, or just places where things could’ve been done better.\n\nIn this session, we’ll go through a quick post-mortem session and explore various bugs, flaws and design inconsistencies along with ways how we can address those problems (if possible).\n\nTo enumerate a few, we’ll see how Stream#flatmap is broken, why Parallel Streams might be not a good choice for production, what’s wrong with Optional, or how to avoid checked exceptions boilerplate in lambda expressions by tricking the compiler."
