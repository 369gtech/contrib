description: "David seeks to build a team that respects and enjoys each other’s company, focussing on architecture and quality; Leigh wants her team to deliver a great product on time and on budget for the client. Can these two objectives be met by the same team?\n\n\n\nA high-performing team is key to delivering projects on time, in scope, and (relatively) stress free. But as many have discovered, the rituals of Agile alone aren’t enough to build high-performing teams, and it takes a heck of a lot more than shared core values to build great teams.\n\n\n\nIn this session, Leigh and David will combine their focus areas to show you how business success and healthy teams can be wrapped into one approach. Building on Patrick Lencioni’s Five Dysfunctions of a Team, our aim is to build teams that are accountable for their results and committed to their work. Using our experience with teams over the last several years, we’ll demonstrate the importance of creating trust and honest, forthright dialogue as the first steps in accomplishing our objective and discuss how a shared commitment to these issues with each other helps keep our teams on track.\n\n\n\nIn this session you’ll learn to:\n\nIdentify dysfunctions blocking team improvement;\n\nPractices to help your teams abandon their dysfunctions;\n\nLearn the role of the team leader and management in beginning & supporting the process;\n\nAlternate methods of measuring team growth and improvement."
