description: "It’s quite simple to compile java-files to class-files, just call javac (Oracle’s compiler) or EJC (Eclipse Java Compiler). But how to compile big projects consisting of many thousands of files? In this talk we’ll see how IDEs speed up the process of compilation to compile even big projects instantly.\n\nI’m going to talk about cooperation between Java-compilers and IDEs: how compiler can help IDE and how IDE can help compiler, and what features of javac make this a challenging task. Also I’ll show how to write a correct Java program which cannot be compiled."
