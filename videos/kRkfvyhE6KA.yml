description: "We always consider the web to be a unique thing. A decentralized platform based on open technologies. A sturdy, open utopia of people using technology to collect and archive the sum of human knowledge. However, in the 20 years we have used the web, this has become less and less of a goal. The web is a thing everyone likes to rely on, but the use of it has to cater to different needs and demands. It is time for us as developers to be aware of these needs and understand different audiences better.\n\nChristian Heilmann\nmicrosoft.com\nhttps://twitter.com/codepo8\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
