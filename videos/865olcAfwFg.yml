recordingDate: 1638378004
description: "Users have indicated many preferences on their devices these days. They want the operating system and apps to look and feel like their own. User-adaptive interfaces are those which are ready to use these preferences to enhance the user experience, to make it feel more at home. If done correctly, a user may never know the user experience is adapting or has adapted. Join us to learn about building adaptive interfaces that centralize user preferences.\n\nSpeaker: Adam Argyle\n\nWatch more:\nWatch all Chrome Developer Summit videos → https://goo.gle/cds21-allsessions\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\n#ChromeDevSummit"
