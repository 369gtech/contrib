description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 18 http://bit.ly/2P7SPII\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nCO-OPERATIVE ROBOTS SHARING THE LOAD\nby Natalia Chechina\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nDistribution\nComputation\nRobots\n\nTALK LEVEL: Advanced\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this talk I will share the idea behind, and features of, Autonomous Mobile Programs (AMPs). Autonomous Mobile Programs are mobile agents that are aware of there resource needs, sensitive to their execution environment, and periodically relocate to reduce their completion time. AMPs previously have been evaluated on a small LAN, then simulated, and now we have explored their potential on a group of Raspberry Pi robots introducing fault tolerance.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/natalia-chechina/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - NATALIA CHECHINA\nOne of the core authors of SD Erlang, lecturer in computing at Bournemouth University\n\nNatalia Chechina is a Lecturer in Computing in the Department of Computing & Informatics at Bournemouth University. Her research investigates approaches and techniques to enable scaling and efficient performance of applications on commodity hardware, including robots, servers, and IoT devices. Her other interests include Erlang programming language, overlay networks, and stochastic modelling.\n\nMore on Natalia Chechina: http://codesync.global/speaker/natalia-chechina/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
