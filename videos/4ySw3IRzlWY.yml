recordingDate: 1408455571
description: "This talk is a demonstration of how to test your Erlang systems for non-functional (or, as some we rather call them, extra-functional) properties such as responsiveness, using property-based testing.\nTalk objectives:\n\nProperty-based testing is an already known testing methodology for the Erlang community, with tools such as QuickCheck and PropEr being highly popular among Erlang developers in the last few years. However, they are commonly used for functional testing... Which are the challenges in using them for testing non-functional properties of software?\nTarget audience:\n\nErlang developers interested in testing methods and tools."
