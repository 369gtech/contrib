title: 'DEF CON 27 Wireless Village - s0lst1c3 - War Never Changes Attacks Against WPA3s Enhanced Open'
language: English
recordingDate: 1574212792
description: 'In this presentation we will introduce working proof-of-concept attacks that can be used against wireless networks that use Opportunity Wireless Encryption (OWE), which is better known as WPA3’s “Enhanced Open.” We’ll also demonstrate a resource exhaustion attack that can be used to disconnect wireless clients from networks that use Protected Management Frames (PMF). By doing this we hope to inspire a conversation about whether OWE is truly a significant improvement from open WiFi, and whether it truly addresses the current wireless threat model.'
