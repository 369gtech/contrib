language: English
recordingDate: 1530691012
description: 'If you woke up tomorrow and couldn’t use your arms to get out of bed, or use your voice to call out for help, and couldn’t see beyond your feet. How would you express yourself? Technology has given us almost unimaginable ways to expand our horizons: gesture recognition, voice controlled interfaces and machine learning, are just a few examples. But does this include everyone? This talk follows a case study in which users with complex disabilities interact with music technology. We will discuss techniques for understanding affordances, tailoring interactions and providing access to all.'
