And as a developer you like to develop - that's pretty obvious. But what to do with your app? How to share your bright ideas with the world?\n\nOptions are endless. But most of them are obsolete, difficult, not scalable, time-consuming. Even liked and well perceived cloud solutions are not free from those drawbacks. So you may use their (very nice and user-friendly, to be fair) web interfaces, but using them is not very productive and doing that for production is not exactly what you want to do. You may also want to use Cloud Formation- or Terraform-like technologies, which are, however, far different from what you already know.\n\nHow about I show you how to use the technology that you already know to make not only frontend and backend application, but also to create the whole scalable, easily maintainable and modern infrastructure for your app?\n\nSounds good or you wanna call it a bluff?\n\n---\n\nConFrontJS 2019 - #Frontend #Conference in #Warsaw, Poland\nDate: 7 December 2019\nVenue: Engineering Design Center (EDC)\n\n▶︎ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/2339951839653302/\n▶︎ Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/WarsawJS/events/264057980/\n▶︎ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/confrontjs.event/\n▶︎ Twitter: https://twitter.com/confrontjs\n▶︎ Homepage: https://confrontjs.com/"
