recordingDate: 1601026270
description: "What is technical leadership? Is it a genetic trait of a technologist or a skill that can be learned? This interactive talk will present a model of technical leadership. The model is not trait-based; you will not be shown a list of the 10 qualities of a technical leader. Rather, the technical leadership model presents a theory of how technical leaders think in such a way that they can make better decisions that avoid costly mistakes. This model provides an actionable plan for developers, team leaders, and architects to further develop their skills.\n\nAdib Saikali, Principal Platfrom Architect at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/a-model-of-technical-leadership"
