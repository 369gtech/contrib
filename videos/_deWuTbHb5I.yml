description: "Offline capable web apps have come a long way in just a few years. Tools like service workers, PouchDB & CouchDB gave answers to the first questions of “can we do this, where do we begin?”, pushing new possibilities to the browser.\n\nBut taking the medical supply system online & offline for Africa’s most populous country asked us a whole new set of questions. How do you model distributed data and scalable code for 30,000 clinics? What about that growth is easy to mess up, and how do we plan for it?\n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/kevin-doran/offline-first-data-getting-bigger.html"
