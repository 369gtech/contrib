description: "Development process is not finished with coding phase completion. We also need to write some kind of documentation, think about verification procedures, make sure availability and other non-functional requirements are satisfied.\n\nWe usually do things with the most familiar approach, even if it contains much manual work and not so efficient. But what if there is another radically different approach? Could we formalize all our activities and structure them as a code? What tools and practices could be used for this purpose?\n\nIn this talk Alexander is going to present his personal experience in automation of different aspects of development process."
