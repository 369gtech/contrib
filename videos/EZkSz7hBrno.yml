title: 'Mathew McLoughlin - Omnisharp: .Net sans Microsoft'
language: English
recordingDate: 1443771196
description: "It used to be that if you wanted to write .NET code you would be completely reliant on Microsoft for their tools, frameworks and even their operating system. Now things are changing. The .NET open source community has grown in size, and with it, so have your options for frameworks and libraries. Microsoft have even announced that they are building a cross platform CLR, so now you have a choice of operating system too.\n\nThe one thing that has been missing from this story is good cross platform development environment. This is where Omnisharp comes in, allowing you to develop C# code in the editor of your choice. In this talk I’m going to discuss some of these editors and the tools and technologies used to build them. Demonstrating how you can use the Roslyn API’s to build an interactive development environment."
