description: "Speaker: Abhinav Suryavanshi & Douglas Vaz - GoJek\r\n\r\nGo makes it fun to build concurrent software due to its goroutines and channels primitives. In this talk, we will explore patterns that treat channels as a means of communication and use these semantics to orchestrate code.\r\n\r\nAbout our speakers:\r\nAbhinav Suryavanshi & Douglas Vaz are both product engineers working at GoJek, with focus on financial services.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/golangsg/events/258485148/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael Cheng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/nq5v/"
