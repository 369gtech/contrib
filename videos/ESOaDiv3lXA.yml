description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJez Humble - Author of \"Continuous Delivery\", Principal Consultant, ThoughtWorks\n\nABSTRACT\nThe concept of \"value\" is central to agile and lean software development - but how do we decide what is valuable, and on what basis? I will argue that determining value is the responsibility of everyone - not just the \"product owner\" - and that in order to deliver value, the most important thing is to be able to measure it transparently, and to establish a fast feedback loop so we can quickly determine if what we're doing is in fact valuable. In this talk I will discuss several approaches to measuring value, how to maximize creating it, and how doing so affects the way teams work.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
