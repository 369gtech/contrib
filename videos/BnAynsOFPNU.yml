description: "Google Tech Talks\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nChris Myers Asch will speak about his efforts to build the U.S. Public Service Academy as the civilian counterpart to the military service academies a federally-funded college where students would get a free education in return for a commitment to serve for five years in the public sector, at the local, state, or national levels. Without lobbyists, a PR firm, or powerful connections, Asch has built a bipartisan coalition of senators, representatives, college presidents, military veterans, service organizations, and others in support of his idea. He will discuss the challenges and rewards of social entrepreneurship, as well as the promise and potential of the U.S. Public Service Academy.\n\nSpeaker: Chris Myers Asch\nA native of Washington, D.C., Chris Myers Asch is a graduate of Duke University and the University of North Carolina, as well as an alumnus of Teach for America/AmeriCorps.
