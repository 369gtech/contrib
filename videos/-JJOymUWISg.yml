description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nTrack: Core Groovy Track\nSpeaker: Fatima Casau\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/using-groovy-grails-in-your-spring-boot-project\nThe emergence of Spring Boot has significantly improved the development of applications with Spring, allowing you to create applications faster by improving the configuration and removing repetitive tasks. Some of the dependencies that can be included are support for ‘Groovy’ and also the use of ‘GORM (Grails Object Relational Mapping)’ as well as ‘Hibernate’ for persistence. We will see where and how to use them in our projects with Spring Boot and how this set of technologies can convert our work in a great experience."
