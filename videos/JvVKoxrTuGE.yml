title: 'Industrial Product Development: Modular Design in Multiple Dimensions with Java'

description: "The Belimo Energy Valve is a valve actuator used worldwide for energy-efficient heating and cooling of buildings. The intelligent valve optimizes the flow of water locally at the valve without centralized control. The necessary complex optimization is performed on an embedded Linux board with Oracle Java SE Embedded directly within the case of the valve. Java fosters modular design in multiple dimensions, and code modularity is offered by OSGi. Control logic is graphically designed with building blocks with an Eclipse-based modeling tool. Finally, the model is executed at the valve. This session demonstrates how Java boosts embedded applications—during design, integration, and runtime—by means of modularity and flexibility. \n\n\nAuthors:\nKaspar von Gunten\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Kaspar von Gunten at https://www.parleys.com/author/kaspar-von-gunten\n\nGert Brettlecker\nGert Brettlecker is responsible for technology and research for Mobile \nView more trainings by Gert Brettlecker at https://www.parleys.com/author/gert-brettlecker\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
