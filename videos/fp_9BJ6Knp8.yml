recordingDate: 1564998686
description: "We’ve been trained to speak “business to business” (B2B) or “business to consumer”(B2C). But businesses and products do not have emotion. Humans do. In Human to Human Marketing (#H2H), Bryan explores why and how communication needs to be adjusted to exude simplicity, empathy and imperfection – in the same way humans are built. Through examples pulled from Bryan’s viral smash-hit first book “There’s No B2B or B2C: It’s Human-to-Human H2H” that birthed the H2H movement, and through entertaining stories from his own experiences, he delivers practical tools and steps you can use right now to connect with your customers, be smarter marketers, managers, and fellow members of the human race.\n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on Marketing Stage during Infoshare 2019."
