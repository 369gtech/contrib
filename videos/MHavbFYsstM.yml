description: "The web's best feature is its reach across most computing devices. There's an overwhelming amount of good resources out there to help guide you through responsive or adaptive design to adjust for varying screen sizes and network conditions. But what about input? In this presentation, learn important tips and tricks for adapting to input types across devices from mouse & keyboard to touch to motion controllers like Leap or Kinect and more. We'll explore the Pointer Events standard as well as what to do when only Touch or Mouse Events are available. We'll also look at key differences in the behavior of different input types, including important concepts like the virtual viewport, hover, input precision, and latency. Finally, we'll spend some time discussing what's on the horizon for input in browsers and how web developers can help shape the future.\n\nAbout Jacob: https://twitter.com/jacobrossi\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl/\n\nVideography generously sponsored by BÃ©yonit: https://www.beyonit.nl/"
