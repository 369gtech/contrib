description: "Quantum Computing: a Treasure Hunt, not a Gold Rush\nIgor Markov, University of Michigan\nPresented at MLconf San Francisco 2019\n\nAbstract: Quantum computers promise a significant step up in computational power over conventional computers, but also suffer a number of counterintuitive limitations â€” both in their computational model and in leading lab implementations. In this talk, we review how quantum computers compete with conventional computers and how conventional computers try to hold their ground. Then we outline what stands in the way of successful quantum ML applications.\n\nSee Igor's presentation slides on our slideshare page here:\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/igor-markov-quantum-computing-a-treasure-hunt-not-a-gold-rush/SessionsEvents/igor-markov-quantum-computing-a-treasure-hunt-not-a-gold-rush"
