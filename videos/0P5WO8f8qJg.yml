description: "This talk will take an two existing Spark ML pipeline (Frank The Unicorn, for predicting PR comments (Scala) - https://github.com/franktheunicorn/predict-pr-comments & Spark ML on Spark Errors (Python)) and explore the steps involved in migrating this into a combination of Spark and Tensorflow. Using the open source Kubeflow project (now with Spark support as of 0.5), we will create an two integrated end-to-end pipelines to explore the challenges involved & look at areas of improvement (e.g. Apache Arrow, etc.).\n\nAbout: Databricks provides a unified data analytics platform, powered by Apache Sparkâ„¢, that accelerates innovation by unifying data science, engineering and business.\nRead more here:\_https://databricks.com/product/unified-data-analytics-platform\n\nConnect with us:\nWebsite:\_https://databricks.com\nFacebook:\_https://www.facebook.com/databricksinc\nTwitter:\_https://twitter.com/databricks\nLinkedIn:\_https://www.linkedin.com/company/databricks\nInstagram:\_https://www.instagram.com/databricksinc/"
