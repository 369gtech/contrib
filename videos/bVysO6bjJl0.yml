This led to a wonderful conversation as we talked about Angular, Blazor, Flutter and a few other frameworks and technologies. We also discussed why one might choose certain frameworks, and some best practices for getting started as a web developer. As a serial entrepreneur who's always exploring, Damola had some wonderful insights to share.\n\nLearn more!\n\nPublish an Angular, React, Svelte, or Vue JavaScript app with Azure Static Web Apps: https://aka.ms/WebWeds/AngularTemplatesDeploy Build a web app with Blazor: https://aka.ms/WebWeds/AngularBlazor Publish an API to Azure Static Web Apps: https://aka.ms/WebWeds/AngularAddFunctionsAPI"
