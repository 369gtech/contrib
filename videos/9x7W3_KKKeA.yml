title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2019 - Amit Dev - Introduction to Functional Programming in Rust'
recordingDate: 1565038800
description: "Rust is a multi paradigm language with performance and safety as primary goals. Rust is strongly influenced by functional programming languages like ML, so it is possible to follow a functional coding style. In this talk I will explore the features of Rust that makes it a good choice for functional programming as well as its drawbacks. Following areas will be covered:\n\n* Algebraic Data Types\n\n* Pattern matching\n\n* Brief overview on Ownership and Lifetimes in Rust\n\n* Higher order functions and combinators\n\n* An extended example that makes use of the above as well as slightly advanced topics.\n\nIn addition to the above the strengths and weakness of Rust as a functional programming language will be compared.\n\nI love designing and implementing software systems in a clean, simple way and have been doing that for years. I'm deeply interested in functional programming and applying functional techniques in software design.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
