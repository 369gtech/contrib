title: 'Migrate to Quarkus, this is the way by Jonathan Vila'
recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "Quarkus is a new super fast and super light framework to develop cloud native and GraalVM compatible apps. But, is that easy to go the Quarkus way? Is it hard to migrate an existing app? For sure in a hello world demo this will look fantastic, (they all look that way donâ€™t they) but, in a real app, is that nice? is that easy? is that fun?\n\nIn this session I will show my experience from scratch migrating an app to Quarkus, using different technologies as Hibernate, Prometheus, Rest. You will also learn how you can check your current app and see how easy is to migrate using a foss app to analyse it.\n\nPrepare for a journey of reality, failures, and experiences on the universe of Quarkus, at a lightning speed.\n\nJonathan Vila, Red Hat\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
