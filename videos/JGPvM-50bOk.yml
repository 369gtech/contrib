description: 'Lua is a very fast and powerful scripting language that can be easily embeddable. It has been shining in industries like game development, for example. Lua is also an excellent tool as a general purpose language and can be used to develop robust applications. Its use in web developments, however, despite its great potential and incredible benchmarks, needs to be more widespread. This talk will mention the current state of Lua in web development, show some benchmarks, compare existing tools and teach how to get started with Sailor, an MVC web framework written in Lua.'
