description: "All users expect a fast experience from web apps. But not all users were created equal, and not all of them have a shiny Mac and high-speed internet connection.\n\nCan you tell if your users are happy about your app performance? Probably not, unless you're monitoring it.\n\nIn this talk I will show you how to build a real time monitoring system, with minimal effort and no cost, that will provide insights on how your app performs even on your grandpa's old mobile phone while he's on the subway and provide a breakdown of where your app bottlenecks are.\n\nSlides: https://slides.com/maorfrankel/deck-1-3/\n\nYGLF 2019: Code Camp Blog, Maor Frankel:\nhttps://www.israel.yglfconf.com/post/meet-the-speaker-maor-frankel"
