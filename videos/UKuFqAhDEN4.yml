language: English
recordingDate: 1433784707
description: "Enabling bulk data parallel operations on collections and other aggregates was a key driver for adding lambda language features to Java SE 8. The centerpiece of the Java SE 8 libraries is the new Streams parallel bulk data API. This session presents an in-depth examination of the architecture of the Streams API and its implementation, providing insights into how to get the best performance and  scalability from the library, both now and in the future.\n\n\nAuthors:\nPaul Sandoz\nPaul Sandoz is the co-spec lead and implementation lead for JSR 311: Java API for RESTful Web Services.
