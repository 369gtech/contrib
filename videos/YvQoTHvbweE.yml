description: "In this Episode Frank is welcoming Mads Kristensen and Mark Downie to talk and try some very interesting new features of the recently release #VisualStudio 2022.\n\nAI Assisted whole line completion\n---------------------------------\nHarnessing the wisdom of the community, Visual Studio IntelliCode is revolutionizing developer productivity. We started with AI-assisted IntelliSense and are now expanding the application of artificial intelligence to significantly accelerate learning, radically improve development agility, and increase code quality by means of two exciting new capabilities: whole line completions and refactoring.\n\n- Using an ASP.NET MVC application\n- Beyond alphabetized suggestions\n- Inferences based on the community\n- Inferences based on the community\n- Using tab completions\n- Validating Model State\n- Return values\n\nReach out to Mark Downie on (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.): https://twitter.com/poppastring \n\n- Download Visual Studio 2022: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=helloworld-17228-cxa \n\n\nDebug code with force run to cursor\n-----------------------------------\n“Force Run To Cursor” provides a convenient way of debugging your application when you want to skip your breakpoints.  We also feature new temporary breakpoints and dependent breakpoints.\n\nReach out to Mark Downie on (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.): https://twitter.com/poppastring \n\n- Download Visual Studio 2022: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=helloworld-17228-cxa \n\n\nHot Reload your ASP.NET apps\n----------------------------\nWith #HotReload our goal is to save you as many app restarts between edits as possible, making you more productive by reducing the time you spend building/restarting as you continue to build your app. We try to achieve this goal by making it possible for you to edit your applications code files and, in many cases, apply those code changes immediately without having to do things such as pause the apps execution or restarting.\n- No restarts required\n- Update Code behind\n- Update HTML\n- Update CSS\n\nReach out to Mark Downie on (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.): https://twitter.com/poppastring \n\n- Download Visual Studio 2022: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=helloworld-17228-cxa \n\n\nDiego's Wall\n--------------------\nBuild your tech resilience: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/tech-resilience?WT.mc_id=helloworld-17228-cxa\n\n\nMake Visual Studio yours\n------------------------\nThere are lots of updates when it comes to personalizing Visual Studio. Theming and extensibility are two of those areas, so we’ll use a new feature that allow us to port a #VSCode theme to Visual Studio and share it as an extension.\n\nReach out to Mads Kristensen on (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.): https://twitter.com/mkristensen \n\n- Install Visual Studio 2022 and Extensibility Essentials: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.ExtensibilityEssentials2022?WT.mc_id=helloworld-17228-cxa \n- Open new or vote on existing feature requests: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/search?space=8&ftype=idea&stateGroup=active&WT.mc_id=helloworld-17228-cxa \n \nChapters\n--------\n00:03:10 Question of the Day\n00:04:28 AI Assisted whole line completion\n00:16:09 Debug code with force run to cursor\n00:28:04 Hot Reload your ASP.NET apps\n00:40:03 Diego Wall\n00:45:51 Make Visual Studio yours\n\nUseful Links\n------------\n- Hello World on Spotify: https://aka.ms/helloworld/podcast-spotify\n- Hello World on Google Podcasts: https://aka.ms/helloworld/podcast-google\n- Hello World on Apple Podcasts: https://aka.ms/helloworld/podcast-apple\n- Join us Backstage: https://aka.ms/HelloWorld/BackStage\n- iCal URL: https://aka.ms/helloworld/reminder  \n\n☁️"
