description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013, in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeakers: Roy Clarkson and Josh Long\nNo application is an island and this is more obvious today than ever as applications extend their reach into people's pockets, desktops, tablets, TVs, Blu-ray players and cars. What's a modern developer to do to support these many platforms? In this talk, join Josh Long to learn how Spring can extend your reach through (sometimes Spring Security OAuth-secured) RESTful services exposed through Spring MVC, HTML5 and client-specific rendering thanks to Spring Mobile, and powerful, native support for Android with Spring Android.\n\nLearn more about Mobile and Spring at:\nhttp://projects.spring.io/spring-framework (Spring MVC + Spring MVC's REST impl)\nhttp://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth\nhttp://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas (Spring HATEOAS)\nhttp://projects.spring.io/spring-mobile\nhttp://projects.spring.io/spring-android\n\nListed in SpringOne2GX 2013 agenda as titled:\nMulti client development with Spring"
