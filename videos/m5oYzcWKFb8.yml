description: "Subscribe to our channel: https://devoxx.pl/youtube\n\nUpdating caches and full-text indexes, synchronizing data between microservices, maintaining different read models in a CRQS-style architecture, feeding operational data to your analytics tools -- just a few use cases which benefit so much from streaming the changes from your datastore. In this session, youâ€™ll learn what change data capture (CDC) is about and how it can be implemented using Debezium, an open-source CDC solution based on Apache Kafka. Find out how Debezium captures all the changes from datastores such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB, how to react to the change events in near real time, and how Debezium is designed to not compromise on data correctness and completeness also if things go wrong.\n#Debezium #Database\n\nPresented by Jiri Pechanec\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
