Dino Esposito — DDD: Where’s the Value and What’s in It for Me?\nКонференция DotNext 2015 Moscow\nМосква, 11.12.2015 г.\n\nAn aura of mystery sometimes surrounds DDD and makes it kind of an exoteric thing. While experts insist that everyone should be doing DDD, people in the trenches find it hard and sometimes don't even see the point of making their life harder because of the DDD guidelines. This brings up a bunch of existential questions that sometimes sound too much basic and even a bit silly to ask. One in particular: where’s the value of DDD and what’s in it for me? There’s a missing link between what DDD is and how it is perceived by most people. DDD is not exactly the thing that it seems to be after you read the Evans’s blue book from cover to cover for the first time. While DDD teaches a set of practices to build a software system, it has little to do with the actual implementation details of such a system. DDD expresses its full potential in the analysis of the system and helps immensely in the discovery of the top-level architecture. After this stage, though, everything you may know already fits nicely in a new picture neither bigger nor larger: just flipped!"
