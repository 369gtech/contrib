description: "In this talk, Mike Amundsen spins a story that describes what APIs may look like in the not too distant future. How will we discover the API we need? What will the API documentation and description look like? What will it be like to \"program\" APIs in the future? Also, who will be doing the \"programming\"?\n\nArmed with this \"future view\" of APIs, what will it take for you and your company to succeed in this new world of future APIs? Most importantly, what can you do today to prepare for the coming API future?\n\nLetâ€™s explore and get ready for APIs of the Future.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
