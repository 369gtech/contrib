Not to mention the differences between Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL), Euroleague, and NBA.\n\nHow we can apply this metaphor to measure Agile maturity? Is your company playing in school or in national league? Which XP, Scrum, Kanban practices we need to apply to get to higher league. Which companies are playing in Lithuanian Agile League and who is leading? How to join this league? Want to hear my practical examples and advices? Come to this presentation."
