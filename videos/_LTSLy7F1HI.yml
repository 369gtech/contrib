description: "Bjoern Rost\nPrincipal Consultant\nThe Pythian Group Inc.\n\nRegardless of what you’ve seen or heard, machine learning is not that complicated, and simple but valuable use cases that extend traditional analytical capabilities are easily unlocked. In this session, the presenters build a prediction model for taxi fares based on existing public data. Watch as they explore the dataset, derive estimates with basic analytics, and then train a TensorFlow model with several iterations to outperform those estimates. You’ll understand the methods, tools, and algorithms used in this predictor and witness the live development and training of their machine learning model. Are you ready to finally understand what machine learning is all about?"
