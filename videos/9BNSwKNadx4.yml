description: "Technical and operational ethics are important, but they're only half of the equation: how do you put the community in open source, from mentoring others and encouraging members to network with others? Why does \"giving back\" matter? How do you find or become a mentor? \n\nStephanie Hurlburt (@sehurlburt) joins Scott Hanselman (@shanselman) to talk about the concept of lending privilege, going beyond quickly reviewing pull requests and clear documentation.
