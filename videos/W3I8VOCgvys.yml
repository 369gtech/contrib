title: 'Building a real-time serverless app in Blazor using AWS - Martin Beeby'
language: English
recordingDate: 1582115547
description: "In this session, we will build an interactive dashboard using Blazor that reacts in real-time to events that happen in the real world.\n\nWe will connect the Blazor application through to a serverless backend built in .Net.\n\nRather than requiring a cluster of servers to maintain our WebSocket communications, we will use a managed service called Amazon API Gateway and take advantage of it's WebSockets support.\n\nThis service introduces a whole new way of thinking about, and architecting, applications that require duplex communication.\n\nBy the end of the session, you will have the knowledge to build highly scalable and resilient real-time applications without having to manage or scale servers.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
