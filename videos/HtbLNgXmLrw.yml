description: "\"Is it me, or the GIL?\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Shanghai]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Christoph Heer\n\nPython's Global Interpreter Lock\_is\_a\_friend\_and rival at the same time.\_We, as\_developers,\_can\_focus\_on the\_design\_and\_implementation\_of\_applications\_without the\_hassle\_of memory management.\_On the other side,\_we complain\_about the\_GIL\_as the limiting factor of performance sensitive applications.\_Therefore, it is\_common\_to refactor\_parts\_of\_systems\_when the\_system\_doesn't perform or scale enough anymore. The refactoring often includes the switch of the used concurrency paradigms like replacing multithreading with multiprocessing or asyncio.\_Another\_option\_is\_moving\_logic\_of CPU-bound workload into\_C extensions\_or a\_full\_rewrite in a \"\"GIL-free\"\" language.\_But how\_do\_you\_know\_that the\_GIL\_is\_the actual\_performance\_bottleneck?\n\nWhile\_scaling and developing\_performance\_sensitive components in Python, my\_colleagues\_and I\_often\_also assumed the\_GIL\_as\_cause\_of our\_performance\_problems\_because it\_is\_a common\_and\_simple\_answer for this usually complex and varied\_problems.\_Instead of\_starting\_a\_rewrite\_or major refactoring, we took a step back and\_tried\_to\_prove\_our\_assumption.\_With the\_result\_that\_analyzing\_the\_impact\_of the\_GIL\_contention\_on the\_overall\_performance\_is\_a\_very\_interesting\_problem\_without\_common\_practices or easy usable set of\_tools that support Python developers.  Within this\_talk, I will\_share\_and\_explain\_the\_methods\_and\_tools, which we\_use\_to\_analyze\_the\_relevance\_of the GIL on our application\_performance and how it\_helped\_us to stay\_focused\_on the\_actual\_problematic areas of our\_applications\_that\_required\_improvements\_to\_meet\_our\_performance\_goals.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
