title: 'Goiko Adzic, Reinventing software quality'
recordingDate: 1441575913
description: "The needs to go faster to market and cut costs, dominating the industry lately, are significantly changing the landscape of software quality.\n\nMany pillars of successful quality strategies in the past are just slowing down delivery too much. To be competitive in the future, we have to switch from quality as a cost centre to quality as value-add, but for that we have to completely change the way we measure, assure and define quality.\n\nThis is a talk for anyone serious about software delivery, regardless of the role in their process."
