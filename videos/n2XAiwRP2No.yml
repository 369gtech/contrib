recordingDate: 1381880814
description: "During the first part of this exclusive webcast event we welcome Eric Ries, @ericries, author of New York Times bestseller \"The Lean Startup\" for a fireside chat with Jeff Gothelf @jboogie, author of \"Lean UX\" and learn the story behind \"Lean UX\" and how the material was chosen for the book.\n\nDuring the second portion you will learn how requirements-driven product definition is a sure-fire way to get 100% of the wrong product launched. The assumptions that requirements are based on are usually not accurate enough to determine the exact solution those requirements dictate. Instead, teams should focus on creating a series of hypotheses that define potential solutions to their business problems and then work together to learn which of these hypotheses are keepers and which ideas to kill.\n\nIn this webcast, Jeff Gothelf author of Lean UX, will provide an overview of how to apply the ideas behind Lean UX and Design Thinking to project definition and planning.\n\nUsing a series of case studies from large companies such as Paypal, TheLadders, and Sesame Street as well as a few select startups, Jeff will cover:\n\n    how recognizing your assumptions increases the speed of finding the right solutions\n    why cross-functional, collaborative teams bring better products to market faster\n    why managing towards outcomes generates better solutions\n    how a Lean UX approach, coupled with Design Thinking, brings out the entire team's creative insights\n\nAbout Jeff Gothelf\n\nJeff Gothelf is a designer & Agile practitioner.
