description: "The Long and Winding Road to Application Logging [A] - Istvan Zoltan Ballok, SAP\n\nThis talk is about our long journey towards a robust and scalable application log ingestion and processing pipeline for SAP Hana Cloud Platform. While we initially paved the way leveraging the streaming feature based on user provided services, it soon became clear that it lacked some usability features. We then decided to switch gears and moved to the Loggregator Firehose, which made life easier for application developers, but required additional effort on our end, especially in large-scale production environments. The lessons we learned (the hard way) on that leg finally convinced us to take a different road again. Next is SLEEVE, a brokered log forwarding service, with features such as quotas and burst limits. Best part is: We plan to make open source.\n\nAbout Istvan Zoltan Ballok\nDeveloper, SAP SE"
