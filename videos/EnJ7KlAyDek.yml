recordingDate: 1579267962
description: "Mark Nottingham\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/32/\n\nMany of the Internet's protocols were designed at a time when no one cared who was watching. That's no longer true, and so the Internet community has put a tremendous amount of effort into making communication between two endpoints *only* between those two endpoints.\r\n\r\nThis talk will recap what's happened so far, explain what's left to do, and explore the larger context, including legal issues, architectural impact, open questions, and limitations.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nFri Jan 17 10:45:00 2020 at Room 7"
