description: "This is the story of a new browser with a complicated legacy. It’s a story about making new friends without alienating old acquaintances. Most of all, it’s a story about innovating without breaking the Web. This is the story of Microsoft Edge, the new browser in Windows 10, how it came to be, what separates it from Internet Explorer and what that means for web developers. It’s a tale of epic proportions with a happy ending that is really only the beginning.\n\nIntro music by @halfbyte"
