description: "Even shops that think they  get  performance often display blind spots in the practice of performance across the team. Often there’s one isolated engineer who is the performance person. Awareness of performance techniques is not spread across the team, and antipatterns such as  tuning by folklore  come to dominate. This session explains how to recognize warning signs in your engineering culture and how to move to a more mature performance culture—how to regard performance as a conversation between engineers and between different parts of the organization. These approaches can lead teams to a view of performance that is far more quantitative and repeatable than the current state of the art as practiced by most companies.\n\n\nAuthor:\nBen Evans\nBen Evans has lived in \"Interesting Times\" in technology - he was the lead performance testing engineer for the Google IPO, worked on the initial UK trials of 3G networks with BT, built award-winning websites for some of Hollywood's biggest hits of the 90s, rearchitected and reimagined technology helping some of the most vulnerable people in the UK and has worked on everything from some of the UKs very first ecommerce sites, through to multi-billion dollar currency trading systems.\nHe helps to run the London Java Community, and represents the JUG on the Java SE/EE Executive Committee. His first book \"The Well-Grounded Java Developer\" (with Martijn Verburg) has just been published by Manning.\nView more trainings by Ben Evans at https://www.parleys.com/author/ben-evans\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
