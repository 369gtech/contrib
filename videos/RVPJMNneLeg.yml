description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: Canonical - Beyond Kubernetes: Universal operators from bare metal to containers.   \n\n Universal operators take the operator concept beyond Kubernetes, enabling a consistent approach to automating infrastructure and applications, from bare metal to virtual machines and containers.  Join our demo and see us utilise universal operators to help data scientists manage their AI/ML pipelines - from Ceph to Kubernetes, and from workstations to production. The Python operator framework (structured to easily write universal operators) provides a single, coherent approach to abstracting complexity across the hardware stack and software lifecycle, enabling businesses to focus on innovation. \n\nhttps://sched.co/fezZ"
