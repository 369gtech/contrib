description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nIn this talk we will compare three techniques for meta-programming in Scala: macros, shapeless, and code generation. Through a sequence of simple examples we will attempt to characterise the relative pros and cons of each technique, where they are most appropriate, and where they might turn around and bite you.\n\nWe can solve many Scala programming problems using simple tools: algebraic data types, higher order functions, and type classes. Sometimes our code can become verbose or unwieldy, and we have to search for ways to make it cleaner and more maintainable.\n\n\"Meta-programming\" is a broad term describing techniques for generating code using code. It often provides the key to eliminating boilerplate, but the meta programming techniques listed above could not be more different. Identify the best meta-programming technique can be they key to saving hours of frustration attempting to go down blind alleys. This is the problem we will solve in this talk.\n\nThe talk is aimed at intermediate Scala developers who have a basic awareness of each technique. You don't need to know shapeless or macro programming to benefit."
