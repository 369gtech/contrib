description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nDepending on who you talk to, either God or “the devil” may “in the details.” At Sarofsky, they use animation, visual effects, computer graphics and live-action to collaborate with clients, from concept to delivery, producing work that aims to be visceral, innovative and diverse. That work crosses all platforms, including commercials, TV and film main title sequences and web efforts. In each and every studio collaboration, they must be the masters of details – but as they’ve learned (sometimes the hard way), those thoughtful realms that span from the tedious to the sublime are opportunities for awesomeness. In this presentation, this one-of-a-kind professional will highlight some of the more dramatic instances where attention-to-detail made her projects, her company and their collective work absolutely spectacular. Naturally, the keys include creative vision – and highly collaborative work environments.\n\nErin Sarofsky\nPresident, Owner, Executive Creative Director, Sarofsky Corp\nhttps://twitter.com/erinsarofsky\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
