description: "Deep Dive: Cluster Lifecycle SIG (Cluster API) - Jason DeTiberus, VMware & Hardik Dodiya, SAP \n\nThe Cluster Lifecycle SIG is the Special Interest Group that is responsible for building the user experience for deploying and upgrading Kubernetes clusters. Our mission is examining how we should change Kubernetes to make it easier to operate. In this deep dive, we will examine how the Cluster API simplifies the cluster management experience for cluster operators by enabling consistent machine management across environments, and bringing declarative upgrades to Kubernetes clusters. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPkR"
