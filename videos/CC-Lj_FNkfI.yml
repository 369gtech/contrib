title: 'Running Persistent Data in a Multi-Cloud Architecture'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601026081
description: "A multi-cloud architecture has recently become imperative for businesses to build a robust disaster recovery and business continuity strategy. And yet, the journey to multi-cloud is confusing to navigate, especially when choosing which workloads to deploy and where. This problem is exacerbated by introducing persistent workloads into the mix. How should data be replicated? How will hardware/distance between data centers impact performance/SLOs?\n\nIn order to construct a multi-cloud strategy for persistent data that best fits your needs, you must step back and evaluate the objectives to achieve. At VMware, weâ€™ve helped several customers build, run, and manage multi-cloud data workloads. In this talk, we will cover: factors to evaluate in order to handle persistent data in a multi-cloud environment, and choosing which ones matter to you; architectural best practices to help you simplify your multi-cloud strategy; and customer use cases where these practices are applied at scale.\n\nAditya Tripathi: Product Manager at VMware\nJudy Wang: Product Manager at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/running-persistent-data-in-a-multicloud-architecture"
