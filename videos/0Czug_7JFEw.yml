description: "Europe’s Leading Laravel Conference\nBlind-bird Tickets 2020 Available\nhttps://laracon.eu/2020/tickets\n\nEuropean customers prefer other payment methods than Laravel Cashier currently offers. I’ve spent a while looking into current Cashier solutions, other packages, and tried to hack these to better fit the European market. It seemed impossible to find a solution that offered Europe-specific payment methods and advanced subscription features in a single package. So I ended up crafting an entirely new Cashier package myself. In this talk I’ll show you how you can use this new Laravel Cashier package to let your customers pay for a recurring subscription using the payment method of their choice."
