description: 'Do you find yourself needing to “check” something in production immediately after go live? Do you work as a designer immersed in UI and/or UX? Or perhaps you work as a software developer or product owner? Without realizing it, you may be performing the role of a software tester in addition to your primary role. Perhaps you want to learn a bit about software testing without entirely becoming a professional software tester. Karen outlines specific areas where UX and testing collaborate well together. She explores how the UX tools of storyboarding and personas can pair with Exploratory Testing and “tour” testing. If testing is part of what you or your team need to juggle to “make it happen” come attend this session.'
