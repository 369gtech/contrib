recordingDate: 1410616944
description: 'Many functional programming languages like Erlang, F# and Scala make heavy use of actor based concurrency. Functional programming and actors fit together like peas in a pod. While actors make things easier designing and architecting systems with them as the fundamental unity of concurrency remains a dark art to many. In this talk I will walk you through the steps required to properly decompose a problem and architect a solution with actors in mind.'
