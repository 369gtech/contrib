description: 'This is a little rant about my rediscovery of just how much I can get done with the unix shell and a few tools. Working at the command line is an unexploited resource that too many developers have forgotten. We’re too easily seduced by hipster frameworks designed to address much bigger problems, and we’ve become too comfortable in our full-screen IDEs. These days, I find it easier and more effective to return to old-style tools that I can compose together and interact with quickly. You have nothing to lose but your tool chains!'
