title: 'GopherCon 2021: Linus Lee - When Toy Languages Grow Up'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639792316
description: "What features would you choose to put in a programming language made just for yourself? \n\nIn 2019, I wrote myself a toy programming language in Go called Ink. Though I didn’t predict it at the time, in the next two years since, I’ve written thousands of lines of Ink programs to build compilers, ray tracers, web apps, and personal dashboards touched by tens of thousands of people. Writing and maintaining my own language also helped me level up as an engineer to understand and appreciate systems underlying my work at a much deeper level. \n\nIn this talk, I will guide you through how you can (and why you should) build a small programming language of your own!"
