title: 'Events on the outside, on the inside and at the core'
recordingDate: 1456226140
description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nEvents on the outside, on the inside and at the core\n\nThis presentation looks at the importance of events and the role that they play in applications. We describe how events are a key application integration mechanism and how they are used by applications to communicate with the outside world. You will learn how the microservices inside a system can use events to maintain data consistency. We discuss how easy it is to implement both of these mechanisms by developing your core business logic using an event-centric approach known as event sourcing.\n\nChris Richardson\n\nChris Richardson is a developer and architect. He is a Java Champion, a JavaOne rock star and the author of POJOs in Action, which describes how to build enterprise Java applications with frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate. Chris was also the founder of the original CloudFoundry.com, an early Java PaaS for Amazon EC2. He is the creator of microservices.io and is working on his third startup: a platform for developing reactive microservices."
