language: English
recordingDate: 1447230489
description: "In this talk we will give an overview of the tools available for making living documentation, bridging the gap between requirements and tests.\n\nBuilding great software requires a thorough understanding of the real needs of our customer. Techniques such as ATDD, BDD and Specification by Example help us understand the requirements by describing how the software has to behave in a language understood by all stakeholders. These specifications are made executable; creating automated acceptance tests. This suite of executable specifications forms the living documentation of the software system as it is guaranteed to be up to date.\n\nThere are several tools available that can help you with this. Well known examples are: Cucumber, JBehave, Fitnesse, â€¦ Finding out which tool is the best fit for your use case is essential to success.\n\nThis talk will give an overview of the tools available in this area. What is the general idea behind them? How do they differ? We will demonstrate how they can be used to bridge the gap between the customer and the development team."
