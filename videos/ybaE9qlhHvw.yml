title: 'CppCon 2017: Arthur O''Dwyer “A Soupçon of SFINAE”'
language: English
recordingDate: 1509211753
description: "Presentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nFollowing on Arthur's \"Template Normal Programming\" from CppCon 2016, this will be a concise cookbook of SFINAE recipes — ways of getting the compiler to do one thing in one circumstance and another thing in another circumstance. The recipes presented will include: \n- Partial specialization of struct templates \n- std::bool_constant \n- std::conditional_t \n- Expression SFINAE on return types (using decltype) \n- Expression SFINAE in a defaulted template type parameter \n- std::enable_if_t as a defaulted template type parameter \n- Tag dispatch on std::true_type and std::false_type \n- \"Meta-tag-dispatch\" on true and false as template non-type parameters \n- priority_tag?N? for tag dispatch with \"fallback\" cases \n- bool_if_t as a template non-type parameter \nIn each case, we'll show a real code example where the recipe is the clearest and best way to get the job done. This will draw on Arthur's recent \"STL From Scratch\".\n— \nArthur O'Dwyer: Nominum, Core Engineering\n\nArthur O'Dwyer worked for many years at Green Hills Software, making the world's most optimizing C and C++ compilers. Now he works at Nominum in San Francisco. Arthur is the showrunner of the Bay Area C++ meetup, which meets practically every week these days.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
