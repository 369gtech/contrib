description: "http://strataconf.com/\nThere's been a huge amount of progress in recent years in developing distributed systems that are resilient to all sorts of faults. However, there's one critical category of errors that has largely been ignored: human error. The scope and potential impact of human error is massive: deployed bugs, accidentally deleting data, accidentally DDOS'ng important internal services, and so on. Designing for human fault-tolerance leads to important conclusions on the fundamental ways data systems should be architected.\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/strata2013/public/schedule/detail/27610"
