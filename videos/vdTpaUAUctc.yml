It is one of the most popular libraries in the Java community. The popularity of Twitter4J is supported not only by the huge adoption of the Twitter API, but also by it’s simple, clean and easy-to-lean API design. The library design inspired many other REST API wrapper libraries such as Weibo4J, Fitbit4J, and Facebook4J. In this session, you’ll learn the key to make your library fun to use, easy to lean, and even extensible."
