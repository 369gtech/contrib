description: "Take a Free introductory instructor-led Live class at : \nhttp://www.edureka.co/courses/enroll/android-for-beginners\n\nMy Intoruction : I have more than 14 years of experience in the IT industry . I am a Group Project Manager working in one of the top 2 IT companies in India.\n\nMy Project : As part of the project, I have developed an application through which user can choose and buy books online.\n\nSmall details of Activities:\n\nMainActivity.java\nThis is the entry point to the application. This class displays the initial login/register page to the client. If the client is an existing customer, he/she enters the emailid/password and then presses the login button. If the client is a new user, he/she will press the register button to get themselves registered to use the application. \n\nLogin.java\nThis class is called as an intent from the MainActivity class. This in turn calls a PHP code GETUSERS.php which takes the email id entered by user as the input and retrieves the corresponding password. If the retrieved password matches with the one entered by the user, the GetListofBooks class is called and the user is shown a screen with the list of books to choose.\n\nRegister.java\nThis class is called when the user pressed the \"Sign Up\" button. User is shown a screen where he/she can enter email id and password to get registered. Once registration is successful, the GetListofBooks class is called and the user is shown a screen with the list of books to choose.\n\nGetListofBooks.java\nThis class calls the GETBOOKS.php program to retrieve the list of books from the database and populate the Spinner . User can select a book from the Spinner and add it to the cart. When user presses the Add Cart button, the AddCart class is called.\n\nAddCart.java\nThe AddCart class allows the user to specify the number of copies of the book he/she wants to buy, once the user specifies the number of copies, he or she clicks on Payment Details and is directed to the payment screen where the user provides the necessary credit card information and then clicks on proceed to checkout button. The is the last step in the shopping process. Once the user presses the button, the Checkout.java program is called.\n\nCheckout.java\nThis class takes all the order details as input from the user and calls the ORDER.php program. This program creates the order record in the database and upon successful creation of the order throws a success message to the user. On this screen, the user can press the OK button that will direct the user back to the screen where the list of books are dispalyed in the spinner. User can choose another book and can repeat the entire checkout process\n\nHow I have handled the images : I converted the image to bytearray and stored it as BLOB in the database. While displaying the image, I have converted the bytearray back to image\n\n\nWidgets used:\nBelow are the list of widgets used in the application\nImageView\nTextView\nButton\nProgressBar\nSpinner\nEditText\nImageButton\n\nLayouts used\nRelativeLayout\nLinearLayout\n\nFor the spinner I have used a custom layout to adjust the text size and color of the Spinner\n\nby - Rajib Deb.\n\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \nhttp://www.edureka.co\nVisit - http://www.edureka.co/courses/enroll/android-for-beginners"
