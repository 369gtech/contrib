The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nImplementing a Consumer Focused SLA for a Kubernetes Based PaaS - Shrenik Dedhia, Box \n\nBox's (internal) Platform as a Service empowers other Box teams to deliver 100's of micro services, on 1000's of hosts, across 10,000's of pods. As they scaled to support a large number of micro services and clusters, they ran into several scaling challenges around both the control and data planes. In order to deliver a production-grade platform, they realized the need for a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for their platform to not only demonstrate availability for infrastructure, but also \"value\" for a consumer, and serve as a benchmark to prioritize those challenges.   In this talk, Shrenik Dedhia will present how their team approached the problem of defining a SLA, principles used, options explored, path chosen, and future work to improve the platform's availability from ~99.4% to ~99.99%, thereby improving the overall availability of micro services that power Box.com. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaZZ"
