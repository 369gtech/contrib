description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nThe C and C++ programming languages are rife with spiky pits, hairpin curves, and loaded footguns, leading industries working with critical systems to embrace strict standards that aim to reduce the amount of damage that can be done with the awesome powers available to them when using these languages.\n\nThis session will briefly review what sorts of standards exist in the public today, leading into a serious critique of the more foolish and user-unfriendly aspects of these standards, and finally closing with an optimistic view of “the good parts” of the same.\n— \nMichael Price\nSynopsys, Inc.\nSenior Software Engineer\nMichael Price has developed and taught C++ for more than a decade and has been an active participant in WG21 since 2014, allocating most of his committee-time to EWG and the Reflection Study Group. He professes interest in making C++ \"safer\" to use through language and library design, automation, testing, and education. His past work includes enterprise-grade screen sharing applications, ABI-safe C++ component design, network protocol design, software development utilities, large-scale build and test automation, C/C++ compiler front-end development for static analysis tools, and a smidge of management experience.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
