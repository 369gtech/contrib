recordingDate: 1523428138
description: "The path to running a successful agency is riddled with obstacles, hoops to jump through, and laws to comply with - and that's all before you do the actual work. How about some real world advice from someone who transitioned from being a fledgling freelancer to a successful agency owner? It only took a decade\_of starts, stops, misfires and outright guesswork to get here.\n\nThis session is less of a success story and more of a guide to help would-be entrepreneurs and newly-minted agencies get started on the right foot. Rather than being a deep-dive into the HOW, this session will address the WHAT\_and WHY\_of the most critical considerations.\n\nAttend this session and you'll come away armed to the teeth with (most) everything you need to run a successful digital agency.\_\n\nSome topics we'll cover:\n\nCritical must-haves right out of the gate. What you need and don't need.\nStrategies on transitioning from a one-man band to a team of producers.\nTools of the trade: building proposals, tracking expenses, running payroll.\nAttracting the right talent.\nBuilding culture."
