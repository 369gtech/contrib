description: "In this talk we will live-code in less than 15 mn a mobile application displaying the ISS position on a map in real time. Impossible? Not with the right tools! On one hand, Streamdata.io and its JavaScript SDK which is able to turn any API into a stream of data in less than 10 lines of code and will give us the ISS position as if we were of board. On the other hand, Ionic, the powerful hybrid mobile framework which will help us to build a highly interactive application, available for all platforms, in less time than it takes to say. I take your bet!\n\nAudrey is Developer Relations at Streamdata.io. She’s a passion driven developer with experience in both web frontend and backend development, specialised in APIs and BigData. Heavily involved in the European wide Java Community, she’s part of Devoxx4Kids, a not-for-profit global initiative to get children coding."
