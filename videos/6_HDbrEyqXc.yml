language: English
recordingDate: 1636643492
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso, Spain Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta and Regional Director for UK South discuss their journey from expert engineers to \"terrible\" managers. This is a common phenomenon experienced by many software engineers as they evolve in their careers. What are the challenges in this transition? Is this a natural evolution? What is the skill mismatch? How to cope with stress and pressure? Those are just a few topics covered in this very insightful episode. \n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
