description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nDecember 16, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nTITLE: Using Google SketchUp with Google Earth for Scientific Applications\r\nPresented by: Declan De Paor\r\n\r\nABSTRACT: Numerous scientists and engineers have discovered the value of the Google Earth application and Keyhole Markup Language as a medium for research and teaching in earth science, life science, and environmental science. Google SketchUp, on the other hand, has been used mainly for designing buildings and for recreational 3D modeling.This talk demonstrates the use of Google SketchUp to create Collada models that have Earth and Planetary Science applications on the virtual globe. Sample applications include plate tectonics, geophysics, atmospheric science, and the generation of paleoDEMs that represent the earth's landscape during previous geological periods."
