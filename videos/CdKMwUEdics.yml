description: "WebGL is the new standard for 3D rendering on the web. With WebGL, developers can create games, animations, data visualizations, product displays and more using only Javascript, a web browser and a standard web technology stack. This webcast with Web3D pioneer and 3D expert Tony Parisi will introduce WebGL development concepts, including graphics, animation, interactivity, 2D/3D integration, production tools and deployment. The session will feature several examples and techniques from Tony's just-released O'Reilly Media book, WebGL Up and Running.\n\nAbout Tony Parisi\n\nTony Parisi is an entrepreneur and career CTO/architect. He has developed international standards and protocols, created noteworthy software products, and started and sold technology companies. Tony's passion for innovating is exceeded only by his desire to bring coolness and fun to the broadest possible audience.\n\nTony is perhaps best known for his work as a pioneer of 3D standards for the web. He is the co-creator of VRML and X3D, ISO standards for networked 3D graphics. He also co-developed SWMP, a real-time messaging protocol for multi-user virtual worlds. Tony continues to build community around innovations in 3D as the co-chair of the WebGL Meetup and a founder of the Rest3D working group.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
