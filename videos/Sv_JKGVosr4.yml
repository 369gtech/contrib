title: 'Breaking Down Your Build: Architectural Patterns For A More Efficient Pipeline - Abraham Marin-Perez'
recordingDate: 1553686608
description: "Do you find constantly rebuilding things that don’t need rebuilding? If yes, this talk is for you. The way your codebase is structured impacts what you need to rebuild after each commit, therefore, the codebase needs to be re-architectured with the build pipeline in \nmind. Sometimes you’ll have many responsibilities packed in one module, so you rebuild all of them every time you change one. Or maybe you have a multi-tiered application and adding a feature implies modifying (and rebuilding) all tiers, with cascading effects.\nIn this talk we’ll go over scenarios like this and others, showing how the code can be rewritten in a way that minimises unnecessary rebuilds.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndcporto.com"
