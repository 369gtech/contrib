description: "Slides: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/walking-up-the-spring-for-apache-kafka-stack/SpringCentral/walking-up-the-spring-for-apache-kafka-stack \nSpring provides several projects for Apache Kafka. spring-kafka provides familiar Spring programming paradigms to the kafka-clients library. spring-integration-kafka adds Spring Integration channel adapters and gateways. The kafka binder for spring-cloud-stream provides kafka support to microservices built with Spring Cloud Stream and used in Spring Cloud Data Flow. In this talk, we will take a look at developing applications at each layer of the stack, and discuss how to choose the layer for your application.\n\nSpeakers:\nViktor Gamov\nSolutions Architect, Confluent\nGary Russell\nSr. Staff Software Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
