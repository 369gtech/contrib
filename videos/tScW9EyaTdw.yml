description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nMario Meets the Robocat: Lessons From Dogfooding Tekton - Andrea Frittoli, IBM & Dibyo Mukherjee, Google \n\nTekton is an open-source project providing lightweight reusable Kubernetes native building blocks for CI/CD that can be curated to embody best practices. Tekton, hosted by the CD Foundation, aspires to be the common denominator in CI/CD. At the last Kubecon, the speakers shared their adventures in incrementally adopting Tekton for its own release \"plumbing\". The goal was to ensure that the project was going in the right direction. Since then the speakers have focused their dogfooding efforts on Tekton’s CI needs. They set up event based pipelines to verify pull requests, test infrastructure defined as code, and provide friendly bots. In this talk, the speakers will share their experiences in using Tekton for its own CI/CD -- the challenges they encountered, how the robocat helped overcome them, the lessons learnt along the way, and how those helped shape the roadmap for Tekton.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zej2"
