description: "Try the codelab at https://g.co/dev/codelab-voice-interaction and submit custom voice action ideas at https://g.co/VoiceActionsInterest\n\nWhether your app uses system or custom voice actions (https://g.co/VoiceActions), there might be times when the app would like to ask the user a follow-up question before performing the action. For example, after a music app launches when a user says “play some music”, it may want to ask the user “what genre?” Or when a home automation app hears the user say “OK Google, turn on the lights”, it might want to ask “which room?” The Voice Interaction API lets Android M apps ask follow-up questions like these. \n\n100 Days of Google Dev / 100 developer videos over 100 days / #GoogleDev100 \n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
