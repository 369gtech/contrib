title: 'Eric Portis - Space Cram: Optimizing the Space Jam Website'
language: English
recordingDate: 1511458620
description: "The venerable Space Jam website – built in 1996 and virtually untouched since – stands as a monument to both the web platform’s backwards compatibility and to its experimental youth.\n\nDesigned for dial-up, the site is small, light, and fast – especially when compared to 2017’s multi-megabyte monsters. But contemporary tools offer new opportunities for optimization. In this talk, we’ll try to see just how fast we can make this living relic go."
