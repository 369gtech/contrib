description: "Envato runs a suite of web marketplaces for digital goods at serious scale. Our core Ruby on Rails application is over 10 years old. This codebase has served us well, however its size, complexity and monolithic nature has made it increasingly difficult to move and improve at the pace that we would like.\n\nIn early 2016, Envato reorganised so that our communication structure was more closely aligned with the system structure that we wanted. In other words we deliberately set Conway’s Law against our monolith.\n\nIn this talk I will explore the reasons for the change, the way we went about changing, and see what progress has been made towards the goal.\n\nDeveloper at Envato\n\nI started in I.T. before the term “devops” had been invented to describe what I was doing at Rio Tinto’s HIsmelt R&D Facility in Kwinana. Eventually I made my way into software engineering and Ruby on Rails. I have now been developing web software for more than 15 years in businesses of all sizes.\n\nFor more on YOW!
