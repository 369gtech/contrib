I am enrolled in their live course and my learning experience has been phenomenal. I tried learning Linux Administration on my own but in every attempt i hit a dead end. However, I learned Linux Administration from the very best. The quality and experience of the instructor are excellent and this reflects in his high quality post lecture hands on projects and assignments. I must also take this opportunity to thank the support staff for prompt doubt solving via their student forums. I am a permanent member of theirs and will continue to learn from Edureka.”"
