description: "DevOps Pro Moscow 2016 - Conference for Developers and IT Professionals.\nNovember 15, 2016 | www.devopspro.ru\n\nPrometheus gave us independence of UDP, no complex math in your application, multi-dimensional data by adding labels to values (no more server names in your metric names!), baked in monitoring capabilities, integration with many common systems, and official clients for all major programming languages. In short: a unified way to gather, process, and present metrics."
