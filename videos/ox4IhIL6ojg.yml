description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nAre type safing your configuration? You are probably not, even if you think you do. Process calls? Rest calls? In this session we'll live code our way into type safing everything - conveniently and in the most simple ways. No implicits, no shapeless, no type-level programming, just vanilla Scala code. \n\nAs it turns out Typesafe config, pure config, etc are actually not type safe. We'll see why and what to do instead. A different concept can be applied to make process and rest calls joyfully convenient and elegantly type-safe at the same time. To the point that Scala can become the more convenient choice over bash for shell scripting."
