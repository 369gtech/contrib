description: 'Brittany Martin is a Pittsburgh native and relocated to SF a year ago. Since she''s been in SF, she''s graduated from a developer bootcamp and taken a gig at Ninefold as a Rails Support Engineer. Day to day, she talks with advanced Rails developers about performance, bugs and best practices. She is giving a talk at Code & Supply on how supporting developers has pushed her to be a better coder. Hilarity and memes to ensue.'
