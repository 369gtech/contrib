description: "DOES19 Las Vegas — It’s 30 times cheaper to fix a security defect in Development vs. Production, yet Security is often treated as an afterthought and a bottleneck. It doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nJoin DJ Schleen for a hands-on workshop, as he shares tips and best practices for building better software, faster. Attendees will be given a chance to execute an attack against the same CVE that affected Equifax; then use Sonatype's intelligence to understand and remediate the vulnerable libraries and verify the attack no longer works.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
