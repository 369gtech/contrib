title: 'Building Applications with a Graph Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433518587
description: "Graph databases, and Neo4j in particular, are gaining in popularity. Like other NoSQL databases, graph databases enable and force you to think in slightly different ways when building an application. Knowing how to do this can be tricky but is crucial to your application’s success. This session uses the largest in-house application at Neo Technology, the company behind Neo4j, as an example of one way to build an application with a graph database. Neo Technology’s experience of eating its own dog food is not only a display of best practices but also a great story of how the company improved the data model of Neo4j in version 2.0.\n\n\nAuthor:\nTobias Lindaaker\nTobias Lindaaker is a software developer at graph database company Neo Technology, developers of Neo4j--the world’s leading graph database. Tobias has always been a tinkerer, taking things apart to understand how they work and then putting them together again to make them better. When he first encountered Neo4j in 2007, his programming language of choice was Python. In order to make Neo4j and Python play nicely together, Tobias undertook the task of updating Jython to support the language constructs of Python 2.5. His journey has taken him deep within the expanses of Python, Java, the JDK and Hotspot. He has delivered code contributions to each, and holds a bare-metal familiarity of matters from language implementation to concurrency--all which help him drive the machinery of graph databases as a member of the Neo4j core team today.\nView more trainings by Tobias Lindaaker at https://www.parleys.com/author/tobias-lindaaker\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
