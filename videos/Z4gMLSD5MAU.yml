title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Decouple your Twig from PHP and make Frontenders happy!'
recordingDate: 1506427876
description: "There are quite a lot of talks recently around decoupling (via API) and component libraries (Pattern Lab). But this session is different, it's about:\n\nDecoupling Twig and PHP.\nRendering Twig templates on node.js server — native Frontend environment.\nUsing Fractal as a component library.\nAs you would already imagined, that allows us to create, render and test our components w/o any PHP! Pure Twig running in pure node.js but still compatible with Drupal — sounds like a dream.\n\nCome on our session, enjoy the power of Twig+Fractal+node.js and become 100% freshly baked decoupled Frontender!"
