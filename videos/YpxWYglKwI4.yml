description: "Ivan Morgillo, Android Engineer at Clue\n\n“When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing. Now, God only knows.”\n\nWe write a lot of code every day, but we spend an incredible amount of time reading code and if it's cryptic it's even more time consuming.\n\nReadable code is critical for every code base. It doesn't matter if you work alone or in a team, if you can't figure out what's going on in a snippet when everything is cool, the moment the pressure goes up you better brace yourself!\n\nI'm gonna share some habits and tips that are part of my daily work life and that can help to create a healthy code base and a pleasant work environment."
