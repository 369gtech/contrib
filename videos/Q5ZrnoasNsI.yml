title: 'Lambda? You Keep Using that Letter by Kevlin Henney'
recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "Lambdas. All the cool kid languages have them. But does ‘lambda’ mean what Java, JavaScript, etc. mean by ‘lambda’? Where did lambdas come from? What were they originally for? What is their relationship to data abstraction? Does having lambdas make a language more functional or, as in the case of Java, more object-oriented?\n\nIn this session we will look into the history, the syntax and the uses of lambdas, the way in which lambda constructs in Java and other languages do (or do not) match the original construct introduced in lambda calculus, and bust a few myths about lambdas and programming paradigms along the way!\n\nKevlin Henney, Curbralan\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
