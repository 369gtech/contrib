recordingDate: 1571649979
description: 'Is your phone ready to do machine learning? Yes, yes it is. It’s a case closed then? No, not really. The question right now is how to do it, and why it’s crucial to do it on a mobile device. In my talk I’ll make a brief introduction to Tensorflow Lite, I’ll show you what do we use it for at Edward.ai, what problems we faced, and how we approached them. I’ll finish up with a summary of what’s currently going on in the field of mobile machine learning and what we can expect to happen in the near future.'
