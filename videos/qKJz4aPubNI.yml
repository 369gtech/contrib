description: "Christopher Biggs\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/150/\nIoT has been in the news for the wrong reasons, with poorly designed\r\nand managed IoT devices being blamed for contribiting to denial of service\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nThis presentation covers\r\n\r\n  * risks to your own business from IoT takeup and how to avoid them\r\n  * how to be a good citizen by ensuring your devices are not a risk to others\r\n  * how to run your own IoT control and monitoring hub in the cloud, and \r\n    to coerce incompatible devices into working together.\r\n  * points to consider when selecting IoT products\r\n\r\nIoT is immature - many devices are not as secure as they could be.  \r\nI cover how to structure your network in order to reduce the attack \r\nsurface presented by your devices.\r\n\r\nIoT is faceless, many devices are unobtrusive and you may not notice\r\nif they \"go rogue\".   I offer advice on how to establish a management regime\r\nto limit the damage a misbehaving device can do.\r\n\r\nIoT is fragmented, everyone is scrabbling to be the market leader, so\r\nmany products do not work well together.  This means each device may want \r\nto talk to its own cloud service.  I cover how to bridge uncooperative \r\nproducts to narrow or eliminate need for direct internet access, and offer\r\nadvice on strategies to build a cooperating whole."
