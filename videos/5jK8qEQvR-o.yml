description: "Talk 1 by Alexis Toumi : Language Processing on Quantum Hardware with DisCoPy\n\nAbstract: String diagrams are a mathematical tool that describe the information flow both in categorical quantum mechanics (CQM) and natural language processing (NLP). DisCoPy (https://github.com/oxford-quantum-group/discopy) is a Python implementation of string diagrams, which we used to translate the grammatical structure of natural language onto the architecture of a quantum circuit: a proof-of-concept for quantum natural language processing (QNLP). I’ll give a short introduction to the category theory behind DisCoPy, followed by a demo where I’ll teach a quantum computer how to say “Alice loves Bob”.\n\nBio: I’m a PhD student at the Quantum Group of the Computer Science depatment in Oxford, under the supervision of Prof. Bob Coecke. I work at the intersection of natural language processing, quantum computing and category theory (a.k.a. general abstract nonsense). I’m also a Python programmer with some background in data science and deep learning for medieval paleography.\n\nTalk 2 by Procheta Sen: Socially Responsible AI: Cognitive Bias-Aware Multi-Objective Learning\n\nAbstract: Human society had a long history of suffering from cognitive biases leading to social prejudices and mass injustice.\nThe prevalent existence of cognitive biases in large volumes of historical data can pose a threat of being manifested as unethical and seemingly inhumane predictions as outputs of AI systems trained on such data.\nTo alleviate this problem, we propose a bias-aware multi-objective learning framework that given a set of identity attributes (e.g. gender, ethnicity etc.) and a subset of sensitive categories of the possible classes of prediction outputs, learns to reduce the frequency of predicting certain combinations of them, e.g. predicting stereotypes such as `most blacks use abusive language', or `fear is a virtue of women'. Our experiments conducted on an emotion prediction task with balanced class priors shows that a set of baseline bias-agnostic models exhibit cognitive biases with respect to gender, such as women are prone to be afraid whereas men are more prone to be angry. In contrast, our proposed bias-aware multi-objective learning methodology is shown to reduce such biases in the predicted emotions.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06618.pdf\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
