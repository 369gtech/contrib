description: "Talk: A competitive food retail architecture with microservices\n\nTwo years ago we started refactoring a monolithic shop into an e-commerce microservice platform. By now we’ve grown to 150 developers. In this talk we want to share our journey and the lessons we’ve learned the hard way.\nAfter agreeing on a few terms about microservices we want to provide some answers to problems we ran into:\n\n- What kind of organizational structure do you need to reflect the vertical boundaries in software while growing fast?\n- How do you define bounded contexts with many teams and features? Are there ways to guide your teams and enable autonomy on all levels in your organization?\n- Can you enable your teams to develop and deploy independently all the way to production?\n- How does asynchronous communication with Apache Kafka change the way you think about your entities?\n- How can multiple microservices contribute to the same pages? (And why you might have to implement this twice...)\n\nAs you see we will share our interpretation of a micro service architecture where developers stay in the driver’s seat and have a fair degree of independence and participation.\n\nSpeaker:  Sebastian Gauder - software architect @REWE digital\n\nSebastian works as a software architect at REWE digital. His special interest applies to technical and organizational structures that enable teams to develop software autonomously."
