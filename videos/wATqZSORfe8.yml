description: "Watch the lecture by Marcos Placona! Android security is nowhere near where it should be. I have been able to hack and get sensitive information from a few different apps and Iâ€™m just an amateur hacker at best. In this session we will explore a number of ways an Android app can be exploited and most importantly methods to stop that.\n\nThis spring over 9400 IT specialists took part in Code Europe, the largest programming conference in Poland! Follow our website for more details: https://www.codeeurope.pl/en The next edition of Code Europe is coming in December!"
