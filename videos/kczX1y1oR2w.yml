title: 'Where Do Libraries Come From? by Gil Tene'
recordingDate: 1550058156
description: "Have you ever wondered where all that useful code that we all rely on comes form? Have you ever wanted to build a library that would actually get used by other people? Have you ever wondered if, and when, it makes sense to do so?\n\nIt is the speaker's opinion that most libraries are [initially] created by accident. And that while most will die young, there may be much to learn from the ones that survive, thrive, and becoming truly useful to others.\n\nWe will walk through some of his first hand experiences in how this sort of accidental creation comes to be. From stumbling across cases and patterns in repeated work, to building code meant for others to use, through finding out if it made sense to do so, and on to what things look like when some of the stuff you build actually gets used."
