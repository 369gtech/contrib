description: "by Thomas Schwinge\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UA2.118/openacc.webm\n\n\nProven in production use for decades, GCC (the GNU Compiler Collection) offers C, C++, Fortran, and other compilers for a multitude of target systems.  Over the last few years, we -- formerly known as \"CodeSourcery\", now a group in \"Mentor, a Siemens Business\" -- added support for the directive-based OpenACC programming model.  Requiring only few changes to your existing source code, OpenACC allows for easy parallelization and code offloading to accelerators such as GPUs.  We will present a short introduction of GCC and OpenACC, implementation status, examples, and performance results. \"OpenACC is a user-driven directive-based performance-portable parallel programming model designed for scientists and engineers interested in porting their codes to a wide-variety of heterogeneous HPC hardware platforms and architectures with significantly less programming effort than required with a low-level model.\" \n\nRoom: UA2.118 (Henriot)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 15:00:00+01"
