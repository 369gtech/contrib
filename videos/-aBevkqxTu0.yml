What is shared element transitions.\n2. Advantages of having a smooth continuous experience.\n3. Why is this a talk? Does React Native support true shared elements?\n4. Overview on what we are building.\n5. Brief details on the approach where I will explain the clever trick of smoke and mirror.\n6. Implementing Entry and Exit animation during transition.\n7. Implementing Transition layer for the shared element.\n8. Will then talk about ways to implement animations in transition layer and discuss the performance of both\n9. One way is to interpolating on the width, height, top and left and analyze its performance and why useNativeDriver cannot be used\n10. Another way is to interpolating on transform and using useNativeDriver\n\nThe speech was given on 23rd May 2018 at Tech Plus II Stage during infoShare 2018.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/"
