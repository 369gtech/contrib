description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nMove semantics, introduced with C++11, has become a hallmark of modern C++ programming. However, it also complicates the language in some ways. For thisu reason it is key to understand move semantics (it purpose, its basic rules, and how to use them in practice).\n\nThis session teaches the basics of C++ move semantics. Based on the basic principles, it motivates and explains move semantics so that you as an application programmer you can use move semantics correctly und understand its use better.\n\n---\nNicolai Josuttis\n\nNicolai Josuttis (http://www.josuttis.com) is well known in the programming community because he not only speaks and writes with authority (being the (co-)author of the world-wide best sellers The C++ Standard Library (www.cppstdlib.com), C++ Templates (www.tmplbook.com), C++17 - The Complete Guide (www.cppstd17.com), C++ Move Semantics - The Complete Guide (www.cppmove.com), and SOA in Practice), but is also an innovative presenter, having talked at various conferences and events.\nHe has been an active member of the C++ standards committee for more than 20 years. \n\n---\nVideos Streamed & Edited by Digital Medium: http://online.digital-medium.co.uk\n\nThe CppCon YouTube Channel Is Sponsored By:\nJetBrains : http://jb.gg/cpptools \nSonarSource:  https://www.sonarsource.com/"
