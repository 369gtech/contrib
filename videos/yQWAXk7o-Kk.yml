It can serve as a doorway to explore realms of unlimited creativity, vocal power, and inner wisdom. Through resonance and vibration, the wave forms and harmonics created by the crystal singing bowls helps return us to a state of our natural rhythm and frequency.\r\n\r\nCrystal Overtones Can Help:\r\nReduce Stress \r\nStrengthen the Immune System\r\nStimulate Endorphins \r\nFacilitate Creativity\r\nBalance the Energy in the Body\r\nClear Unwanted Thought Patterns\r\nMove into Conscious Creation with Joy and Certainty\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Bruce Manaka\r\nBruce Manaka, author of \"Flights of a Runaway Monk\" spent 19 years in a monastery living a life of meditation and contemplation. In his therapeutic sound work, he combines the ancient vocal techniques of overtone singing with the beautiful tones of quartz crystal singing bowls to create dynamic vibratory environments that raises the energy level of everyone present. He will experientially show how sound and its overtones can create positive and profound changes on all levels.\r\n\r\n\"To me, artistic creation is born of deep inner listening. It is about the energies of the artist embracing the dark mystery that we are, giving form and substance to what wishes to be expressed. And with deep listening comes a kind of surrender, an open window allowing the artist to \"see\" and experience universal patterns of creation. The Kabbalah is one such dynamic pattern, guiding the artist/seer inwardly to deeper and deeper levels of mystery until he is face to face with the Unspeakable Beauty. He then begins to understand that the underlying fabric of this Beauty is fathomless Love, and that its tapestry can be seen everywhere and in all things.\"\r\n\r\nSince making his transition from the monastery, Bruce has married and now lives in Northern California with his lovely wife Patty."
