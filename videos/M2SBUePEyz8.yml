description: "SREcon16 Europe - Downtime Budgets\n\nCory Lueninghoener, Los Alamos National Laboratory\n\nThe concept of the error budget is a great way to hack SLAs and make them into a positive tool for system engineers. But how can you take the same idea from a world that handles millions of transactions in a day to one that handles hundreds? High Performance Computing jobs run for hours, days, or weeks at a time, resulting in unique challenges related to system availability, maintenance, and experimentation. This talk will explore a way to modify the error budget concept to fit in an HPC environment by applying the same idea to cluster outages, both planned and unplanned, and to ultimately give customers the best computing environment possible.\n\nView the full SREcon16 Europe Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program"
