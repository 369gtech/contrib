description: "Yoshio Terada, Senior Cloud Developer Advocate, Microsoft Corporation\nMaaya Ishida, Cloud Solution Architect, OpenStream.Inc.,\n\nThis session is a case study on how to get started with Kubernetes and Docker for production environments. The speaker and his team sat down with several large enterprises and did a five-day hack-a-thon in which they helped them learn how to use the latest Kubernetes tooling and approaches. They focused on how to migrate from on-premises to Kubernetes, how to perform blue/green and canary deployments with Istio, how to create CI/CD environments within a few hours, how to troubleshoot Kubernetes workloads, and how to create highly available and secure environments. This session shows our experiences of this hack-a-thon how to properly make the leap to Kubernetes. Finally, we'll see a live-demonstration that manages Kubernetes clusters by text and voice messages."
