description: "Inspired by Ramsey Nasser’s Arabic programming language Qalb, a functional, Lisp-style language, I created Noor, an Algol-based, imperative Arabic programming language. Arabic is my first language, and I wouldn’t have learned to program had I not moved to the US and learned English. I created Noor with the intention of it being a language for middle schoolers and high schoolers. In this talk I’ll share what I learned about creating an Arabic programming language and how Arabic text really works on your computer.\n\nEVENT:\n\n!!Con 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAhmed Abdalla\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCxqAr7LjW8"
