title: '#HITB2021SIN D1T1 Practical AI Red Teaming: A Facial Recognition Case Study - Alex Polyakov'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630491217
description: "acial recognition technology has grown in prevalence, and today you can find it in different areas of human activity, including social media, smart homes, ATMs, and stores. Recently, researchers have discovered that AI algorithms are prone to adversarial attacks which involve changing an image and staying undetectable to the human eye. While the use of facial recognition systems provides less physical contact during the pandemic, this technology is far from perfect in terms of cybersecurity. Our objectives were to find out whether threats described in academic papers actually exist and how real AI solutions can be attacked.\n\nWe will show the details of a AI Red Teaming engagement for facial recognition software and hardware solutions to identify the most critical ways of attacking facial recognition engine.\n\nTo be able to make a proper test, we created our own attack taxonomy and evaluated the effectiveness of recent approaches to attacking facial recognition systems. We will present our own research conducted in the real environment with different cameras and algorithms.\n\n=== \n\nAlex Polyakov is a Trusted AI and Cybersecurity expert, founder of Adversa.AI, serial entrepreneur, lecturer, and member of Forbes Technology Council. He has over 18 years of practical experience in cybersecurity. His expertise covers cybersecurity aspects of complex systems and future technologies from AI to Neuroscience and SynthBio. He has presented his research at over 100 conferences in 30+ countries, released two books, and multiple trainings including the first MOOC on AI security."
