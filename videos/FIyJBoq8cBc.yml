description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nSpeaker: John Field, Shawn McKinney\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/a-how-to-guide-to-security-in-the-paas-cloud\nMost developers still deal with application security issues in isolation, without understanding the security of the \"\"full stack\"\". As a result, security is sometimes inconsistent, and can be seen as a barrier to moving applications to the cloud. The session will examine the security of a typical Java Web application in an enterprise deployment. We will then look at what needs to change when that secure Java application is “forklifted” into Cloud Foundry. Finally, we will look at the benefits of adopting cloud native security protocols, such as OAuth2 and SAML2. The journey will cover 5 common application security architecture patterns taken from real world customer problems. We will compare how the security integration patterns differ between a standalone application and a cloud native application. From legacy enterprise identity management integration to security for microservices, this technical session includes practical, hands-on guidance to properly implementing authentication, authorization, and confidentiality controls using Spring and Cloud Foundry. We have all heard of the idea of the “Full Stack” developer — someone who can understand the application up and down the whole stack. The goal of this session is to describe the full security stack and show how it differs between standalone deployments and a PAAS deployment."
