description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJutta Eckstein - Independent Coach, Consultant & Trainer\n\nABSTRACT\nIn this session, I want to explore how departments like Human Resources, Legal, Marketing, Sales, yet as well Quality Control, or Operations can support and how can they hinder agility. Despite the challenges, the focus is on leveraging the departments in order to become successful. Thus, involving everyone who is affected early on and making them part of the agile approach is crucial. This session is based on my experiences working in large and distributed corporations, yet the variety of the participants' experience will make all the difference.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
