description: "Presented by Eric Gradman at JSLA (js.la) on Thursday May 29th 2015 - The Intel Galileo is a pretty powerful little board. It comes pre-installed with node.js, and you can use it to interface with electronic components. In collaboration with Intel, we developed a kit to acquaint kids with functional programming concepts and basic electronics through artistic expression. The interface is a simple webpage served by the Galileo. Using a Google Blockly graphical interface, kids connect nodes representing graphical elements to nodes representing switches and sliders connected to the Galileo. And just like thatâ€¦ art.\n\n* twitter.com/egradman\n* github.com/egradman"
