title: 'Project Avatar: More Than Just Node.js on the JVMâ€”Java EE Written in JavaScript'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433254925
description: "With its thin-server architecture (TSA, protocol-based-only communication), Project Avatar makes Java EE resources (JPA, JMS, push/REST/socket services, and so on) directly accessible via JavaScript. On the server side (service components), Avatar is based on the Node.js implementation for the JVM (Avatar.js for the Nashorn scripting engine) and thus represents nearly the entire Node.js API and also uses the asynchronous, nonblocking programming model of a single threaded event loop. The client library (view components) provides bindings to HTML5 widgets and is limited to as little JavaScript as possible and only as much as necessary. The demos in this session show how, with a few lines of code, fully Java EE-compliant applications are possible.\n\n\nAuthors:\nHeiko Spindler\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Heiko Spindler at https://www.parleys.com/author/heiko-spindler\n\n Niko Ko?bler\nNiko works as a self-employed software architect and developer for Java and JavaScript enterprise solutions, integrations and web development.
