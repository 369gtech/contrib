language: English
recordingDate: 1433262501
description: "Continuous integration, test-driven development, and continuous delivery or deployment are the primary supporting pillars of successful agile development. Hudson is a full-fledged execution and scheduling engine used by many enterprises today. However, using it not merely as an execution tool but also as a real continuous integration build server means planning and architecting the build units to meet the necessary conditions required to achieve the flow from continuous integration to continuous delivery. This session follows a real-world use case involving the use of  Hudson within Oracle’s own software delivery process to illustrate how this can be achieved.\n\n\nAuthors:\nWinston Prakash\nDr. Winston Prakash is currently an architect at Oracle Corporation.
