description: "It seems like keeping up to date with Java nowadays is an enormous task. Gone is the era of big, delayed Java releases that span years. We're now getting a new major release every six months. What's up with that? You're probably still developing on Java 8, even though Java 13 is already available.   Join this session to get an overview of what's new in Java since Java 8. We'll give an overview of the module system (Java 9), the local-variable type inference feature (Java 10) and the new HttpClient API (Java 11). Expect lots of advice on how to get from Java 8 to Java 11. It's time to embrace the newfound agility of the Java platform!\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
