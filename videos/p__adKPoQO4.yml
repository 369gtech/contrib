description: "There‚Äôs still a ton of AngularJS code out there, but long term support for AngularJS is ending soon. It can be really overwhelming to know how to approach the monumental task of migrating to Angular ‚Äî and if you even should! How do you figure out where to start, which path to take, and whether it‚Äôs even worth it for your company to spend the time and money? Should you use ngUpgrade, Angular Elements, hybrid routing ‚Äî or just rage-flip your desk in frustration and rewrite everything in Perl? Should you rewrite your architecture first or your build process? And how do you show the business side of things that spending hundreds of hours on technical debt is actually worth it ‚Äî even if you‚Äôre not adding any functionality?\n\nIn this talk, you will learn the why and the how of each building block of the upgrade process and how to avoid the ‚Äúupgrade pit of despair.‚Äù This is the meta-level talk I wish I had seen a few of years ago: a toolbox I could use to identify the gaps in our app‚Äôs architecture and tooling, but also how to balance upgrading against our budget and time constraints. You‚Äôll walk away with the tools you need to build a solid, actionable game plan for migrating away from AngularJS and into the new world of Angular.\n\nLearn the best ways to build reliable web applications, write quality code, choose scalable architectures, and create effective automated tests at the Reliable Web Summit this August 26-27, 2021.
