recordingDate: 1526232224
description: "Speakers: Colin Carroll, Karin C. Knudson\n\nAt the end of 2017, there were seven states with ongoing redistricting litigation.  We will discuss a statistical model that the United States Supreme Court declared to be appropriate in cases of racial gerrymandering, and show how it can be implemented and used with the library `PyMC3`.  We will also discuss what the model tells us about racial gerrymandering in North Carolina.\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
