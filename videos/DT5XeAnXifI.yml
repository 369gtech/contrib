description: "RubyConf 2019 - Bridging the Knowledge Gap: Debugging by Mina Slater\n\nWe're usually never get an official lesson in debugging. No one tells us at bootcamp or in online tutorials what to do when our code doesn’t work. It’s one of those learn-it-on-the-job sort of things and comes with experience. As early-career developers, we get a lot of syntax thrown at us when we’re first learning, but in actuality, the majority of our time is spent trying to fix broken code.\n\r\n\nBut why should we slog through it alone? Let’s explore some Ruby/Rails debugging techniques and tools together!\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
