description: "Nishant Totla - Software Engineer, Docker, Inc.\nDrew Erny - Software Engineer, Docker, Inc.\n\nJoin SwarmKit maintainers Drew and Nishant as they showcase features that have made Swarm Mode even more powerful, without compromising the operational simplicity it was designed with. They will discuss the implementation of new features that streamline deployments, increase security, and reduce downtime. These substantial additions to Swarm Mode are completely transparent and straightforward to use, and users may not realize they're already benefiting from these improvements under the hood."
