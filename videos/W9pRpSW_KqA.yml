description: "This is the first video in a 3-part series. In this video, Jarek Wilkiewicz introduces you to the reference architecture for support of Schema.org Actions (http://goo.gl/vw8rOJ) in the context of a specific use case (a music store). The video then then focuses on exposing entities using Schema.org markup with JSON-LD. \n\nThe second video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oOwrBEeQss) introduces data loading and graph processing using Cayley, an open source graph database written in Go (https://github.com/google/cayley). Together, the first and second videos cover ETL for linked data. \n\nThe third video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB94dIamAQc) details activating the small Knowledge Graph stored in Cayley with Schema.org Actions. \n\nAfter watching the videos you will have a solid foundation to embark upon the Google I/O 2014 Actions Codelab (http://goo.gl/4ykgZ6).\n\nSpecial thanks to: https://www.youtube.com/user/dualcoremusic."
