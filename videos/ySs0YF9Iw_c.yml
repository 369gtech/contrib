title: 'Let''s Build a Language Translator! LIVE'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605031003
description: "The specific application of Machine Learning that has always interested me the most is Natural Language Processing. During this live game show, I'll ask 3 NLP questions that you'll need to answer interactively via a link i'll provide. At the end, we'll crown 1 winner. They'll win $500 cash (sent via BTC or ), a freestyle rap performance by me, and early access to my coming game titled Code Royale. If we can get computers to understand and interpret human language as well as we do, then they'll be capable of automating any intellectual task we can conceive of.  Modern NLP curriculums incorporate probability, linear algebra, calculus, part linguistics, and even philosophy. We're going to build a language translator from English to Sanskrit using various deep learning tools and discuss different modern methodologies we could use. \n\nPlease Subscribe! And Like.
