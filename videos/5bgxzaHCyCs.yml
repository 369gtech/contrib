description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2017\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nAligning Organisational & Technical Boundaries to Maximise Team Autonomy — Nick Tune\nAlign your organisational boundaries with the contours in your problem domain and everyone wins. Delivery teams, focused around business outcomes, become highly autonomous and motivated, causing organisation-wide productivity increases.\n\nIn this session, you will learn how to identify boundaries in the fuzzy problem domain, and how to align your organisational boundaries with them. You’ll also see patterns for aligning technical boundaries in the fragmented world of microservices to maximise team autonomy.\n\nNick is passionate about delighting users, creating business impacts, and crafting quality software, placing an equal focus on improving both the execution capabilities and alignment of an organisation. You can find a range of Nick’s opinions and speculations on his blog, covering topics from Continuous Delivery to the Business Model Canvas to polyglot programming.\n\nNick Tune is the co author of Patterns, Principles and Practices of Domain-Driven Design, and someone who doesn’t get out very much... unless he gets kicked out the house by his angry partner."
