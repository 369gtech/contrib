description: "Reject.JS 2014 – Berlin, September 11, 2014\nSlides: https://github.com/mousemke/PunkDIYinDev\n\nPeople are very quick to adopt tools that they have no idea how to fix or what what powers them. By using other tools as an example you can make things that are yours, can be tweaked and fixed specifically for whatever your needs are or will be. (and you might even learn something)\n\nMy talk will focus on the idea of crafting your own solutions. The company I work for has a very DIY approach to everything, despite having over 200 employees. As examples our custom live CSS editor with autocomplete and context highlighting and a custom framework. I will focus not only on the benefits of DIY, but also whether or not you should build your own tools.\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
