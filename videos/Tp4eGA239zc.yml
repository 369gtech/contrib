description: "A lot has been said about the importance of engaging and retaining your users, and Instant Messaging is an obvious way to achieve that. For that reason, adding a chat to your solution is almost always a good idea. It builds community and makes your platform more commercially viable and user-friendly.\n\n\nThe chat feature is often used as an example in tutorials to show programmers how to build an instant messaging feature in any programming language. As a result, youâ€™d be forgiven for thinking that it was a simple thing to do, all you need is a way to send a message from one user to another.\nBut is it really that simple? What makes a messaging solution valuable? There is a big difference between a basic chat functionality to a good instant messaging solution that is reliable and adds value.\n\nIf you are serious about providing your users with an enjoyable experience that adds to your platform, it is important to build a messaging platform that does more than just deliver messages.\nIn this webinar, we will explain the things we believe make a good instant messaging platform and why they are valuable for both the application owner and its end-users\n\nMeet the speakers\nThe MongooseIM team has over a decades experience in building hugely scalable, customised Instant Messaging solutions. The team helps global leaders in gaming, FinTech social media and telecoms use Instant Messaging to enhance their products performance, productivity and results."
