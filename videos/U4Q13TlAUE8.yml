description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nThe first part of this talk is an overview of the state of the art of application development with Spring Boot 2.2 and Kotlin:\n- Immutable @ConfigurationProperties data classes\n- Testing with #JUnit 5 and #Mockk\n- The new router DSL for #SpringMVC\n- Coroutines support for WebFlux, RSocket and Spring Data\n- Kotlin code snippets in Spring Framework documentation\n- MockMvc Kotlin DSL\n- Best practices (extensions, constructor based injection, etc.)\n\nThe second part is a livecoding of a #SpringBoot application configured with the Kofu, the Kotlin DSL currently developed in the Spring Fu incubator I have created a few months ago. It is an alternative to Spring Boot auto-configuration designed for configuring your application explicitly with auto-completion and custom configuration slices while still supporting most of Spring Boot features.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nSÃ©bastien is a Spring Framework committer at Pivotal.
