description: "Xamarin helps lower the barrier of entry into mobile development for .NET developers. By using Visual Studio and C#, two staples for .NET developers, Xamarin takes away the need to learn new IDEs and languages to get into mobile development.\n\nHowever, there's still plenty to learn to become a mobile developer with Xamarin. From platform foundations to app lifecycles, this session will cover the basics needed to get started with Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android."
