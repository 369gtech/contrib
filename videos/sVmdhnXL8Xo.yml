title: 'Luc Bourlier - Leverage Scala and Apache Spark for your Big Data'
recordingDate: 1445386511
description: 'The Scala programming language is not a newcomer to the JVM arena, and companies like Twitter and LinkedIn are heavy Scala users. The Functional Programming paradigm fits naturally the data processing space, and Scala libraries that made Hadoop more palatable quickly emerged. Apache Spark is a radical new approach to big data, and Scala is at its center. In this talk I will show the main features of Spark and how you can leverage Scala to build powerful data processing applications that scale.'
