In a Continuous Integration (CI) scenario, disruptions in the QA Environment can eliminate the possibility of CI. Strong guarantees and notification of environment errors are necessary for the orderly management of CI. An Erlang application can automate the type of monitoring, state reporting, and supervision of the environment needed by an active Agile organization for managing CI.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/jay-nelson/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JAY NELSON\nEmerging from a past mission to eliminate all worker pools, my current focus is on a similar goal: stability.\n\nJay has spent the last 10 years proselytizing The Erlang Way for applications in telecoms, electronic payments, secure texting, and ad delivery.\n\nMore on Jay Nelson: https://codesync.global/speaker/jay-nelson/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 19\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
