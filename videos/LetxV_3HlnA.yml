description: "Beyond 1001 Dedicated Data Service Instances - Julian Fischer, anynines\n\nThe first on-demand provisioning service brokers have appeared on the radar. This talk inspires to use them at scale leading to new challenges. Provisioning thousands of dedicated service instances, a corresponding number of VMs or even clusters of VMs needs to be managed. Find out whether common practises from manual cluster operations and automation strategies suitable for managing a small number of service instances can still be applied. Striving for a full lifecycle automation, this talk gives insights about obstacles and strategies for deploying dedicated, clustered data services instances at a large scale. Questions such as how to manage thousands of service instance dedicated PostgreSQL or MongoDB clusters will be discussed, exemplarily. Join this talk and the mission to automatically manage the entire lifecycle of complex data services beyond 1001 service instances.\n\nJulian Fischer\nJulian Fischer is CEO of Avarteq GmbH, the company behind anynines. He is enthusiastic about lean thinking, agile and cloud. As a Ruby friend he fell in love with Cloud Foundry, early. By running Cloud Foundry for more than two years on VMware, AWS and OpenStack as well as researching deep into the development of Cloud Foundry services, Julian has collected valuable experience about the capabilities of Cloud Foundry."
