title: 'Serving election results to an entire nation - Hallstein Br√∏tan - NDC Oslo 2020'
recordingDate: 1601835191
description: "What do you have to consider when all of Norway will be accessing your web site at exactly 9 PM, and you get only one shot to deliver?\nDuring 2019 I worked in a two-man team for NRK, building a greenfield .NET Core API to serve election results to TV, web and more. The election was the most important project for NRK during 2019, and it was absolutely crucial that everything worked as planned.\nI will give you insights on how we approached this task, with an absolute deadline and inescapable performance demands, and how we flawlessly coped with one of the highest peak traffic loads in Norway during 2019 when other well known media sites broke down."
