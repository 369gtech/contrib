description: "Serving DNNs like Clockwork: Performance Predictability from the Bottom Up\n\nArpan Gujarati, Max Planck Institute for Software Systems; Reza Karimi, Emory University; Safya Alzayat, Wei Hao, and Antoine Kaufmann, Max Planck Institute for Software Systems; Ymir Vigfusson, Emory University; Jonathan Mace, Max Planck Institute for Software Systems\n\nMachine learning inference is becoming a core building block for interactive web applications. As a result, the underlying model serving systems on which these applications depend must consistently meet low latency targets. Existing model serving architectures use well-known reactive techniques to alleviate common-case sources of latency, but cannot effectively curtail tail latency caused by unpredictable execution times. Yet the underlying execution times are not fundamentally unpredictableâ€”on the contrary we observe that inference using Deep Neural Network (DNN) models has deterministic performance. Here, starting with the predictable execution times of individual DNN inferences, we adopt a principled design methodology to successively build a fully distributed model serving system that achieves predictable end-to-end performance. We evaluate our implementation, Clockwork, using production trace workloads, and show that Clockwork can support thousands of models while simultaneously meeting 100 ms latency targets for 99.997% of requests. We further demonstrate that Clockwork exploits predictable execution times to achieve tight request-level service-level objectives (SLOs) as well as a high degree of request-level performance isolation.\n\nView the full OSDI '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/technical-sessions"
