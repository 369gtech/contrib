Lisa will cover in detail the typical struggles a company Fastly's size runs into when building around-the-clock incident operations and the things Fastly has put in place to make dealing with incidents easier and more effective. She will also cover common mistakes and lessons learned as Fastly continuously improves its Incident Management framework."
