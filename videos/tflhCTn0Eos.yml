description: "A Google TechTalk, presented by Maribeth Bottorff, 2021/04/28-29\nABSTRACT: This talk was presented as part of the 2021 Blockly Summit. In the past, all of our Getting Started information has suggested that you clone or fork the entire Blockly repo. But now with plugins, it's easier than ever to customize Blockly without having to fork it. In that case, the easiest way to manage your Blockly dependency is through a package manager such as npm. This talk is focused on those new to npm or not yet using a package manager. We will talk about the benefits of using npm and how to use the Blockly package."
