description: "How random number generators work and how to get good numbers out of them.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/probability-random\n\nNew video every Thursday. Question? Leave a comment below, or ask me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VinoBS\n\nEXERCISES:\n\n1. Modify the function to pass the current time into the random number seed and verify that a new sequence is always produced.\n\n2. Create a pseudorandom number generator that generates only 1's and 0's, false and true values.\n\n3. How would the difference in probabilities be between outputs if there were only 2^8 input values and 100 output values? What about if there were 2^8 input values and 128 output values?\n\n4. Tricky: How would you design a pseudorandom number generator over arbitrary output ranges where all of the output values are exactly equally likely?"
