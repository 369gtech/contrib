description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nJune 5, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Eric Arseneau, Sun Microsystems, and Fritjof Engelhardtsen, Telenor.\r\n\r\nThe Java Card™ system is the smallest Java™ platform available, but what can you do with it? This session covers some interesting examples involving the playSIM development kit.\r\n\r\nplaySim is an open-source development kit for prototyping new and creative Java Card 3 technology-based applications without the hardware limitations of today's smart cards. It combines the flexibility of the open Sun SPOT platform with the hard security requirements of SIM-card-based applications. Sun SPOT is used as an execution engine as well as a modular hardware platform to enable connection of different types of sensors and I/O interfaces.\r\n\r\nSee how the presenters combine the flexibility of open-source technologies such as Sun SPOTs and Squawk Virtual Machine with the commercial license aspects of the Java Card 3 platform.\r\n\r\nCome see how to\r\n• Experiment with Java Card 3 in the embedded domain through the I/O capabilities of the Sun SPOT platform\r\n• Get started with Java Card 3 Servlets, even without terminal support\r\n• Simulate SIM and smart cards with embedded radios\r\n• Experiment with Near Field Communication (NFC), using regular radios\r\n• Create new machine-to-machine interactions\r\n• Add one or two boards to a Sun SPOT and have a ready playSIM kit\r\n• Simulate smart cards with gigabytes of memory, using ordinary MiniSD cards\r\n\r\nplaySIM is an open-source hardware/software project; all source and details are at https://playsim.dev.java.net/."
