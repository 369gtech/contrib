description: "Functional programmers have been saying for decades that they know the way to the future.\n\nClearly they've been wrong, since imperative languages are still far more popular.\n\nClearly they've also been right, as the advantages of functional programming have become increasingly obvious. Is it possible to face both ways, and combine the two models?\n\nScala is one language that does this, and Java too has been on a journey, which still continues, of learning from functional languages and carefully adding features from them.\n\nIn this talk, we'll review what Java has learned from functional languages, what it can still learn, and how its added features compare to Scala's original ones.\n\nJosé Paumard:\nPassionate about programming computers for over 20 years, Jose made his debut in assembler and C, C for SIMD parallel machines before adopting Java as an object-oriented language, indispensable to most major modern applications. He brings his expertise and capacity for analysis and synthesis to many projects, mainly in the lower layers, close to the data, but also on complex UI design, or in the browser. PhD in applied maths and computer science, assistant professor in Paris North University for 20 years, Java Champion, Java Rockstar, Jose also has a passion for education and knowledge transfer. He gives talks in major international Java conferences (JavaOne in San Francisco, Devoxx in Antwerp, Paris and London).  He wrote numerous technical articles on Java technologies for Java Magazine, Oracle Technolgy Network. He writes a blog, Java le soir, French documentary source on Java technologies for thousands of french speaking developers around the world. He is a member of the french Paris Java User Group, and has been a co-organizer of the conference Devoxx France for three years.\n\nMaurice Naftalin:\nDeveloper, author, teacher. Forty years in computing. Co-author “Java Generics and Collections”, author “Mastering Lambdas”. JavaOne Rock Star (x4)."
