description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nServerless Beyond FaaS - Vaclav Turecek, Microsoft & Hongchao Deng, Alibaba Cloud \n\nInterest in serverless computing has increased exponentially over the last five years, yet Gartner estimates that less than 5% of enterprises adopted a serverless computing model in 2019. Definitions for serverless computing vary, but in practice it hasn’t moved much beyond Functions-as-a-Service. While this event-driven architecture works for many use cases, we believe in a broader vision for serverless computing where entire cloud-native applications can run on serverless infrastructure.  In this session, we’ll show how we are designing the Open Application Model to allow developers to describe complete cloud-native applications with operational characteristics in an infrastructure-agnostic way. In doing so, we hope to broaden the scope of what a serverless application can be.\n\nhttps://sched.co/aYqI"
