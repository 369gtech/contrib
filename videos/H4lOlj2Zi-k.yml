description: "This talk is about an expedition, we’ll tell you about the adventure in the seas of Kyriba’s product. Kyriba is a fintech founded 18 years ago and which became a global leader in cloud treasury solutions.\n\nWe’ll tell how Kyriba’s product started as a small boat - built to reach customers in shore nearby - had evolved to a big ship sailing the seas to deliver full business SaaS solutions. Building such a big ship and sailing the seas in the early days of the Cloud looks more like an expedition than a cruise... and the time has come to transform the monolithic big ship in a fleet of micro-services vessels….\n\n… Well, the talk is not actually about sailing but we’ll look at some challenges we have experienced to split up our monolith and what choices we have made to go into microservices.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
