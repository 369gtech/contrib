Various ways to develop components,\npowerful mixins, and the freedom to choose a build system are just some of the advantages of Vue.\nIn this talk we'll look at Vue component libraries from our perspective as IDE developers and discuss\nsome challenges we're facing with such flexibility. How to find all the available components in a library?\nWhat types their props have? Where are the docs? These are just some of the questions we have to answer.\nFinally, I'll tell the story of how we ended up creating web-types, a format for describing component libraries.\nI'll demonstrate how it can help editors and documentation generators and how to use it.\n\n---\n\nConFrontJS 2019 - #Frontend #Conference in #Warsaw, Poland\nDate: 7 December 2019\nVenue: Engineering Design Center (EDC)\n\n▶︎ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/2339951839653302/\n▶︎ Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/WarsawJS/events/264057980/\n▶︎ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/confrontjs.event/\n▶︎ Twitter: https://twitter.com/confrontjs\n▶︎ Homepage: https://confrontjs.com/"
