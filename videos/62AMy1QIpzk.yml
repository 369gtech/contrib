title: 'Wormhole State Management With React Hooks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1591974106
description: "React revolutionized the way most of us think about the state. No more binding, no more mess, just a beautiful unidirectional flow of data. It was great.\n\nUntil your app grew.\n\nHow the heck do you scale a central store of all app state? Where do you drill all the props? Why does every update go through a bazillion nested layers before it shows?\n\nReact Hooks enable a new architecture.\n\n\nAn architecture where state lives where you need it, business logic is where you use it, and anyone can understand your code without studying the whole codebase.\n\n\nSPEAKER: \n\nwizec is a prolific engineer, instructor, blogger, vlogger, conference speaker, and author. He's written many books including ReactForDataViz.com, Data Visualization with D3.js, the work-in-progress SeverlessHandbook.Dev, and ServerlessReact.Dev. He has trained the engineering teams from multiple Fortune 500 companies on React, Redux, GraphQL, Serverless, and other modern web technologies.\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nReactive Conf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish Reactive tech talks.\n\n\nCREDITS:\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ7ZDfQ4snc"
