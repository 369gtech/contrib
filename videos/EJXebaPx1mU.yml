A fundamental and particularly insidious concurrency bug is a race: a condition in which a pair of threads simultaneously access the same memory location and at least one of those accesses is a write. Today's concurrent programs are riddled with races.\n\nThis talk presents a novel approach to detecting races in concurrent Java programs.
