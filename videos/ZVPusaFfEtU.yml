It combines ideas from property-based testing, TLA+ and linear temporal logic, and functional programming.\n\nIn this talk, we'll take a look at the core ideas, how it's currently implemented, the results from testing TodoMVC implementations, and some possible future work. For more details and documentation, see https://quickstrom.io/.\n\n---\n\nTHE HOST - Oskar Wickström\n\nAfter some years of musical education, Oskar Wickström began his journey into the world of software.
