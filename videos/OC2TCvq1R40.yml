And sometimes, it's very helpful to visualize a complex topic to understand it better. In this talk we'll see what concurrent design patterns such as Fan In and Fan Out really look like.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/alexey-soshin/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ALEXEY SOSHIN\nAuthor of \"\"Hands-on Design Patterns with Kotlin\"\" book\n\nAlexey is a Staff Software Engineer @Deliveroo.
