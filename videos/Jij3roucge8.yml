description: "OWASP AppSec EU 2018 DevOps Track - Day 1, talk 2\n\nNow that we have passed \"peak orchestrator\" and as Kubernetes eats the world, we are left wondering: how secure is Kubernetes? Can we really run Google-style multi tenanted infrastructure safely? And how can we be sure what we configured yesterday will be in place tomorrow? In this talk we discuss:\n- the Kubernetes security landscape\n- risks, security models, and best-practices\n- how to configure users and applications with least-privilege\n- how to isolate and segregate workloads\n- persisting configuration across cluster rebuilds\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
