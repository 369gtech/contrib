recordingDate: 1477641168
description: "Inside Domain's journey down the Yellow Brick Road of Continuous Delivery.\nThis session will show you how at Domain.com.au we went from deploying our 100+ .Net apps to production once every 2 weeks to up to 150 times in a single week thanks to our Robot Army. Robot Army also allows Domain to spin up new world-class server clusters with a few simple lines of code.\nWe'll talk about all aspects of Continuous Delivery, including build, tests, deployment, monitoring and most importantly: automation. We'll also cover some less technical topics such as the cultural changes required to enable such a transition.\n\nJoin Domain's very own Scarecrow and Tin Man as they show you why we're not in Kansas any more, Toto."
