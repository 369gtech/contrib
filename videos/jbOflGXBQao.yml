description: "Samantha and her mom, Lynn Langit, are working together to understand the computational challenges and limits present in today's cancer genomic (bioinformatics) pipelines.\n\nSamantha took 'Cancer Biology at Stanford as a visiting scholar in the summer of 2016 (as a junior in high school). She is working with her Cloud architect mom, Lynn Langit, to understand these challenges and to push solutions at the cutting edge of bioinformatic research which best utilize advances in cloud technology (such as docker and lamba).\n\nIn this demo-filled session mom and daughter will discuss and demonstrate some of the latest cloud data pipeline work that they've been working together to build out for the bioinformatics community."
