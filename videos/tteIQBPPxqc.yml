description: "Errors and debugging are the bane of a programmer’s life — and the source of many jokes, Twitter rants, and midnight breakdowns. But how often do we consider error themselves: not as obstacles but as entities?\n\nThis talk will cover a short history of errors in computer science and how errors work in Javascript itself, before looking at different approaches to reducing errors — maybe even by embracing them.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
