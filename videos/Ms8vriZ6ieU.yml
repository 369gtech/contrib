description: "Server-side development at Apple involves a highly distributed set of heterogenous services that must communicate over the network. There is a wide variation of use cases, and each has unique operational requirements. The goals are to minimize latency and memory overhead while maximizing throughput. However, achieving these goals may introduce complexity in the application and increase maintenance costs. One mitigation technique to reduce complexity is to invest in commonly used networking frameworks and libraries. Apple’s strategy involves leveraging and contributing to open source projects as well as developing internal software. Come to this session to learn how Apple uses frameworks as a technique to address the challenges of server-side development.\n\nScott Mitchell From Apple, Inc.\nSenior Software Developer @ Apple.\n\nCore contributor to the netty.io project @ https://github.com/Scottmitch."
