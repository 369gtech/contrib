title: 'NewSQL scalable relational databases - Jon Tirsen (Jfokus Brown Bag series)'
recordingDate: 1632769669
description: "NoSQL was a reaction against the scalability issues with regular SQL relational databases such as MySQL and Postgres. They scaled out well and were easy to operate but were lacking many of the features developers have relied on for decades such as ACID transactions, global indexes and complex queries with joins and aggregations.\n\nWhile many NoSQL vendors have started addressing these issues there is also a new breed of databases that offers both scalability and many of the features of the SQL databases such as joins, global indexes and ACID transactions.\n\nThis talk will dig into what these databases can offer and what some of the trade offs are. When you should use them and when you probably should not. We will go through the most popular NoSQL databases Vitess, TiDB, Cockroach and Cloud Spanner and explain their differences, pros and cons.\n\nRecorded Tuesday 17 November 2020 kl. 12:00"
