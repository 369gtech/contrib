description: "Designing an Autonomous Workbench for Data Science on AWS\n\nDipen Chawla, Episource LLC\n\nThis talk is a synopsis of how we built a self-serving workbench for the team of data scientists at Episource and designed it to be scalable, secure, and cost-efficient. The talk will also include the challenges we faced while navigating the architecture, the lessons learned, and the impact the workbench has had on Episource's ML dev workflows. If you are an organization looking to improve autonomy and promote rapid experimentation within your data science ranks, this talk will help you in your journey.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
