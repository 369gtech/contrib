description: 'We all know Gartner''s expectations - 20 billion connected devices by 2020. People are not going to charge tens of devices every day so we need low power communication. More and more devices are being deployed remote so we need wide area networking. With the emergence of LPWAN and the commoditization of connectivity, the industry needs to focus on new challenges: life cycle optimization and environmental issues, firmware updates, transfer of ownership, spectrum regulation, security and privacy issues, and making IoT development and deployment as easy as developing a website using WordPress.'
