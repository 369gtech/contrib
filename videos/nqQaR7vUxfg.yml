description: "Apache Camel is one of the most complete integration frameworks out there. With more than 150 components and a large community, it clearly has its fans. Deploying the lightweight core is easy, but getting into modules and even more components is challenging. There are different approaches to riding that Camel. How to get the most out of it with Java EE and WildFly is exactly the topic of this session. It introduces you to both Java EE 7 and Apache Camel in a very brief way, follows up with various integration and deployment scenarios, and introduces the tools that can help you the most on the way to your integration solution.\n\nSpeaker:\nMarkus Eisele, Developer advocate, Red Hat GmbH\nMarkus is a Developer Advocate at Red Hat and focuses on JBoss Middleware.
