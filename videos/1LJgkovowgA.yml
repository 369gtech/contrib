description: "Coronavirus is turning out to be one of the deadliest disease outbreaks of all time. The people that are fighting this disease need a solution now, not a year from now. As such, I'm hosting a 2-week $3500 Coronavirus Deep Learning Competition for anyone in this community to participate. The goal is to use deep learning to find a potential cure or treatment, then we'll send samples of the compound to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for further analysis. This is the perfect opportunity to show the world how open-source, community-driven AI can effect positive, relevant change. This is the AI-Human collaborative \"Deep Blue\" moment, a moment where, given AI tools, a human or group of humans will be able to accomplish an extraordinary feat that they couldn't otherwise. In this episode, I'll explain the details of the competition, the details of the Coronavirus genome, which teams are currently using AI to fight it, and we'll go through the necessary steps to generate and test candidate molecules with deep learning and PyRX (molecular docking software).
