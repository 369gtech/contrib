title: 'YOW! 2014 Gil Tene - How NOT to Measure Latency'
recordingDate: 1514467609
description: "Time is money. Understanding application responsiveness and latency is critical not only for delivering good application behavior but also for maintaining profitability and containing risk. But good characterization of bad data is useless. When measurements of response time present false or misleading latency information, even the best analysis can lead to wrong operational decisions and poor application experience. This talk demonstrates common pitfalls encountered in measuring, describing and reporting latency and response time behavior. It then demonstrates the use of recently open sourced tools to improve and gain higher confidence in both latency measurement and reporting.\n\nGil Tene is CTO and co-founder of Azul Systems. He has been involved with virtual machine technologies for the past 20 years. Gil pioneered Azul’s Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector (C4), and various managed runtime and systems stack technologies that combine to deliver the industry’s most scalable and consistent Java platforms.\n\nGil is a frequent speaker at technology conferences worldwide, and an official JavaOne Rock Star. In 2006 he was named one of the Top 50 Agenda Setters in the technology industry by Silicon.com. Prior to co-founding Azul, Gil held key technology positions at Nortel Networks, Shasta Networks and at Check Point Software Technologies, where he designed ground breaking traffic management solutions. He architected OSs at Stratus Computer, HA solutions at Qualix/Legato, and served as an officer in the Israeli Navy Computer R&D unit.\n\nGil holds a BSEE from The Technion Israel Institute of Technology, and has been awarded over 30 patents in computer-related technologies.\n\nFor more on YOW!
