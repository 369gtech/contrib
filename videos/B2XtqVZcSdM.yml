description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nThis is a talk about solving the most difficult problem a software engineer ever faces, converting a large codebase with antiquated designs and spotty quality into a state-of-the-art, modern system. We'll be covering clang-based refactoring, mnemonic reasoning methods, safe rewrites, coding standards, and, oh yes, migration paths. \n\nIf you've ever been tasked with making a legacy codebase the best-in-class, or think you might, then this talk is for you.\n— \nDavid Sankel: Bloomberg\n\nDavid Sankel is a professional software developer/architect based in the USA and an active member of the C++ Standardization Committee.
