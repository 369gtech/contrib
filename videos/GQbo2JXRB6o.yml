If something breaks in production, how will you know? Will you wait for a user to report it to you? What do you do when your staging test results do not reflect current production behavior? In order to test proactively as opposed to reactively, try testing in production! You will have an increased accuracy of test results, your tests will run faster due to the elimination of bad data, and you will have higher confidence before releases. This can be accomplished through feature flagging, canary releases, setting up a proper CI/CD pipeline, and data cleanup. You will leave this talk with strategies to mitigate risk, to better your understanding of the steps to get there, and to shift your company’s testing culture, so you can provide the best possible experience to your users. At the end of the day, we don't care if your features work in staging, we care if they work in production. \n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nAWS Amplify → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nRetool → https://retool.com/\nEpsagon → https://epsagon.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nG2i → https://www.g2i.co/ \n\nSilver Sponsors\nAppSignal → https://appsignal.com/\nSailscasts → https://sailscasts.com/\n\nDiversity Sponsor\nPrisma → https://www.prisma.io/"
