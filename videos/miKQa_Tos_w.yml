description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch, 14 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMany problems in Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves an\nefficient search for the best derivation over (exponentially) many\ncandidates, especially in parsing and machine translation. In these\ncases, the\nconcept of \"packed forest\" provides a compact representation of the\nhuge search spaces, where efficient inference algorithms based on\nDynamic Programming (DP) are possible.\n\nIn this talk we address two important open problems within this\nframework: exact k-best inference which is often used in NLP\npipelines such as parse reranking and MT rescoring, and approximate\ninference when the search space is too big for exact search.\n\nWe first present a series of fast and exact k-best algorithms on\nforests, which are orders of magnitudes faster than previously used\nmethods on state-of-the-art parsers such as Collins (1999). We then\nextend these algorithms for approximate search when the forests are\ntoo big for exact inference. We discuss two particular instances of\nthis new method, forest rescoring for MT decoding with integrated\nlanguage models, and forest reranking for discriminative parsing. In\nthe former, our methods perform orders of magnitudes faster than\nconventional beam search on both state-of-the-art phrase-based and\nsyntax-based systems, with the same level of search error or\ntranslation quality. In the latter, faster search also leads to\nbetter learning, where our approximate decoding makes whole-Treebank\ndiscriminative training practical and results in the best accuracy to\ndate for parsers trained on the Treebank.\n\nThis talk includes joint work with David Chiang (USC Information\nSciences Institute).\n\nLiang Huang (2008).

He is mainly interested in the theoretical aspects of\ncomputational linguistics, in particular, efficient algorithms in\nparsing and machine translation, generic dynamic programming, and\nformal properties of synchronous grammars. He also works on applying\ncomputational linguistics to structural biology."
