description: "I am an enthusiastic Front End Developer with the ability to build responsive, fast, well-tested and maintainable web applications using technologies like React, Node.js and Rails. My background is Geospatial Engineering but I felt my lack of programming skills was very limiting. I love art and solving mathematical problems, so I decided to join both of those fields, learn programming and become a software developer. 😊\n\nProgramming is an absolutely amazing tool. It is incredible what can you build by using just a few lines of code. I like working in a team and sharing the joy when the code we wrote works. 🙌🏻\n\nI am eager to learn and grow my skills so will be on the lookout for picking up new programming languages, algorithms and data structures. \n\nFor more information on YOW!
