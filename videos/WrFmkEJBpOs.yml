description: "by Ioana Chiorean\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UA2.114/is_the_web_rea11ly_for_all.webm\n\nThe web is pretty much present in everyone's life nowdays. But is it really for all? How are we making it a smooth usage for those with disabilities, for those with reduce time and internet connection? Or even more further, for those that just use the web for the first time?\nLet's learn a bit how the devtools from Firefox can help us improve everyone's experience without much of a sacrifice on our end.\nA11y and inclusion is getting more traction nowadays but people still think that they address only those with disabilities. As a person without any officially i did find myself in this situation and felt confused about how the web should be ( was about to loose money on ticket conferences because i was not seeing the categories). Some Developers are a bit defensive saying they don't have users for whom to build more a11y in or the time to add these features. Showing the devtools Firefox has for it - will show how fast you can check your page and how no costy is. Also not knowing all best practices won't be a blocker and firefox will give you suggestions. In a way i wanted to bring attention to A11y nd Inclusion in a more technical way.\n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 10:00:00"
