description: 'What is necessary for CI for microservices? Jenkins 2.0 with pipelines looks like a good option for that. But is it enough? Letâ€™s add Docker for containerization. We think it could be even better with Kubernetes. The presentation will provide you how to build CI for microservices from scratch with those tools and describes some best practices applicable for Microservices CI.'
