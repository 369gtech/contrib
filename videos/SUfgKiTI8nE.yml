title: 'Serverless-ish: Zero to App with Datomic Cloud and GraphQL - Chris Johnson Bidler'
language: English
recordingDate: 1543514104
description: 'The #serverless architecture pattern is taking the world by storm, and for good reasons. The principles of server less design allow for building robust and feature-filled prototypes quickly and cheaply, while also scaling readily when a prototype finds traction and gets big. Datomic Cloud and Ions allow the working Clojurist to enjoy many of the advantages of this architecture pattern without giving up the power and expressivity of either Clojure or Datomic. In this talk, I will demonstrate going from an empty buffer to a working distributed chat application with a GraphQL API serving Web and mobile clients, user authentication, and a BI dashboard in about 30 minutes, by leveraging the power of Datomic Cloud and the plethora of AWS services that support #serverless application.'
