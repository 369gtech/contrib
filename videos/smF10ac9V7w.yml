title: 'Jenni Jepsen - Redefining leadership in a not so normal world'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604140578
description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal\n\nShift from a culture of permission and waiting, to intent and action.\nOur old ideas of good leadership is where the leader knows all, tells all and is always in control. In fact, it’s difficult for us to change because those old habits are so hardwired in our brains! Intent-Based Leadership™ offers a way for us to rewire: to give control, trust and learn to be okay with not having all the answers. Jenni will share more on why and how leaders can set the environment for others to excel and act to the maximum extent of their creativity and intellect; where team members come to the leader describing what they see, what they think, and what they intend to do. The result: the culture of the organization shifts from one of permission and waiting, to intent and action, and people feel more valued and come to better solutions. A way of leading that is especially relevant in today's world."
