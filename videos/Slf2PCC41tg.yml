description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 2020 - http://bit.ly/2wpn0SM\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference - https://codesync.global\n\n---\n\nUNIQUE RESILIENCY OF THE ERLANG VM, THE BEAM AND ERLANG OTP\nby Irina Guberman\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nUnique powers of the BEAM\n\nABSTRACT\nDemonstrate how unique features of the BEAM, Bogdan's/Bjorn's Erlang Abstract Machine, in combination with Eralng OTP can take your company's servers to the next level of resiliency and robustness. Irina will be doing some very cool demos (github repo revealed after the talk) and analyzing some key differences between the BEAM and JVM. Hopefully, JVM specialists will learn some interesting stuff not just about the BEAM but also about the JVM.\n\nSlides & full abstract: \n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - IRINA GUBERMAN\nErlangelist (TODO)\n\nBlindly passionate software engineer/architect since 1997 and an enlightened and happy software engineer/architect since around 2010. That's when Irina discovered Erlang and the BEAM, its amazing VM, while dealing with an enormous scale distributed web server in online targeted advertising space running on JVM. At that moment, she knew there was a BEAM of light at the end of that tunnel.\n\nMore on Irina Guberman: \n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM SF 2020\nCode BEAM SF is powered by Code Sync.
