title: 'Object-Oriented Program: Best Practices - Jon Kalb [ C++ on Sea 2020 ]'
language: English
recordingDate: 1595862028
description: "Object-Oriented Programming was state-of-the-art C++ programming for decades and industry best practices developed to produce high-quality code and avoid practices that lead to buggy, hard-to-maintain code. With billions of lines of OOP code in C++ currently in production, we should be talking about OOP best practices, because old-school doesn’t mean easy.\n\nIn this session, instead of lecturing you that you shouldn’t be using OOP, I’m going to share the industry best practices developed during the last four decades and updated to latest language features.\n-------\n\nJon Kalb does onsite C++ training to make good teams better.\n\n-------\n\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
