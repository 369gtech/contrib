description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLogging Operator the Cloud Native Fluent Ecosystem - Sandor Guba, Cisco\n\nThe Kubernetes logging ecosystem does not support the native Kubernetes concepts. This is the reason behind the open-source project called Logging Operator. Moreover, the easy scaling of workloads results in a massive amount of logs produced. This can cause extremely huge bills on your analytics deployment (both SaaS and self-hosted). Some of the key features are namespace isolation, supporting label selectors, filtering, and using secrets for credentials. It is more than 3 years old and already deployed in production environments. Sandor will introduce the challenges of configuring a complex logging stack on Kubernetes and summarise the lessons learned of writing, supporting, and operating the Logging Operator."
