description: "Building a distributed knowledge base with a Linked Data powered CMS Implementing the vision of the web of data\nby Sander Van Dooren\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.120/cms_linked_data_knowledge_base.webm\n\nAfter a quick overview of the semantic web landscape, we'll look into a practical application of Linked Data in the public sector: the Joinup platform of the European Commission.\nJoinup makes use of Linked Data to harvest information from various sources into a knowledge base. We'll have a look at the various components that we needed to build (all Open Source) to make the CMS system (Drupal) 'Linked Data enabled'.\nWe'll look at the technical problems that needed to be solved and the solutions we came up with, as well as a the opportunities that this technology can bring to the CMS world.\n\nRoom: AW1.120\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 09:30:00"
