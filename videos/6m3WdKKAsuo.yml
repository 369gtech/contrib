description: "Let Your Software Supply Chain Ride with Kubernetes CI/CD\n\nRicardo Aravena, Rakuten\n\nIn the last two years, we have seen Kubernetes GitOps become more universal in many teams helping them enhance their software pipelines. Yet, there are still some gaps when it comes to enhancing security and gluing all the pieces together.\n\nWe will survey some of the more popular GitOps open-source tools such as Draft and Flux along with a security review for real-world production environments. Which one could be more vulnerable and how would you harden them? What about building and verifying container images with open-source projects like Kaniko, and in-toto? How can you fully put the pieces together with Spinnaker or Tekton?\n\nBy the end of the session, the audience will have a good understanding of the current state of the GitOps ecosystem in the open-source world and how to leverage several tools to enhance, secure, increase agility and create their container software factory in production.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
