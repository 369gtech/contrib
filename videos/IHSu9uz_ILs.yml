Extracting value from that growing data and scaling up analysis is a constant pain. Modern tools need to solve both critical performance tasks like data collection as well as pre-processing enrichment and delivery.\n\nFluentd and Fluent Bit CNCF projects are the de facto Logging and compatible Metrics solution for any cloud environment. In this session you will learn about our journey on scaling up data processing for financial institutions, performance improvements and how Calyptia, the company founded by Fluent creators and maintainers, is taking the Fluent ecosystem to the next enterprise level through cloud services and free tools for our community."
