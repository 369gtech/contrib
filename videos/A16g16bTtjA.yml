description: 'Web developers should care about web performance. Unfortunately web performance explanations usually start from the rendered website, go down to the DOM and stop with statements as ".. and it''s fast because it''s accelerated". We will do it the other way around: We will start with a pixel and work our way up: How does a piece of markup turn into pixels, how are they combined to the page? We will visit: Parsing Layers / Textures Painting Compositing / Transformations From this we will conclude what we need to do to help the platform make our sites slick and fast.'
