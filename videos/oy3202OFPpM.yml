description: "With Java 9, modularity comes to your doorstep (whether you ordered it or not). This isn't your average language feature: making the most out of it may involve rewiring your brain. In this university session we explore the benefits of a modular codebase using Java 9 modules. Because who doesn’t like more reliable and secure applications, meanwhile killing the dreaded classpath?\n\nAfter reviewing the basic concepts of modules, we'll explore modularity patterns that enhance your design and development skills. We all have existing software, so migration of codebases to a modular world is an important topic as well. Automatic modules and other new concepts are added to your toolbox to this end.\n\nWant examples? We've got plenty in this practical and code-driven talk. Even if you intend to use Java 9 without modules, this talk helps you prevent common issues. You'll be ready for Java 9 before you know it.\n\nBoth speakers are currently writing “Java 9 Modularity” for O’Reilly, expected release early 2017. They have extensive experience under the belt already with the Java 9 Jigsaw early access builds.\n\nSander Mak crafts scalable software at Luminis Technologies. With almost a decade of experience on the JVM platform, he specializes in modular Java and JavaScript development. Additionally, data analysis and machine learning are part of his ever growing list of interests. \n\nSander loves sharing knowledge, for example through his blog (at http://branchandbound.net) and by writing for the Dutch Java Magazine. He speaks regularly at various international developer conferences, sharing his passion for Java, alternative JVM languages and related technologies.\n\nPaul Bakker is a software architect for Luminis Technologies and the author of “Building Modular Cloud Apps With OSGi”. He believes that modularity and the cloud are the two main challenges we have to deal with to bring technology to the next level, and is working on making this possible for mainstream software development. Today he is working on educational software focussed on personalised learning for high school students in the Netherlands. Paul is an active contributor on open source projects such as Amdatu, Apache ACE and BndTools.\n\nHe has a background as a trainer on Java related technology and is a regular speaker on conferences such as JavaOne, Devoxx and JFokus.\n\n[ULZ-3941]"
