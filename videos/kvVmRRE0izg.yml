description: "Pre-Conference Special NorDevCon 27 February 2014 \n\nSystems Thinking\nWith Jon Jagger \n(@JonJagger)\n\nThe French have a saying (originally from Aristotle) - plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose. The more things change the more things stay the same. Bradford Keeney, an early pioneer of cybernetics said \"All change can be understood as the effort to maintain some constancy and all constancy as maintained through change.\" What does this mean? I will explore some examples.\n\nAnother Systems Thinking Law is The Law of Unintended Consequences, also known as Murphy's Law, I will explore some humorous examples of this law too... \n\nThen there are the The Causation Fallacies - the idea that every effect has a single cause (fallacy number one) and that we can tell which is cause and which is effect (fallacy number two). Again more examples.\n\nHow do these relate to Peter Senge's Axiom?\n\nUsing some of these insights I will explore some alternative ways to think about, for example, Conway's Law.\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/163007372/\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/"
