description: "Java is entering a new era, the cloud native one. Thanks to GraalVM it can be made smaller, lighter and faster, keeping all its power.\n\nThis innovative way of developing and deploying Java applications has been pushed to the next level by Quarkus that provides a full-stack development experience seamlessly integrating many widely used Java libraries and thus opens the door for next generation of middleware.\n\nBusiness automation is an important players in this context and Kogito, a new Java toolkit based on Drools and jBPM, is made to bring rules and processes to the Quarkus world. After a quick introduction to Kogito we'll show in a live conding session how it can be used to build cloud ready event-driven business applications.\n\nStarting from scratch we'll create micorservices implementing the business logic of a complex domain with rules and modelling its workflows through business processes.\n\nWe will demonstrate how Quarkus hot reload capabilities can be used to design this business logic in an iterative way, how to integrate these services with Kafka to process business events, how to monitor them with Prometheus and Grafana and finally how to deploy everything into the cloud.\n\nMario Fusco:\nMario is a principal software engineer at Red Hat working as Drools project lead. He has a huge experience as Java developer having been involved in (and often leading) many enterprise level projects in several industries ranging from media companies to the financial sector. Among his interests there are also functional programming and Domain Specific Languages. By leveraging these 2 passions he created the open source library lambdaj with the purposes of providing an internal Java DSL for manipulating collections and allowing a bit of functional programming in Java. He is also a Java Champion, the JUG Milano coordinator a frequent speaker and the co-author of \"Modern Java in Action\" published by Manning.\n\nEdoardo Vacchi:\nDuring my PhD, I researched language design and implementation at University of Milan. After three years at UniCredit's R&D dept, I have joined Red Hat's Middleware team, where I work on the Drools rule engine, the jBPM platform and the Kogito initiative.\n\nMaciej Swiderski:\nMaciej is principal software engineer at Red Hat where he leads jBPM project and is also co-founder of the Kogito project. Since 2007 he is in business automation domain both from development point of view and helping to adopt it in different sectors. He's passionate about open source and tries to promote it wherever possible. In his spare time he enjoys calm and relax life on country side and travels."
