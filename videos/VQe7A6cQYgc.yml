description: "Have you always been curious about what machine learning can do for your business problem, but could never find the time to learn the practical necessary skills? Do you wish to learn what Classification, Regression, Clustering and Feature Extraction techniques do, and how to apply them using the Oracle Machine Learning family of products?\n\nJoin us for this special series “Oracle Machine Learning Office Hours – Machine Learning 101”, where we will go through the main steps of solving a Business Problem from beginning to end, using the different components available in Oracle Machine Learning: programming languages and interfaces, including Notebooks with SQL, UI, and languages like R and Python.\n\nThis sixth session in the series covered Clustering 102, where we learn more about the  methods on multiple dimensions, how to compare Cluster techniques, and explore Dimensionality Reduction and how to extract only the most meaningful attributes from datasets with lots of attributes (or derived attributes).\n\nSession highlights:\n00:39 Oracle Machine Learning Office Hours - next Session\n01:28 Machine Learning 102 - Clustering\n02:00 Clustering 102 - Demo Introduction\n03:25 Dataset for Demo\n03:45 Dataset view\n04:40 2-D visualization of subset of Dataset\n06:40 k-Means model demo build with k=2 clusters\n08:10 k-Means cluster prediction\n09:15 k-Means prediction visualization in 2-D and 3-D\n11:20 Identify Attributes that explain the prediction for cluster\n13:15 Elbow Method to identify ideal number of clusters for k-Means \n15:45 Function to build, score and plot k-Means clusters\n16:49 Visualizing k-Means from k=2 to k=7 in 3-D\n18:05 O-Cluster algorithm demo\n21:45 Materializing OML4Py proxy object to a Database table\n23:21 O-Cluster model build using PL/SQL\n24:55 O-Cluster model settings and attributes\n25:45 O-Cluster model views\n27:52 O-Cluster cluster prediction\n29:20 O-Cluster prediction visualization in 2-D and 3-D\n32:00 Expectation-Maximization clustering demo introduction\n33:10 E-M clustering model build\n37:43 E-M clustering scoring and Attribute Importance\n38:13 Identify Attributes that explain the prediction for cluster\n39:14 Create a function to build, score and plot an E-M clustering model\n39:38 Several E-M clustering results using several available settings\n41:20 E-M clustering with Model Search Enable\n45:19 E-M clustering models and model views\n47:10 E-M clustering scoring via Python and SQL\n50:55 Q&A"
