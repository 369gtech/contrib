description: "Need for SPEED: Site Performance Efficiency, Evaluation and Decision\n\nKingsum Chow, Alibaba, and Zhihao Chang, Zhejiang University\n\nWhen you are tackling many servers in the data center, saving a small percentage of servers would bring significant return. We will describe how we evaluate performance at scale, and also how it is different from optimization on a single system.\n\nThe emergence of large-scale software deployments in the data center has led to several challenges: (1) measuring software performance in the data center, and (2) evaluating performance impact of software or hardware changes. We will highlight a couple of problems that may lead to wrong conclusions. We will present a sketch of our solutions.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
