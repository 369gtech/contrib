description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nChoose Wisely: Understanding Kubernetes Selectors - Christopher Hanson, RX-M,llc.\n\nKubernetes uses labels and selectors to tie otherwise distinct API objects together. Application controllers like ReplicaSets use labels on pods to enforce replication factor; Services (via Endpoint controllers) also use labels on pods to identify endpoints for routing client traffic. However, not all controller behavior is the same! Some controllers add extra label metadata to avoid potential collisions and others do not! Through a series of live demos, this session explores the use of labels and selectors used by controllers so that you can clearly understand and use both to your advantage when deploying apps on Kubernetes. The talk will conclude with examples of advanced deployment patterns such as red/black, highlander, and canary that can be achieved natively in Kubernetes via labels/selectors."
