description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nDocker Container Lifecycles, problem or opportunity?\n\nDocker is hot. However, as Docker container use spreads into more mature production pipelines, there can be issues about control of Docker images to ensure they are production-ready. Is a promotion-based model appropriate to control and track the flow of Docker images from development to production? We will demonstrate how to implement a promotion model for docker images, and then show how to distribute them to any kind of consumer, being it a customer or a data center.\n\nBaruch Sadogursky, JFrog\n\nJavaOne Rockstar Baruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate of JFrog, the creators of Artifactory Binary Repository, the home of Bintray, JavaOne 2011 and 2013 Duke Choice Awards winner.
