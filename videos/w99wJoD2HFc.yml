recordingDate: 1420556419
description: "Originally aired June 3, 2014. Pattern libraries are a great source of inspiration and education for designers. But common practice doesn't always equal best practice. In this webcast, we'll look at why many common tutorial patterns are ineffective and how you can leverage game design principles to increase user engagement.\n\nAbout Theresa Neil\n\nTheresa Neil has been designing user interfaces since 2001 when she coded her first seat map for an airline kiosk. She loved the direct interaction of tapping a seat to change rows, and updating the colors to show the seat was assigned. She wanted to make more products like this, intuitive, direct, and interactive. In the past 11 years, she has led the design for more than 100 web, desktop, and mobile applications, working first as the Usability Lead at Sabre Airlines Solutions, then on her own as a User Experience consultant. Clients include a diverse mix of Fortune 500 companies, non-profit organizations, and local Austin start-ups. Her experiences as a UX designer are chronicled at theresaneil.wordpress.com and her work can be seen at www.theresaneil.com.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco\n\n - Don't miss an upload!
