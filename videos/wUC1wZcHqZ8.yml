description: "Businesses have access to more data than ever before, but the question of how the data can be leveraged to drive action is at times a daunting task, especially for larger organizations. Designing data delivery applications for enterprise organizations is a very different animal than designing for consumers. In consumer applications the buying decision is made by the end user, while in enterprise applications a buying decision is made for a large and heterogeneous group of end users. Managers who wish to foster data-driven organizations are given the difficult mission of either evaluating or designing software for a seemingly fickle audience.\n\nJoin for an exclusive webcast presented by Bitsy Bentley where she answers the questions:\n\n- What happens when you give an entire organization access to a common data set? -\n -Who are the different players we need to take into account?\n    -How do we ensure that the communication brings value to both the numbers novice   and the statistically savvy?\n\nAbout Bitsy Bentley\n\nAs the Director of Data Visualization at GfK Custom Research (a global market research firm), Bitsy designs data visualization applications to tell compelling stories about research data.
