title: 'EdgeConf 4: Installable Web Apps and Permissions'
language: English
recordingDate: 1412353187
description: '"Installable" web apps are a mess. Better access to native APIs like geofencing, offline, push notifications and alerts requires new APIs and a way of managing user consent. What should ''installing'' a web app actually mean? With the manifest specification being implemented by Chrome and Firefox right now, how far do this and other new standards like ServiceWorker go towards solving the problem? How granular should user consent be and at what point should it be obtained?'
