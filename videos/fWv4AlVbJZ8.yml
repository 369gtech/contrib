description: "by Andy Wingo\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.201/guile3fasterprograms.webm\n\n\nThere's a new major version of the Guile language implementation\ncoming, and it's on average around twice as fast as Guile 2.2.  Guile\n3, expected to be released in Spring 2019, achieves these improvements\nby adding on a just-in-time compilation system to its virtual machine.\nCo-maintainer Andy Wingo will walk you through how we managed to\nachieve these improvements while not increasing startup latency, and\ngive tips and tricks for early adopters. \n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:50:00+01"
