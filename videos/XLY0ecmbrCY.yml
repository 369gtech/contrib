title: 'Java and Haskell - Similarities and Differences by Dervis Mansuroglu'
recordingDate: 1581886340
description: "The Java programming language has evolved a lot over the last year. With future releases from projects like Panama, Loom, Amber, and Valhalla, Java will continue to adopt features that developers know from languages like Kotlin and Scala. One area that Java still differs, is functional programming. There is especially one functional language that people either hate or love: Haskell. In this talk, I will take a look at the similarities and differences between Java and Haskell. For developers who have never tried Haskell, it will be good opportunity to see how it compares with features we know in Java. We will also discuss why Haskell hasn't taken over the world yet. After listening to this talk, you will learn how you can benefit from learning a purely functional language and you will also learn about Java's strengths compared to Haskell.\n\nDervis Mansuroglu\nNorwegian Labour and Welfare Directorate\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
