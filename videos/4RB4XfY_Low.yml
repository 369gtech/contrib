description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSupercharged Analytics for Prometheus Metrics with Spark, Presto, & Superset - Rob Skillington & Gibbs Cullen, Chronosphere \n\nPrometheus continues to make it simple to alert, monitor and understand systems in a cloud native world with growing complexity. New connectors to big data query engines such as Spark and Presto enable us to ask more complex questions than ever before. We can ask questions such as “Which of my deployments in Kubernetes account for the majority of compute and network costs, and how has that grown and shrunk with respect to doing real work such as query volume from users?” We’ll walk through a working example to run Superset and Presto in docker connected to a remote Prometheus to perform advanced SQL queries of arbitrary size reliably without timeout. We’ll also demo joining metrics data using the Kubernetes node name Prometheus label to detailed Kubernetes object metadata (events, pods, etc) collected by Fluentd using a simple SQL join thanks to Presto’s query federation capabilities. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekCr"
