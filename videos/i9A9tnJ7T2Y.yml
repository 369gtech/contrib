description: "The modern online social environments such as messaging systems, social networks and marketplaces provide high connectivity between participants and high interaction speeds. That makes it impossible for a participant to access all risks of social engineering and opinion manipulation that people are exposed to.\n\nMost of known electronic communication environments, social networks, online media ecosystems, marketplaces and unmanaged transactional system such as blockchains easily host scam and manipulation campaigns targeting individual wallets, corporate assets and public security. Even the rating systems being employed in most of marketplaces are vulnerable for reputation gaming attacks with different strategies.\n\nWe discuss our proposition for flexible “liquid rank” reputation assessment system based on graph theory and “liquid rank” implemented as open source. We present how different configurations of the reputation system may reduce loss to scam for honest participants and increase costs of scam for dishonest ones, with examples for real blockchains and simulations of marketplaces. We also discuss possible design and implementation options for such system.\n\nIn the end, the weakest chain in computer security is a human, so the social engineering may crack what is not cracked exploiting software and hardware vulnerabilities. To address this, we present the notion of personal security assistant based on the cognitive model of the human mind and intended to defend human users from manipulation and negative impacts. \n\n=== \n\nAnton Kolonin received his first education as a programmer in the special mathematical class of the Novosibirsk Academgorodok in Siberia, Russian kind of “Silicon Valley”. Later he graduated cum laude from the Leningrad Mining Institute in Saint Petersburg. By the end of the institute, he prepared for publication several scientific papers in the field of computational geophysics. After the institute, he independently developed a software-algorithmic complex for processing geophysical data, introduced into production in many CIS countries. This work served as the basis for his Ph.D. thesis, defended in 1998.\n\nOver the past 25+ years, Anton Kolonin has participated as a leader or lead architect in many projects to develop algorithms and software, including those related to the use of AI, including the recognition of static text, moving objects, music, extracting information from texts and identifying events on financial markets – in Russian and foreign companies. Since 2014, he leads his own project Aigents, as the founder and technical director, about 20 research papers have been published on the project topic. The project targets to create personal ad secure agents of artificial intelligence for individuals and small businesses. Since 2017, he is also a software architect for AI and blockchain in the SingularityNET project, leading work care of unsupervised language learning and reputation systems.\n\nhttps://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.anton.kolonin"
