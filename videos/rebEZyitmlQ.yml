description: "Conversational interfaces are here to stay. Almost all IM clients have now the possibility to create bots, and with devices as Google Home or Amazon Alexa solely based on voice, bots and NLP will be more important every day. API.AI allows us to easily create a smart agent with ability to learn and to interact with all those services (and much more). In the talk we will review the steps to create a Google Action that can answer questions about the Star Wars characters in a natural and fluid way.\n\nMore information about awesome conference: https://devfest.gdg.lv"
