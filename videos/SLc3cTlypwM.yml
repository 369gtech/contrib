title: 'Authentication as a Microservice'
language: English
recordingDate: 1519790233
description: "Authentication is a core piece of many applications. However, it has traditionally been handled in a monolithic manner. Foreign keys to the user table and join tables for roles and permissions is the most common mechanism that applications use to manage user data. Moving to micro-services means that applications now need to decouple authentication, user management and user data. To accomplish this, a portable identity model is required.\n\nBrian Pontarelli\nCEO / CHAIRMAN\nInversoft\nBrian Pontarelli is founder and CEO of Inversoft, a Denver-based provider of platform technologies built to help companies manage, moderate and engage their customers. These technologies include Passport, a modern identity and user management API that provides login, registration, single sign-on and many other user management features and CleanSpeak, an intelligent profanity filtering and moderation tool. Before Brian bootstrapped Inversoft, he studied computer engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. After graduating, he worked at a variety of companies including Orbitz, BEA, US Freightways, XOR and Texturemedia.
