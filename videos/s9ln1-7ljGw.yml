You will also get to know the boundaries of Kubernetes â€“ what it does and what is it not supposed to do. \n\nYou will also understand the inherent architecture of Kubernetes â€“ master components, node components and the addons provided by it. The course will start off with learning the basic components of Kubernetes like Node, Pod, Deployment, Services, APIs etc and then teach you to create a local cluster using Ubuntu VMs. \n\nYou will also learn to deploy stateful and stateless apps on the cluster. Finally, you will learn, how to expose these app outside of the kubernetes cluster and will also get to know how to scale their apps either manually or using auto-scaling. Learn the best security practices that must be followed during this container and cluster orchestration.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nWho should go for this course?\n\nThere is a huge shift in DevOps from virtualization to containerization. Docker has been the buzzword in the technology sphere, in the recent past to ship applications as containers. \n\nA research states that there are already 10,000 companies who have adopted containers for taking their application to production and there are already 185 million containers on use in the world. The rate of adoption of Docker is increasing by 40% every year. Now that Docker has become the most integral part of production environment, various organizations are now looking out for tools that can help them effectively manage and orchestrate their containers. \n\nHere is when industries started adopting a Google open sourced tool called Kubernetes for effectively managing the containers.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free)."
