title: '2019 - Dariusz Wawer - Microservices are the answer - but what is the question?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1574708412
description: 'Microservices are no longer a novelty used by select few modern companies. Orchestrators are stable and trustworthy, there''s plenty of tools and learning resources available and more and more people have experience working with microservices, Somehow microservices became a kind of a standard, widely used in all fields by many companies, including large corporations. In this talk I will share my and my colleagues'' experiences building a microservices architecture from scratch - three separate times for three different major companies. And I will not attempt to answer the technical question of "how" - there''s lots of resources covering that topic. I will focus on "what", "when" and "why": what kinds of problems are microservices well fitted to solve? What drawbacks do they have or what difficulties do they introduce? What should you remember when designing the architecture? And finally - when should the microservices be used at all.'
