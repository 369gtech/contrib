title: 'Higher order functions for ordinary C++ developers - Bj√∂rn Fahller'

description: "Higher order functions, i.e. functions that accept functions as parameters, or return functions, are not used much by C++ developers, except for the occasional call to standard algorithms.\nThis session will show some simple techniques for writing your own, that will lift the level of abstraction in your programs, making code easier to read while reducing code duplication, and maintaining performance.\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
