title: '#HITBGSEC COMMSEC: Hacking Object Detectors Is Just Like Training Neural Networks - Jay Xiong'
language: English
recordingDate: 1569108463
description: "In this presentation, we will demonstrate a new perspective for object detector deception techniques. We will formulate the object detector attacking process, comparing it with the neural network training process, to show that they share an intrinsic similarity. In addition, by applying the techniques in training a neural network, our experiments show performance improvement for the adversarial attack upon the state-of-the-art techniques.\n\n=====\n\nJunfeng Xiong (Jay Xiong) is an AI security researcher at Baidu X-Lab.
