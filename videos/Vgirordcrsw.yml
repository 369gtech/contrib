description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nThis session will feature four panelists who have extensive experience in designing systems that have to work securely in an insecure world. Two of the panelists have multiple decades defending everything from operating systems to networks to sensitive military systems from attackers.\n— \n\nPatricia Aas, TurtleSec\nProgrammer\nPatricia has been programming C++ professionally for 13 years, she started out working on the Opera desktop browser and has looped back to browser making in the recent years, now working on the Vivaldi browser with many ex-opera colleagues. While away from the browser world she did a stint as a Java consultant coming back to C++ when working on embedded teleconference systems at Cisco. For the last couple of years she has begun doing public speaking, after only doing in-house speaking before. She is passionate about the tech industry and its impact on peoples lives. Since January she has been active in the #include＜C++＞ community where she is one of the admins.\n\nMatthew Butler\nMatthew Butler has spent the last three decades as a systems architect and software engineer developing systems for network security, law enforcement and the military. He primarily works in signals intelligence using C, C++ and Modern C++ to build systems running on hardware platforms ranging from embedded micro-controllers to FPGAs to large-scale airborne platforms. Much of his experience has come in either building systems that defend against attackers or building highly sensitive systems that are targets. He is actively involved in the C++ community and is on various planning committees for C++Now and CppCon as well as being a speaker at both.\nOver the past thirty years, he has learned the harsh lessons on how we often write systems that fail, not because they don't scale, but because they aren't designed to be secure.\n\n\nEva Conti, Andromeda LLC\nAlso known as Bunny in some circles, Eva started doing very bad things with computers when she was a teenager, but eventually learned to use her powers for good instead of evil. These days, she is an organizer for #include, advocate for diversity and acceptance in both the tech and gaming community, and focuses on automation and penetration testing in her day to day life. She is a games industry veteran, rescuer of guinea pigs, and an avid writer who somehow still gets asked to do things like be on Cpp.Chat and moderate security panels.\n\n\nMatt Miller, Microsoft\nMatt Miller is a Partner Security Software Engineer working as part of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). In this role, Matt drives strategy and engineering related to proactive vulnerability defense across Microsoft's products and services. Prior to joining Microsoft ten years ago, Matt was a core contributor to the Metasploit framework and an editor for the Uninformed journal.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
