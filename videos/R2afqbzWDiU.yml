description: "Modern type systems have come a long way from the days of C and Java. Far from being nit-pickers that berate us for making mistakes, type systems like the ones found in Haskell, PureScript and Elm form a language in themselves. A language for expressing high-level ideas about our software to our colleagues and to the computer. A design language. In this talk, we'll take a look at the way the right kind of type signatures let us talk about software. We'll survey how to state our assumptions about the domain we're coding in and how each part fits together. We'll show how it can highlight problems, and surface opportunities for reuse. And most importantly, we'll see how types can help you communicate to your coworkers, and to future maintainers, with little effort. You've probably heard the phrase, \"programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute.\" Come and see how a modern type system is about communicating ideas to humans, and only incidentally about proving correctness.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
