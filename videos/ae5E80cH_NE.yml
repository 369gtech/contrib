title: 'BARTEK ZDANOWSKI - Vert.x - high performance polyglot scalable platform'
recordingDate: 1445385959
description: "Vert.x is very efficient high performance scalable platform. Based on event driven paradigm with eventbus allows you to build non blocking thread safe asynchronous applications. Vert.x is easily scalable that can handle very high load of concurrent connections. Due to non blocking IO efficiently uses server resources. It runs smoothly even on Raspberry Pi! That's awesome base for IoT solutions!\nAnother key feature of Vert.x is ability to use many programming languages in the same application. Vert.x supports Java, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Ruby, Python, Groovy, Scala, Clojure and Ceylon. You can mix all of them in the same application using eventbus to communicate between pieces. Vert.x nicely handles concurrency so writing concurrent and yet thread safe code was never so easy. During the talk I'll show you live how to create simple and more advanced pieces of code. In 2014 Vert.x won Jax Innovation Award in Most innovative Java Technology category. Vertx 3.0 is on the way with it's premiere at 22 July 2015.\nVert.x is awesome. Come and let me convince you!"
