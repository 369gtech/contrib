title: 'Habits of Highly Effective Technical Teams'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433260247
description: "Most software development teams deliver applications over budget, not on time, and with a distinct lack of quality. So how do you transform your organization and teams from a cost center into part of your revenue-generating business? How do you get your IT teams to work at their creative best? How do you create those magic  x10  teams that people keep talking about? Over the past 13 years, Martijn Verburg (a.k.a. The Diabolical Developer) has specialized in transforming technical teams. In this session, he covers the cultural and technical habits of highly effective teams in organizations from deep-tech startups through to ponderous government departments. He unveils the truth and tells you what not to do, based on bitter first-, second-, and thirdhand experience.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMartijn Verburg\nMartijn Verburg (aka 'the Diabolical Developer') herds Cats in the Java/open source communities and is constantly humbled by the creative power to be found there. Currently he resides in London where he co-leads the London JUG (a JCP EC member), runs a couple of open source projects & drinks too much beer at his local pub. You can find him online moderating at the Javaranch or discussing (ranting?) subjects on the Programmers Stack Exchange site. Most recently he's become a regular speaker at conferences on Java, open source and software development and has recently wrapped up his first Manning title - \"The Well-Grounded Java Developer\" with his co-author Ben Evans.\nView more trainings by Martijn Verburg at https://www.parleys.com/author/martijn-verburg\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
