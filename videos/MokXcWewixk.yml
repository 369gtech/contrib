description: "by Gorka Eguileor\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2214/container_storage_interface_explained.webm\n\n\nOver the next year, all Kubernetes persistent storage will be moving to CSI plugins. But what is CSI? What's in the specification? How does it work in practice? The rapidly evolving Container Storage Interface specification has finally slowed down, reaching its first stable release v1.0.  With it, all vendors have rushed to update their drivers or write new ones.  But what does this mean to us? How does CSI benefit the ecosystem? What are the final features? \n\nIn this talk we’ll cover this and more, going over the objectives and feature of the CSI spec, as well as some of the Kubernetes flows.  By the end of the talk, you’ll be up to date with the current CSI spec, be able to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with a CSI plugin, and know the elements in Kubernetes’ CSI, their relationship, and the part that each one plays. \n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:15:00+01"
