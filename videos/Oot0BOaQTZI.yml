description: "\"Racial Profiling Analysis in a Post-Beer Summit World\"\r\nGreg Ridgeway\r\n\r\nGreg Ridgeway, Director of the RAND Safety & Justice Program, and Director of the RAND Center on Quality Policing, presents \"Racial Profiling Analysis in a Post-Beer Summit World,\" an analysis of effective policing practices and policies with special focus on racial profiling.  The title of the talk is a reference to the 2009 incident between a Cambridge police department officer and a prominent African-American college professor that was escalated to a national discussion on policing and racial profiling.  Ridgeway has worked with dozens of law enforcement agencies, local police, federal agencies, and non-U.S. police forces on predictive policing, recruiting, gun violence, community relations, use of force, racial profiling, and other key policing issues.  He will examine some of of his methods in this talk.\r\n\r\nGreg Ridgeway received his Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in statistics from the University of Washington, Seattle; and a B.S. in statistics from the California Polytechnic State University. Prior to joining RAND Dr. Ridgeway worked at Microsoft Research, receiving seven patents for developed methods.  He has published studies on some of the largest police departments in the United States, including Los Angeles, New York City, and San Diego."
