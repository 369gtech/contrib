title: '"Your Secrets are Safe with Julia: A Compiler for Secure Computation" by Jason Dagit'
language: English
recordingDate: 1539526473
description: "Homomorphic Encryption (HE) provides the ability to compute functions over encrypted data without the need to decrypt. By computing on the encrypted values, HE is able to ensure that private data stays private. Traditionally, HE has been a tool that only cryptography experts have had the expertise to use. In this talk we will explore Ramparts, a compiler that translates a subset of the Julia programming language into a form suitable for computation under HE. Because the computation model for HE is different than traditional compute models we required a strange kind of compiler. Ramparts provides a proof of concept for the idea that data scientists, and programmers generally, should not have to compromise on the tools they use in order to take advantage of homomorphic encryption.\n\nSpeaker: Jason Dagit"
