title: 'Konrad Kokosa. Mobius — writing your own .NET runtime running on .NET Core'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619617822
description: ".NET application is «just» a piece of CIL bytecode to be executed by the .NET runtime. And .NET runtime is «just» a program that is able to perform this task. It happens that currently .NET Framework/.NET Core runtimes are written in C++. But what if we write .NET runtime as... .NET application? Is it possible at all? Does it sound like kind of inception and infinite recursion? I’ve decided to try this out and this is how Mobius project has been coined. Obviously, for a single person it can be only a small vertical proof-of-concept to be written. But I found it interesting to validate such idea and I find it small usages as well. I’d like to share with you this mental experiment, that allows you to better understand deep .NET runtime internals.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/Ot12hiW8NxhtiQ\n\nDotFest: https://2020.dotfest.ru/lecture/3"
