description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh LDN 18 http://bit.ly/2P7SPII\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nPARSING SAFELY, FROM 500MB/S TO 2GB/S\nby Geoffroy Couprie\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nParser\nCombinators\nRust\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nTo handle low level data, we now have a few safe languages, and good parsing libraries, to make sure untrusted data will never overstep its bounds. Unfortunately, when we need performance, we will too often resort to handwritten state machines, generally in C, and maybe a little assembly while we're at it.\n\nThanks to one of the most annoying formats to parse (HTTP), we will see how we can write a naive parser in Rust, and transform it to beat state of the art handwritten C parsers while keeping it as readable and safe as the original one.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/geoffroy-couprie/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - GEOFFROY COUPRIE\nSecurity engineer\n\nGeoffroy thinks a lot about parsers and protocols, and builds proxies for Clever Cloud. If left unchecked, he starts writing highly technical projects for ridiculous purposes and puns.\n\nMore on Geoffroy Couprie: http://codesync.global/speaker/geoffroy-couprie/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
