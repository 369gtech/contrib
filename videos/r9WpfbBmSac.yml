title: 'Fitting Stateful Functions into a streaming platform'
recordingDate: 1635784214
description: 'At Nordstrom, a fashion retailer in the United States and Canada, engineers are invested in event-driven architectures and real-time processing of streams of data on Apache Kafka. Every day, hundreds of engineers are adding to thousands of topics and schemas from many different domains including merchandising, warehouse, inventory, customer activity, physical and digital stores, credit, payments, and more. Enabling our diverse technology organization to deploy their applications to our shared streaming platform in a usable and observable way is an exciting challenge. Kafka clusters and their tenants, Kafka topics, Avro schemas, and Kafka Connect connectors are some of the platform resources we support. In this talk, we''ll show how we can use Stateful Functions as an event-driven control-plane to model and manage the evolving resources in our infrastructure. We''ll mix this data with telemetry to provide a rich view of streaming resources to our users and enable interesting behaviors.'
