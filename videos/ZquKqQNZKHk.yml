title: 'Finding aids as open data: Access points to data-drive stories of the past'
recordingDate: 1579212993
description: "Bonnie Wildie\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/156/\n\nFinding aids are an important part of archival practice, designed and created to facilitate user access to archival collections. As these traditionally paper-based manifestations find expression in electronic formats, institutions envision “new ways of locating, interacting with and sharing information about archival material”. In some cases, institutions are proactively releasing finding aids, such as indexes, as open datasets. In others, electronic index data is being hacked, liberated from behind institutional interfaces and set free as open data. This presentation takes the audience on a series of short data journeys provoked by hacked index data made free. It makes the argument for greater support for and release of open data by cultural heritage institutions. \r\n\r\nThese data-driven stories of discovery and exploration take us into the past, and inspire us to ask new questions of these materials. Is there, for example, a link between occupation and location as evidenced by the visualisation of index data for the unemployed in Sydney, 1866?\r\nWas a spike in data extracted from the publican licences index for the 1850s a result of the NSW gold rush? Are Mary and William, married by Samuel Marsden in 1830, a typical convict couple, or an example of systemic reductionism of identity and experience operating within the ‘System’? And finally, what happens when you feed this data to a Twitter bot?\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
