description: "Language as a Tool of Thought: Consistency versus Progress by Victor Shepelev\n\nOur programming language is not a mere instrument: it shapes how we think about problems, what we feel right and wrong. But as the Ruby itself changes (and rather quickly, lately), what happens with our understanding and feeling of it? More powerful language is probably good, but how should it stay consistent and true to its spirit without losing the pace of the progress? Let's look closely at some new and upcoming Ruby features, and some missing and rejected ones, and discuss where are we standing currently in regards to consistency and \"developer's happiness\".\n\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019 #rubyconf"
