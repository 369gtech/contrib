description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPaving the Way of WebAssembly in the Intersection of Machine Learning and Cloud Native - Shivay Lamba, Layer5; Mritunjay Sharma, Hackerrank\n\nToday, Machine learning can be seen in literally every aspect in life. Machine learning has become more than a buzzword. It is used in almost all fields : from education to cloud native, from Deep Learning to DevOps. The lingua franca of machine learning is Python. However, Python itself is quite slow when it comes to computationally intensive algorithms. On the other hand, Rust could be 25x faster than Python for machine learning. Furthermore, the language of the web is mostly JavaScript. While building machine learning solutions for web applications, performance of the machine learning models is really important and that is already a lot of complexity which often results in poor performance. Rust functions can be compiled into WebAssembly bytecode for runtime safety, cross-platform portability, and capability-based security. Developers can then access those functions from an easy-to-use JavaScript API in the Node.js environment or deployed in cloud-native technologies like WasmEdge. This talk shows how you can integrate machine learning models written in Rust and executed in Web Assembly can be integrated with Nodejs and cloud-native WasmEdge to power machine learning based web applications."
