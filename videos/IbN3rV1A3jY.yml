description: 'The games industry is a sprawling business with over $100bn turnover per year, but its audience spans genders, generations, and communities. How can we make sense of the diverse results of video game development? In this talk, Dr. Mata Haggis presents a model that allows both outsiders and developers to gain an overall understanding of the commonalities and differences in the areas of games development. Taking a view from the perspective of the developers themselves, this model creates a coherent picture of this exciting and innovative medium.'
