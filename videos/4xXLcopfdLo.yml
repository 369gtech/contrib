description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nProgramming Languages on top of the BEAM\nby\nManuel Rubio, Robert Virding\n\nABSTRACT\nTalk about the implementation of languages on top of BEAM which have not the same semantics as Erlang so, it is not going to be a talk about languages like LFE or Elixir but also others like Lua or PHP which are implemented in an interpreted way. The talk is going to review the issues that can occur, solutions to them and also give some examples about how in the end they can be done.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Manuel Rubio\n\nManuel is a developer since he was 12 years old (26 years ago) and he started with Basic, like others, but later also with Modula-2, Pascal, C, Assembler and these before 20 years old. In his professional career, he used Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, and last 10 years he was more on Erlang and 4 years ago he started with Elixir and Go. He can be considered a polyglot programmer and he loves to teach and coach others.\nHe also a fan of creating crazy projects like myproto, ephp or skirnir.\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Robert Virding\n\nRobert Virding is Principal Language Expert at Erlang Solutions Ltd. While at Ericsson AB, Robert was one of the original members of the Ericsson Computer Science Lab, and co-inventor of the Erlang language. He took part in the original system design and contributed much of the original libraries, as well as to the current compiler. While at the lab he also did a lot of work on the implementation of logic and functional languages and on garbage collection. He has also worked as an entrepreneur and was one of the co-founders of one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail). Robert also worked a number of years at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) Modelling and Simulations Group. He co-authored the first book (Prentice-Hall) on Erlang, and is regularly invited to teach and present throughout the world.\n---\n\nCode BEAM V\nWebsite: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio"
