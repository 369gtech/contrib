title: 'Math for Game Developers - Runge-Kutta Order 4'
recordingDate: 1470337203
description: "Runge-Kutta 4 is the go-to integration method for initial-value problems like the ones we have been studying. Then at the end I apply it also to the orbital mechanics problem from previous videos.\n\nMidpoint is a much more accurate method than Euler for numerically integrating differential equations.\n\nhttps://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/numerical-integrations\n\nNew video some Thursdays. Question? Leave a comment below, or ask me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VinoBS"
