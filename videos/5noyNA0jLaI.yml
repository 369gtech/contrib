description: "Most Open Source communities do their best to welcome new contributors to their projects on every technical level, but small things like overly technical descriptions of projects, incomplete documentation, & wordy write-ups can unintentionally intimidate potential contributors without a lot of experience &/or traditional tech education.\n\nAs a pretengineer myself now in charge of building an open source community, it is important to me to remove as many boundaries as possible for others coming from non-tech backgrounds, but who are passionate about Open Source software. Being careful to not construct unintended boundaries in the projects I maintain, in addition to spreading awareness with other projects has become something of a mission. In this talk I will share what obstacles I've observed over the course of my my journey in the Open Source world, as well as my game plan for dismantling said obstacles as a community manager.\n\nTreva Williams\nReplicated\n@OGtrilliams\n\nTreva Nichole Williams is a Red Hat certified Linux, OpenStack, & OpenShift sysadmin, instructor, & dedicated Open Source evangelist.
