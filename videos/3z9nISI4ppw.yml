description: "Dependent types let us use the same programming language for compile-time and run-time code, and are inching their way towards the mainstream from research languages. Unfortunately, the essential beauty of dependent types can sometimes be hard to find under layers of powerful automatic tools.\n\nPie is a little dependently typed language, small enough to understand completely but big enough to write a variety of proofs and programs.\n\nCome get a taste of Pie, and see for yourself where dependent types can take us.\n\nMore details here: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2017/david-christiansen"
