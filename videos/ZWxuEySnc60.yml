description: "We often focus on our output, the thing we're delivering and let everything else fall by the wayside. When we flip the focus on our journey, and put the time into thinking about how we deliver, rather than what we deliver we can change the conversation and bring people into the picture.\n\nLet's look at culture together and understand how encouraging people to bring their whole self to work can transform our delivery and improve not only what we do but how we do it.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
