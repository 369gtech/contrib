recordingDate: 1312076880
description: "Humans. As a species, we suck. The only real evolutionary advantage we have is our brains, and by using them we've become the dominant species on the planet. Our brains are superbly adapted for our survival and success in the environment in which they evolved... the African savanna 200,000 years ago.\n\nOur brains are not-at-all suited for modern life, and are plagued by a raft of bugs and unwanted features that we've been unable to remove. Join us in a tour of some of the most amusing bugs and exploits wetware has to offer.\n\nPaul Fenwick\n\nPerl Training Australia\n\nPaul Fenwick is the managing director of Perl Training Australia, and has been teaching computer science for over a decade.
