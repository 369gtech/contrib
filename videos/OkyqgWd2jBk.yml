description: "PyData Warsaw 2018\n\nPyTorch is one of the main tools used for machine learning research these days. It’s been developed in beta mode for over 2 years, but this October, a release candidate for 1.0 version has been finally released! In this talk, I’ll briefly introduce the library, and then move on to showcase the cutting edge features we introduced recently.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
