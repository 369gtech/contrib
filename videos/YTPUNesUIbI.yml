description: "For Spring developers, building containers is a common obstacle on the road to Kubernetes adoption. Traditionally, Dockerfiles define container builds imperatively, but can also be cumbersome, error-prone, and slow. The development cycle can be slow. IDE support is generally poor. Most likely, your Java application will crash with an OOMKill message.\n\nIn this talk, we'll introduce tools and best practices to help you adopt Kubernetes faster and easier. This includes tools such as Jib and Skaffold for fast image build and development cycle turnaround time. We'll also discuss best practices for configuring your Java applications to run inside of Kubernetes, such as health checks, zero downtime deployment, externalizing configurations, logging, and understanding memory usage to avoid OOMKilled situations.\n\nSpeaker: Ray Tsang, Developer Advocate, Google\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/best-practices-to-spring-to-kubernetes-easier-and-faster"
