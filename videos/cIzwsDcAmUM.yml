description: "There are two big discussions in the world of programming. Tabs vs. Spaces and statically-typed languages vs dynamically-typed. TypeScript is Microsoftâ€™s approach to add a stronger type system to JavaScript while making both camps happy.\n\nLet's not jump into the never-ending debate to what the better approach is, but instead focus on when you should use TypeScript and how you can start using TypeScript in your projects today.\n\nDominik Kundel is a Developer Evangelist for Twilio serving developer communities in Berlin and around the world. He has a passion for JavaScript, hackathons, teaching and good whiskey. You will usually find him speaking at meetups and conferences, mentoring at hackathons and CoderDojos or work on open source projects.\n\n[SRK-1932]"
