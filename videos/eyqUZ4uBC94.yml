description: "Picture this in your mind. Your neighbours playing Spotify in the early hours of the morning and you are trying to sleep. Would you go over and chat to them or would you use your phone and disable their internet. \n\nThis session shows you how to do such things and other useful skills like attacking your own web applications to look for vulnerabilities, check if someone is snooping on your network and even how to find beer on the internet. \n\nSpeaker: Niall Merrigan"
