description: "In our modern REST architectures, the session cookies of old are getting stale and crusty. It’s time to unbox JSON Web Tokens : a new approach, simpler, 100% stateless and easily scalable.\n\nNo more server side session storage. No more session replication across the cluster. Best of all, navigating multiple layers of APIs with only a single connection is much easier.\n\nIn this talk, you will discover the inner workings of JWTs. You will see how to handle a client session properly between a browser and a server. We will explore other usages and wrap up with pros and cons.\n\nHubert Sablonnière\nI'm a curious and passionnate Web developer. I'm specialized in HTML, CSS and JavaScript but I also use server side technologies like NodeJS, PHP, Java, Neo4j, Docker...\n\nWith OpenDevise I help clients to move their trainings and conference talks to the next level.\n\nMy motivation : \"To push the technology far enough to find new ways to improve user's experiences.\"\n\n[DUK-7522]"
