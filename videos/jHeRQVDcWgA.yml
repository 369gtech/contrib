It is present everywhere. It really doesn't matter which domain you are working in, you will surely come across Java sooner or later!\n\nOpen Source: The good news is that Java is available for free! All the development tools and the environment (JRE & JDK) that is used to develop Java applications are absolutely free of cost.\n\nAndroid: Irrespective of the fact that you are tech-savvy or not, most of us are badly bitten by the Android bug! Android is in great demand today and fortunately, you need Java for Android development. Hence, the importance of Java has increased even more.\n\nHadoop: Hadoop is one of the most trending frameworks for processing Big Data. It has been designed and developed in Java.\n\nIn spite of having a tough competition on the server side from Microsoft and other companies, Java is doing extremely well on mobile platforms, thanks to Android! It has also been the primary language for Hadoop Developers.\n-------------------------------------  \n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free)."
