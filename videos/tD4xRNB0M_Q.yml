description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nWhile 2014 CppCon talk \"C++ in Huge AAA Games\" focused on reality for a lot of games developed at Ubisoft Montreal, this talk with focus on what was done to ship Rainbow Six Siege at 60 frames per second. Delivering a game with 5 versus 5 multi-player with heavy procedural environment destruction at 60 FPS was a constant challenge. From memory usage to lock-free solutions, a lot of developed C++ solutions are reusable outside of games. Some interesting analysis tools were also developed to find issues, and their concepts could be reused by any C++ developer caring about performance. \n— \nNicolas Fleury\nTechnical Architect, Ubisoft Montreal\nNicolas has 13 years of experience in the video game industry, more years in the software industry in telecoms, in speech recognition and in computer assisted surgery.
