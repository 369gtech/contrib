description: "Speaker: \r\n\r\nWe're holding a DataLearn on how to use docker within a data project! What is this DataLearn?This DataLearn is to prepare volunteers for our upcoming DataDive (to be held on 7-9 Apr). In this session, we will share on the usage of dockerized jupyter notebooks for R and Python. This is to ensure volunteers know how to use these tools at the DataDive. Using docker will allow us to promote reproducibility of analysis among project team members and our partner organisations, regardless of our computing environments (Windows, Linux or MacOS). Please bring your laptop as this will be a hands-on session, thanks!\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/DataKind-SG/events/237997635/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/5Dk2/"
