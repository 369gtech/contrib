description: "Tom's spent 16 years working with technology across a number of sectors, from manufacturing with Jaguar Cars to media with the BBC, Global Radio and now ITV. During this time he's held senior positions in several disciplines, including engineering, development and architecture. As Head of Common Platform at ITV, he's responsible for the cloud hosting platform that underpins their key applications. He'll always be an engineer, but now his day job is managing and developing the team of \"smart and kind\" people that build, maintain and advance the platform.\n\nDOES18 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
