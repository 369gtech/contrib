description: "Google Tech Talks\nMarch 29, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe want powerful, linguistic abstractions for concurrent and parallel control of computational devices, be they small or big. As a step towards this, we've been developing the Transterpreter[1], a small (8KB), portable VM for a growing family of programming languages. The most complete and interesting language we support is occam-pi[2].\n\nIn this talk, we'll talk a bit about the journey that brought us here, paying particular attention to things we think are cool. Typically, \"things we think are cool\" involve using linguistic abstraction to make programming tasks involving concurrency and parallelism easier. So, expect to see some wireless sensor network..."
