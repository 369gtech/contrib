description: "Anna Fiofilova\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/208/\n\nWorking in the IT industry today is hard, but it is even harder if you are a woman. There is still lots of â€œold school thinking\" that women face daily. This talk is a survival guide based on real-life stories and different challenges from women of different ages, cultural backgrounds and roles in the Australian IT industry.\r\nLike any survival guide, this one provides you with the essential information to help you identify and overcome the most frequently encountered hazards. Each chapter contains useful tips, instructions and practical advice on a particular issue so you can implement the skills and techniques even under the most stressful circumstances. From the hiring process to promotions and corporate events, you'll have the tools to survive.\r\n \r\nYou will learn these skills and more:\r\n* Assess your situation and prioritize your needs;\r\n* Surviving techniques for the hiring process;\r\n* Assemble your own custom emergency kit with essentials tools;\r\n* Manage extreme work conditions and overtime;\r\n* Survive corporate parties and drinks;\r\n* Build trust network and create allies; \r\n* Identify your enemies and their habits.\r\nPreparation is the key. If you are starting your career in IT or navigating through it - this guide is for you.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
