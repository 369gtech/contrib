description: "Sponsored Keynote: What I Learned Running 10,000+ Kubernetes Clusters - Jason McGee, IBM Fellow, IBM \n\nAfter years of running Kubernetes, I've learned a few things about scale. When you have one cluster, you can manage it by hand. For 2-10 clusters, familiar tools work OK. But for more than 10, it's time for help. In my Kubernetes journey, I've seen stable tools fail under pressure. Even with good intentions, developers can throw a wrench into ideal consistent ops. This keynote covers how to scale to thousands of clusters worldwide. You'll also hear why observability for every cluster change is critical. And don't forget about policy enforcement for cluster declarations. Bonus! A demo of Open Razee (a new open source project) shows how you can control and scale daily cluster updates. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MRzX"
