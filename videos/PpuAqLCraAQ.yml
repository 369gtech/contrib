description: "WebAssembly brings a new capability to the web, delivering a performant run-time to allow compiled languages such as C++ to be used in web applications. In this video, Alex Danilo and Deepti Gandluri introduce the principles for using WebAssembly in a web application, techniques for debugging, and demonstrate a real-world example of a large code-base built to run in the browser for production deployment. They also present future features coming to Web Assembly along with some tips for how to deploy and support older browsers using a graceful degradation approach.\n\nCheck out the rest of the Chrome Dev Summit videos here: https://goo.gl/ekCoVu                \nSubscribe to the Google Chrome Developers channel: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
