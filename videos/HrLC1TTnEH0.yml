description: "Many people may not know it, but we live in a time where the first quantum computers have been created - and they're pretty damn cool. Why? Because while regular bits are limited to only two boring values, QBITs can take near infinite values and operate singularly or in harmony with each other. This outstanding property gives rise to a new kind of algorithms (and a lot of fun!). Follow me on a journey from Zuses Z3 computer and Schr√∂dingers cat to supercooled quantum processors and parallel universes - no PhD in physics required.\n\nA software developer for Senacor Technologies by day, I have long been interested in the \"metadata\" of computers and programming. This has lead to - among other things - the exploration of some esoteric programming languages, the culture around geeks and nerds (of which I am one myself) and the history of computers and programming. It also leads me to exploring new concepts and how those influence what we do for a living."
