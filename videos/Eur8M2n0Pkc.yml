title: 'Teodor Elstad Making the pixels dance at Mobile Era'
recordingDate: 1574413422
description: "Playing around with shaders can be a creative and satisfying way to explore visual programming, and with WebGL being supported on most mobile and desktop browsers, it’s more accessible than ever. Still, writing shaders might seem intimidating at first glance. What is this strange GLSL-language, and why does all the examples resemble a badly formatted math paper? Let’s take a quick dive into shader programming, and get familiar with the basics of fragment shaders, how to create more or less planned effects, and how to use audio to breath life into simple visualizations. Although shaders might take a lifetime to master, there’s plenty of room for casual exploration and happy accidents for those of us just starting out.\n\nAbout the speaker\nTeodor works at Computas, where he’s currently busy telling everybody that Charles Moore ran a very successful consulting firm using Forth, among other things. He’s passionate about programming as an creative process, and he strongly believe that fun fosters innovation. When he’s not coding for hire, he enjoys making programs that run for a while and only makes the machine hot. In the future he hopes to eliminate this unfortunate side-effect as well.\n\nAbout Mobile Era\nMobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo. We're passionate about developing mobile apps and want to see a kick-ass event in Oslo for people like ourselves. The organizing committee consists of developers who are also active in organizing open events, conferences and meetups in the Oslo developer community.\n\nOur topics: iOS / Android, Mobile web / PWA, Cross-platform / JS-to-Native, IoT / Hardware, Mobile UX / Accessibility\n\nFollow us on:\n\nWebsite: mobileera.rocks\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mobileeraconf\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mobileeraconf/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mobileeraconf"
