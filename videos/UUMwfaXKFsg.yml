language: English
recordingDate: 1584704721
description: "APEX 19.1, released in early 2019, introduced the new Form Region. Besides REST Service and REST Enabled SQL support, this new region type has a number of new features: It supports multiple form regions on a page, these can be created not only on tables, but also on SQL queries and even on \"PL/SQL Functions returning SQL\".  Developers are offered far more flexibility when building the form DML processes, i.e. use custom PL/SQL code, but keep the lost update detection.\n\nThis Office Hours session will introduce the new form region and walk you through its new capabilities.  This session is for both new and existing APEX developers.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
