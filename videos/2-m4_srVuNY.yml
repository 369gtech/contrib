description: "Mistakes Were Made by Jesse Spevack\n\nWe picked the wrong technology. We worked in silos. We prematurely optimized. We introduced too many changes at once. And yet somehow we delivered a system that is integral to a shopping rewards app used by millions across the United States. I want to tell you the story of how the best of intentions led to crucial blunders. In this public, honest, and vulnerable post-mortem I will share the missteps I made so that you can avoid them.\n\n__________\n\nJesse Spevack is a father of twins, skier, marathoner, and Senior Platform Engineer at Ibotta, a cash back for shopping app whose mission is to make every purchase rewarding. Before getting into the tech world, Jesse worked in public K-12 education for 11 years in teaching, school leadership, and consulting. Jesse transitioned from education into technology by way of the Turing School of Software Design, a Denver based code school with a Ruby-centric curriculum."
