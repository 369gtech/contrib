title: 'Deep Dive: Cloud Native Buildpacks - Terence Lee & Joe Kutner, Salesforce Heroku'

description: "Deep Dive: Cloud Native Buildpacks - Terence Lee & Joe Kutner, Salesforce Heroku \n\nLearn why you need a buildpack and how to create one. We'll write a simple Python buildpack we can use to build an image from a Django app. We'll take advantage of caching and Docker layers to speed up rebuilds and deploys. Unlike Dockerfiles, buildpacks are composable. We'll create a build pipeline with our Python buildpack and the Node.js buildpack, which we'll use to prepare asset bundles.&nbsp; Finally, you'll learn how to rebase your application layers on a new image. This allows operators to efficiently handle the delivery of OS-level dependency upgrades. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/I1p2"
