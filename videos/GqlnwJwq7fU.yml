description: "Google Tech Talk\nMay 17, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by Vladimir Bulatov.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe discuss technical challenges of creation of 3D printable models and  what Shapeways team is doing to help developers and regular users to create unique and customizable 3D pieces. In particular we will pay attention to use of AbBab3D - open source software for 3D voxel based modeling library developed by Shapeways. \n\nAbout the Speaker: Vladimir Bulatov, PhD. \nPrior of joining Shapeways in 2012 as 3D graphics research scientist Vladimir has been doing academic research in theoretical physics at St. Petersburg University and Imperial College and developing software for non visual access to scientific information at ViewPlus Technologies. He also runs his own business of making mathematically inspired sculptures and jewelry."
