description: "In this talk, I'll discuss the sort of systems we would like to understand better, and why I've found Julia a useful tool to approach them. I'll also discuss what it is about the Julia community at large I feel is great for scientists (and non-scientists!), and how programmers of any skill level can get involved.\n\nEVENT:\n\nPyData NYC 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nKatharine Hyatt\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nPyData provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nPyData YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjD18EJYcsBog4IozkF_7w"
