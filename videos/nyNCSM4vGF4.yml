description: "Dan Lüdtke, Google\n\nMay I introduce \"Skinny\", an education-focused, distributed lock service.\n\nWith the help of Skinny, we will:\n\nbriefly look at the Paxos protocol\nsee an example of a typical Paxos run\ndesign a simple distributed consensus protocol\nlearn the tricky parts of implementing our simple distributed consensus protocol\ngradually move from theory-level to coding-level, solving small challenges (network, availability, fault-tolerance) along the way\nThis talk addresses engineers who had little exposure to the inner workings of distributed consensus, who want to learn about distributed consensus as they start building distributed systems, and who worked with ready-made distributed consensus solutions such as Zookeper and etcd but strive to understand the underlying theory as well.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
