title: 'Generating Celebrity Voices & Music'
language: English
recordingDate: 1566441301
description: "I've generated my own voice with AI! This is a relatively new technology and people have started generating not just celebrity voices, but entire musical pieces as well. The technology to generate sounds, both voices & music, has been rapidly improving the past few years thanks to deep learning. In this episode, I'll first demo some AI generated music. Then, i'll explain the physics of a waveform and how DeepMind used waveform-based data to generate some pretty realistic sounds in 2016. At the end, I'll describe the cutting edge of generative sound modeling, a paper released just 2 months ago called \"MelNet\". Enjoy! \n\nIt would mean so much to me if you subscribe to my Youtube channel! https://bit.ly/2SvhG7v\n\nCoding challenge! Replicate MelNet by Sept 1 2019, submit your github links in the comment section and i'll announce the winner shortly afterwards in a video.
