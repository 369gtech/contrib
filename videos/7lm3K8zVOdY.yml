title: 'Lucas Cavalcanti & Edward Wible - Exploring four hidden superpowers of Datomic'
recordingDate: 1416604862
description: "This session will explore four common problems, and the unique and surprising tools Datomic provides to solve them elegantly:\n\n    HTTP caching - How to generically generate and validate Last-Modified and If-Modified-Since headers\n    Audit trail - how to extend Datomicâ€™s immutable transaction log to include arbitrary audit related metadata\n    Mobile database sync - trivial implementation of an incremental update API for high latency/low bandwidth clients\n    Authorization - easily determine resource ownership, and centrally isolate users from data they are not allowed to see\n\nThese problems have certainly been solved before using other databases, but Datomic provides features that make the proposed implementations concise, generic, and purely functional.\n\nLucas Cavalcanti is the Lead Software Engineer of Nubank, an early stage Brazilian Internet bank built as a service oriented architecture leveraging Clojure and Datomic. Lucas is a functional programming enthusiast, and proponent of best practices in software development, with a vast experience in real production applications written in Java, Scala, Ruby and now Clojure. He holds a BS in Computer Science from the University of Sao Paulo.\n\n`Edward Wible is the CTO of Nubank, an early stage Brazilian Internet bank built as a service oriented architecture leveraging Clojure and Datomic. Prior to co-founding Nubank, Edward worked in technology-focused private equity (Francisco Partners) and management consulting (The Boston Consulting Group). He holds an AB in Computer Science from Princeton University and an MBA from INSEAD."
