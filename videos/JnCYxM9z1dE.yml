description: "Finding the right ingredients for the perfect team\n\nA great team is a like a great dish, balanced flavors, tastes, textures and smells combine to create something unique and delicious. I’ve made the mistakes of trying to build unbalanced teams either with poor distributions of experience, bad combinations of temperament, clashing skill sets or lack of diversity. I’ll share those mistakes. I’ll also share some of the things I did right (either intentionally or unintentionally) to create the teams that have worked very well. I’ll provide some things to look out and consider for as you build a team or just expand the one you have.\n\nABOUT KEVIN GOLDSMITH\n\nKevin Goldsmith oversees the development and IT teams at Avvo.
