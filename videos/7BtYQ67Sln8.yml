All that without writing a single line of CloudFormation or CDK code.\n\n## Alex DeBrie - Using DynamoDB in Serverless Applications\n\nFor many reasons, DynamoDB has been the database of choice for serverless developers in the AWS ecosystem. In this talk, you'll learn why DynamoDB is such a great fit in serverless applications.
