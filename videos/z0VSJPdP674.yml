description: "Kubernetes is all around the world now and more companies start using it on a daily basis. After learning how to master the platform, many companies look into getting their engineers certified to either achieve Kubernetes Certified Service Provider status or verify knowledge of their workforce. Yet taking an examination can be scary, especially as the Kubernetes ones are not “simply” multiple choice. Let’s get rid of that uncertainty what is going to happen and share best practices for taking an exam like the CKA and CKAD with insights into the process.\n\nPresenter:\nChristian Jantz, Cloud Strategist @ Level 25"
