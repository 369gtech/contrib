description: "Can you tell an apple from an avocado? Carrot from a cucumber? Onion from an orange? The future of user interaction with machines depends on the ability for us to be able to detect and recognise objects and images. In a world filled with machine learning buzzwords, is it possible to start harnessing this technology without spending years becoming machine learning specialists?\nIn this session, we will dive into image classification and object detection both within the cloud, and on the edge, using Microsoft Cognitive Services. This session assumes little to no knowledge, and will attempt to present simplified explanations, alongside code for the more adventurous.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
