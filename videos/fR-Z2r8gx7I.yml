A mapper’s job during Map Stage is to “read” the data from join tables and to “return” the ‘join key’ and ‘join value’ pair into an intermediate file. Further, in the shuffle stage, this intermediate file is then sorted and merged. The reducer’s job during reduce stage is to take this sorted result as input and complete the task of join.\n\nEdureka is a New Age e-learning platform that provides Instructor-Led Live, Online classes for learners who would\nprefer a hassle free and self paced learning environment, accessible from any part of the world.\n\nThe topics related to Mapreduce have extensively been covered in our course 'Comprehensive MapReduce'\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.co\nCall us at US: 1800 275 9730 (toll free) or India: +91-8880862004"
