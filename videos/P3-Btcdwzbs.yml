description: "Welcome to season 5 of Assistant on Air. This season is all about game development and we’re having conversations -- at home -- with designers and developers who recently built some fun and creative Assistant games for smart displays.\n\nIn this episode, Mary Chen (Strategy Lead for Google Assistant) meets with \nMelissa Ames (UX designer at B-Reel), who plotted the design of the game Gnome Garden. Hear how the user experience, persona, and rich visuals were developed for this ambient-style game.\n\nInterested in playing Gnome Garden? It will be launching shortly so check back soon. In the meantime, just say, “Hey Google, let’s play a game” on your Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max to discover other fun games.\n\nActions on Google docs → https://goo.gle/2YIelnq\n\nOther episodes of Assistant on Air → https://goo.gle/2X0nBqG\nPlease subscribe for more updates →  https://goo.gle/googledevs"
