description: "In a sense, Application Express is almost \"too good\" a platform, because it can handle so many of the database interaction tasks for developers. As a consequence, developers often avoid exploting the more advanced SQL features, because Application Express can handle that task for them. But SQL has grown enormously from its origins of just simple data access. By delving deeper into these modern SQL facilities, developers can get performance benefits and write a lot less code. This session highlights some SQL techniques to solve problems that would otherwise require a lot of complex coding. Learn how to become a more productive developer by modernizing your knowledge of the SQL language.\n\n\n\n\nA recording provided by the awesome APEX community, that built a virtual 24 hour conference called APEX@Home held on April 16th 2019.\n\n\nWith 24 world renowned speakers and nearly 5000 virtual attendees, this event was a huge success.
