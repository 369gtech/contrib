description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nDecember 15, 2010\r\n\r\nPresented by Miško Hevery.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe Clean Code Talks are designed to help teams get better at writing clean, well-designed, testable code. Such code is easier to write tests for, more robust, easier to understand and maintain. Having clean code lets you be more productive. It helps you release more often, with more robustness, more confidence, and fewer rollbacks.\r\n \r\nMiško Hevery works as an Engineer at Google where he is responsible for coaching Googlers to maintain the high level of automated testing culture. This allows Google to do frequent releases of its web applications with consistent high quality. Previously he worked at Adobe, Sun Microsystems, Intel, and Xerox (to name a few), where he became an expert in building web applications in web related technologies such as Java, JavaScript, Flex and ActionScript. He is well published and very involved in Open Source community and an author of several open source projects, most recently angular.\r\n\r\nThis Tech Talk was presented at one of the Google NYC Tech Talk series.
