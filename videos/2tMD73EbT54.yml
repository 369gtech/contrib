description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nNAVIGATION: DEEPING SAFELY\nAmro Abd Elgawwad, Senior Mobile Software Engineer, Accenture \n\nYou are using the navigation in your app, aren’t you? When you navigate between pages, you may need to pass arguments! Passing arguments is awesome - it means you don't have a global declaration in your app, but different destinations have shared information that is not needed. Just pass arguments with SafeArgs and save your life.\n\nFrom time to time, we need to land our end-user from an external application inside a deeper part of ours, without passing through the whole hierarchy, but land directly to the destination. Let's glance at the deep linking with the navigation component!\n\nAre you ready to let the users smoothly navigate through the app with the navigation component? Fasten your seat belt and join the session\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/droidcon-italy\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
