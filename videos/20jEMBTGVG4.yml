description: "Arnaud Claudel, Software Craftsman at Codurance, brought to us a workshop about Outside-in TDD in React. This sessions contained two parts: A more theoretical introduction to analyse common issues when testing in React, in order to find a solution, that could be Outside-in TDD as Arnaud showed us.\n\nThe goal of this workshop is learning to separate logical application and Front End design, selecting what is really worth testing considering design because many times the complexity comes from testing many things at once.\n\nDuring the second part of the session, we coded! Using React together with Typescript, Arnaud did two hands-on exercises, one on Front end logic and the other one focused on UI and Design.\n\nThank you Arnaud for the great workshop! \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
