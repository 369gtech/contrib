description: "One of the key points of the agile methodologies is to inspect and adapt - but this is sadly often missed. For many teams, they adopt \"off-the-shelf\" scrum and go no further; there are standups, there is backlog grooming/planning, there are retrospectives - but it can be a little stale, or even ineffective.\n\nThis is where we should mix it up! There are some common problems that have fairly easy solutions, that can be a lot of fun to try out, and give fairly quick results. I'll share the things I see most often, with some tips on things to try, and the reasons why these things can really make your processes work for you.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
