description: "Mike Kerr at JS.LA, the best JavaScript event in Los Angeles. Filmed at Google in Los Angeles, sponsored by PlayVS.\n\n\"Getting my company, FabFitFun, off a monolithic WordPress app and on to React, a change I wanted to make in the company and yelled loud enough to get the attention and approval of everyone. Discussing what it took from gaining approval from the tech team and executive stakeholders as well as how I assembled the tool to keep both Content Editors, UX Designers and Engineers happy. This initiative led me to building a custom React CMS + WYSIWIG Editor from scratch! \"\n\nhttps://www.github.com/reactiongears\nhttps://www.twitter.com/codecareercoach"
