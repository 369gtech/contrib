description: "Building Real Time Infrastructure at Facebook\n\nJeff Barber and Shie Erlich, Facebook\n\nReal Time Infrastructure is a set of systems within Facebook that enables real time experiences on Facebook products, such as sending payloads to/from devices, real-time presence, push notifications, real-time delivery of comments and likes on News Feed, comments and reactions on Live (video) and many more across Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram. With more than 1B daily users on Facebook, Real Time Infrastructure is a very large scale affair – on the surface, these features seem to “just work,” while on the backend this is a complex system that we designed to work at scale that makes it run smoothly. This talk will focus on architecture, and how we design our systems at scale for low latency while reducing the risk of failure, and making it easier to recover when failure does occur.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
