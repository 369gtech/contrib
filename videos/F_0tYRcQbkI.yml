description: "Margriet Groenendijk\n\nSaturday 15th, 15:30 (Ferrier Hall)\nA talk (25 minutes)\nData visualization is fun but can take up a lot of time, especially when you are exploring new data. The magic forest is much easier to navigate with PixieDust, a free open-source Python library that makes it quick and simple to explore data with any visualization library without writing code in a Jupyter notebook. Learn how PixieDust takes out some of the coding, how to contribute, and how to make and share visualizations in seconds.\n\nThe speaker suggested this session is suitable for data scientists."
