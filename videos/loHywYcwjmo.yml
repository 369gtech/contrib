description: "As enterprises are moving their iOS development towards Swift development from Objective C, it has become essential to adopt skills required to perform penetration testing/security audit of such applications. If you are working as Product Security Engineer or Bug Bounty hunter, it's important to know pentesting Swift application.\n\nConsidering such requirements, we're releasing brand new version of OWASP iGoat in Swift. Definitely, there are certain changes while pentesting Swift application over Objective C applications.\n\nThis talk is all about how you can find out security loopholes in Swift applications and as a developer how you can defend against them.
