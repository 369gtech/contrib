title: '"How to bring open source to a closed community" by Abigail Cabunoc Mayes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474223007
description: 'This past year, I''ve been testing out ways to bring more open source to the academic research space. It hasn''t been easy -- the research world is full of competition, private data and a cutthroat need to publish. However, we found some open source champions, invested in them through workshops, summits and ongoing one on one mentorship as they learn to work openly on their research. In this talk, I''ll share some of the lessons learned building an open source movement in academia.'
