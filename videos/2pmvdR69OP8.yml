title: 'Marcos Holgado - Why we failed at modularizing Sky Sports. An honest retrospective.'
recordingDate: 1555665937
description: "Modularization is the new trend, almost everybody in the Android ecosystem is refactoring their apps to use a modularized approach. We at Sky are no different, we had a big monolithic codebase supporting 4 apps in different countries that we started modularizing in September 2017. But we failed, big time.\n\nThis talk is an honest retrospective of everything that went wrong, the bad decisions that we made, the approach we initially took and how we, against all odds, eventually started re-building a maintainable, sustainable and extensible modularized codebase. \n\nIn this talk you will learn from our mistakes and struggles, like defining what is a module and its responsibilities, how to integrate Dagger in a multi-module environment, set some rules and best practices and much more but, more importantly, you will learn what not to do when modularizing your codebase."
