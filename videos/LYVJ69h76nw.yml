description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA\nSpeaker:  Mattias Severson\nIs it possible to decrease the turn-around time of your test suite? How can you make sure that your tests execute independently? Is it possible to automatically verify that the database schema is kept in sync with the source code? What are the trade-offs? In this presentation, you will learn how to apply features such as the Spring MVC Test Framework, Spring profiles, and embedded databases, to automate and improve your test suite, thus improving the overall quality of your project. A simplistic Spring web app will be used to show some practical code examples.\n\nTopics include:\n\n    Basic Spring Testing\n    Embedded Database\n    Transactions\n    Profiles\n    Controller Tests\n    Server Integration Tests"
