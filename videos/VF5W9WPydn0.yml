description: "In Spanish (with English subtitles)\n\n*Update*\n\nPlease use the following Javascript origins for your Drive Hosted web apps:\n* Javascript origins:\nhttps://googledrive.com/\n\nFor a safer Javascript origin, I recommend personalizing your URL with:\nhttp://gweb.io/\n\nThis is necessary to avoid other people who reads your code, to use your Client-Id on 3rd party apps and your web app's URL will look like the one from the example:\n\nhttp://hackademy.drive.leccion4.ejemplo.gweb.io/\n\nHappy coding!\n\nGoogle Developers Hackademy (GDH) presents an intro to Google Drive by our GDE Cesar Anton. This is lesson 1 of 5.\n\nGDH is a project in which expert developers from our communities in SP LatAm will teach you about Google developer products and platforms."
