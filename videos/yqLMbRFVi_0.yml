title: 'Fireside Chat #20: How effective are we really?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1637251276
description: "In this episode, our co-founders Sandro Mancuso and Mashooq Badar and Spain's Managing Director José E. Rodríguez Huerta discuss how effective we really are. What is effectiveness? How does it relate to efficiency, leadership, teamwork and expectation management? Is there a way to measure individual and team effectiveness? What are the techniques we use? Those are just a few of the topics discussed in another very insightful discussion. \n\nIf you would like us to discuss a topic, please let us know in the comments and we will do our best to address it in a future episode. Any topics around Agile, Software Craftsmanship, Extreme Programming, technical practices, thought leadership, architecture, management, team dynamics, or anything related to technology or software projects are welcome. \n\nThe idea of the Fireside chat series is to record many informal conversations we normally have outside working hours. Topics are normally decided just before we start recording. Our objective is to have spontaneous conversations instead of something more structured or scripted. \n\nFor more information about Codurance, please visit our website: https://codurance.com/."
