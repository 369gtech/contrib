description: "Automating Research Workflows at BlackRock - Matthew Magaldi & Vaibhav Page, BlackRock \n\nBlackRock’s Data Science Platform enables investors and users across the firm to access a wealth of financial data using research models. Event-based workflows play an integral role in data driven modeling. In this presentation, the speakers will give an overview of BlackRock’s Data Science Platform, talk about the transition from vanilla Kubernetes Cron jobs to more complex sensor-driven research workflows. They will discuss how these workflows powered by Argo Events, an open source event-based dependency manager for Kubernetes, form a core component of the platform. They will also review the challenges of building automated financial models and look forward to the class of problems this framework solves. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrS4"
