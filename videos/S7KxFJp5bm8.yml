description: "Speaker: Jinghan\r\n\r\nApple has been rolling out freaky screens for two years. Most of us are probably familiar with concepts like safe areas that help facilitate the layout process. However in UIKit, there are many other things (e.g. layout margins, content adjustment behaviors, etc.) that can interact with or affect the behavior of safe areas. One fine day when they all come together, UIs become restless, and things start messing up.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we decipher the various, confusing layout concepts one by one. We will also discuss some clever tricks and best practices that we can use everyday.\r\nAt the end of the talk, we hope such layout bugs wonâ€™t bother you anymore!\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-iOS-Dev-Scout-Meetup/events/260276570/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Yeo Kheng Meng\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/oaRQ/"
