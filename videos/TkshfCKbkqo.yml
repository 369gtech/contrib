description: "Is My App Still Up? Monitoring Your Cloud Native Application - Johannes Tuchscherer, Pivotal\n\nWith the introduction of the Cloud Native application, we are seeing a paradigm shift on how an application is developed and deployed. But development and deployment are just two phases of the application lifecycle. Equally important is the next phase in which the operator has to monitor the application to keep it up and running 24/7. \n\nIn this talk, Johannes Tuchscherer is going to explore how the idea of Application Performance Management has to adopt from its classical roots to keep up with Cloud Native applications. He is going to explain what KPIs are important for an application that is running on Cloud Foundry and how to actually get those numbers from the platform.\n\nJohannes is currently working as a Software Engineer for Cloud Foundry in Denver and is part of the team that works on Logging and Metrics for Cloud Foundry. Before that, he spent a year in Germany as a developer advocate ]spreading the word about Cloud Foundry all over Europe."
