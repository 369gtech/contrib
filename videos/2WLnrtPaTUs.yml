description: 'The purpose of this session is to demonstrate CI running on the recently open-sourced Calculator project. The end-to-end process of committing a code change, generating new binaries, and running UI validation tests on a hosted agent (via WinAppDriver) will be walked-through, emphasizing the minimal need of manual processes.  This CI system will work with your UWP, Win32 and .NET applications.'
