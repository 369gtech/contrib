description: "Blockchain is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies bringing together Merkle trees, Hashing & Distributed Architecture. Christopher Ellis explains.\n\nNote1 - At 6:46 when Chris is drawing the Merkle Tree, C would actually be duplicated and hashed with itself not with B. So you would get H(C - C) instead of H(B - C). \n\nNote2 - At minute 17, Christopher mentioned the mining reward halving at 21,000 bitcoins but meant 210,000 blocks. \n\nPublic Key Encryption: https://youtu.be/GSIDS_lvRv4 \nThe Perfect Code: https://youtu.be/WPoQfKQlOjg\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
