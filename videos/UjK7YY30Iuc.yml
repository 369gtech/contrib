title: 'Evolving Java for the Serverless Era with Micronaut by Graeme Rocher'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573074628
description: "In this session, Grails and Micronaut creator Graeme Rocher discusses the evolution of the Java and other software platforms and frameworks over the last 10 years and the challenges in adapting these to the fast-evolving microservice and serverless space. He demonstrates how new projects such as Micronaut and Oracleâ€™s GraalVM are taking unique approaches to address issues, such as memory footprint, startup time, and cold-start performance, making Java competitive in a space where newer languages such as Go and Node.js shine.\n\nGraeme Rocher is a software engineer and professional open source contributor who created several popular open source projects including Grails (http://grails.org), GORM (http://gorm.grails.org), and Micronaut (http://micronaut.io). Rocher currently leads the development of the Grails and Micronaut frameworks at OCI (http://www.ociweb.com) and is the author and/or co-author of several books including The Definitive Guide to Grails 2 (Apress). Graeme won the inaugural Oracle Groundbreaker award in 2018."
