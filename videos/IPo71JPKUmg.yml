description: "Learn how to build a completely custom website using WordPress, PHP, HTML, CSS, and Elementor. You will learn how set up your local server, create the design, and build a custom WordPress theme that works with Elementor. \n\nThe design section is sped up because it is just an example about how the design is done. You can create your own design or use a preexisting design.\n\nOnce you have learned how to build out your website, you will learn how to get it from your local server to a production server and how to setup SEO, security, and caching the right way.\n\nDon't worry if you don't know much PHP. Everything you need is explained in the course. \n\nüíª Assets (including mockup, theme folder, and images): https://github.com/thedevdrawer/sample-law-firm-template\n\n‚úèÔ∏è This course was created by The Dev Drawer.
