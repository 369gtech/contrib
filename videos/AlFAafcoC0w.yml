description: "Dynamic Application Availability - Jayson Go & Grant Deshazer, Charles Schwab\n\nKnock, knock! Who’s there? Request. Request who? Requesting a route to my application, please!\n\nRouting is no joke! We’re all good at building software and constructing cloud-native applications, but have you thought about the entry points to your application? It’s easy to forget about these requests hitting our apps when we’re focused on building our software, however, these very requests (and responses) hold interesting information. Dynamically routing requests to different versions of your application enables different deployment strategies such as Blue-Green deployments and canary releases. Want to learn more and see practical demos? If so, please join jgo and Grant as they leverage Spring Cloud Netflix and Netflix Zuul to enable these types of deployments in the cloud.\n\nWe’ll primarily talk about Blue-Green deployments and canary releases, and show demos of those two strategies. We'll show how to configure Zuul, write filters, and an environment leveraging eureka and configserver.\n\nAbout Grant DeShazer\nGrant is a graduate from Colorado School of Mines with a background in Mechanical Engineering and software development on microprocessors. He joined Charles Schwab in 2017 and has been building the Intelligent Portfolio Application while providing the primary development for Zuul integration. \n\nAbout Jayson Go\nJayson, also known to colleagues as “jgo”, is a Technical Lead for Charles Schwab where his team of “schwabbies” enables clients to robo-invest with the Intelligent Portfolios platform. JGo started professional development in 2000 where he initially focused on desktop technologies, and later, with web and cloud platforms. At Schwab, where digital transformation and modernization are key initiatives, JGo contributes to team and product efforts by helping transform apps to become cloud-native."
