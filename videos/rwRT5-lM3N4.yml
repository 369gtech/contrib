description: "A modern internet service is not just a web client today. It is common to write native mobile clients at least for the major platforms (iOS/Android).\n\nAnd this trend is extending to the desktop as well, forcing ISVs to look for cross-platform solutions.\nNow recall that Java offers a variety of rich UI frameworks, from Swing to JavaFX, for all major desktop platforms right now.\n\nHowever, to be called a native client, an application written in Java should deliver native user experience:\nit should install in a native manner, come with no external dependencies, look good, start and work fast, and not consume too much memory.\n\nIn this talk we will consider how these requirements are addressed by different Java implementations and solutions."
