language: English
recordingDate: 1523696385
description: 'gRPC is a modern, high-performance, open-source RPC framework focused on the requirements of connecting polyglot services in microservice-oriented systems. In this talk we will take a closer look at gRPC and its concepts and we will explore how its support of HTTP/2, protocol buffers, type-safety and other goodies make it an attractive alternative to traditional REST/JSON based service communication.'
