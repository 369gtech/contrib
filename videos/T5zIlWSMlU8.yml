description: "Facebook is the worlds largest social network with over 2 billion monthly users at the time of this video. It's flagship product, the 'news feed', uses an AI algorithm to personalize the content that each user sees. This AI optimizes for a users attention, as thats what drives its ad revenue based business model. Its an incredibly powerful AI that knows users in ways no human could, synthesizing hundreds of thousands of data points from their browsing activity and web history.  In the past few years, we've seen that this AI has had both positive and negative effects on society. I'm going to highlight the negative effects and present 3 possible solutions to fix the problem. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Stream-Framework\n\nPlease Subscribe!
