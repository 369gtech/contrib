description: "Developing applications with Spring Boot is already a pretty magical experience, but could it be better? Can the magic get any more powerful than it already is?\n\nIn this talk, we'll look at how Kotlin can be used to reduce boilerplate, increase code quality, and elevate your wizardry. The presenter will demonstrate how to begin incorporating Kotlin into your existing Spring applications and, once you start your journey, where it can lead. Come to this session to level up on Spring+Kotlin! (Robes optional)"
