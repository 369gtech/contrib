description: "by Kaushal Madappa\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2214/gluster_container_storage.webm\n\n\nGluster Container Storage (GCS) is a new initiative from the Gluster community. It integrates several different old and new Gluster projects, building on top of the experience gained from the Heketi and gluster-kubernetes projects, and aims to provide the best persistent storage solution for containers. Gluster Container Storage (GCS) is a new initiative from the Gluster community, that aims to build the best persistent storage solution for containers. \n\nGCS integrates different Gluster projects, built on top of the experience gained from the Heketi and gluster-kubernetes projects and provides users with simple and robust tools to deploy, monitor and manage Gluster as well-behaved citizens of the Kubernetes world. \n\nGCS introduces the new Anthill and gluster-csi-driver projects.\nAnthill is Kubernetes operator, that deploys and manages GlusterFS with GlusterD2 and the gluster-csi-driver as containerized applications in a Kubernetes cluster.\nThe gluster-csi-driver implements the Container Storage Interface API, and interacts with GlusterD2 to automatically provision persistent volumes for Kubernetes applications when needed. \n\nIn this session we'll learn how all of these projects work together and form GCS. \n\nRoom: H.2214\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 13:40:00+01"
