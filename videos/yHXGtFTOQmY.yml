description: "Deep Dive: CoreDNS - Yong Tang, MobileIron & John Belamaric, Google \n\nCoreDNS is a flexible and extensible DNS server with a focus on service discovery. It is written in Go and has a unique plugin-based architecture. This means CoreDNS could be easily extended with customized plugins for new functionalities. If some functionality is not provided out of the box, you can add it if you know how to write in Go. In this deep dive session, we take a detailed look at the service discovery and plugin system of CoreDNS. We will demo a simplified version of a plugin that achieves source IP based service discovery. By walking through the complete code base of this demo plugin, we will showcase the ease of convenience to implement a custom plugin for serving new functionalities. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPjH"
