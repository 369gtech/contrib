recordingDate: 1371754853
description: "Use frustum culling to avoid drawing entities that are outside of the player's field of view. It's the one of the simplest and most effective scene management techniques.\n\nFind the source code here: https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/frustum-culling\n\nA paper on how to get the planes from the projection matrix can be found here: http://gamedevs.org/uploads/fast-extraction-viewing-frustum-planes-from-world-view-projection-matrix.pdf It's not terribly educational so I'm omitted it.\n\nQuestion?
