description: "Data structures are all about contracts: the basic API contract relating inputs to outputs, the internal invariants crucial to preserving the performance guarantees and, in the case of persistent data structures, the implicit contract around structural sharing guarantees. Bugs related to the latter two can be particularly insidious, causing gradual performance degradation of long-running client programs without producing observably incorrect results.\n\nThis talk aims to demonstrate how tools like spec and test.check can help one derive correct and efficient data structure implementations from (precisely stated versions of) the above-mentioned contracts."
