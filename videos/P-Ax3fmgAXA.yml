description: "PyData Chicago December Meetup\n\nSpeaker | Hemanshu Kaul, Applied Mathematics, Illinois Tech\n\nAbstract | With the advent of powerful computational tools like Machine Learning and their growing applications in the real-life, the ethical concerns underlying their use have become an important and urgent topic of study. In this talk, we will discuss the importance of a fundamental ethical view-point in the mathematical modeling process that underlies the application of mathematics in real-life. This fundamental view-point goes beyond the usually discussed topics like algorithmic bias, data bias, etc. We will discuss some historical examples related to the precautionary principle as well as a recent paper (with Adam Rumpf) on designing a public transit system with equitable access to social services.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.\n\n00:00 Welcome!\n00:10 Help us add time stamps or captions to this video!
