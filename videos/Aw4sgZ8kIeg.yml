language: English
recordingDate: 1491895807
description: "Github and Google recently released a huge dataset on BigQuery about all the Open Source code contained on Github, thanks to the data from the Github Archive project.\n\nWhat can you learn from such a dataset? What about learning about the most frequently used dependencies and imports? What are the most common Exceptions being handled or thrown? Are there common programming mistakes that we can spot? Guillaume will show you some concrete examples from the dataset, with examples applied to the Apache Groovy language, to learn more about our programming habits and pitfalls.\n\nAnd figure out on your own about your favorite language or framework usage patterns!\n\nDeveloper Advocate at Google for Google Cloud Platform, and PMC chair of the Apache Groovy programming language project."
