description: "Speaker : Kenneth Rohde Vhristiansen\n\nIf you have been to any conference the last five years, you have probably heard about Progressive Web Apps (PWA). Web sites that can progressively turn into app like experiences and be installed on your devices. PWAs now also work on desktop systems, but usually desktop applications have different requirements as they are usually used for creating, in contract to consumption on mobile. As a user you want to be able to access your files, copy paste without issues, not having the screen turn off while giving a presentation, you want access to printers and other devices, access to local fonts. The list goes on! Currently most of those things are only available to native apps and are not things you want your random web sites to have access to. Project Fugu is the project to extend the web with more native like capabilities in a way that is safe and understood by the users. Join this talk to learn more about the exciting things we are working on as part of Project Fugu."
