language: English
recordingDate: 1624249319
description: "Wouldn't it be great if we could rank developers based on their productivity, reward the best ones, and make sad noises at the others? Don't be silly, developer productivity isn't an innate ability that you can measure and rank! This talk will discuss how to think about and improve productivity based on the longest-running academically rigorous research investigation into the practices and capabilities that drive high performance in software delivery. Find out what drives productivity, how you can do more of it, and why it's important. Discover how tools and culture both impact productivity, and how to make a research-based argument for reducing technical debt.\n\nJez Humble is co-author of several books on software including the Shingo Publication Award winner\_Accelerate\_and Jolt Award winner\_Continuous Delivery. He has spent his career tinkering with code, infrastructure, and product development in companies of varying sizes across three continents. He works for Google as a site reliability engineer and teaches at UC Berkeley.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit, www.yowconference.com.au"
