description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nShipping Metrics From the Edge - Matthias Loibl, Red Hat \n\nComputing is getting pushed to the edge, it may be your car, TV, washing machine, or your toaster. All these devices have a lot of computing power these days. While extending the cloud to the edge is getting solved with projects like KubeEdge or k3s, in this talk we want to take a closer look at how to run Prometheus on them. We want to configure Prometheus in a way that we can replicate its data to a central collecting point, that is running Thanos on Kubernetes in a replicated setup, and then make use of all the shipped metrics to efficiently query across the entire fleet. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaZc"
