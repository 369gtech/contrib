title: 'Jaswanth Sreeram: Parallel JavaScript | JSConf EU 2014'
language: English
recordingDate: 1415200002
description: "JavaScript is the lingua franca of the web, yet it remains predominantly sequential and web applications until recently have been unable to utilize hardware parallelism. The goal of Parallel JavaScript is to change that. Parallel JavaScript provides web developers with a safe, high-level API that allows them to write applications that effectively utilize multi-core and SIMD parallelism as well as GPUs while preserving the programmability and portability of JavaScript. This talk will introduce the key design principles of Parallel JavaScript, the API itself and our experiences with implementing it. Finally I will show sample applications that highlight the leaps in performance that are possible. I will also briefly discuss the standardization efforts underway to make Parallel JavaScript part of ECMAScript 7.\n\nTranscript at: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/jaswanth-sreeram-parallel-javascript.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
