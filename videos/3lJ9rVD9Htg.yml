recordingDate: 1400783882
description: "One of the biggest advantages of Chef is it's flexibility, allowing you to customize it at-will to fit your infrastructure needs. While this makes Chef incredibly powerful, it can also be challenging to develop a workflow to manage the day-to-day usage of Chef.\n\nShould I use a single repo for all my cookbooks?\nOne cookbook per repo?\nBerkshelf?\nLibrarian?\nTest-Kitchen?\nWhere does Jenkins(CI) fit it?\nWhat about Testing?\nHow does this work with my small team? What about my large team? What about my * Distributed Team?\n\nOver the past few years I have been a part of two distinct Chef workflows that take opposite paths about how to solve issues around collaboration, versioning, testing, etc. During the course of this talk I will share:\n\nDetails about the requirements that lead us down these two paths\nWhat worked\nWhat didn't\nHow we use many of the tools available to safely test code changes\nHow we deploy cookbook changes safely and quickly (and keep uptime our highest priority)\n"
