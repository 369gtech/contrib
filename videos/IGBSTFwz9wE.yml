description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nContinuous delivery process is getting more and more attention, especially since the whole DevOps movement started. Package/build/dependency managers like npm, maven and composer make it easy for developers to package their code. Configuration management tools like Chef and Puppet make it easy to deploy the packages and configure the whole infrastructure. Vagrant allows developers to run on their machines (more or less) the exact copy of the production systems."
