language: English
recordingDate: 1375361747
description: "Software engineering can be considered a process: developing a system from its current state to its ideal state. For many problems in large-scale web environments, Go is an excellent tool to facilitate that process. A very brief introduction to the language is followed by examples of real-life use-cases at SoundCloud. The talk demonstrate how Go's simple, powerful, and orthogonal primitives can be combined to build robust, maintainable software.\n\n\n\nLiked the song? It's \"Tank\" by Seatbelts"
