description: "When is consensus possible in distributed systems? It depends on our system model, and on how we define consensus. This talk gives an example consensus algorithm for a simple key-value store, and then presents the FLP and CAP theorems, two important results about when consensus is impossible.\n\nSpeaker: Rowan Jacobs, Cloudfoundry Engineer, Pivotal Santa Monica\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jTjmm_unV6e-zU1keB-14W0ReykwfyVdPp5z6PBj57c/edit#slide=id.p"
