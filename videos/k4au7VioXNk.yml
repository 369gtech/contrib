Dialyzer is a post-compilation type-checker that has found more bugs in my code than I can count, saving me a lot of time and frustration. This talk will discuss briefly what Dialyzer is, how to use it in Elixir projects, and go in depth on three bugs it helped me find in the Elixir compiler and standard library.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/sean-cribbs/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - SEAN CRIBBS\nCreator of Neotoma and Former CRDT Evangelist\n\n\nSean Cribbs is a software engineer and leader at Postmates, focusing on scalable and reliable core services.
