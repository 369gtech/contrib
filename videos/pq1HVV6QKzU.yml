description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nWeaving a Mesh for Multiple Clusters at bol.com - Remco Overdijk, bol.com & James Brook, Google \n\nBol.com, the largest online retailer in the Netherlands, has many teams running services on Kubernetes in cloud and on-prem. Over time, they have grown out of a single cluster. They will explain how adopting Envoy and service mesh gives them resilient and uniform connectivity across clusters and datacenters, while optimizing costs.  The goal was to go all in on service mesh with a cautious and incremental approach. Injecting Envoy into hundreds of mission-critical pods needs care. You'll learn about the reasons for choosing service mesh, the journey, architecture, challenges and the lessons learned along the way.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZesW"
