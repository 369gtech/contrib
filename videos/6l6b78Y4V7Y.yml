description: "This video covers genetic algorithms and looks at how they are applied in 3 scenarios.   \n\n1: search problems where brute force is an impossibility (infinite monkey theorem).  \n2: physics-based systems  \n3: Interactive selection (i.e. user behavior driven fitness).\n\nThis video is excerpted from a presentation given at Kickstarter.
