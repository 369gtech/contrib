language: English
recordingDate: 1609873269
description: "Talk \nFairness is a hot topic in AI/machine learning/technology these days, but there isn’t much clear guidance on how to operationalize it into actual code. This talk will walk the audience through a few basic fairness algorithms and their open source implementations. We will also review recent developments in both the engineering and law of machine learning fairness.\n\nSpeaker\nAileen is a software engineer and data analyst with a data background that runs the gamut from experimental physics to healthcare startups to finance. She is the author of two O’Reilly Media titles, Practical Time Series Analysis and Practical Fairness (forthcoming 2020), and frequently speaks and teaches at industry conferences around the world on her two areas of interest, time series forecasting and algorithmic fairness.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
