description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\n\nThe relationship between software developers and quality assurance professionals is crucial to making good products. Through 15 years of software development, Adrian P. Dunston has had opportunities to work with dedicated and talented QA professionals. And now he has a little tester in his head.\n\nSo how do we build up the little testers in our heads? Based on extensive reading and years of working with and without the support of QA professionals, Adrian will show you:\n\n* How to help your QA team-members be force multipliers\n\n* How to become and encourage quality-minded developers\n\n* How to use repetition and story to get your ideas stuck your colleague's heads\n\n* How to instill habits they can use and take with them\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#Tester%20at%20the%20Table%20and%20the%20Tester%20in%20My%20Head-Adrian%20P.%20Dunston"
