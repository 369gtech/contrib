description: "RubyConf 2019 - How to use Your Superpowers to Transform People's Lives by Albero Colon Viera\n\nHave you ever thought about how government services should actually meet people's expectations? Have you ever considered using your skill sets to transform the way government operates?\n\nEven if you haven't, you have to interact with government in your everyday life. Imagine being able to use your programming and technical superpowers to design a new government. You'll hear about how the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) team at the Small Business Administration redesigned the experience for small business owners. And we used ruby! You'll also learn about the civic tech ecosystem and other organizations from where you can contribute, as well as how USDS keeps transforming people's lives at other agencies.\n\n#confreaks #rubyconf2019"
