title: 'Infrastructure *is* Code with the AWS Cloud Development Kit - Steve Roberts - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623754508
description: "Successfully creating and managing infrastructure at scale in the cloud requires an approach favoring readability, consistency and repeat-ability - not mouse clicks - and to date has largely used static, declarative templates referred to as Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Yet declarative templates have disadvantages. Awkward formats (JSON, YAML, etc), limited or no ability to iterate or use conditional statements, limited ability to ‘reach out’ programmatically from a static template to discover existing resources for reuse, and ‘copy and paste’ inheritance, are just some of the disadvantages.\n\nWith the AWS Cloud Development Kit, infrastructure *is* code - the same .NET code your developers use every day to build your applications. In this session we will begin with the essentials – what you need to know to get started with the CDK – before diving deep into examples of managing real world infrastructure in the AWS cloud using .NET and the CDK, best practices for effectively using the CDK, and how to codify your infrastructure requirements into simple, and easily reusable, constructs."
