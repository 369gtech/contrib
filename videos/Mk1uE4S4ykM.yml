description: 'When building a website, you expose an endpoint where you control the contents that are served back to a user. What if you could do this with a mobile app? Quin will be talking about how you can host your own javascript bundles, writing your own policies so you control exactly what version of the app different users get, and pushing them over the air to users for real time updates.'
