See ML for Hackers #4 for a tutorial on how to use AWS:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKmIVU8EUbw\n\nSome great info on LSTM architecture:\nhttp://deeplearning4j.org/lstm.html\n\nLink to Facebook's Chatbot API if you're curious:\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2016/04/12/bots-for-messenger/\n\nI love you guys!
