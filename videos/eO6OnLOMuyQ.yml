title: 'CON7506   Java EE Application Servers: Multitenant or Containerized? Both!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450064357
description: "Multitenancy is a software architecture that enables a program to serve multiple tenants, each with a dedicated set of resources such as data, configurations, users/groups, and log files. In the cloud era, most SaaS apps are multitenant. In recent years, container-based technologies such as Docker have gained great traction, and they are also multitenant software. So how do Java EE application servers fit in, given that they are multitenant too? What are the gaps between them and containers? In this session, you will learn the history of multitenancy architecture design, how containers are implementing it, and the differences between a deployment model of applications in a Java EE application server versus single-instance container application servers.\n\nSpeaker:\nBruno Borges, Principal Product Manager, Oracle\nBruno Borges is Oracleâ€™s Principal Product Manager for Fusion Middleware, Java, and Oracle Cloud, as well Developer Advocate for the Java platform and Oracle Cloud platform. Bruno has more than 15 years of experience as a Java developer in several areas, from mobile to enterprise applications."
