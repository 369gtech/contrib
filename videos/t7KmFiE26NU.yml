title: 'Graph Algorithms: The Core of Graph Analytics'
language: English
recordingDate: 1598562307
description: "Graph algorithms are the foundation of graph analytics. When you model your data as a graph you can run powerful algorithms on the graph for new insights into your data.  A few examples: Centrality algorithms (such as pagerank) can identify influencers in a social network, community detection algorithms (such as sccKosaraju) can identify similar buying patterns, path analysis (evaluating reachability) can identify the impact of changing the design of one component on connected components.\n\nThe Property Graph feature of Oracle Database includes over 50 built-in graph algorithms.  We will discuss the usefulness of these algorithms in a variety of industries such as financial services, manufacturing, retail, and security.  We will give an overview of some of the key algorithms, demonstrate how to use these algorithms in your applications, and show how you can visualize and query the results of a graph algorithm.\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/  \n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"
