description: 'In recent months, Deep Learning has become the hottest topic in the IT industry. However, its arcane jargon and its intimidating equations often discourage software developers, who wrongly think that they’re “not smart enough”. Through code-level demos based on Apache MXNet, we’ll demonstrate how to build, train and use models based on different types of networks, such as multi-layer perceptrons or convolutional neural networks. Finally, we’ll share some optimization tips which will help improve the training speed and the performance of your models.'
