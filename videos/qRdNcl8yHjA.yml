description: "The lines between Development and Operations have gotten blurry and lots of skills need to be held by both sides. In this webinar we'll talk about all the considerations that are needed to be taken into account when creating a development and production environment, mentioning Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment and the buzzword \"DevOps\".\nWe will also cover some real implementations in the industry.  \nOf course how can we leave out the real enabler of the whole deal? \"The Cloud\" gives us a tool set that makes life much easier when implementing all these practices."
