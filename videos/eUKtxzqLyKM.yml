description: "Danny Preussler, Head of Mobile, Intermediate Android Architechture, sporttotal.tv\n\nTO INJECT OR NOT INJECT - DEPENDENCY INJECTION IN A KOTLIN WORLD\nIntermediate / Android Architecture / Talk\n\nDependency Injection via frameworks like Dagger were present in most modern Android projects. But then Kotlin happened. And since then a bunch of new libraries like Koin or Kodein appeared. Developers are even writing articles how to do DI without any framework. Some argue that those don’t even offer real dependency injection. Let’s look at that argument and compare the approaches. So is there something wrong with Dagger & co. in Kotlin? Are they obsolete? What are the alternatives? Let’s dive in."
