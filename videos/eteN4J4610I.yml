title: 'Webinar: Critical DevSecOps considerations for multi-cloud Kubernetes'
language: English
recordingDate: 1600455955
description: "The distributed nature of Kubernetes has turned both legacy infrastructure and traditional cybersecurity approaches on their heads. Organizations building cloud-native environments in their own data centers grapple with operationalizing and scaling Kubernetes clusters, and then ensuring system-wide security from the infrastructure layer all the way up to each container.\n\nIn this webinar, youâ€™ll hear from two cloud-native experts in infrastructure and security who will offer up valuable insights on:\n\n- How containerized applications use compute, storage, and network resources differently than do legacy applications\n- Why hyper-converged infrastructure is suited for Kubernetes\n- How a Kubernetes stack should be instrumented for observability\n- Best practices for implementing system-wide security for multi-cloud Kubernetes\n\nPresented by Nutanix and Sysdig\n\nPresenters:\nSylvain Huguet, Sr. Product Manager - Karbon/Kubernetes @Nutanix \nLoris Digioanni, CTO & Founder @Sysdig."
