description: "Serverless is a misnomer; your future cloud native applications will consist of both microservces and functions, often wrapped as Linux containers, but in many cases where you the developer ignore the operational aspects of managing that infrastructure. In this session, we will dive into the capabilities of a Function-as-a-Service Platform for Kubernetes/OpenShift. The Microservices evolution was relatively easy, the programming model was nearly identical to the previous generation of Java EE. Today, Functions represent a new programming model for your next generation Java business applications. This will be a demo intensive session.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
