We will examine how web testing will develop and what challenges this will bring for conventional frameworks like Selenium or WebdriverIO, as well as new frameworks such as Cypress, Puppeteer and Playwright. Lastly, we will experiment with some new automation capabilities these frameworks provide to test some of the new web features.\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\nPlatinum Sponsors\nSauce Labs → https://saucelabs.com/\n\nGold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nNeuralegion → https://www.neuralegion.com/\n\nSilver Sponsor\nTestim → https://www.testim.io/\n\nProduction Partner\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/"
