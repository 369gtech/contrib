title: 'Dynamic Workflow Orchestration with Azure Data Factory and Prefect | OD549'
recordingDate: 1622098410
description: "Prefect is an open-source general-purpose dataflow automation tool that lets users orchestrate workflows with Python code. Weâ€™ll go over some of the features that make Prefect the perfect complement to Azure Data Factory in building dynamic workflows. These features include task mapping, non-Azure resource tasks, and robust state handling. Prefect is also designed to run on user-managed infrastructure and provides an easy way to manage on-premise execution of workflows through Data Factory.\n\nExplore Deeper Content and Training -- https://aka.ms/learnatbuild\nLearn more about Prefect Cloud -- https://www.prefect.io/cloud/\nLearn more about Prefect Core -- https://www.prefect.io/core/\nJoin our Slack community -- https://www.prefect.io/slack/\nCheck out additional resources at our Build sponsorship site -- https://mybuild.microsoft.com/partner/a0ce371f-cf0e-45c8-9701-138124051bf9?t=%257B%2522from%2522%253A%25222020-12-30T00%253A00%253A00Z%2522%252C%2522to%2522%253A%25222070-01-15T23%253A59%253A00Z%2522%257D\n\n\nMicrosoft Build 2021"
