description: "Google Tech Talk\nDecember 4, 2009\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPresented by Manuel Pérez-Quiñones.\n\nPersonal Information Management (PIM) practices are the behaviors that we follow when we organize our information. This often includes emails, documents, bookmarks, pictures, etc. Research in PIM has identified a common set of activities that require support: encountering information, organizing information, filing/archiving, and reusing information. Different tools must provide different kinds of support for each one of these activities.\n\nPIM practices become easier if the organization provides some infrastructure to alleviate the difficulty of these activities. But a larger value is that the organization can leverage these personal practices to improve the effectiveness of others and to capture that elusive corporate knowledge in an easy way.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe previous work in PIM and highlight how some of the PIM practices can be supported and leveraged from the organization point of view.\n\nManuel A.
