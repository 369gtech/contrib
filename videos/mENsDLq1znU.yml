description: 'Figuring out the right balance of collaboration across teams and applications in a codebase is a challenge. Working out the mechanics of building these applications using a monorepo simplifies these challenges. Nx is a next generation suite of build tools. Next.js is state-of-the-art framework for building web applications. This talk is a quick rundown of how Nx can help you maintain multiple Next.js apps, with multiple teams, while sharing components and libraries for consistent user experience.'
