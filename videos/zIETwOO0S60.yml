description: 'By now, you''ve probably heard of Kotlin and may have even taken a look at some of its features. And you might be wondering what the big deal is. Sure, it''s got some nicer syntax—and what else? The thing about Kotlin though is that it''s not about a list of features but how, together and in harmony, these features lead to a more enjoyable and productive development experience. In this talk, we''re going to focus on showing why Kotlin solves some of the pain points you often encounter when writing code—be it Android, Server, or any other type of software development.'
