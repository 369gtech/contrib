description: "Further information: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/18/session/technical-consequences-data-subjects-rights-kino\n\nIn her keynote speech Aurélie will focus on data subject's rights and the technical consequences of these obligations. As the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be enforced as of May 25th 2018 and replace the current Data Protection Directive, data subject’s rights are being re-introduced and reinforced, building the ground work for a more balanced approach towards data uses within our increasingly digitized societies. Aurélie will dive into the practical perspective of how to manage these new GDPR data subject rights, what it means for your processes and IT systems and when or to what type of data they apply.\n\nSpeaker: Aurélie Pols\nhttps://berlinbuzzwords.de/users/aurelie-pols"
