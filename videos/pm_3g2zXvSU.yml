description: "All data exists in context, and understanding that context is key to unlocking its potential. In this talk you will learn how we consciously and unconsciously influence the context of data, and how qualitative and quantitative methods can be combined to better interpret and extract insights from data.\n\nThe presentation will cover:\n\n* What data in context means\n* How bias and interpretation affect data collection, data analysis, and the design of data-driven applications\n* The importance of combining quantitative data with qualitative insights; data tells you “what”, whereas qualitative insights tell you “why”\n* Lessons learned from five years and over 15 data-driven projects\n* A framework for connecting the “why” to the “what”\n\nAn expert in research, design and user experience for social impact, Cameron has delivered projects for clients in foreign development, health and disability care, education, intellectual property, legal, emergency services, geospatial, environmental management, meteorology and water conservation.\n\nCameron joined NICTA, now Data61, in 2014 to work with researchers, business teams and software engineers on a wide range of data-driven projects, from platforms for open data and digital public service delivery, to geospatial, machine learning, optimisation and computer vision.\n\nHilary is a digital industry veteran with over 20 years experience and have worked in commercial and government, across media, marketing and software development, and more recently in the emerging technology sector.\n\nShe joined NICTA (now Data61) in 2011 to assist academic researchers, business teams and software engineers in the transition of blue-sky research to industry. In that time the UX team has grown to 8 in response to increased demand for project strategy and development assistance.\n\nData61 UX & Design Team specialise in folding user understanding and creating future state proposals in complex data projects, including big data and analytics.Our projects and products span multiple knowledge domains – machine learning, optimisation, geospatial and cyber security – as well as across multiple industry sectors including top levels of the Australian Government.\n\nFor more on YOW!
