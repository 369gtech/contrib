description: "There are already great IDEs for both Perl (Padre) and Raku (Comma).\nThey're both designed to help you write software faster\n...by providing a range of syntax-based coding tools.\nMore importantly, they can both help you rewrite software better\n...by supplying a set of language-aware refactoring mechanisms.\n\nThere's only one problem: neither of them is Vim\n(or Emacs or «your editor-of-addiction here»).\n\nIn this talk I'll introduce a new set of modules, designed to\nmake it easy to add syntax-driven Perl source refactoring\nand other useful code transformations to any modern text editor,\nor any other scriptable application.\n\nAlong the way, we'll explore the horrors of Perl's scoping rules,\nnavigate the labyrinth of Perl's many argument passing conventions,\nand descend briefly into the whirling maelstrom that is\ngeneralized semiautonomous contextual API inference.\n\nWe'll also look ahead to examine how I'm planning to implement\nthe same set of code manipulation tools for Raku, and see why\nthat's going to be at least two or three times as challenging\n...but also an order of magnitude easier."
