recordingDate: 1472216215
description: "For quite some time, web developers outside of the .NET space have been managing their front-end resources in very different way than we .NET devs are used to. They have been using sounds, I mean tools, like Gulp and Grunt to do their bidding.\nNow .NET developers can get also Gulp and Grunt their way through Visual Studio and automate a lot of the tasks that you thought we impossible to do. In this talk, Chris will take you through Gulping your front end and Grunting out your projects. Alongside this, he will discuss topics such as npm, Bower, bundling and minification so you can sit the lunch table and know what your colleagues are Squeezing about… You googled Squeeze didn’t you?"
