title: 'How to implement Zero Trust'
recordingDate: 1636696179
description: "ZeroTrust is a security architecture that takes its starting point around identity and encryption. ZeroTrust means that we always verify everything, that there are no safe zones anymore. When an organization is going to implement ZeroTrust, the question usually comes, where do you start and how do you actually do it? We'll go over what ZeroTrust is and how we implement this.\n\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
