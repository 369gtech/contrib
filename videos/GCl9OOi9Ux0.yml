description: "Confluence is the content collaboration software that changes how modern teams work. We have grown enormously over the years and now it is the software trusted by over 40,000 teams and millions of users to maximize productivity.\n\nThis talk is aimed at a deep dive to provide insights on how we have evolved Confluence architecture to its current form. I will cover the journey from a large monolith to micro services, how we deploy, run and operate at scale and challenges encountered along the way. Using examples of real life incidents, and failures this session covers best practices and lessons learned for building resilient, stable, and predictable services as the cornerstones of working with micro service based architectures.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nLearn how we isolated impact of failures and blast radius by microservice sharding and proper tuning of various parameters.\n\nLearn how we rearchitected Confluence by building services with sub ms latencies, highly available in multi region.\n\nStrategies for dependency scaling, task handling, resource awareness, failure injection, deployments pipelines and end to end testing\n\nLearn about how we solved issues with Data locality"
