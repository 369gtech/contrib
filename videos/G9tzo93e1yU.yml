description: 'The emergence of new electronic ballot return methods creates an opportunity for greater vote access and potential enfranchisement, but also raises concerns about security in an increasingly tumultuous cyber-election landscape. The challenge of security is further compounded by a lack of proactive guidance from the federal level on developing these new technologies, leaving a gap in the secure development of the technologies to adopt an elections framework and approach to security. Experts from the National Cybersecurity Center (NCC) will offer a draft of security guidelines for the new electronic ballot return platforms to consider, and for federal agencies to adopt. The guidelines format mimics the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines created by the Election Assistance Commission.'
