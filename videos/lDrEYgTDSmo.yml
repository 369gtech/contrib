description: "Slides: https://slides.com/ranyitzhaki/build-your-own-test-runner\n\nIn the javascript renaissance, more and more developers become toolmakers; even a basic understanding of how a tool works can help in the debugging process.\n\nTogether, we'll live code a mocha-like test runner from scratch.\n\nWhile understanding the mechanism behind it, we'll create a small CLI app, that runs our test suites, and reports the results to the console.\n\n---\n\nConFrontJS 2018 - #Frontend #Conference in #Warsaw, Poland\nDate: 29 October 2018\nVenue: Campus Warsaw, Poland\n\n??
