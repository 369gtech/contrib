description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nRunning SPIRE In Large Scale, Enterprise-Grade Environments - Andrew Harding, HPE \n\nSPIRE started as the reference implementation of SPIFFE back in 2017, and is now part of the core security architecture of many large enterprises. That means it has to be flexible and reliable in a wide variety of deployment scenarios. We’ll discuss the practical logistics of running SPIRE in a large enterprise: high availability, nested deployment for multiple availability zones, integration with upstream certificate authorities, observability, and monitoring. This talk will be useful for anyone who is already using SPIRE at scale, as well as anyone who is thinking about using SPIRE and wants to know what to expect as their infrastructure grows.\n\nhttps://sched.co/aDcf"
