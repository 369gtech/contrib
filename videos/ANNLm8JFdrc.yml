description: "“Neither monoliths nor microservices are the future,\" says \"Microservices Patterns\" author Chris Richardson. \"They’re essentially patterns, and your job as an architect is to understand the context in which you are working, the problems you need to solve, and then pick the appropriate architecture. So chasing the shiny new thing is wrong, but sticking with the old thing can equally be wrong as well.” There's more insight from Richardson in this interview recorded at DevNexus 2020. \n\nAdditional Resources: \nhttps://community.oracle.com/community/groundbreakers/middleware/soa_and_process_management/microservices"
