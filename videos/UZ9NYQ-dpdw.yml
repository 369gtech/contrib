The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nDeep Dive into Autoscaling - Maciek Pytel & Joe Burnett, Google \n\nCome and see how to debug and optimize your autoscalers and decrease your monthly infrastructure costs even further. During this talk members of SIG-Autoscaling will discuss the internals of HPA, VPA and Cluster Autoscaler, their peculiar features, and ways to fine tune them across dimensions like cost and availability. After this talk you will know where to look for information about the autoscaler activity, what settings can be changed and which flags should probably be left alone.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZeyB"
