recordingDate: 1539019393
description: "A lot has been written about new features in HTTP/2 and performance improvements it’s bringing, so you have probably read some of it (don’t worry if you didn’t, there will be a brief recap). But we all know there is nothing for free in IT (and especially Web) world. There are no “no brainers” or “silver bullets”. This talk focuses on what to consider to get the most out of HTTP/2 without hurting yourself or your users in the process.\n\nDevConf 2018 (http://devconf.pl)\n26-28 September 2018"
