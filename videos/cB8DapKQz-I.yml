description: "Google Tech Talk\nMay 30, 2015\n(\"show more\" for more information)\nPresented by Edward Kmett\n\nWeb: https://wiki.haskell.org/ZuriHac2015#Edward_Kmett\n\nSlides are available here: https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/blob/master/meetups/20150530-ZuriHac2015_Edward_Kmett-Discrimination_is_Wrong_Improving_Productivity/Discrimination%20-%20Zurihac.pdf\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis talk is a case study in library design in Haskell.\n\nFritz Henglein has shown through a number of excellent papers how to use \"discrimination\" to do lots of things in O(n): Sorting many more data types than you'd expect, table joins, etc.\n\nIn the process of optimizing this approach and wrapping it up in a form that can be easily consumed, we'll take a lot of detours through the different ways you can think about code when optimizing Haskell.\n\nWe'll need some category theory, from a deeper understanding of monoids to Day convolution.\nWe'll need to consider final and initial encodings.\nWe'll need to drift down to low level system concerns from building a custom foreign prim to nesting unsafePerformIO within unsafePerformIO.\nWe'll need properties of laziness from productivity to IVars.\nAlong the way we'll find and fix a small problem with the initial discrimination paper, which opens the door to streaming results, rather than having to wait until all the input is ready."
