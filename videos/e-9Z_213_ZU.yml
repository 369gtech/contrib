description: "http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/to-petascale-and-beyond-apache-flink-in-the-clouds/\n\nApache Flink performs with low latency but can also scale to great heights. Gelly is Flink's laboratory for building and tuning scalable graph algorithms and analytics. In this talk we'll discuss writing algorithms optimized for the Flink architecture, assembling and configuring a cloud compute cluster, and boosting performance through benchmarking and system profiling. This talk will cover recent developments in the Gelly library to include scalable graph generators and a mixed collection of modular algorithms written with native Flink operators. We'll think like a data stream, keep a cool cache, and send the garbage collector on holiday. To this we'll add a lightweight benchmarking harness to stress and validate core Flink and to identify and refactor hot code with aplomb."
