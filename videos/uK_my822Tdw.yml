description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - "Trophy Winning Teams" by Adam Onishi - “Players don’t win you trophies, teams win trophies”. A team works better when they work together, no matter whether the goal is winning the World Cup or creating amazing websites. Any development team, large or small needs to ensure that it works together as a cohesive unit in order to produce the best output. In this talk I’ll take a look at how as a development team we can work better together, taking a look at some examples from great sporting teams. Covering everything from coding style guides, team training techniques, and code reviews, all the way through to Dutch Total Football.'
