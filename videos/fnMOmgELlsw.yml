description: "Object-oriented programming has well-established design principles such as SOLID. For many developers, architecture and functional programming are at odds with each other: the developers donâ€™t know how their existing tricks of the trade convert into functional design. This problem becomes worse as hybrid languages such as Java 8 and Scala become common. This session discusses how functional programming helps you implement the SOLID principles and how a functional mindset can actually help you achieve cleaner and simpler OO design.\n\n\nAuthor:\nRichard Warburton\nRichard Warburton is a software developer who loves solving complex problems, but actively challenges how much of software development is dealing with day-to-day trivialities. Having obtained a PhD in the area of compiler optimizations and static analysis, he has been applying his abilities in industry. Initially on bytecode analysis software, and more recently on Java performance tuning tools. He actively involves himself in the London Java Community, and its Java Community Process Committee. He has been helping with the push to improve and complete the JSR 310 API and the expand community engagement with JSR 335.\nView more trainings by Richard Warburton at https://www.parleys.com/author/richard-warburton\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
