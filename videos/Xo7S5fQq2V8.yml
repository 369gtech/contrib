title: 'GopherCon UK 2021: Chris Reeves - Instrumenting GO Applications'
recordingDate: 1637596355
description: "In this talk, weâ€™ll show that introducing observability is not as daunting as it seems! We'll walk through how simple it is to get started with Open Telemetry, how tracing and metrics work and the patterns you can use to help make automatic instrumentation easy (such as errors) and how this approach would work for event driven systems.\n\nExpect a lot of demos and code snippets as we discuss deployment options such as using the Open Telemetry Collector to send traces and metrics to multiple third parties such as AWS X-Ray, Datadog or Grafana."
