description: "Google Workshop on Quantum Biology\nQuantum Mechanics of Photosynthetic Light Harvesting Machinery\nPresented by Mohan Sarovar\nOctober 22, 2010\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAfter a brief discussion about the conditions required for quantum effects to be relevant in biological systems, I will focus on recent advances in our knowledge about the quantum nature of the primary processes in photosynthesis. I will review some of the experimental results and theoretical predictions regarding quantum aspects of the sophisticated molecular machinery behind photosynthesis, including coherent energy transfer and robust quantum entanglement. To conclude I will present a new direction of research that aims to harness the quantum properties of pigment-protein structures to create tunable and versatile light sensors and photovoltaic devices.\n\nAbout the speaker: http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/kbwgrp/mohan/Site/Welcome.html"
