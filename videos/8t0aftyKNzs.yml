language: English

description: 'Tanzu Service Manager allows you to connect application-enabling services running on Kubernetes to applications running on the Tanzu Application Service. In this video, find out how you can offer any service that is wrapped in Helm to developers via the "cf marketplace" with Tanzu Service Manager. This process works with services you download from the internet (for example: open-source RabbitMQ), compatible services offered via Tanzu Network, or other bespoke services you writeâ€”as long as they are packaged using Helm.'
