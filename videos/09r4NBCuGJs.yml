description: "by Radomir Stevanovic\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.121/dwave_hybrid.webm\n\n\nThe D-Wave Hybrid is a general, minimal Python framework for building hybrid asynchronous decomposition solvers of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. Designed in the spirit of the dataflow programming paradigm, and built atop the Ocean SDK primitives, it provides a simple workflow construction, execution and instrumentation environment that enables rapid development and tuning of hybrid applications running across classical and quantum systems. In the talk, we'll briefly discuss the motivation for some of our architectural decisions, briefly present available submodules, features and building blocks, only to focus on describing several interesting use cases (hybrid workflows). \n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:00:00+01"
