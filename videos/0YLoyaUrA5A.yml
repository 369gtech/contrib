language: English
recordingDate: 1540491049
description: "Hasibur Rahman is a Senior Software Engineer on the Service Fabric team. He has worked on many pieces of the system including Service Fabric Mesh, which is currently in public preview. You may also remember him from a Channel 9 video from years ago (he remembers the exact date, of course - that's just Hasibur's way): https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/C-AMP-The-Test-Team-Hallway-Office-Tour \n\nWe've spent a lot of time digging into Service Fabric's underlying technologies and subsystems. We are now moving up the stack to the developer platform and experience. Who better to get at the whiteboard to learn about the fundamentals than Hasibur (he wrote a lot of the Actor framework, by the way). \n\nIf you are a cloud developer and you want to jump into Service Fabric, this is for you. We highly recommend you watch this even if you have been programming Service Fabric apps for years. Both Deep and I learned a lot so we know you will too. Tune in. Learn."
