description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nNATIVELY FUNCTIONAL UI WITH SCENIC\nby Boyd Multerer\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nNatively \nFunctional \nUI\n\nABSTRACT\nGet to know Scenic, the first fully functional UI system built directly for and on the BEAM. Boyd will show the high-level concepts and functionality of Scenic, including latest developments.\n \nBuilding a UI system on the BEAM is also a great way to understand supervision trees. This talk will demonstrate software isolation, recovery, concurrency and more using Scenic to directly see what is going on.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/boyd-multerer/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BOYD MULTERER\nCreator of Scenic and Lead engineering for Xbox Live, XNA\n\nBoydâ€™s near 30-year career spans the range of software projects, from desktop publishing, to web servers, to game consoles, to low-level operating systems. For the past four years he has been independently exploring and building a full stack for Connected Devices that heavily leverages the BEAM.\n \nPreviously, Boyd spent 18 years at Microsoft running engineering for things such as Xbox Live, XNA (game developer program), and everything OS for Xbox One. This work includes large scaled-out datacenter services, VMs, and the layout of the hypervisor/kernel.\n \nHis most recent release is the open-source Scenic libraries, which is a functional UI stack built on the BEAM. Its primary goal is for use in connected devices, but it is already being used for desktop apps and more. His current work takes the foundation laid with Scenic and is attempting to answer deeper questions about the future of client-side operating systems.\n\n\nMore on Boyd Multerer: https://codesync.global/speaker/boyd-multerer/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
