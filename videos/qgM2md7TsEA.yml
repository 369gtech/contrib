description: "\"Tools for maintaining an open source Python project\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-23 - Microsoft\nOnline\n\nBy Ben Nuttall\n\nThere is a wealth of amazing tools freely available to open source software developers to use to maintain their projects. Practically every problem we face or are likely to face in software development has been lived through and solved many times over. Patterns emerge for dealing with development practises and we build our software using the tools made by the previous generation of developers.\n\nWe're very fortunate to operate in an amazing open source ecosystem where we've learned we're stronger when we build on each other's foundations. We're constantly laying new foundations for ourselves and we share our ways of working with the world. We now have a very sophisticated set of tools for developing, managing, testing and documenting our new projects without reinventing the wheel.\n\nBut we don't discover all the tools at once - we pick them up as we go along, as we find uses for them and we hear about them. I'm going to share a range of great tools I use to maintain some popular open source Python projects, and explain how the difference they've made.\n\nThe talk covers:\n\n\nSoftware packaging and distribution\nLicensing\nVirtual environments\nSoftware testing\nContinuous integration\nGit &amp; GitHub\nContributor community\nProject management tools\nDocumentation tools\n\n\nThe talk demonstrates examples for development of Python projects on Linux, but the tools can be used cross-language and cross-platform.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
