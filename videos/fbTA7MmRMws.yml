description: "Designing for room scale VR experiences \nby Richard Bang (@FreekstormUK) \n\nWith the arrival of the first consumer virtual reality headsets the world of computer interaction and gaming is experiencing large changes in the way that we handle the Human/Computer Interface. Old rules get thrown away, new rules are discovered. The world has suddenly changed. \n\nWhat are the challenges we face as we move from a world of the flat screen into the world of immersive virtual reality?\n\nRichard Bang\n\nRichard has been a self-confessed computer geek for over 30 years and has been obsessed with gaming for as long as he can remember. He designed and sold his first computer game “The Key of Asmar” at the tender age of 14 and after mostly gaming his way through a Physics degree, he was seduced by the Dark Side and entered the heady world of business software, whereupon he built his own successful software company and designed one of the world’s leading email software suites.\n\nDespite this exciting career in internet communication software, he always wanted to create computer games again. So in 2008 he decided to do just that, and thus Freekstorm was born. \n\nWhen he is not polishing his alter-ego, the dastardly Doctor Kvorak, our resident genius likes to play games and make short indie films, largely because he’s a big kid at heart."
