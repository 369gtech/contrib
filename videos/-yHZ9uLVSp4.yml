recordingDate: 1637680802
description: "Learn why and how to add feature toggles (aka feature flags) to your software. We go through the basics of what feature toggles are, how you can use them and how they can help you to improve the workflow of your development team to accelerate time to delivery. We start off by interviewing Ivar Østhus, the founder of Unleash — an open source feature toggle system — and then continue to look into basic feature toggle use cases and how you can set up Unleash open source to tackle more advanced use cases and scenarios.\n\nFeature toggling resources\n🔗 https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html\n🔗 https://www.getunleash.io/blog/feature-toggle-best-practices\n\n✏️ Instructor: Fredrik Strand Oseberg\n🐦 Twitter: @foseberg\n🔗 Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZTeUahnA2GMoo_YpTBFo9A\n\n🎤 Interview subject: Ivar Østhus\n🐦 Twitter: @ivarconr\n\nThanks to Unleash for providing a grant to make this course possible.
