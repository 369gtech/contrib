recordingDate: 1478595907
description: "In a fast-paced fashion, to keep you awake after long University sessions, Audrey and Guillaume will set you up to create a Web API using Google Cloud Endpoints, and stream the content of the API in real-time with Streamdata.io. After a quick introduction to both technologies, they’ll build together both the backend and the front-end to interact live with the audience, through the Web or via a mobile app.\n\nGuillaume Laforge is Developer Advocate at Google, in the Google Cloud Platform team. He's well-known for his decade-long work on the Apache Groovy programming language project, for which he serves as Chair of the Project Management Committee at the Apache Software Foundation. Guillaume is also a co-founder of the French tech podcast \"Les Cast Codeurs\".\n\nAudrey Neveu is Developer Relations at Streamdata.io. She’s a passion driven developer with experience in both web frontend and backend development, specialised in APIs and BigData. Heavily involved in the European wide Java Community, she’s part of Devoxx4Kids, a not-for-profit global initiative to get children coding.\n\n[HPE-5408]"
