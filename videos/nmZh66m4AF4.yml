title: 'Driving GPU Clusters with JavaScript - Forward 3 Web Summit'
language: English
recordingDate: 1441133749
description: "Putting the thousands of threads in a GPU to work can achieve 10X+ speedups... if you can program them. With the rise of\ncloud community, we might even cheaply run on hundreds of GPUs simultaneously! Making this possible is new bindings like Node-OpenCL that give us full access to low-level GPU APIs yet still allows quick scripting in JavaScript. This talk will introduce the physics driving GPU computing, the basic hardware, and the computational model on top. Drawing from our experiences from the last several years, we will then share how JavaScriptâ€™s frameworks and features like RxJS make working with GPUs easier than in other languages. While the talk should benefit experts, it will still be accessible to beginners.\n\nForward 4 kicks off in Feb 2015!
