description: "droidcon Italy webinar\n22 September 2020 \nBartosz Kraszewski, Android Team Leader, SoftwareHut\n\nOne man army - Becoming fullstack superhero with Flutter and Firebase\n\nSoftware Engineering is all about teamwork - we usually run dedicated frontend and backend teams, rarely interfering besides API design and complaining about each other. What if you can code, have startup idea, do you need to hire whole pack to bring it to market and validate? I'd like to teach you how to replace whole team with 1 superstar - you.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
