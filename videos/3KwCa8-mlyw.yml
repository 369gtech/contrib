CodeFest: https://codefest.ru/\n??? ????????-?????: https://t.me/cdfst\n\nStop thinking of your platform as a solution to improve user's life as a whole and focus instead on life contexts to create memorable user experiences. This talk will outline the concept of Context Platforms and the value of openness and extensibility.\n\nWhat does Facebook, Alexa, Yelp, Airbnb, and Uber have in common? They all provide experiences that make your life easier and more enjoyable. We use platforms like these as part of our life with a very specific context in mind. At Uber, we call them Life Context Platforms. Great Context Platforms leverage a unique life context and optimize it for the best possible experience. However, the best Context Platforms also enable third-party applications to leverage that unique life context through an open and extensible ecosystem. These third-party applications, also called Agents, can be a stepping stone into a different life context. Agents allow connecting a variety of life contexts to shape the perfect, fluent user experience. For instance, a Facebook Agent for Uber would allow you to order an Uber while you connect with your friends. In your Uber, a Nest Agent could allow you to set your thermostat into economy mode. The Yelp Agent could show you reviews of the place you're headed to... That creates a magical experience!\n\nContext Platform ecosystems serve a critical goal: Make your life context even more personal, and with that more valuable. You can choose your personal goals and infuse context information from other platforms to improve your life context experience.\n\nJoin me for a presentation about the concept of life contexts and how current platforms act as agents that fulfill your very specific, contextual goals. You will understand how life contexts should shape your experience to make your users have wow-moments!"
