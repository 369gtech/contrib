title: 'Numpy To PyTorch (Shagun Sodhani)'
recordingDate: 1550773821
description: "Numpy is the de-facto choice for array-based operations while PyTorch largely used as a deep learning framework. At the core, both provide a powerful N-dimensional tensor. This talk would focus on the similarities and difference between the two and how we can use PyTorch to augment Numpy.\n\nPresentation page -- https://2018.pycon.ca/talks/talk-PC-53293"
