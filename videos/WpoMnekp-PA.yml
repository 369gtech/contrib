recordingDate: 1519659235
description: 'In the years spent on the front line managing open source projects and applications developed by distributed teams, I''ve managed to gather quite a few Git stories from the trenches. In this practically oriented talk, I will share some patterns and practices I have collected while on the front. We will first go through some useful git aliases, then touch on topics such as the various git branching models, long-running branches, conflict management, the rewriting of project history, etcetera. Oh and yes, the (in)famous Git rebase will be covered too.'
