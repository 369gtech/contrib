description: "Google TechTalks\nBay Area Discrete Math Day XII\nApril 15, 2006\n\nDave Bayer (Barnard College, Columbia University)\n\nABSTRACT\nCircular colorability geometrizes the study of graph colorings. Using color values in R mod Z, one can reformulate \"avoid edge differences close to zero\" as \" seek edge differences close to 1/2\", then generalize to arbitrary edge difference goals. We define the coloring torus Xg of a graph G to be the space of all such coloring problems. X is made of the same stuff as the color values R mod Z: it is R mod L for a lattice L, so we can apply toric methods to its study. For planar graphs, the observed distances from 0 to torsion points of Xg form a pattern generalizing the four..."
