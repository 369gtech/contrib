recordingDate: 1599579897
description: "Evan Kohilas\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/8TA7ZA\n\nHave you ever clicked the *FREE GEMS* button and been served an ad, only to find you're now trialing a game?\r\n\r\nWhat are they? Are they running code? \r\nIf they are, can we hijack them?\r\nIf we can't, can we bypass, or even replace them?\r\n\r\nAnd more importantly, what are they actually doing?\r\nAre you really playing a game? Or are they bitcoin miners in disguise?\r\n\r\nCome along and join my adventurous curiosity as we learn to man in the middle these ads and discover what they're really about!\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 13:55:00 2020 at Python 2"
