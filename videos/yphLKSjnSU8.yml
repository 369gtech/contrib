Check out the course descriptions at the following links **\n\nPython Training: http://mrkn.co/ukl52\nDjango Training: http://mrkn.co/jjnf3\n___________________________\n\nSaltStack is often boxed into the configuration management tools basket, but it's much different from most software like it. In fact, it is radically different than most configuration management tools. Salt has a unique approach to infrastructure management and at the end of day that means you can run on live data, make dynamic decisions, and do some really powerful stuff. Plus, it's ridiculously easy to get up and going.\n\nThe creator and principal architect himself, Tom Hatch, spent years as a cloud builder and experimented with most of the open source tools available on the market today, but he thought they weren't fast enough or easy enough to use. He paid a visit to SF Python to showcase Salt, explain what it does, and how it does it really well. If you're managing huge pools of data, you should definitely check out what Salt is capable of.\n\n**More free python content: http://marakana.com/s/tags/python"
