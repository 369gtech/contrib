recordingDate: 1571147176
description: "The alternative name of this talk could be “What they don’t teach Architects at school”. In Uldis’ talk, he’ll come back to the very old and well known Conway’s Law. He hopes to give you a bit deeper insights on why it’s so relevant nowadays and why we should keep it in mind when designing IT systems for organizations. This talk is somewhat a summary of what he has been evangelizing over the last 10 years at different meetups and conferences. Uldis will also touch topics about culture and human behavior. After this talk, you’ll be able to design better long-living, self-sustainable, agile and continuous architectures.\n\nTwitter:@UldisKK\n\nwebsite: https://devops.lv/"
