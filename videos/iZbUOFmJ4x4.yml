description: "# Why I Was Bad At Sketchbooks: Imposter Syndrome And Letting Go Of Perfection.\n\nCharli Vince - Charli Vince Illustration\n\nLooking at the importance of experimentation and fighting the impending imposter syndrome goblins and anxiety monsters that comes with it. Charli Vince, Norwich illustrator and speaker on all things creative, probes into the way getting comfortable with the “sketchbook mentality” has helped her start to defeat these adversaries and the boosts it’s given her work flow, confidence, and problem solving abilities.\n\n## About nor(DEV):con\n\nThe eastern region's biggest tech conference runs annually in February with a fantastic line-up of speakers and workshops.
