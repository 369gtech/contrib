recordingDate: 1424191558
description: "What is it that immediately attracts users and customers to a product, a website or a campaign?\nAnd what makes them want to come back, learn more, and stay as customers? It is all about what happens in the brain – a minds game.\n\nYour brain automatically knows what it likes and quickly gets bored if it doesn’t get what it wants. \nIf you want to attract users /customers, you will need to intuitively know what basic principles the customers brains are following, or, you will need to learn about them and adapt your product or presentation accordingly. \n\nAssociate professor and neuroscientist Magnus Sjögren from Edubrain AB demonstrates some of the principles that the brain follows, how it involves motivation and relationship building, and how gamification serves to reinforce these. Magnus presents to you some of the keys you need to build long-term relationships through enhanced learning, participation and improve retention, influencing your customers.\n\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/MagnusSjogren/gamification-motivation-edubrain-10-feb-2015\n\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
