title: 'Håkan Silfvernagel - Affective Computing – bringing humans and machines closer through emotions'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619690550
description: "\"Research has shown that emotions play an integral role in decision making, cognition, perception, learning, and more. If we want our computers to be intelligent and be able to interact with us we need to ensure that they are able to recognize, understand and express emotions. This is the basic assumption of the field of Affective Computing. In this talk, I will give an overview of Affective computing and how it can be applied in order to make our interaction with machines more suitable to us as humans.\n\nFirst I will give an introduction to the field starting with established findings from the field of psychology on how we best can measure emotions.\n\nThen I will describe how the field of Affective Computing has transformed from its origin in the ’90s until now when it is an established research field. I will highlight some of the technology enablers that have made Affective Computing a hot topic nowadays and give some examples of API and services that we as developers can use as of today.\n\nIn the second part of my talk, I will give some examples of application scenarios across various fields (retail, medical, education, and social). After that, I will be showcasing what is on the front line now. I will conclude my presentation with some recommendations on how this affects us as developers going forward.\""
