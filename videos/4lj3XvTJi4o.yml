We will highlight some existing plugins and show how to easily create your own plugin including hands-on examples. We will cover some tricks and tips that will jumpstart your journey into CF CLI plugins.\n\nAbout Johannes Tuchscherer\nJohannes is currently working as a Solutions Architect for Pivotal in Munich where he helps several Cloud Foundry users to get the most out of their investment into the platform.
