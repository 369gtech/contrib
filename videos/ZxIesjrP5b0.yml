description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nEnabling E2E Observability via Open Source in 5G Telco CNFs - Tamas Zsiros & Henrik Saavedra Persson, Ericsson \n\nEricsson is building CNFs for 5G being deployed in live operation throughout the world. One of the earliest challenges to answer when developing for a Kubernetes evnironment was how to enable observability (monitoring, logging and tracing) as well as configuration management for cloud native applications that need to interact with a multitude of management and visualization systems, some of which were created for the cloud (e.g. ONAP), and some which has long been established in telecom service providers' environments.  To answer the challenge Ericsson has built a platform using open source projects straight from the CNCF Landscape. This session will show the motivations behind this undertaking, walk you throuh the architecture of the platform and discuss the benefits and challenges of using open source and cloud native for 5G networks.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zepo"
