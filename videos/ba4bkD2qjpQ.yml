description: "From Research Project to PyPI Release\n[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-29 - Brian]\n[Online]\n\nBy Griffith Rees\n\nHalfway through my first postdoc it was clear it would be very difficult to submit a paper to a journal before my contract ended. How do I make  something useful in the time allotted that keeps me motivated enough to finish a paper after my contract ends (and useful on a CV)? Answer: package my code into a tested library via GitHub, The Python Package Index (PyPI) and Zenodo for citations.\n\nGoals: \n- Pros and cons of rearranging a project for public release (5 min)\n- Python cookiecutter templates (5 min)\n- Options for testing (standard library unittest vs pytest) (5 min)\n- Continuous Integration (Travis vs GitHub Actions) (5 min)\n- Documentation (5 min)\n- Release on Zotero for citation (5 min)\n\nPrerequisites:\n- Intermediate Python\n- Command line\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
