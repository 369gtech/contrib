description: "As companies evolve to adopt, integrate, and leverage software as the defining element of their success in the 21st century, a rash of processes and methodologies are vying for their product teams' attention. In the worst of cases, each discipline on these teams -- product management, design, and software engineering -- learns a different model. This short, tactical talk reconciles the perceived differences in Lean Startup, Design Thinking, and Agile software development by focusing not on rituals and practices but on the values that underpin all three methods. The tactics in this talk draw on Jeff’s years of practice as a team leader and coach in companies ranging from small high-growth startups to large enterprises. Whether you’re a product manager, software engineer, designer, or team leader, you’ll find practical tools in this talk immediately applicable to your team’s daily methods.\n\nEVENT:\n\nØredev 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJeff Gothelf\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nØredev Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nØredev YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0XtR2kcXnqtfrGSsxM8oAg"
