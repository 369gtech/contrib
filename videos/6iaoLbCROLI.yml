description: "Venkat Subramaniam, President, Agile Developer, Inc.\n\nMention Java 9, and everyone immediately thinks of modularization. Although that's quite important, Java 9 contains many other improvements to the language and the JDK. This presentation dives into the language-level improvements and also the changes related to the Streams API and the functional style of programming. The objective of this session is to help developers make better use of Java 9 from the language, JDK, and functional programming point of view."
