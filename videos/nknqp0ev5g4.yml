description: "The way we publish to the web is broken. For years, we’ve relied on pre-built HTML templates inside content management systems as our only way to publish content online. Designers hand off their creations to developers who meticulously hand-code basic templated layouts that take days or weeks. A lot of the magic of a design gets lost in translation due to the limiting technology of the day. When you simply want to move an image 1 inch to the right, the technology tells you you can’t.\n\nWhat if you could crack open your browser, hit New Page, and just create? Straight from brain to page? No hand-coding? (Unless you want to!). What if every page on the Web was a starting point that you could use to take it in another direction and make it your own? What if the browser acted just like every other desktop publishing or design app you’ve ever used?\n\nNow it does.\n\nCraig Fitzpatrick\nCEO, PageCloud\nhttps://www.twitter.com/pagecloud\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
