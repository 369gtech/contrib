description: "From the time when I started writing my first programs at school, I was fascinated about how large systems are designed and created.\n\nSince then I have had a chance to be involved in development and design of systems of various sizes. Starting with small student projects, to full scale enterprise applications. \n\nBeing able to apply architectural patterns, integration patterns in real world systems, and have clean design makes me a happy engineer.\n\nHaving clean code, beautiful and efficient design in the systems challenges me to strive for perfection.\n\nI love to share this passion with my colleagues. I like discuss the impact of recent technologies on the systems that we design and code on daily basis.\n\nOutside of work, I have a passion for photography, running, wilderness, independent travelling and mountaineering."
