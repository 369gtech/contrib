description: 'Let''s have some fun with TensorFlow and React. Not familiar with TensorFlow?

With a good background in the tech let''s expand to tracking multiple limbs and evaluating and scoring some yoga positions. We will look at a couple different scoring algorithms, and finally challenge the audience to beat our high score for ultimate bragging rights.'
