description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nVisual concurrency cookbook\nby \nVámosi Dániel\n\nABSTRACT\nWhile building an air travel distribution system, the number and variety of concurrency patterns we need to evaluate and apply can be vast. Sometimes OTP comes to the rescue, sometimes good tricks from the community, sometimes our own designs. I have been prototyping visualisation tools for the BEAM for few years already, also gave same talks around the topic. This time I would like to use these tools to tell our journey and present our learnings through a visual concurrency cookbook.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Vámosi Dániel\n\nDániel started as architect (not software) 15 years ago, then he gradually switched to software development and later engineering management. Since 2016 January Daniel is leading the tech for flyiin.com and bringing BEAM technologies to the aviation industry.\n\n---\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: https://www.elixirconf.eu/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU"
