Information discovery is enabled through Search and Recommendations, but users expect Google-like quality results. In this talk, we discuss several ML strategies and design considerations around collecting and using signal data to train ranking algorithms and Collaborative Filtering recommenders as a component of a larger information portal. Recent progress in NLP and deep learning have ushered in a new wave of search methodologies, primarily vector-based search which is distinctly different from lexical-based search engines. We discuss how your businesses can leverage these advancements to drive a better user experience around information retrieval.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nMark Moyou, PhD is currently a Senior Data Scientist at NVIDIA. Prior to NVIDIA, he was Data Science Manager at Lucidworks, a hyper-growth, San-Francisco based startup that delivers ML-powered search where he worked with Fortune 1000 clients on their Search and Recommendations roadmap for powering both external customer-facing and internal-facing search applications.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
