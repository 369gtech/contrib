description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #18\n16 December 2018\nHosted by Waze\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nPandas is constantly evolving and adding more functionality, yet somehow, we tend to reinvent the wheel each time we face a task.\nModern Pandas has a lot functionality that is just waiting for you to use.\nIf you think your task is common enough, it probably is, and Pandas probably has a solution.\n\nDean is a data scientist at BlueVine interested in data-science, machine learning, deep learning, Python scientific programming, data visualizations, and Bayesian modelling. Before my current position, I was working on complex, dynamic, health systems, finding optimal vaccination allocation for disease in Israel, and I was researching large social networks for social influencer marketing.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
