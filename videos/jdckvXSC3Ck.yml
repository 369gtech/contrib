recordingDate: 1629200186
description: "Among other things, the banking world is looking for new revenue and ways to retain customers. Focusing on customer experience is one way to get there. Shifting to a product-centric way of thinking results in dreaming up new types of “features” and even products to offer existing customers and help retain them - maybe even garnering new customers above the humming churn rate. In this episode, Coté talks with Henri van den Bulk about these drivers and some examples of that product-centric thinking in action.\n\nFind Henri in Twitter and LinkedIn:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/hmvandenb\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/hvandenbulk/"
