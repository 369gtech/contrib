description: "Web3 - the Internet of Freedom, Value, and Trust On exiting the system and reclaiming control of our digital and physical lives\nby Bruno Škvorc\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2215/web3.webm\n\nFor as long as human society has existed, humans have been unable to trust each other. For millennia, we relied on middlemen to establish business or legal relationships. With the advent of Web2.0, we also relayed the establishment of personal connections, and the system has turned against us. The middlemen abuse our needs and their power and we find ourselves chained to convenience at the expense of our own thoughts, our own privacy. Web3 is a radical new frontier ready to turn the status quo on its head, and these are the technologies we're using to make it happen.\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 12:00:00"
