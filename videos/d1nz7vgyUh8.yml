description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2016 - Brussels, January 27-29 2016\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nThe Apollo Guidance Computer was a sophisticated fly-by-wire system, interactive with flight crew, with mission control and capable of automatic flight as directed. It was a general purpose, integrated-circuit computer and the programming group for the machine invented wholesale many modern techniques of critical embedded software. This machine whose function was so sophisticated, whose programming environment admitted modern techniques was made of hand-threaded ropes of copper, had a mere 36,864 words of memory and a 2MHz clock. Astronauts were limited to the DSKY, a numeric display and keypad that comprised the whole of their UI."
