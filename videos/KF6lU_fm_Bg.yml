description: "Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and beyond ?\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Moorfoot]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Peter Babics\n\nHave you ever tried to manage deployment of multiple python applications through various\nlinux distributions ? If so, you must have heard of Docker and maybe also Kubernetes.\nDistributing python applications using docker is simple and allows to create static packages\ncontaining everything required for them to run. Also it allows to freeze everything, packages, available\nlibraries, files on filesystem.\nIn my speech I would like to tell you about our brief journey, of moving our trading platform\nfrom standalone application directly on host system, through deploying it in docker and latter\nmoving it to kubernetes. I will explain our struggles with implementing stable and fast CI using Gitlab CI and Docker,\nimage (package) storage and cleanup of old images and finally I will tell you how we are deploying\nour platform to kubernetes, with nothing more than yaml-s and templating.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
