description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nServerless Platform for Large Scale Mini-Apps: From Knative to Production - Yitao Dong & Ke Wang, Ant Financial \n\nServerless architecture is getting increasingly popular. However, developers are still experiencing pain points that hold them back from using it in production, like portability, interoperability and debugging. At Ant, Ke and Yitao are committed to building a mission-critical serverless platform that reduces those frictions, which is now supporting large scale mini-apps.  Ke and Yitao will share the key workloads they are building with serverless and how they address pain points in production by expanding Knative. They will introduce technical details of adopting Knative with secure container runtime and reinventing Knative control/data plane, which largely saves deployment and operation efforts to enable serverless in Kubernetes clusters. The chat will also cover a quick demo to illustrate improved serverless app lifecycle management, 0-M-N-0 autoscaling performance and operation workflow. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uad9"
