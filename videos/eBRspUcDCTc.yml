description: "Speaker: Danilo Sato (@dtsato)\n\nDevOps and Continuous Delivery practices help increase deployment frequency of systems to production, while also increasing their reliability. A focus on automation makes it possible to deploy several times a day. However, operations teams might still resist when you try to apply these practices. In this talk I will present some principles and deployment practices that can help reduce the risk with frequent deployments and discuss how to increase collaboration between the development and operations teams. \n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nDanilo Sato is a Principal Consultant at Thoughtworks with more than 15 years of experience as developer, architect, Agile coach, trainer, data engineer, and devops guru.
