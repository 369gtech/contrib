recordingDate: 1525772885
description: "Making tired on developing \"new-Snapchat-with\" or \"app-like-Airbnb-but\" or doing something like \"ok, I will copy that from that project, add design and go to production\" sounds familiar to you? Was ruby worth it to learn and use it for all these years? Let's see what more can ruby do for you!\n\nWe will start with top level overview about options you have today (they will make your life is a developer challenging), then will go down to real world case(-s) and, hopefully, will make something working together. I want to present my experience and will guide you on what can ruby do with machine learning, so often called AI today."
