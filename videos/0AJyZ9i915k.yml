title: 'Pushing Java EE Thin WARs To The Clouds'
language: English
recordingDate: 1485780470
description: "Java EE applications are tiny and therefore particularly interesting for cloud deployments. In this screencast I created, build, deployed and launched a minimalistic Java EE application to/in the clouds.\n\nThe base docker image was taken without any modifications from: https://github.com/AdamBien/docklands\n\nSee you at: http://workshops.adam-bien.com.
