description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nMethods to Achieve High SLOs on a Large Scale Kubernetes Cluster - Kang Fan & Jinghua Yao, Ant Group \n\nWith the scale and complexity of a Kubernetes cluster increasing, it's getting harder to keep the cluster deliver qualified pods with high success rate and low latency. In this session, engineers from Ant Financial would share their experience on design of SLO architecture and methods implemented to achieve high service level objectives. They would introduce proper indicators proposed to measure whether Kubernetes clusters are healthy firstly. Then, they would explain how to design and implement the tracing and analysis platform to collect valid metrics and compute those indicators. With the tracing and analysis platform, problems occurred in pods' delivery process would be diagnosed easily. Finally, they will show how to precipitate artificial experience to self-healing system to fix known problems automatically. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp8H"
