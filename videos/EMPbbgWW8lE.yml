description: "??????????????? ?? CodeFest: https://codefest.ru/\n??? ????????-?????: https://t.me/cdfst\n\nThe world is more and more etherogeneous and each echosystem has pros and cons that must be carefully evaluated.\_\n\nThe target of the session is to show how can NodeJS and .NET Core be bridged, and taking advantage of the best of the two worlds.\_\n\nInstead of just showing of how the bridge works, we will see each interoperability step, from NodeJS to C++, hosting the Core CLR, invoking asynchronous task-based .NET methods and finally marshalling back to the world of NodeJS."
