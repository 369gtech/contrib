What is the type theory? How can I benefit from it as a software engineer? The story of how I end up applying Type Theory in static configurations files like JSON and YAML. What I learn in the process of this experiment, and how it changed my perspective in software design.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/gabriel-habryn\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - GABRIEL HABRYN\nBackend Domain Lead at Brainly\n\nGabriel Habryn functional programming enthusiast who is not afraid to use free-monads and the Type Theory. During the day at Brainly helps engineers to use best practices. Encourage experimentation and research. Coach, and train in new technologies and concepts (#GraphQL, #CRDTs, #EventStorming, #SystemDesign...). During afternoons explore concepts of functional programming, and publish code on GitHub under @widmogrod nickname.\n\nMore on Gabriel Habryn: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/gabriel-habryn\n\n---\n\nLAMBDA DAYS & ERLANG SOLUTIONS\nLambda Days is powered by Erlang Solutions.
