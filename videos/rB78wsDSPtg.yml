description: "Scott Coulton - Senior software engineer, Puppet\n\nIn this talk Scott Coulton will take you through Docker's cluster solution Swarm mode with his operations hat on. We will start from the beginning by describing what swarm mode is, what it does, and how it works behind the scenes. From there, we will look at very basic configurations of Swarm mode from the point of view of the operations team as well as a production-ready workflow including deployments of the cluster, logging and CD best practices. Attendees will be able to apply their learnings to their use cases."
