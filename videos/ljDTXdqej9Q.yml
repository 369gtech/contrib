description: "Speaker: Ellen Friedman (@Ellen_Friedman)\n\nAbstract: There’s a revolution underway in how people work with data. Streaming data is no longer seen as a special use case – and that’s good a thing given that streaming is a better fit to the way life happens. This talk takes a look at the benefits of stream-first architecture and some of the emerging technologies that enable best practices with streaming. These include message transport with Apache Kafka or MapR Streams, and stream processing with Apache Flink. As a top level Apache project, Flink has an active and growing international community. The Flink engine offers robust, accurate and highly scalable real time stream processing, and it also works in batch. We’ll briefly explore how these new approaches and technologies are being put to use in real world situations.\n\nEllen Friedman is a consultant and commentator on big data topics. Active in open source, Ellen is committer for Apache Drill and Apache Mahout projects. She has a PhD in biochemistry, years of experience as a research scientist and has written about a wide range of technical topics. She is co-author of many short O’Reilly big data books including the Practical Machine Learning series, Time Series Databases, Streaming Architecture and the latest, Introduction to Apache Flink.
