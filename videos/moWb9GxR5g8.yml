description: 'Codemotion Milan 2015 - "The Step After Styleguides" by Ben Scott - Styleguides provide a useful means to visualize the components within your website, yet they are sometimes treated as second-class citizens that need extra work. In this talk I will discuss why component libraries are a good start and how that core idea can be expanded. I will show how to use a component library as a foundation for your application, how to formalise the transformation from data objects to visual components and why this helps speed up development and ensure visual consistency.'
