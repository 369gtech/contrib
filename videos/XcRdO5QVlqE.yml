description: "www.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a two day, single track conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 500 to 700 Developers from across the country will converge on beautiful Salt Lake City, UT to participate in training sessions by the Google Angular team, and other Angular experts. In addition to the invaluable training, ng-conf will deliver a premier conference experience for attendees, providing opportunities to network with other developers, relax at social events, and engage in some of the unique entertainment opportunities available in Utah.\n\nChristian Lilley\nTopic: Going Postal with Angular in Promises\n\nLet's get a little crazy, share some visions of Promises as the Mailbox and Deferreds as the Postman, and then lay waste to everybody who's still harshing our mellow with pyramids of doom and callback spaghetti. We all know the sexy Angular buzzwords of 'Dependency Injection', 'modularity', 'HTML as a DSL', etc, etc. But the promise pattern (and lazy promises, no less!) is also baked right into the fabric of Angular, and doesn't get half the press of those other poseurs. Yet it will change your code to the very bones! We'll start with an overview of the essential promise pattern, then dive into the sundry ways that Angular leverages it to convert your async anger to promise paradise, especially in version 1.2. Plus! Bonus references to obscure Kevin Costner Sci-Fi flicks!"
