description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nSponsored Session: StackRox - Kubernetes Security Checklist using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework \n\nYou have Kubernetes workloads running in production, but how do you *really* know your applications and Kubernetes environment is protected from attacks? A comprehensive Kubernetes MITRE ATT&CK matrix is available to help your organization identify, prioritize, and mitigate security risks. However, trying to address Kubernetes security gaps without taking advantage of Kubernetes-native security controls exposes you to greater risk, higher operational costs, and lower developer productivity. This session will cover the security features built into Kubernetes and highlight some of the ways those capabilities can be aligned to the Kubernetes MITRE ATT&CK matrix so that your entire organization benefits from a developer-friendly approach to securing Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff1v"
