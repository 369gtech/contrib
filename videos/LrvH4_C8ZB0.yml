title: 'Metaprogramming With The Groovy Compiler - Part 2 of 2'
language: English
recordingDate: 1404726699
description: 'Groovy is a really powerful and really flexible language. The runtime capabilities allow for a lot of capabilities that are not possible with less dynamic languages. Those runtime capabilities are really powerful but are not the whole story of Groovy''s dynamic capabilities. Groovy also allows for a lot of dynamic behavior to be introduced at compile time. Participating in the compilation process isn''t something that application developers are generally used to doing, but Groovy makes it somewhat easy to jump into that process without having to write a whole compiler of your own. This session will dive deep into the features of Groovy that allow for you to participate in the compilation process to control what the compiler emits. You will learn to add methods to classes, modify existing and more, all at compile time. This session is focused specifically on Groovy''s compile time metaprogramming capabilities. Part 1 of 2 will cover Groovy''s runtime metaprogramming capabilities.'
