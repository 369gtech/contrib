For Java EE applications, this enables packaging of applications, the application server, and other dependencies in a container that can be replicated in build, test, and production environments. This talk introduces the audience to the various concepts and dives into the different delivery models that can be achieved with Java EE servers running in containers. it introduces several different approaches to packaging, deployment and continuous delivery on a full blown, open source middleware stack.\n\nMarkus Eisele, Red Hat Inc.\n\nMarkus is a Developer Advocate at Red Hat and focuses on JBoss Middleware.
