These types of issues have also been used in several real world exploits. Clearly something needed to be done, but what?\n\nOne potential solution to the problem was automatically initializing variables in C/C++ code, however, this comes with potentially significant performance and compatibility problems. In this talk, we’ll walk you through the journey of prototyping, building, and shipping a mitigation named InitAll which does exactly that. Along the way we’ll look at specific vulnerabilities, mitigation implementation details, performance problems, compiler optimizations, application compatibility issues, and more.\n\nWe’ll finish up by sharing some cool bugs this mitigation has already killed and share our thoughts on the future of safer C/C++ code.\n\n— \nJoe Bialek\nSoftware Security Engineer, Microsoft\nJoe Bialek is a security engineer in the Microsoft Security Response Center's Vulnerability & Mitigations team. Joe spends his time eliminating vulnerability classes, creating exploit mitigations, and finding security bugs.\n\nShayne Hiet-Block\nSoftware Engineer, Microsoft\nShayne is a software engineer working on the Microsoft Visual C++ team, where I've worked for over 13 years. Most of my focus has been on C/C++ code generation. I've worked on general feature work for back-end code generation, optimizations and security.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
