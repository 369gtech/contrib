title: 'Meta-programming in lambda - Tom Wallace'

description: "After taking a joke way too far, we ended up with the “single lambda application”. A monstrosity that would serve up an interface, respond to requests and edit its own deployment accordingly.\n\nFrom re-configuring timeouts all the way to updating the code itself- it was an experiment in just how far you can go meta-programming with lambda.\n\nAnd while our ‘single-lambda-app’ is unlikely to become the next big framework; how we got there sheds some light on tools that might just be useful.\n\n“They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should\"\n\nWebsite: https://cardiff.serverlessdays.io/"
