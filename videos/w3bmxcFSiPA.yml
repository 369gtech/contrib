description: 'Do you have this build script that with a single command builds your software? Does this still apply on a brand new PC? This presentation takes you on the journey to construct complex build environments using Docker. The journey follows our lessons learned and experiences going from hand crafted to Dockerized build environments. We will look at different patterns to build modular containers, ways to chain containers and the specialties of Windows containers.'
