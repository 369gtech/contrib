description: "\"I Would Rather Have a Backend Guy Write Frontend Code Than the Other Way Round\"\n\nNowadays Front-End does not only have to look well. It has to perform, it has to be developed fast, not rarely by multiple teams, it has to be easy to update, change, you name it. The way we have been doing Front-End does not really make all that achievable without sacrificing sanity of developers put to the task.\n\nThe funny thing is: developers have been dealing with problems like these for quite some time. Even more: the greatest brains of software development have come up with some pretty neat techniques to use when those situations arise. Most of them have catchy acronyms, too!\n\nUnfortunately we (on the frontend side) didn’t use all that experience from the start. We were the cool kids trying to deal with problems our own way. I have seen it time and time again: custom code for well defined problems, jquery spaghetti hell, 4k+ scripts.js files containing all application frontend logic with hardcoded markup…\n\nWell, it doesn’t work. We are waking up to that fact and we are doing what we can to learn all the tricks from the ‘old dogs’ and use them with our cool shiny tools. We will take a look at how it’s done, what is here already and what the future might have in store for us."
