description: "http://strataconf.com/\nNerds crash the gates of a venerable American institution, shoving aside its so-called wise men and replacing them with a radical new data-driven order. We've seen it in sports, and now in The Victory Lab- which Politico has described as \"Moneyball for politics\"- Sasha Issenberg tells the hidden story of the analytical revolution upending the way political campaigns are run in the 21st century. The Victory Lab follows the renegade academics and maverick operatives rocking the war room and re-engineering a high-stakes industry previously run on little more than gut instinct and outdated assumptions. Armed with insights from behavioral psychology and randomized experiments that treat voters as unwitting guinea pigs -and reams of new individual-level data fed into microtargeting algorithms-the smartest campaigns now believe they know who you will vote for even before you do. The Victory Lab presents a secret history of modern American politics, pulling back the curtain on the tactics and strategies used by some of the era's most important figures-including Barack Obama and Mitt Romney-with iconoclastic insights into human decision-making, marketing and how analytics can put any business on the road to victory.\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/strata2013/public/schedule/detail/28555"
