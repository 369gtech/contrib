description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nKotlin/Native lets you reach beyond the JVM, and into the world of hardware. In this talk we use Kotlin/Native to create a hardware audio synthesizer. You will learn how to interface with C++ libraries and compile and deploy Kotlin to embedded systems. We explore the state of the current Kotlin/Native ecosystem and what it provides. The result will be something we can jam with, Kotlin/Native-style!\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nJosh Skeen is an Android engineer and instructor at Big Nerd Ranch, and author of Kotlin Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide. When not working on client consulting projects, he teaches Kotlin and Android. When not in front of his computer, you can find Josh running or creating electronic music on a eurorack modular."
