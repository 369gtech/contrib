The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nA Special Interest in Cloud Native Security - Emily Fox, National Security Agency (NSA) & Brandon Lum, IBM \n\nWonder about the security of CNCF projects? What about the state of security in cloud native? Security is not binary, it’s a practice of reducing risk. With fast-changing infrastructure and emerging best practices, there’s no simple, cookie-cutter solution. The Special Interest Group (SIG) Security is a group of security minded folks in the cloud native community. These awesome people are focused on improving security of cloud native projects & minimizing security gaps in cloud native adoption. In this session you will learn about our current and future projects, efforts, and how you can get involved in the future of cloud native security. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekG3"
