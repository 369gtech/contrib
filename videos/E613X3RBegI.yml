title: 'Jacob Kaplan-Moss - Assets in Django without losing your hair - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: Jacob Kaplan-Moss\n\nThere's one part of building a Django app I hate: setting up handling of assets and media. There are so many moving pieces â€” static assets,  asset compilation and compression, file uploads, storage engines, etc. etc. I can never remember how it all fits together. I wrote this talk for one very selfish reason: to document how this all works, in one place, once and for all. \n\nThis talk is primarily intended for Django developers who want to build an asset pipeline that Just Works. The bulk of the talk covers front-end tooling (Webpack, PostCSS, Babel, etc.), so full-stack developers of any stripe will find something here, too.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
