description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/FrankMcSherry/flink-meetup\n\nApache Flink Meetup Berlin #6  29.04.15\n\nFrank surveys some recent research work (from his experience with the Naiad project) on extended dataflow models, including those integrating streaming and iterative computation. \n\nThe material is not specific to Flink, but it should be interesting for anyone looking to push the boundaries of dataflow computation.\n\n\nhttps://flink.apache.org/"
