description: "A Google TechTalk, 12/5/16, presented by Ulf Adams, Helen Altsuhler, David Stanke.\nABSTRACT: Google has more than 2 billion lines of code distributed over more than 9 million source files. This talk will be a deep technical dive into how Google designed a build system to handle that kind of scale. Bazel is Google's platform independent open source build tool, now publicly available in Beta. Bazel has built-in support for both client and server software, including client applications for both Android and iOS platforms. It also provides an extensible framework that you can use to develop your own build rules."
