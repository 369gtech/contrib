title: '"Why Ruby Isn''t Slow" by Alex Gaynor'
language: English
recordingDate: 1614356620
description: "Ruby, perhaps more than any other dynamic language, has a reputation for being slow. But this doesn't have to be. I've spent the last year building Topaz, a high performance Ruby VM, built on the same technologies that power PyPy. This talk will be an overview of what makes a Ruby VM slow, and how we solved.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* Method dispatch\n* Constant lookups\n* Allocation of integers, floats, and other \"primitives\" on the heap\n\nAlex Gaynor\nRackspace\n@alex_gaynor\n\nAlex is a software engineer at Rackspace. He spends much of his time working on open source projects such as Topaz, PyPy, CPython, and Django, as well as serving on the Board of Directors for the Python Software Foundation.\n\n\nRecorded at Strange Loop conference (https://thestrangeloop.com) in St. Louis, MO, Oct 2013."
