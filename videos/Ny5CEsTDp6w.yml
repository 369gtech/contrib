title: 'px3d: a free software browser based pixel 3D nano-engine in ClojureScript'
recordingDate: 1578987134
description: "Chris McCormick\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/188/\n\nInfinite Lives is a tiny game-jamming collective from Perth. We're building games and tooling with Clojure & ClojureScript. Earlier this year we built px3d, a free software pixel 3D nano-engine that runs in the browser. Built on top of three.js it features a pixel aesthetic and live-reloading of models from Blender. This talk will show off the features of the engine and get you started using it to build games.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 11:55:00 2020 at Room 6"
