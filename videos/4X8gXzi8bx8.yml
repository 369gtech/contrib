title: 'CppCon 2017: Zhihao Yuan “Class Template Argument Deduction: A New Abstraction”'
language: English
recordingDate: 1508106786
description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nC++17 is often quoted as “just a better C++14”, suggesting that nothing is new, nothing is changing the way we program. This talk presents class template argument deduction as a counterexample, a hidden gem in the new standard. \n\nSaves typing? A replacement for the `make` functions? If that’s your frame, then you should come to this talk. The true power of class template argument deduction is underestimated. It’s a new point of abstraction but requiring creativity, insights, and understanding about the language details to manage. \n\nThis talk will start by introducing all matters about this feature to build up sufficient background knowledge, followed by teaching how to write deduction guides by examples, and finally explain how to build abstractions using the whole feature in a top-down approach, with patterns categorized.\n— \nZhihao Yuan: Research Engineer, DePaul University\n\nZhihao Yuan is a research developer at DePaul University. In the last several years, he participates in the C++ standardization due to personal interests, and most recently, contributed the deduction guide for std::array to C++17.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
