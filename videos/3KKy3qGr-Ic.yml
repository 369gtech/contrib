description: 'As a developer, chances are you have created, consumed (or both) APIs at some point in your career. If you are a mobile/web/UI developer, you have definitely interacted with APIs because the data to be displayed needs to come from somewhere and if you are a backend developer, you have definitely created APIs to interact with other services (UIs and other backend services alike). Before we get started with the actual API service implementation, we define a spec and that is going to be the focus of my talk: A step-by-step process for defining an API spec - Where to begin, what components to consider, useful resources and finally, a few gotchas!'
