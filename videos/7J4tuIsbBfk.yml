description: "Quantum computers are real and I have used them. After being inspired by a conference talk I've learned what they can and can't do and I've learned to program them. I'm currently in the process of making ThoughtWorks UK ready to help to shape the quantum computing revolution when it comes.\n\nThis is the story of what is going on in the world of quantum computing and what previously intractable real world problems will potentially become solvable. I will give some detailed demonstrations of how to write quantum code and how to execute the quantum code on real quantum computers, not just simulators."
