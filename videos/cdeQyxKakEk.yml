description: "Fine-Grained Cost Allocation in Multi-Tenant Kubernetes Clusters - Yang Guan, Google \n\nAn organization operating a multi-tenant Kubernetes cluster may want to attribute the cost of operating the cluster to individual tenants for a variety of reasons. For example, a SaaS provider may want to understand how much it costs them to serve each customer, or an enterprise may want to perform chargeback or showback to internal teams or departments that are sharing the cluster.  This session introduces you to methodologies to track the usage of cloud resources from various Kubernetes objects, and to associate the usage information with the cost of cloud resources on a per-namespace basis. The session also compares the methodologies with existing products in the market. A demo is included at the end to illustrate how we apply the methodologies to perform namespace-granularity cost allocation in GKE clusters. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrYY"
