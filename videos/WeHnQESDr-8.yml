description: "In this hands-on workshop, Googlers Mano Marks and Pamela Fox show how to use tools within Google Maps, Google Earth, and Google Spreadsheets to create, import, and edit KML. They also show a quick integration of KML in the Maps API, and briefly mention geo search and indexing. This talk is useful for developers who haven't had a chance to play with the Maps or Earth creation tools yet, and are looking for quick ways to create and share geo-data.\nMore info on the series at http://google-geo-developer-series.googlemashups.com/"
