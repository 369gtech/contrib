description: "This session’s speaker says, “If I got a cent for each time I heard a variant of ‘We implemented Agile/Scrum/Kanban/Xp at our company, but it didn’t work for us, because we do things differently,’ I would have 4.10 € (or $).” During this session, he goes into why you should stop trying to implement a methodology from a book in just one team and instead try to create an agile methodology for your company as a whole. He discusses\n• The history of agile and the ideas behind it\n• How you can enlighten your company about the advantages of agile\n• Successes and failures and how we can learn from them\nAt the end of this session, you’ll have ideas, tips, and tricks for making your company agile.\n\nSpeaker:\nPeter Van de Voorde, Community Developer, Atlassian\nPeter is a 33 year old Belgian with a love of boardgames, skiing, reading, socializing and helping people.
