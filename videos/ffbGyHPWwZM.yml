description: "Arnaud Lawson, Squarespace\n\nImplementing service level objectives (SLOs) effectively is a hard task, especially for a service which not only is new within your engineering and product organizations but also encompasses both a request-driven and a storage subsystem.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss our experience defining and measuring service level indicators (SLIs) and objectives for our Ceph Object Storage service. I will describe our approach in specifying service level indicators plus the tradeoffs and implementation decisions we made when it came to measuring various types of SLIs, including availability, latency, and durability.\n\nI will also share the lessons learned and benefits gained from our implementation. You will understand why SLOs are crucial for site reliability engineers and service users and will be given some tips on how to implement them for either a request-driven or a storage system.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
