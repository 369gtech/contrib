description: "Google TechTalk\r\nApril 24, 2007\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Dr. Seth Shostak\r\nThe scientific hunt for extraterrestrial intelligence is now into its fifth decade, and we still haven't uncovered a confirmed peep from any cosmic company. Could this mean that finding aliens, even if they exist, is a project for the ages -- one that might take centuries or longer?\r\n\r\nNew technologies for use in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) suggest that, despite the continued dearth of signals from other societies, there is good reason to expect that success might not be far off -- that we might find evidence of sophisticated civilizations within a few decades.\r\n\r\nWhy this is so, what contact would tell us, and what such a discovery would mean, are the subject of this talk on the continuing efforts to establish our place in the universe of thinking beings.\r\n\r\nThis Space Exploration series talk was hosted by Boris Debic."
