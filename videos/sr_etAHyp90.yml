title: 'Event-driven plugins with Grails 3'
recordingDate: 1465930801
description: 'With Grails 1.x and 2.x we leveraged plugins like platform-core, spring-events and falcone-util to build event-driven applications. While it worked reasonable well for most applications, there was no standard way to use events in Grails applications or plugins.Grails 3 includes support for event-driven programming out of the box. Based on the Reactor framework Grails 3 deliveries an efficient event model that can be used by applications and plugins in a standard way.This talk will cover the new event support in Grails 3 and also lessons learned when migrating Grails 2.x plugins to Grails 3. The foundation of the talk is based on experiences when migrating several GR8 CRM (gr8crm.github.io) plugins to Grails 3.'
