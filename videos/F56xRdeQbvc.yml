description: 'Computing is moving fast towards an API-only model where canonical infrastructure (containers, VM''s and servers) are rendered obsolete and replaced by an undefined, "serverless" Function-as-a-service (FaaS) model. If this is the lay of the land, what roles are left to the army of "DevOps engineers" that are now filling the ranks of uncountable enterprises and startups? As any transformational change, fear and anxiety for job security might lead some to close down and reject the unstoppable trend upon us; however, I''ll argue that this could be the beginning of a DevOps 3.0 revolution.'
