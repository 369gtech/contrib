Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nKeynote: Super-Charge Your Mesh Services With Enhanced Data Access- Idit Levine, Founder & CEO, Solo.io\n\nIt is clear that service mesh is ‘crossing the chasm’ as more and more organizations not only deploy service mesh into production, but deploy it in large scale, mission critical environments. Development and operations teams value the common security model, fine grained traffic management and end-to-end observability provided by the mesh. Organizations are also realizing that the services and APIs that run within the mesh can expose valuable data and functionality, but application developers still need to write a lot of code to harness this information, limiting the adoption and ultimate benefit these services can provide.\n\nIn her talk, Idit Levine, CEO of Solo.io, will discuss innovative use cases that can be enabled by extending a service mesh. She will explore how a mesh can be used to simplify complex data and information access to support a wide variety of clients with minimal code to unlock hidden insights of an organization."
