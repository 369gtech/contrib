description: "Humans of all times have used codes and ciphers. Some of the greatest wars in history have been won thanks to good encryption, or lost due to great cryptographers. Even if we don’t think about it, encryption and cryptography are a big part of our lives, now that https is the defacto standard for the web. While most modern developers want to ensure that their data is secured, most of them don’t understand how the data is encrypted or how cryptography works. During this talk, the attendees will understand where ciphers come from by going through a journey in the history of cryptography. With examples from the Caesar cipher all the way to quantum cryptography, the speaker will explain in simple terms how cryptography evolved into what it is today and how it should be used to secure user data.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
