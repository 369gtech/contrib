title: 'Building Reactive Pipelines: How to go from scalable apps to (ridiculously) scalable systems'
language: English
recordingDate: 1557993450
description: "by Mark Heckler\n\nGoing from imperative, blocking code to a reactive programming model enables us to scale our apps in ways that aren't possible with a thread scale-out approach, which is a good thing! But as with all optimizations, one must examine & address the system holistically or all we accomplish is moving bottlenecks around, creating or finding new chokepoints as we tune certain applications/services. This is not so good.\n\nIn this session, the presenter discusses:\n\nHow Project Reactor builds on reactive streams to help you create performant & scalable reactive microservices\nMessage brokers & streaming platforms like RabbitMQ & Apache Kafka\nHow Spring Cloud Stream leverages Reactor to provide fully reactive pipelines for system-wide (ridiculous!) scalability\nThe presenter will code all examples using 100% open source software live and in real time. This is not an abstract discussion, come to gain real, practical knowledge!"
