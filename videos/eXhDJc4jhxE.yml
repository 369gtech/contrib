description: "CDON is the biggest online shopping site in Scandinavia and has their headquarters and development unit here in Malmö. They constantly try to improve the shopping experience for their customers and invest heavily in trying to make the shopping experience more joyful and seamless. This evening CDON and their technology partner Apptus will share their visions around the future online shopping experience.\n\nThis event is intended for people interested in developing and using immersive online shopping solutions.\n\nSpeakers\n\nAxel Rydby, UX Director at CDON (previous Design Director at Massive) and Michael Ericsson (COO) from Apptus Technologies:\n\n“Our UX vision, to create one of the most immersive online shopping experiences in the world, aims to do what physical stores can't. Imagine a store that rearranges itself to best fit your needs and desires, a store where there's no friction and no interruptions, and the more you shop, the more the store will know what you want - even before you do.\"\n\n-----------------\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing and learning.\n\nBorn out of the desire to create a year round conference like atmosphere, Foo Café is THE place for planned and spontaneous meetings of all sizes and interests within the IT arena.\nEnjoy a coffee or a cold beer, along with light pub fare, and engage with other like minded individuals interested in sharing their knowledge and learning from one another. Foo Café is sourced by individuals, small, medium and goliath-sized enterprises, as well as entrepreneurs. Awaiting you, after stepping over the Foo Café threshold, is a space that is recruitment and product placement safe!\n\nWe look forward to igniting inspiration and creativity year round to patrons of Foo Café."
