description: "UAA Authentication for Kubernetes - Andrei Krasnitski, Altoros\n\n With no built-in solutions for managing user accounts, Kubernetes has to rely on external systems for this. Can we use one UAA solution for both Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes authentication while building a hybrid deployment? Yes! This talk explores integration options between UAA and Kubernetes, discusses different ways of sharing UAA and the tradeoffs of each design. The speaker will show a prototype of a UAA solution integrated with both Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, enabling engineers to use the same credentials on both platforms. \n\nAbout Andrei Krasnitski\nAndrei Krasnitski is Cloud Foundry Engineer at Altoros. Having 3+ years of experience in building CI/CD pipelines and automating clouds, Andrei has participated in building a private cloud for one of the largest US-based IT service providers. Today, he is building and supporting Cloud Foundry environments for the enterprise customers of Altoros."
