title: '[Online Meetup] How to Build a Scalable Application? Introducing Repluggable'
recordingDate: 1604233425
description: "For the past years, we've been building large and complex applications at Wix.\nAs a product grows, it usually becomes more challenging to manage.\n\n* How do you keep the velocity?\n* Can you have a specific team develop and deploy only a part of an application?\n* What if you want to reuse code in multiple products?\n* How do you build to scale while keeping cross-cutting concerns easy to control?\n* How do you create various experiences for the same product?\n* How can you replace a specific module without compromising product integrity?\n\nAfter we've accumulated substantial mileage in creating these applications we've decided to systematically address those pain points with Repluggable, our new micro frontends framework. It introduces a robust foundation of developing for modularity and scale from the start, with strong design principles and inversion of control.\n\nIn this talk, you can learn more about how this solution works. It's open-sourced - so you can use it too!\n\n// Bio\n\nItay Shtekel is a software architect at Wix. He's a co-author of the Repluggable library and is guiding dozens of developers through building Wixâ€™s complex EditorX - a tool that incorporates more than 5 years of editors building experience in Wix. Prior to that, Itay was a software developer at 8200."
