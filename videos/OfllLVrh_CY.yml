recordingDate: 1250187806
description: "This is an 8-minute preview of the full webcast. MySQL's Clustering solution provides some pretty sophisticated functionality. In this webcast we'll take you through getting it up and running on your laptop or single node server, building a sandbox where you can play with the dials and levers and get familiar with all the moving parts.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is for intermediate DBAs who are already familiar with the basic MySQL architecture, and want to learn about the cluster architecture in terms of installation, setup, configuration and management."
