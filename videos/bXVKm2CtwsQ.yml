title: 'YOW! West 2017 James Stewart - Lessons Learned as a Government CTO'
recordingDate: 1497226433
description: "Over the past few years James Stewart went on an unusual journey, from a very hands-on software delivery role changing how the UK government made its website, to a high-profile position working across government to reform technology and security policy. He’ll share some of that story and some of the lessons learned along the way, with some thoughts on how as technologists we can communicate the wider changes we know are possible.\n\nJames Stewart is as an independent consultant supporting senior leaders in a range of sectors embed modern technology and security in their strategies, and helping organisations with digitally-enabled transformation.\n\nPreviously James was a co-founder of the Government Digital Service and Deputy CTO of the UK Government. He was responsible for the technical architecture of the award winning GOV.UK, building the acclaimed team behind it, supporting the delivery of dozens of projects across government and transforming the UK Government’s relationship with open source by “coding in the open.”\n\nWorking across government, he helped make the move toward a more user-centric and platform-based architecture for government services. He’s been instrumental in the UK government’s move to use of public cloud, reform of network policy and coordinating the network of senior technology leaders across government.\n\nFor more on YOW!
