title: 'YOW! Perth 2018 - Heidi Helfand - Dynamic Reteaming at Fast-Growing Companies'
recordingDate: 1538620641
description: "Team change is inevitable, especially when your company is hiring like crazy and doubling in size. Your teams might grow and split. 20 people might arrive in one day. What feels like tectonic shifts happen as you morph structurally to refocus people and work. How can we bring a humanistic stance to this dynamic reteaming? How can the people be empowered to have ownership over their team change? How can we integrate the new people and redefine our sense of “culture?” We will explore questions like these and will discover practical strategies to master dynamic retiming.\n\nHeidi brings a practitioner approach with 17 years coaching and influencing cross-functional teams. She is currently Director of Engineering Excellence at Procore Technologies in Carpinteria, California. Prior to that, she was an early employee at two highly successful startups from roughly 10 team members to 700. The first was ExpertCity, Inc. (acquired by CitrixOnline) where she was on the development team that invented GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting and GoToWebinar. After that she was Principal Agile Coach at AppFolio, Inc., a SAAS workflow software company that went public in 2015.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
