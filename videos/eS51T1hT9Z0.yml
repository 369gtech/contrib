title: 'How To (Semi-)Automate JavaScript Refactoring - Giles Bowkett'
language: English
recordingDate: 1392845150
description: "http://fluentconf.com\nRefactoring bad code can be tedious, repetitive work. But tedious, repetitive work is for computers to do! Find out how you can build a happy little refactoring droid which can do (at least some of) the boring parts of your job for you.\n\nThis talk will cover principles of automated refactoring, including tactics and low-hanging fruit; automated refactoring projects I've done for consulting clients; silly but effective hacks which misuse JSLint for fun and profit; automated refactoring and similarity-detection systems I've built in JavaScript and Ruby; and new parsing libraries using Node.js which make the process much easier."
