description: "Howdy ninjas, in this CSS beginners tutorial we'll take an in-depth look into the font weight property. Font weight in CSS simply means how bold or how light the font displays in a browser. \n\nBe aware that not all fonts come with light and bold variations, so the different font weights available in CSS may not work in all cases.\n\nOne font which has these extra two weights in Windows 8.1 is called Yu Gothic, which I'll be using in this video.\n\nAnyway, peace out, have fun and keep on coding :).\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n========== HTML Basics Course ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
