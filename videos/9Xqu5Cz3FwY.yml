Mgmt is a next gen config management tool that takes a fresh look at existing automation problems.\nThe tool has two main parts: the engine, and the language.\nThis presentation will have a large number of demos of the language.\nThe language is a minimalistic, functional, reactive DSL.\nIt was designed to both constrain the user with safe types, and no core looping constructs, but also to empower the user to build powerful real-time distributed systems.\nWe will present a number of traditional use cases that were historically quite difficult to setup and deploy, but which can now be expressed as simple, short snippets of code.\nExamples will include service discovery, auto-scaling, provisioning, state-machines, scheduling and more!\nFinally we'll talk about some of the future designs we're planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project. \n\nA number of blog posts on the subject are available: https://purpleidea.com/tags/mgmtconfig/\nAttendees are encouraged to read some before the talk if they want a preview! \n\nRoom: K.4.201\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 10:30:00+01"
