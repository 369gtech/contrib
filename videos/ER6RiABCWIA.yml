description: "A lot of architectures we see are driven by powerful forces that have nothing to do with technology or application requirements. These forces include but are not limited to résumé-driven development, vendors’ commercial interests, and the desire to be hip and ahead of the curve. What do architectures look like when we have application requirements so strong that these other forces are overcome?\n\nMartin Thompson explores the architectures that emerge from applying design patterns required for high performance, resilience, security, usability, and other quality-of-services measures that when not achieved result in total project failure. Martin outlines emergent designs and working practices that succeed in these areas where the design pressures quickly cull that which does not deliver."
