description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIntro: Telepresence: Fast Local-to-Remote Development for Kubernetes - Daniel Bryant, Datawire \n\nThis session will provide an intro to Telepresence, a CNCF Sandbox tool. We’ll talk about development workflows for Kubernetes. We’ll discuss the differences between traditional development, and different approaches people take to building Kubernetes services. We’ll then introduce Telepresence and discuss how it integrates with different organizational development workflows. Finally, we’ll talk about the evolution of Telepresence and how we are actively moving Telepresence forward from its heritage as a VPN-type approach into a more sophisticated L7 routing layer for developers. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp9y"
