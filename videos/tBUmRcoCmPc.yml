title: 'Climate Data, Scientific Data Visualization and Clojure - George Kierstein'
recordingDate: 1447793975
description: "The controversial nature of climate data demonstrates that scientific data sets can be challenging to communicate about. Traditional visualization approaches often fail to effectively illustrate the implications and limitations of this kind of data. This is especially true when the target audience are not domain experts.\n\nThis talk provides an overview of some key differences that scientific data sets have from more common data sets, such as business analytics. These differences impact correctness of results and add complexity to handling, processing, visualization and even understandability of these kinds of data. Using climate data as a touchstone, we will explore these differences with AWS/Clojurescript examples to illustrate what makes visualizing large scientific data sets challenging while demonstrating promising alternative approaches.\n\nAbout the speaker: Ms. George Kierstein has a deep interest in data visualization and a long professional history building high-performance computing systems on a variety of platforms. She is a recent functional programming convert and is excited about what functional programming and Clojure in particular can bring to the scientific community. She has over 16 years experience in industry and a Masters in Computational Neuroscience from Boston University."
