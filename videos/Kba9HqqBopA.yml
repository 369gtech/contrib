title: 'Functional programming with Raku - Juan Julián Merelo Guervós'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623340964
description: "Raku is a multiparadigm language, and that needs to include giving functions the status of first class citizens. In this talk we will see how Raku implements functional programming concepts, and how it compares with other popular functional programming languages.\n\nRaku has been described variously as the 100-year language, the language with everything _and_ the kitchen sink, and \"a better Haskell\". Any one of them points at it being a functional language, with many of the features that makes other functional languages interesting and fun to program. We will talk about these functional features, and compare them with other languages.\n\nFunctional programming is the programming paradigm that is best suited to modern, reactive, programming environments, but does not mean all languages implement it, or even implement it properly. However, in its 15-year design cycle, Raku decided it would walk that functional path, which implies, for starters, that functions are first class citizens, but also that it implements other functional characteristics like lazy data structures, algebraic data types, currying and pattern matching. All instances of this have been designed from scratch into the language, and feel natural in they they are used, fitting quite well other features such as concurrent programming.\n\nIn this talk, after introducing Raku, we will review how functional programming makes Raku expressive, hackable, interesting and fun, and how the implementation of functional features there compares in syntax and semantics to other functional languages, fully functional or otherwise."
