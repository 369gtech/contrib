title: 'Graal: Using JVM libraries in Node.js - Laurynas Lubys'
recordingDate: 1546423854
description: "GraalVM promises seamless interoperability between multiple languages, all running on the JVM. It makes it trivial to call code implemented in JVM languages from Node.js. However, given Nodeâ€™s event loop model, blocking it is not a viable option. In this talk Laurynas looks into how we can use blocking JVM libraries in Node.js as well as call back from JVM libraries into Node.js\n\nLaurynas Lubys is a curious software developer interested in how things work and how to make them work right."
