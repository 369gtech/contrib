As an introduction, this presentation briefly discusses Scala’s key characteristics. Then it explores this language and some of its typical applications, such as concise OO and powerful functional collections. If you are a developer and expect vivid examples and live coding, you will like this session.\n\n\nAuthors:\nHeiko Seeberger\nHeiko Seeberger is the Director Professional Services at Typesafe. He has been a Scala enthusiast ever since he came to know this beautiful language in 2008. He started his professional career as a software developer in 1993 using programming languages like object-oriented Turbo Pascal, Perth and C++. Since 1998 he has been living almost exclusively in the Java world where he could build deep expertise in technologies for enterprise applications like AspectJ, Spring, Eclipse RCP and OSGi. Soon after he was infected by Scala he started the ScalaModules project, a Scala-based DSL for OSGi, and became a committer to Lift and Akka. Heiko regularly shares his expertise in articles and talks and is the main author of the German Scala book \"Durchstarten mit Scala\".\nView more trainings by Heiko Seeberger at https://www.parleys.com/author/heiko-seeberger\n\nHeiko Seeberger\nHeiko Seeberger is the Director Professional Services at Typesafe.
