description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nFrom Tweet to BadIdea: Creating an Embeddable Kubernetes Style API Server - Jason DeTiberus, Equinix Metal\n\nKubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) have made building Kubernetes-style declarative APIs easy. However they depend on an existing Kubernetes cluster, which can lead to difficult bootstrapping issues when building infrastructure management tooling. Would it be possible to remove the Kubernetes cluster dependency by piecing together the components that Kubernetes itself uses to implement the features needed to support CRDs? This talk explores the process of attempting to do just that through the process of building a minimal and embeddable Kubernetes style API Server with CRD support."
