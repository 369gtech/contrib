title: 'Quantization of Deep Learning Solution for Efficient Inference | Kim Hee, UMM [PyData Südwest]'
language: English
recordingDate: 1634680818
description: "The power consumption of data-center is doubling every year and edge devices like Internet of Things (IoT) are growing rapidly. Quantize deep learning model reduces model size and inference time with little to no loss of model accuracy. Background of the core concepts and some results will be presented during the presentation.\n\nKim Hee\nUMM Medizinische Fakultät Mannheim / Biomedizinische Informatik\n\n\n\n\n\nPyData Südwest: https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/PyData-Suedwest/\nBig Data BBQ Event website: https://www.koenigsweg.com/big-data-bbq2021-community/index_eng.html\n\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
