description: "In 2009 Jim Weirich defined Connascence as «The Grand Unified Theory Of Software Development». The concept it is simple, yet very powerful in context of Object Oriented software development. It generalizes the ideas of Cohesion and Coupling, combining them in a more exhaustive classification under three axis, using a proper taxonomy. In this talk I will try to explain you the different kinds of Connascence using code and real life examples.\n\nAudience and level:\nAdvanced. Material for software crafters and XP practitioners.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/7avrPV2z49LDAA\n\nCodeFest O! https://o.codefest.ru/lecture/1681"
