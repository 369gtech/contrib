title: 'Resilient Architecture by Matt Stine'
language: English
recordingDate: 1501676848
description: "In the past we tried to create robust systems via mistake prevention. Modern approaches take a different approach called resiliency. Resilient architectures enhance observability, leverage well-known resiliency patterns (like Circuit Breakers), and embrace chaos. This presentation will show you how to create resilient systems using technologies like Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Retry, Netflix Hystrix, and Chaos Engineering.\n\nMatt Stine is a 17 year veteran of the enterprise IT industry, with eight of those years spent as a consulting solutions architect for multiple Fortune 500 companies. He is the author of Migrating to Cloud-Native Application Architectures from Oâ€™Reilly, and the host of the Software Architecture Radio podcast. He is currently the product owner for Spring at Pivotal, and spends much of his time driving an active feedback loop between the Spring R&D organization and customers developing cloud-native application architectures."
