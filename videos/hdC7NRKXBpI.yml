description: "Responsive design is in. Everybody’s talking about it and diligently putting together responsive websites. Yet it’s no easy task to design and build good, fast, and flexible responsive pages. How do you achieve your goal faster? What design patterns can we use and how do we deal with complicated mega-drop-downs, tables, calendars, dashboards, content blobs, tables, maps, modal windows, forms, and interactive elements, including conversational interfaces?\n\nWe’ll cover them all. Keep in mind: you won’t be able to unsee the things you’ll see in this session. Yes, it’s going to be dirty, tricky and horribly annoying at times.
