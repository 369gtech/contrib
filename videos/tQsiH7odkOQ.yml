Initially when i called edureka regarding my requirement of completing salesforce training i was a bit skeptical to choose between the local center which offers in house training - then i spoke to one of the edureka reps regarding it - First i taught what he was offering i.e Online Class / Support Team / Study Material n al were just a trick to convert me to a sale - But i was Wrong - he took my requirement seriously and gave me a very convincing plan to complete my certification by the date my company had wanted me to complete it - it was a matter of trust that had payed off for me Now i am a Certified Salesforce Administrator - A Big Thanks to Edureka!\""
