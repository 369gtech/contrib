language: English
recordingDate: 1623283417
description: "Azure Functions now supports OpenAPI generation on-the-fly. For professional developers, they can easily integrate it with Azure API Management and export a custom connector for low-code development. For citizen developers, they can also create a custom connector by themselves, with the OpenAPI document generated from Azure Functions. In this episode, we'll show you how easy it is to design, build, and test your APIs in a variety of app-building and integration scenarios using Azure Functions, plus how to leverage open-source packages and tools that to make it even easier.\n\nGuests\nBrady Gaster is a principal program manager in the Developer Division at Microsoft, where he works on SignalR, microservices and HTTP APIs, and integration with Azure service teams in hopes to make it exciting for developers who work on .NET apps to party in the cloud. You can find Brady on Twitter at @bradygaster when he's not learning with (or from) his 2 sons, tinkering with code, or making music in his basement using various synthesizers and guitars.\n\nJustin Yoo is a Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft. Justin used to be double-awarded Microsoft MVP before joining in Microsoft. He loves serverless technology as a glue that integrates everything.\n \nLinks\nDevelop ASP.NET Core apps using OpenAPI tools\n\n---\nView more episodes of the Launch Space at https://aka.ms/TheLaunchSpace"
