description: 'Enterprises often have hundreds or even thousands of applications spread across hundreds of development teams, business units and geographies. This presents challenges to IT teams as they architect an environment to run Docker apps on globally distributed hybrid cloud infrastructure, developed by distributed dev teams and consumed by customers around the world. Docker Datacenter provides the technology and framework to implement a global software supply chain. This session will dig into the design considerations, tools and best practices to address this type of environment with Docker Datacenter. And there will be data, demos and tools! Results from various performance tests will be presented in conjunction with recommendations for high-availability configurations, content cache use cases for faster developer workflow and scheduling strategies for improving application resilience.'
