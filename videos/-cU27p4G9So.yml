description: "Azure Machine Learning Studio provides an easy and inexpensive way to use machine learning as a service. The platform offers many implementations of data science algorithms and evaluation of created models. As a data source, developers can use available datasets, upload their own or connect to the external service. When working with big data volumes though, there is a need to treat data a little bit different.\nWhen handling datasets too big to fit into memory we usually either split or stream them. In the word of big data there are several technologies, like Hadoop or Spark that can handle this tasks in a quick and effective way. Azure ML users can benefit from them when connecting to Azure HDInsight clusters. In this talk Barbara will show how to approach big data architectures around Azure ML Studio. Session will cover the following topics:\n\n- Azure capabilities when designing big data architectures\n\n- Azure ML integration with different types of data stores\n\n- Working with data loads, batches and streams\n\n- Customising ML process using R modules\n\n- Publishing endpoints for predictive analysis and retraining the model\n\n- Scaling Azure ML web services\n\nAfter this talk attendees will know how to use Azure ML when designing architecture for big data volumes. They will find out how to adjust and customize their models using R modules. The talk will provide information on scaling up developed solutions to meet performance demands."
