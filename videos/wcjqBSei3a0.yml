description: "Speaker(s):\nEllie Powers\n\nDescription:\nBack in the 90s, there were early glimpses of a dream to connect the whole world through the internet. However, it seemed unrealistic during an era of desktop computers, dial-up modems, and mouse-and-keyboard interaction. Today, that dream is actually starting to come true, through mobile and apps. In this session, you'll see how the new mobile ecosystem including Google Play and Android are empowering developers to make good on the dream of connecting the world through technology to improve people's lives.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2015 videos at: g.co/dev/io15videos.\n\n#io15"
