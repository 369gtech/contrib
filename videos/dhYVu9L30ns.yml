title: 'Sai Ma - MIY: Model It Yourself - with ML Legobricks'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619003327
description: "PyData Cyprus Meetup - April 2021\n\n\nAbstract\n------------\nML-legobricks is a machine learning project that includes one code-sharing library, one agreement with Sagemaker and one cookiecutter template. It aims to unify the model building cycle, creating reproducible pipeline steps using Docker, and essentially build a model by one click away, not only providing you ingredients and recipes but also allowing you to cook your model as you want. We have this project onboarding internally in the Klarna fraud prevention team, and plan to push it to be adopted globally within Klarna.\n\nAbout the speaker\n-------------------------\nSai Ma is a senior data scientist in Klarna, specifically responsible for fraud detection in the Fraud Prevention Team. Before Klarna, she had working experience in content analysis, recommendation systems and CLV in the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe. Sai Ma has studied mathematics (Geometric Analysis) at Polytechnique, Paris, France, and has been an international butterfly living/studying/working in 5 countries. She believes that to become an outstanding data scientist, there are 3 skill baskets to fill: deep understanding in theory, practical engineering skills and business storytelling. She is very excited to be here and is looking forward to sharing ML-legobricks in PyData Cyprus.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
