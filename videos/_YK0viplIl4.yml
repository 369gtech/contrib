description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotgo.eu on November 6th in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nGo's concurrency model makes it easy to develop scalable servers and data pipelines. Many of the patterns we use in developing concurrent code mirror structures in real-world systems.\nIn this talk, Sameer presents a simulation of a small real world system and shows how variations in the design impact the system's performance."
