title: 'Micro Frontends – a strive for fully verticalized systems - David Leitner'

description: "We’ve seen significant benefits from choosing a microservice architecture for building enterprise applications, which allows us to structure teams based on business capabilities, improve scalability and enable the flexibility of being polyglot in the usage of technologies. Mostly this architecture is then complemented by a feature-rich and powerful browser application which sits on top of these backend-services. Unfortunately, the latter step ends up way too often in the creation of a single, sprawling and hard to maintain frontend-monolith.\n\nThe approach of micro frontends is an effective way to tackle this problem and first appeared at the end of 2016 on the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar. By going into detail about the underlying concepts of this architectural style, the idea of extending concepts of microservices to the frontend world, the importance of fully end-to-end verticalized systems, and the difference of an orchestration- or choreography-based implementation become reasonable.\n\nUpon a closer look at the advantages and challenges I've experienced in customer projects, it turns out that micro frontends are not a silver bullet either. Rather, they are suited for a specific set of problems. In a nutshell, micro frontends can be a powerful tool to avoid frontend monoliths and this talk will give you the needed knowledge to decide if it’s the right one for the job.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
