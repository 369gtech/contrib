description: "Google I/O 2010 - Google Wave API design principles + anatomy of a great extension \r\n\r\nWave 201 \r\n\r\nPamela Fox, Michael Goderbauer (Hasso Plattner Institute) \r\n\r\nGoogle Wave is all about collaboration. The most successful extensions are user-friendly and collaborative. Wave robots should be as intuitive to communicate with as a human, and play well with other robots; Wave gadgets should extend the metaphors of the textual collaboration into the visual. In this talk, we'll discuss the design and privacy principles you should consider while building extensions, and show examples of extensions that demonstrate these principles.  \r\n\r\nFor all I/O 2010 sessions, please go to code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions.html"
