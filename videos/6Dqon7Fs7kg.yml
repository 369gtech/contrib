description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nWhat You Didn’t Know About Ingress Controllers’ Performance - Mikko Ylinen & Ismo Puustinen, Intel \n\nThe Kubernetes Ingress is a way to connect cluster services to the world outside of the cluster. The incoming traffic is routed through a proxy server that is responsible for tasks such as load balancing and TLS termination. The proxy server performance plays a critical role in good service experience, contributing directly to HTTP request latency. In this talk we give a detailed performance breakdown of common proxy servers used in Kubernetes Ingresses and discuss where to pay attention to when configuring the proxy to gain the best performance. The focus is in CPU intensive TLS crypto operations (such as TLS handshakes), hardware acceleration, node resource allocation, and ideal workload placement.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZetR"
