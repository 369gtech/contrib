description: "The O'Reilly Animals\n\nFrom Perl to Hadoop, the O'Reilly Animal books have been there to help you advance your knowledgeâ€”and you've thrived under their tutelage. In real life, the animals themselves have not done nearly as well. Many are now critically endangered, and if the current trend continues, conservationists estimate that one-eighth of all bird species, one-fifth of mammal species, and one-third of amphibian species are at risk of extinction within the next 40 years.\n\nBut it doesn't have to end this way.\n\nOne person with a bright idea and a little technology can make a big difference. Just think what someone with your mad skills could do."
