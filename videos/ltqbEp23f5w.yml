description: "Speaker: Satoshi Nagayasu Japan PostgreSQL Users Group / Uptime Technologies\n\nDescription:\nRecently, PostgreSQL has succeeded in getting popularity among\nweb developers. One of the reasons is that PostgreSQL is growing\nnot only as a traditional RDBMS, but also as an application\ndevelopment platform with fully supporting ACID properties. In this\ntalk, I would like to introduce new features in the latest release 9.4\n(JSON, Analytics, Logical Decoding, etc.) to take advantages of the\nlatest PostgreSQL advancement, and share a quick look in the\nupcoming release 9.5.\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCjf/"
