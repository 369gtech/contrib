description: "Slides are available at: http://www.erlang-factory.com/berlin2014/mariano-guerra\n\n\n\nOne of the secret weapons of Erlang is Riak Core \"a toolkit for building distributed, scalable, fault-tolerant applications\", it's so secret that it's really hard to find information about it. \n\nIn this talk we will start from a riak core project skeleton using rebar riak core template and one bite (commit) at a time we will add features until we have a working riak_core based application supporting commands, consistent hashing, clustering, handoff, quorum based reads and writes, coverage calls, riak_core_security and more.\n\nAll of this exposed through an HTTP API using Cowboy and Bullet."
