description: "\"Speakers: Jérôme Petazzoni, AJ Bowen\n\nYou've started to \"\"containerize\"\" your applications by writing a Dockerfile or two, and now you want to run your containers in a cluster. But Kubernetes is quite different from Docker: the smallest unit of deployment is not a container, but a *pod*; pods are accessed through specialized load balancers called *services*; there are *labels* and *selectors* everywhere; and everything is created by expressing desired state with YAML, lots of YAML.\n\nIn this hands-on tutorial, we will learn about Kubernetes and its key concepts, both in theory (we will become familiar with all the things evoked in the previous paragraph) and in practice (we will know how to use them to deploy and scale our applications).\n\nKubernetes has the reputation of being a complex system with a steep learning curve. We will see that it is, indeed, a complex system, but that it is possible to tame its most essential features in just a few hours.\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
