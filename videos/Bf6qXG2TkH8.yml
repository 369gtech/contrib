title: 'CloudWatch-ing: Creating More Useful Logs & Alerts with AWS - Rhia Dixon'

description: "Logging is essential for visibility and resiliency, especially when monitoring and debugging software applications. However, overzealous logging of everything can do more harm than good. For integrated applications, generating massive files of data no one reads can lead to days of troubleshooting and weeks of fixing the “fix”. The time lost multiplies when these logs live in various places with no system to sound the alarm.\n\nLearning to use Amazon CloudWatch for streamlined, meaningful, centralized logging and alerts can drastically reduce the time it takes to notice issues, find bugs, and fix them.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndcminnesota.com/"
