description: "Is data exploration the most important step in a data project? Weird how this crucial phase almost never gets the credit its deserves. \nI will do an attempt here, a little ode to the exploration phase, and try make it cool again by using some modern packages. Any tool that helps us being effective, increases the change we find that gem during data explorations. I believe any insights gained during the data exploration phase pays back at least double later on in the journey.\n\nWillem Hendriks : Studied mathematics, and working with data since graduation. From small statistical sets to using big data tooling, currently at Big Data Republic.\nGitHub: https://gitlab.com/whendrik/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/willemhendriks//\n\nPyData Eindhoven 2021\nWebsite: https://pydata.org/eindhoven2021/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/pydataeindhoven\n\n===\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
