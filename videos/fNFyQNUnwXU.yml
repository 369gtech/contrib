title: '"iOS for Java Developers" by Daniel Schneller - Coding Serbia Conference'
recordingDate: 1383153058
description: 'With the tremendous popularity of Apple''s iOS in the mobile space, interest in being part of the "App-Ecosystem" is growing steadily. Objective-C with its unfamiliar syntax and a somewhat unusual development environment and tool chain, however, still scares developers away. In this talk I am going to present the language and tools in a way that specifically targets Java developers and that they will find easy to grasp. Objective-C constructs will be mapped to their Java counterparts and differences and similarities will be explained. After this session, every Java developer -- who previously might have considered themselves only qualified for writing Android apps -- should feel comfortable and knowledgeable enough to start diving into their first experiments with writing iPhone and iPad software.'
