description: "Psychotherapy is about building awareness and understanding, which leads to healthier habits. In this interdisciplinary session we do the same for software development by taking both technical and social factors into account. Our therapy starts with why it is so hard to write good code. We explore ways of building mental maps of large-scale codebases, and dig deeper to reflect on the gap between what most code looks like and what our brain actually prefers. Turning to cognitive psychology and learning theory, we explore alternative approaches that are better aligned with our strengths and weaknesses as humans. From here we explore the social dynamics of software such as collaboration, communication, and group decisions. We learn why code complexity goes far beyond code, look at common pitfalls for team work, and how to avoid them. Our conversations will result in actionable and specific take-aways that we can apply in our day jobs. So listen: your code wants to talk.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
