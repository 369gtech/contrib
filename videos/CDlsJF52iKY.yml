description: "Mystified as to how Oracle's decisions on open source fit together? Stop looking at your crystal ball and get insight into how Oracle views open source and the role Java plays in the developer community. Find out where Oracle sees Java heading and how you can navigate the best path as an open source Java developer and decision-maker to participate in moving Java forward.\n\nSteven G. Harris\n\nOracle\n\nSteve Harris joined Oracle in 1997 to manage the development team that delivered native Java support in the Oracle database. Since that time, his team has grown to include overall Java server development at Oracle, including WebLogic, GlassFish, and the Java Enterprise Edition platform. Steve has been a key stakeholder and leader in open source and open standards work at Oracle, and in developing and executing on Oracle's strategy in these areas. The acquisition of Sun has brought new opportunities and responsibilities to Oracle, particularly in the Java and open source worlds. Steve and the Java server team remain at the center of the many changes happening at Oracle as a result."
