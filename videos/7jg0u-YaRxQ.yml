description: "DevDay (http://devday.pl),\n20th of September 2013, Kraków\n\nAndreas Håkansson - \"Guerilla Framework Design\"\n\nDescription:\n\"A commonly overlooked part of framework design is the user experience of consuming the framework. Throughout the design of Nancy, we have walked many unconventional paths to make sure the consumer experience is not only good, but awesome! We'll be taking a look at some of the, sometimes, crazy, design decisions we've made any why. You'll be seeing things like heavy use of dynamics, implicit cast operator overloading, auto-discovery of new features, self-composing framework, anonymous conventions and much more. Buckle up!\""
