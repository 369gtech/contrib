description: "Mobile browsers are getting faster and more powerful. Better graphics, sounds and lower latency of interactions offer new mediums for creativity. Instead of considering the next social app for exchanging text and images in some form, what if we played with gestures and symbols? Perhaps even creating things without any practical functions and except for being personally meaningful? These simple apps occupy a world somewhere between plain static text and minimal games. They’re simple interactive experiments. And because they can be shared with just a link – no appstore or downloads necessary- there’s an opportunity to create and spread work rapidly.\n\nIn his talk, Kawandeep shares his own mobile works that are interactive and collaborative; leveraging browser audio, graphics and real-time communication.\n\nKawandeep Virdee\nOpen Web Artist, Embedly\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/pub/kawandeep-virdee/41/363/b08\nhttps://twitter.com/whichlight\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
