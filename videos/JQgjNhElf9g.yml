title: 'YOW! 2020 Online - Kyle Kingsbury - Jepsen 13'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624249412
description: "We trust databases to store our data, but should we? Jepsen combines generative testing techniques with fault injection to verify the safety of distributed databases. We'll learn the basics of distributed systems testing, and show how those techniques found consistency errors in MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis-Raft. Finally, we'll conclude with advice for testing your own systems.\n\nKyle Kingsbury, a.k.a “Aphyr”, is a computer safety researcher working as an independent consultant. He’s the author of the\_Riemann\_monitoring system, the\_Clojure from the Ground Up\_introduction to programming, and the\_Jepsen\_series on distributed systems correctness. He grills databases in the American Midwest.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference visit, www.yowconference.com.au"
