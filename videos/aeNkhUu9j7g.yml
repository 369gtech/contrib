description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nRoberto V. Zicari - Prof. Dott. Ing. Goethe University Frankfurt\n\nABSTRACT\nWhat can be done in the international research and development communities to make sure that some of the most brilliant ideas do have an impact also for social issues?\nIn my talk I will focus exactly at this question: is it possible to conduct research, and/or development work for a corporation and/or a research lab, and at the same time make sure that the potential output of our work has also a social impact?\nI will take take Big Data as a key example. Big Data is clearly of interest to marketers and enterprises a like who wish to offer their customers better services and better quality products. Ultimately their goal is to sell their products/services.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
