description: "What is \"Serverless\"? - Moderated by Kim Bannerman, IBM; Kenny Bastani, Ruben Orduz, Jason Kennedy, & Tyler Britten, IBM, Casey West & Kenny Bastani, Pivotal\n\nWe all have heard these \"Serverless\" or \"NoOps\" buzzwords lately. So, why do these matter? How does it affect Cloud Foundry? Are they affronts or sources of impulse for the platform and community and CF technology? Should CF take a stance or just let the buzz fizz? \n\nThe thrust and motivation of this panel is the increased (mis)use of buzzwords like \"serverless\" and \"NoOps\" floating around and how those tend to be conflated with other technologies like PaaS, CF, and other fast-deployment technologies. \n\nPlease note it's not supposed to be a critique or the merits of the technologies discussed. It's a constructive and educational panel on the nomenclature and messaging and how that impacts Cloud Foundry and the tech community at large.\n\nAbout Kim Bannerman\nKim Bannerman leads the Technical Advocacy & Community team inside the Office of the CTO at IBM Blue Box. Kim has over a decade of experience in the tech industry working with enterprise customers. Prior to joining Blue Box, she was the Director of Evangelism Programs inside the ISV Partner Ecosystem at CenturyLink Cloud.\n\nKim is passionate about open source and the open source community.
