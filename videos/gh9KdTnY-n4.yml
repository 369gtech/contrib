description: "Read the latest JavaScript and Web Development Trends Report from InfoQ https://bit.ly/2wOyIH6. \n\nAs Dylan Schiemann, InfoQ Editor, CEO at SitePen& Co-founder Dojo, points out:\n\"This report doesn’t just look at what’s popular and stop, it takes a really broad look at the many things that JavaScript and web developers might use or think about learning, from front-end and server-side to design systems, IoT, machine learning, mixed reality, and more. It’s really comprehensive in that it, of course, includes the things you’ve heard of, but also adds a lot of innovative things that might not be on someone’s radar. So it’s not a popularity contest but a mix of adoption, maturity, and invention/innovation.\"\n\nRead the latest JavaScript and Web Development Trends Report from InfoQ https://bit.ly/2wOyIH6."
