description: 'So much of the "new shiny" in tech is simply an old idea reimagined for a modern world. One brilliant example is the recent reinvention of functions as cloud-enabled Functions as a Service, (FaaS) or “Serverless” technology. Come and learn about this new approach and what it means for your development process and the applications you build. This session includes advice on when to consider Serverless for your own applications - and when it might not be such a great fit. FaaS is a disruptive change to the way we build software, but it’s an exciting way of reinventing functions for the future.'
