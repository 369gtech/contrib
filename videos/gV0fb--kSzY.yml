title: 'Building the Optimal Architecture for Open Banking'
language: English
recordingDate: 1608067036
description: "This session will provide a lens to better understand the drivers behind Open Banking, and how those drivers ultimately affects the solution architecture. We will cover the evolution of Open Banking architecture across different regions and markets, and discuss how these differing approaches strike a balance between innovation and standardization, goals which are often treated as competing concerns. As we drill-down on the technology, we will discuss how API gateways and microservices fit into a comprehensive architectural solution, and how the emergence of the service mesh provides a foundation for a future-ready, optimal Open Banking architecture. A real-world case study will describe how Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s (CIBC’s) open source, cloud-native API platform, the API Foundation, realizes this optimal architecture, including the milestones we’ve achieved, and the challenges we face along the way. In conclusion, we will provide a framework for establishing an API-driven business culture focused on speed, innovation and client needs.\n\nEVENT / SPEAKER:\nAPIdays London 2019 / Eyal Sivan\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS / ATTRIBUTIONS:\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).
