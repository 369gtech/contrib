title: 'Andrew Fresh - "Open Sourcing DBIx::Class::Events"'
language: English
recordingDate: 1560866802
description: 'While I will explain a bit about what DBIx::Class::Events does and how it works, this talk is primarily about open source contributions being driven by the folks in a company who care about them and how it is up to those people to provide the resources and knowledge to everyone else in order to create an open source culture in the workplace. As far as I know, no request to open source something has ever been denied by my employer, Grant Street Group, and while the company has always had the same "go for it" attitude, the folks writing code are only just starting to gain momentum releasing things publicly. I''ll talk about showing other folks in the company the benefits of sharing code internally, how that exposed the benefits of open-source in general, and how we as a company progressed to getting DBIx::Class::Events onto the CPAN.'
