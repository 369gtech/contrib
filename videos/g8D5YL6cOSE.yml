description: "Support Vector Machines are a very popular type of machine learning model used for classification when you have a small dataset. We'll go through when to use them, how they work, and build our own using numpy. This is part of Week 1 of The Math of Intelligence. This is a re-recorded version of a video I just released a day ago (the audio/video quality is better in this one) \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Classifying_Data_Using_a_Support_Vector_Machine\n\nPlease Subscribe!
