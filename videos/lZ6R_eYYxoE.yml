description: "Hey guys, in this CSS tutorial for beginners, we're going to take a look at selector specificity (I hate pronouncing that word, even though I'm a ninja!). Essentially, this translates as how specific and how much weight your CSS selector has when it comes to dealing with conflicts. It's a really important subject that I suggest you guys master.
