recordingDate: 1581358599
description: "Deep Learning is the the most exciting subfield of Artificial Intelligence, yet the necessary hardware costs keep many people from participating in its research and development. I wanted to see just how cheap a deep learning PC could be built for in 2020, so I did some research and put together a deep learning PC build containing brand new parts that comes out to about 450 US dollars. I chose NewEgg for the parts because it has a global shipping policy, deep learning belongs to the world not just the United States. In this episode, I’m going to walk you through what the deep learning stack looks like (CUDA, Jupyter, PyTorch, etc.) , why i chose the various hardware components, and then I’ll show you how to setup the full deep learning software stack on your PC.
