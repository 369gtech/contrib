title: 'Pydata Berlin April 2021: How to detect silent failures in ML models'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620422216
description: "ML models fail silently. So how do we detect and address these failures? In this talk, I'll discuss types of failures in operational ML, and ways to detect and address them.\nWe'll cover the taxonomy of failures based on use cases, data, characteristics of systems they interact with, and human involvement. You'll learn the tools (both statistical and algorithmic) used in dealing with these failures, their applications, and their limits.\n\n\nWojtek Kuberski is a co-founder of NannyML, a startup for monitoring ML models in production. He holds a Master's Degree in AI. He previously founded and grew an AI consultancy. He likes tennis, chess and food.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
