description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nNetwork Service Mesh (NSM) is a community-driven CNCF Sandbox project that is rapidly gaining momentum because of its ability to simplify connectivity between workloads, independent of where they are running. It extends an IP reachability domain to workloads running in multiple clusters, legacy environments, on-premises, or in a public cloud, communicating with the protocols they are currently using.\n\nNSM does this at the granularity of individual workloads. Your workloads have connectivity to just the workloads they need – nothing more, nothing less. NSM brings the useful features of a Service Mesh from the lofty heights of HTTP all the way down to IP itself. Applications and Application Service Meshes, such as Istio, run unaltered on top, leaving the hybrid/multicloud IP connectivity to NSM.\n\nView this webinar to get an introduction to what NSM is all about, how it works, and see a demo of NSM in action!\n\nPresentation Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aG56Oqv7I1JpNsY4VPNpyoKppT-BRyOdYE43fr9ylNs/edit?usp=sharing"
