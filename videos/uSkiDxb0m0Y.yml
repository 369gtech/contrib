description: "Ближайшая конференция — HolyJS 2020 Piter\n22-25 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/hollyJS2020\n\n\n\n\n. Every year, Ecma’s TC39 (technical committee 39) releases a rolling specification with new language features added to JavaScript. But how does a feature go from an idea to a cross-browser implementation?\n\nIn this talk, we join the Nullish Coalescing operator on it’s journey through the TC39 process, and we will dive into its implementation in SpiderMonkey. You will come away from the talk knowing about the process from start to finish."
