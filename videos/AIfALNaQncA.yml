description: "Talk recording from JSNation Live 2020, the biggest JavaScript conference in the cloud: https://live.jsnation.com\n\n# Javascript Tooling - The Evolution and Future of JS & Front-end Build Tools\n\nI can tell at least that in 3 years, JavaScript will gain more the status of a VM and lose the status of a language. Already today, not many people use raw JavaScript. You usually have some transpilation, at least e.g. Babel. In the future, Web Assembly will enable more innovation in that regards, and existing transpiling languages like Elm, TypeScript, PureScript will continue to improve.\n\nIn this talk, I'll go through the Evolution of JavaScript Tooling and frontend build tools, Javascript itself and the future of them all.\n\nAlso, Babel and other build tools, what they might most likely be in the future. Also, I'll talk about javascript itself as a language, it's present and it's future."
