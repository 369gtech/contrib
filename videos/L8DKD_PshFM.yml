description: 'Once upon a time there were people who worked on a thing.. but they did in in separate rooms, with different tools and they spoke different languages and thought they used different brain hemispheres. One group called the other smart and the other group called the other creative.. and sometimes they called themselves these different things. After many years of their passing back and forth their work and much confusion about what they were building they developed technology and processes that helped them work together in a more integrated fashion. Eventually they moved into the same rooms, used some of the same tools and even learned to speak the same language! They even started to think less about their brain hemispheres and gained a clearer picture of what they were trying to build! Yes, today designers and developers are working together in Clojure in ways that are really effective and fun! Let’s go back in time and look at where we’ve been with all the crazy broken things we’ve endured, explored. Then arrive back to the here and now with full-stack Clojure where people party and profit.'
