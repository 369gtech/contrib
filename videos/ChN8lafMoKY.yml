recordingDate: 1539019357
description: "In fewer than 50 years we have seen massive changes in the classroom. From chalkboards to videotapes, the introduction of computers to interactive whiteboards, and now the implementation of Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence. But how much learning value can AR & AI actually offer students beyond the “WOW factor”? Are we just rehashing old teaching methodologies and redressing them up with the latest technology? Or should we be exploiting AR & AI’s potential as a tool rather than just another medium? Additionally, by integrating 21st-century skills and gamification into our design thinking, we can push the potential of educational applications to the limits! Richard Lewington explores these topics and discusses what we should be doing about them.\n\nDevConf 2018 (http://devconf.pl)\n26-28 September 2018"
