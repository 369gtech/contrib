description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015\nSpeaker: Jeff Brown, OCI Web\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/microservice-architecture-with-grails-3\nFor some web applications it does not make sense to have 1 monolithing process which handles all of the requirements of the application. More and more often Grails is showing up in microservice architectures where instead of building 1 monolithing web application which is responsible for all of the pieces of the application puzzle, microservice applications are being assembled which collectively solve the requirements of the larger application. Grails is very well suited for this type of architecture. A microservice based architecture can result in applications which are easier to build, easier to test, easier to extend and are easier to adapt to changing business requirements."
