description: "Code is Here: http://goo.gl/4xqo3\n\nBest Design Patterns Book : http://goo.gl/W0wyie\n\nWelcome to may Facade Design Pattern Tutorial! The Facade pattern is extremely easy to understand. Chances are you have used it already and just didn't know it.\n\nThe Facade pattern basically says that you should simplify your methods so that much of what is done is in the background. In technical terms you should decouple the client from the sub components needed to perform an operation.\n\nAll of the code that I link to above will fill you in on anything you don't catch in the video."
