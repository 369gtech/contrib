title: '"Keynote: Who cares about Democracy?" - A/Prof Vanessa Teague (LCA 2020)'
recordingDate: 1579151625
description: "A/Prof Vanessa Teague\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/216/\n\nI'll begin with analysis of the Swiss e-voting system and its flawed proofs, then explain why the NSW  iVote system is even worse.  Next, I'll discuss the world's first pilot Risk-Limiting Audit of a preferential election, in San Francisco, and compare it to the completely non-existent auditing strategy for our Senate elections.\r\n\r\nAustralia, once a leader in genuine democratic innovation, lags woefully behind the rest of the world in applying basic standards of privacy, transparency and security to electronic electoral processes.  So why is it so bad, and what can we do about it?\r\n\r\nThis talk includes joint work with Michelle Blom, Andrew Conway, Chris Culnane, Sarah Jamie Lewis, Olivier Periera, Philip Stark and Peter Stuckey.\r\n\r\nI'll conclude with some speculative ideas about improving democratic participation between elections - suggestions welcome.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
