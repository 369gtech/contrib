description: "How do you identify the weakest links in your IoT network? How do we justify cost and benefits of security mitigation measures in a digital manufacturing plant?\n\nIn this talk, we will share about our innovative approach to quantitatively measure the vulnerability and damage of the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of data.\n\nOur work based on critical infrastructures is applicable to IoT and SCADA networks.  Manufacturing enterprises will be able to fine tune their cyber security implementations and spending, and reduce under or over protection.  Our data-driven approach to conceptualise and develop the essential metrics, namely, Damage Index (DI) and Vulnerability Index (VI) that quantify the extent of damage an IoT or Manufacturing networks due to a cyber attack.  We will also share a use case of computing the metrics for an academic lab that undertakes commercial manufacturing projects in Singapore is demonstrated.  This work builds a strong foundation for development of an adaptive cyber security architecture with optimal use of IT resources for manufacturing enterprises.\n\n===\n\nSimon ENG is a Manager in NYP School of Engineering. His research focuses on cyber security, Domain Name System (DNS), network security and cyber-physical security. He is the sole inventor for 3 patents in the cyber security domain with core expertise in the domain for more than 10 years. He is the team lead for various collaboration projects with industry partners and is also actively involved in evangelising STEM education to community and Secondary School students.\n\n---\n\nLIM Eng Woei is a Development Engineer (DE) in digital manufacturing at Centre for Digital and Precision Engineering at NYP. He received his First Class Honours Master’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College London in 2017. He is a young and passionate engineer who is keen to explore innovative ways in digital transformation of the manufacturing sector. He has led several digital transformation projects including the development of ‘SMART Tool Management System’ and ‘Unmanned Machine Coolant Monitoring System’ as retrofits to convert legacy shopfloors into smart shopfloors. He is currently involved in the investigating cyber security solutions for the manufacturing sector."
