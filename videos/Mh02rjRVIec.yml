It touches on which parts of the app were straightforward to build with Flutter, which aspects presented challenges, and the rationale for important design decisions such as which state management approach to take and how to handle deserialization of data from the VoxxedDays API.\n\nAndrew Brogdon From Google\nAndrew is an engineer on the developer relations team for Flutter, Google's multiplatform SDK for building native apps.\n\nMatt Sullivan From Google\nMatt leads Flutter's developer relations from Googleâ€™s Mountain View campus.
