description: "The Clojure community is filled with really smart people, with great ideas writing very few tutorials and less documentation. At times it can be quite intimidating and discouraging. This talk is about how you can build your skill and confidence as a Clojure developer. As well as my journey from Pixie, to Hylang and eventually Clojure.\n\nWe’ll unpack how build your own path to Clojure confidence as well as some of the things I’ve learnt in my journey from being a lousy, lazy lisper to coding confidently to writing Clojure for the financial sector. It’s gonna be a goodie. All skill levels welcome. See you there!"
