title: 'A Spring Data’s Guide to Persistence'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632325513
description: "Seconds before coding yet another lookup query, our hero is plucked off his office chair and put into this persistence spaceship where he meets his good friend Spring Data, a library aiming to ease the pain of every day data access, who has been around for more than 10 years.\n \n Together, we’ll begin a journey—aided by a bunch of features like CRUD operations, query derivation, and SQL and NoSQL support—towards developer happiness. \n \n Is this magic? Where is my finder method? When to use named queries? For all the answers, register to this session or stick your thumb up at start.spring.io\n\nChristoph Strobl, Spring Data Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/a-spring-datas-guide-to-persistence"
