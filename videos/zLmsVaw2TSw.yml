description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nDevOps Patterns and Antipatterns for Continuous Software Updates - Kat Cosgrove, JFrog \n\nSo, you want to update the software for your user, be it the nodes in your K8s cluster, a browser on user’s desktop, an app in user’s smartphone or even a user’s car. What can possibly go wrong?  In this talk, we’ll analyze real-world software update failures and how multiple DevOps patterns, that fit a variety of scenarios, could have saved the developers. Manually making sure that everything works before sending update and expecting the user to do acceptance tests before they update is most definitely not on the list of such patterns.  Join us for some awesome and scary continuous update horror stories and some obvious (and some not so obvious) proven ideas for improvement and best practices you can start following tomorrow.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zelk"
