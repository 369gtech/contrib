description: "Agile Tour Vilnius 2020. The New Normal.\n\nWhat was the decision you struggled more with? Are you currently feeling stuck with any decision? What are the variables you take into account when taking decisions? Have you ever thought your answer might be in a lunch box? In this talk I want to share with you what Bentoism is: a (convenient and coherent) way for decision making, allowing you to think of decisions in a full spectrum of your self-interest.\nObjectives:\n- practicing decision making in an anti-reductionist approach;\n- practicing the moral courage needed to reflect\n- identifying how decisions unfold in an individual and collective perspective and in different time frames;\n- getting in touch with values for a more generous future;\n- learning a possible way to achieve value- coherent decisions"
