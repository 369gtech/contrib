description: "PyData LA 2018 \n\nTogether we live code (in a RISE slideshow) a fully-connected neural net from scratch via numpy, initially training it using a for-loop to demonstrate core concepts, and finally codifying it as a Scikit-learn classifier with which one can fit & predict on one’s own data. To close, I walk through a toy example which logistic regression can’t properly classify, but which our NN can.\n\n---\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
