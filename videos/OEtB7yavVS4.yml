description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Amsterdam 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOams\nhttp://gotoams.nl\n\nHeather Gray - Assistant Professor of Physics at UC Berkeley\n\nABSTRACT\nParticle physics seeks to answer fundamental questions by studying tiny particles produced by enormous machines like the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva Switzerland. I will provide a short introduction to key questions in particle physics, highlight some of the key challenges that we are facing and illustrate how novel ideas from computing, such as quantum computing, might [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/825\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOamst\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#QuantumComputing #QuantumPhysics #physics #LHC #CERN"
