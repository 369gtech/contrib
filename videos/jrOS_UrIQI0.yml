description: 'https://developer.oracle.com/code/online | Owen Cliffe, Thom Leggett: Building an app using serverless technology brings many benefits: seamless scaling, infrastructure abstraction, and lower costs. But there are compromises tooâ€”splitting your app up into many tiny functions makes it difficult to reason about your app as a whole. Fault handling and reliability are a real challenge in this environment. In this session, we will build a fault-tolerant serverless app on the Fn platform by showing how the Fn Flow system can apply the saga pattern. First we will discuss the need for an external orchestration system such as Fn Flow as well as why we believe that our approach with Fn Flow is superior to previous attempts to solve this problem. Then we will develop a serverless travel agency booking system that will demonstrate some complex fault-tolerant behavior. We will do all this in Java from the comfort of our own IDE while keeping the code relatively simple and in one place. Finally, we will show how this approach enables us to encapsulate and reuse complex distributed programming patterns, saving us time and money.'
