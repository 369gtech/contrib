title: 'Hash Maps: more room at the bottom - Peter Schuck'
recordingDate: 1460847372
description: 'Since it''s invention the Hash Array Mapped Trie has grown to become the defacto Immutable Hash Map implementation. However there is still room for big improvements with this central data structure. It''s possible to get speedups of 100% for iteration and equality checking. Great, more complex algorithms and bit twiddling, you say. Balderdash! We make some simplifications to the underlying data structure making the operations on it simpler and faster.'
