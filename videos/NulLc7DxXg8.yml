description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nMulticloud Vitess over Network Service Mesh - Tim Swanson, Cisco & John Watson, PlanetScale \n\nThis talk will describe using Network Service Mesh to create a private L3 network between Kubernetes clusters in different cloud providers to seamlessly deploy multiple Vitess cells across them. We will describe a multicloud Vitess use case and walk through the deployment details, highlighting the networking requirements in the process. We will describe NSM’s inter-domain feature and multicloud capabilities and a network service which fulfills the Vitess multicloud networking requirements by dynamically forming a common private L3 routing domain to interconnect specific workloads hosted in multiple clouds.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZejK"
