description: 'We all have used design pattern in Java for decades. Most of those patterns were influenced by the capability of the language. The capability of the language, however, got better with Java 8. With lambdas, we will use some design patterns differently than before. There are other design patterns that we can use now that were beyond reasonable reach before.
