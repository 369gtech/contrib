description: "The enterprise change process is filled with tickets, approvals and all forms of non-deterministic change review and time wasting gates that dominate the ITSM landscape. Cloud Foundry has thrown a monkey wrench into ITSM in the form of high velocity change and nose diving lead time via CI/CD pipelines. Our VP of Continuous Delivery, Kyle Campos, will talk about how we at Smarsh are raising the quality and security bars of the platform through infrastructure and application CI/CD pipelines and how automation can serve the ITSM overlords through higher levels of determinism.\nSpeaker: Kyle Campos, VP of Continuous Delivery, Smars\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
