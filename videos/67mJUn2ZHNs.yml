description: "In this talk, Nandini and Malini will share some of the Do’s and Don’ts from their experiences working on the cloud native transformation of Dell.com using Spring Boot, REST, microservice architecture, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Pivotal's modern approach to software development. Dell.com has been the pioneer in the e-commerce world for computers, with its unique \"build-to-order\" or \"configure to order\" approach to manufacture and deliver individual PCs, configured to customer specifications. From generating $1 million in sales per day 6 months into its launch in 1996, this legacy giant now transacts multi-million dollars per day globally. Legacy system migration has many traps, but like all traps - if you know they are there - they can be avoided or even turned into an advantage. Join this session for practical advice, as well as the high-level strategy that has worked for them - they could be useful shortcuts for you in the future when trying to solve a similar problem.\n\nSpeakers:\nNandini Agarwal\nSoftware Engineer II, Dell EMC\n\nMalini Bhattacharjee\nSr Advisor, Product Management, Dell EMC\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
