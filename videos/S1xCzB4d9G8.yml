description: "Get the code: http://goo.gl/5I88E\n\nIn this video I continue making a Java Asteroids game while teaching about OOP design principles. In previous videos I showed how to make a Java UML class diagram and then we turned the UML class diagram into a class.\n\nHere I finish up the class so that you can now fly your ship in any direction. You'll also be able to keep it on the game board and use life like velocity that accelerates.\n\nAll of the code is  heavily commented to help you learn."
