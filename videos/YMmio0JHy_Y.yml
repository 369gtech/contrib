description: "A Python implementation in Rust?\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-26 - Kilsyth]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Windel Bouwman\n\nRust is a fairly new programming language aimed as a competitor of C.\nThere are already attempts to write extension modules in rust and load\nthem into CPython. A whole new approach would be to re-implement the Python\nlanguage in rust.\n\nThis is what the rspython project is about: implementing\na python interpreter in rust. Rust already has many features such as vectors,\nhashmaps and strings as unicode. There also exist already modules for\nregular expressions and dealing with files, so a lot can be re-used in\nthis area.\n\nDuring this talk we will dive into rust and python and the design of\nthe rspython. We will present some challenges and opportunities. Also\nwe will show the current state of this project in a demo.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
