description: 'When faced with the challenge to procedurally generate downhill mountain bike tracks for our new game ''Descenders'', an approach based on randomness and noise was not enough. In order to create varied, interesting and challenging levels it was necessary to translate the game''s design goals into an algorithm, basically teaching the computer how it should design. We will take a look at how a level in Descenders is generated from scratch, and what''s going on under the hood during every step of this process.'
