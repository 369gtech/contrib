title: 'Simulating noisy quantum devices with QuTiP'

recordingDate: 1598947422
description: "by Boxi Li\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UA2.118/quantum_qutip.webm\n\nSimulation is a powerful tool to understand quantum phenomena. The simulation of quantum circuits is usually achieved by gate matrix product, such as in Qiskit and ProjectQ. Thanks to the Lindblad master equation solver, QuTiP is developing a simulator that simulates quantum circuits at the level of the real quantum evolution happening in your quantum device. This framework offers pulse-level control and a flexible way of noise simulation. Upon it, we are going to define different back-ends for different physics systems such as Cavity QED, Ion trap or Superconducting system. The simulator could help to improve your quantum device, study the effect of noise and create noise mitigation scheme.\n\nRoom: UA2.118 (Henriot)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 15:00:00"
