title: 'Serverless Kotlin with App Engine by Ludovic Champenois and  …amonn McManus'

description: "After years of development of a new security sandbox, App Engine Standard now supports Java 8 and practically all of the JVM languages that run atop of standard OpenJDK 8. In the new sandbox environment, we removed the Java security sandbox and the classes whitelist; this allows developers to use all features in the JVM and still be protected within a secure environment.\n\nApp Engine can now support powerful frameworks like Spring Boot, Dropwizard with all the Java 8 language features. Best of all, you can run any JVM languages, including Groovy & Kotlin.\n\nWe'll show you how to use Kotlin end-to-end to build from an Android mobile client and also the backend with Kotlin & Spring Boot that can be quickly deployed and capable of scaling from 0 to infinity.\n\n# …amonn McManus\n…amonn McManus is a member of Google's App Engine Java Runtimes team.
