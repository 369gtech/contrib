title: 'The ClojureScript Compiler - A Look Behind the Curtains - Maria Geller'
recordingDate: 1447800360
description: "Over the past years, development for the ClojureScript compiler has moved at a fast pace and its community is growing continuously. It's a fun community which I enjoyed to be a part of over the past months through my Google Summer of Code project. In this talk I will give an overview of the moving parts of the ClojureScript compiler, dive into some details about the compilation process itself with a hands-on example and will provide you with some pointers on how you could start contributing to the compiler.\n\nAbout the speaker: Maria is a Clojure/ClojureScript developer working at LiveOps. She is also currently an online student at Georgia Tech studying towards her master's degree in Computer Science. Other than programming, she enjoys running, spending time with her husband and growing the programming community in Auckland by organizing workshops, such as RailsGirls and ClojureBridge."
