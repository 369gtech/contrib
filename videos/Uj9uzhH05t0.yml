description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nInherently infrastructure and technology agnostic, Kubernetes can run on any Linux machine on any infrastructure and is compatible with any cloud-native tooling. There are numerous Kubernetes solutions on the market, each with their own Kubernetes 'flavor' potentially impacting Kubernetesâ€™ openness and flexibility. To retain these core abilities, it's helpful to shift the focus from seeing Kubernetes purely as a container orchestrator to leveraging it as an infrastructure abstraction. This will allow developers to leverage any Kubernetes compatible stack across any infrastructure. Not only does this make your stack a lot more portable, but it also adds flexibility along with building a much needed future-ready architecture. Join this webinar to learn how a layered architectural approach will future proof your Kubernetes strategy."
