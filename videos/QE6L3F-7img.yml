recordingDate: 1499244436
description: "Software should just work! Suave gives you HTTP super powers by letting YOU decide how you want your API to respond. Libraries should be competent at what they do and then get out of your way.\n\nIn this talk I'll show you how to program F# with Suave to create smooth HTTP APIs from scratch and how to leverage functional composition and functional programming in a sweet symphony to quickly and effortlessly deploy a service. We'll go behind the scenes and discover the thought patterns behind the hugely popular suave.io web server and web library written in all F#.\n\nHenrik has programmed for the web since the late nineties; take this opportunity to learn about how to write server-side software for the web by a true web development expert and coauthor of the Suave web server, a cross-platform, functional-first library for building HTTP APIs."
