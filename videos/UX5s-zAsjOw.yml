description: "How does a small Australian email company like Fastmail compete with such dominant players like Google or Office 365 or Apple who have the clout and market presence to do what they like, forcing everyone else to conform to their whims?\n\nCome and hear a tale of David vs many Goliaths. Learn why we decided to build a new email standard - JMAP - and the process of getting that turned into an RFC. You'll hear about the pitfalls and joys of navigating the standards body IETF to get the standard ratified, and the challenges we still have ahead.\n\nMaybe you, too, have something you'd like to turn into a standard?\n\nNicola serves as Fastmail's Chief of Staff, providing executive-level oversight for cross-functional teams and projects. Her professional background spans the full range of technical experience as she has been a programmer, project manager, technical writer, tester, support manager and an open source community manager. Nicola is passionate about literacy for all ages and works part time at her kids' school library.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
