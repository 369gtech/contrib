title: 'Mob Programming, A Whole Team Approach -  Woody Zuill'
language: English
recordingDate: 1489738263
description: "Mob Programming is a development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and on the same computer. It is a whole-team approach to doing all the work the team does including designing, coding, testing, and working with the customers, users and other stakeholders.\nThis is an evolutionary step beyond pair programming, and accentuates face-to-face communication, team alignment, collaboration, and self-organizing team concepts of the Agile Software Developmentre. Mob Programming can be a highly effective approach.\n\nPlease join me as I share how the concept got started, the benefits, techniques we use, and some of the problems we've faced."
