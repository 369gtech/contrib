description: "Video with transcript included: https://bit.ly/2WjfkfE \n\nManuel Pais discusses how many organizations see Kubernetes as “the” platform, rather than just a technical foundation for a true internal platform. Successful Kubernetes adoption requires thinking about what a platform really means and learning which team structures and interactions work well. And evolve them over time.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon London 2020: http://bit.ly/2VfRldq\n \nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQ’s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\n#Kubernetes #Containers #Platforms"
