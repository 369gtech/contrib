title: 'TvExperience.levelUp() - Thomas Pettersen, Thomas Pronstad'
recordingDate: 1574093685
description: 'For years Get, one of the largest TV providers in Norway, has run traditional third party software on proprietary platforms for their TV boxes installed in half a million homes. Now we decided to make it ourselves from scratch, based on Android TV. This is the story of how we used Android TV as a platform, design the user experience from the ground up, integrated deeply into the system, collaborated with hardware engineers to provide us with sufficient security and capabilities, and took a whole new step towards a modern TV experience.'
