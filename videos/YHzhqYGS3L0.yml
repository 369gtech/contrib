description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Salih Guler, Klar.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=176462\n\nFrom the day that it's announced, Flutter is attracting so many developers from different backgrounds. It gives the developers a chance to develop an app from a single codebase and deploy it for Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web. But not everyone is in the position to abandon an existing codebase and start from scratch - luckily Flutter got you covered even if you just want to extend your existing application with cool Flutter features.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will have a look at how you can add Flutter to your ongoing iOS and Android applications by showing a real-life example app with thousands of users and, we will talk about how you can rewrite your existing applications step by step with Flutter."
