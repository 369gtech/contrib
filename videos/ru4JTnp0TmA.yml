description: "From the W3C spec (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/VRML/):\n\n\"\"\"VRML allows to create \"virtual worlds\" networked via the Internet and hyperlinked with the World Wide Web.\"\"\"\n\nThe year is 1995. The place... *cyberspace*.\n\nThe exciting new technology Virtual Reality Modeling Language, or VRML for short, is poised to change the way we surf the information superhighway forever. Rather than scrolling through a boring old document, web surfers would now have the ability to literally navigate the information superhighway to virtual worlds of their own creation.\n\nThese worlds mostly consist of spinning cubes.\n\nThis talk will also touch on the virtual reality file system navigator as seen in Jurassic Park."
