description: "Join us for our next conference: https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\nAs a developer you are used to certain constants in your life such as battling with a compiler/interpreter or debugging a production issue only to discover a single, tiny error. You know, for certain, there will always be more problems to solve, usually moving bits from one system to another regardless of which language, or product you work with.\n\nYour transition to a Tech Lead will surprise you as you discover new and different constants for the first time. In this talk, we will explore the Constant Life of a Tech Lead where you will hear advice, learn strategies and stories to prepare with these new constants.\n\nAbout Patrick Kua\n\nPatrick is a Principal Technical Consultant at ThoughtWorks who is normally found leading development teams. He is a conference speaker and author of The Retrospective Handbook and Talking with Tech Leads and is passionate about bringing a balanced focus on people, organisation and technology."
