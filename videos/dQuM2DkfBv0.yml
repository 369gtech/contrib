In this talk we'll look at some of the amazing opportunities that await Spring and Microsoft Azure users. We'll begin our journey by looking at Azure Spring Cloud, the platform-as-a-service offering jointly developed and delivered by Microsoft and VMWare and built upon Azure Kubernetes. If you were looking for an easy, turn-key mechanism to get Spring-based applications up-and-running on Azure, then this the way to go. Then, we'll introduce Spring Cloud for Azure, the Spring Boot- and Spring Cloud-ready integrations and APIs that make connecting your applications with Azure-managed infrastructure an absolute breeze.\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/270985596/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/C1Tyh/"
