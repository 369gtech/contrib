description: "Like many design patterns, the Observer in Python is different. A lot has been written about patterns since the turn of the century, for languages like Java, C++, C# and PHP. Curiously, though, much of that doesn't exactly apply to Python - or, at least, applies in a different way. Dynamic typing, functions as first-class objects, and some other additions to the object model all mean design patterns just work differently in this language. \n\n++++Resources++++\nWrite-up and code examples: \nhttps://newcircle.com/observer-tut\n\nAdvanced Python Newsletter: \nhttp://migrateup.com/\n\nPython Training from NewCircle: \nhttps://newcircle.com/category/python"
