description: "This talk by Paweł Królikowski describes how Uber tries to be reliable. With an explosive growth from a few to thousands of microservices there’s a few things they did right, but also a lot of things they had to learn the hard way. He starts with incident prevention: integration testing, load testing, chaos testing, blackbox testing, rollout strategies. He then follows with incident response: on-call, monitoring, alerting, mitigation strategies and touches briefly on benefits of using common frameworks in reliability engineering.\n\nThe global dev community meets at WeAreDevelopers, an event dubbed by many as the “Woodstock of Developers”. The WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 brought together 8,000 techies from 70 countries for 72-hours of pure dev-fun.\n\nVisit the largest developer playground in Europe!\nhttps://www.wearedevelopers.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wearedevelopers\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_wearedevelopers/\n\n#WeAreDevs\n\n©2018, WeAreDevelopers"
