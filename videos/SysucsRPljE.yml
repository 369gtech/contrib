description: "\"Containers are the new ZIP format to distribute software\" is a fitting description of today's development world. However, it is not always that easy and this talk highlights the development of Elastic's container strategy over time:\n\n* Docker images: A new distribution model.\n* Docker Compose: Local demos and a little more.\n* Helm Chart: Going from demo to production with maximum flexibility.\n* Kubernetes Operator: Full control with upgrades, scaling, and operational best practices.\n\nBesides the strategy we are also discussing specific technical details and hurdles that appeared during the development. Or why the future will be a combination of Helm Chart and Operator (for now).\n-----\n\nhttps://wearedevelopers.com/live\nConnect to WeAreDevelopers Live, the platform where you can see featured developers working and showcasing live.
