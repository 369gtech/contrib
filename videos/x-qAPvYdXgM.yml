AND IF SO, WHY? CONSIDERATIONS FROM MEDIA ARCHAEOLOGY\nby Frieder Nake\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nGraphics\nLanguages\nMedia\n\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced\n\nABSTRACT\nOf course, calculating machines do not like to draw. In fact, they will just not do it. I am a machine, they will say, a machine for calculations. That's exactly what I am supposed to do and that, therefore, I will do with utmost precision, reliable and correct. But there was a time when the calculating machine still had to be told what to do when its human master requested that a line was to be drawn, straight or circular. And many lines in many styles, and areas in brilliant colors. In such a way these visual object were supposed to appear an paper that galleries and museums, through their directors, would say, that's marvellous and rather surprising, and causing a lot of new thinking, but we exhibit that stuff anyway. And we don't hesitate too much and even call it art if it is nice enough.\n \nThe years, when this happened, were the early 1960s. Today, nobody can imagine that there was a time when only symbols and numbers went through the narrow channels into and out from computers, no icons and no visuals, just nothing of this kind. The early 1960s became the time when digital media start emerging around an entirely new world of using (or mis-using?) computers. They are the times, when the machine computer mutates into a medium. A fascinating medium. The semiotic engine! â€“ This contribution will offer a bit of media archaeology of the time. The perspective must, of course, be that of languages for programming. Therefore, it will include a remark on an algebra-oriented graphics language, and a few early language constructs for graphics.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/frieder-nake/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - FRIEDER NAKE\nPioneer of algorithmic art, first exhibition in 1965\n\nFrieder is a mathematician by training and a computer scientist by work who happened to become a pioneer of algorithmic art by having had the first exhibition of his works in 1965. Since then, he has had many more, has published a lot, taught a lot, and is still continuing to do so.\n\nMore on Frieder Nake: http://codesync.global/speaker/frieder-nake/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
