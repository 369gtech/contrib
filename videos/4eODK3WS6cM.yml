title: 'ScreenPlay: the next stage in automated acceptance testing by John Smart/Jan Molak'
language: English
recordingDate: 1478870251
description: "With ScreenPlay, writing clean, maintainable automated acceptance tests becomes easy even for testers who are relatively new to automated testing.\n\nLearn how to write robust and articulate tests using the Screenplay Pattern, an innovative approach to writing BDD-style automated acceptance tests that are easier to understand, easier to extend and easier to maintain. You will also witness a demonstration of these principles in action, with live coding of Serenity BDD automated tests, and see how Serenity BDD turns the Screenplay tests into living documentation.\n\nWhile the demonstration will be in Java and will use the open source Serenity BDD library, the Screenplay pattern can be applied to any language or framework.\n\n[BIC-3525]"
