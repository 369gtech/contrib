description: "BlockSci: Design and applications of a blockchain analysis platform\n\nHarry Kalodner, Malte MÃ¶ser, and Kevin Lee, Princeton University; Steven Goldfeder, Cornell Tech; Martin Plattner, University of Innsbruck; Alishah Chator, Johns Hopkins University; Arvind Narayanan, Princeton University\n\nAnalysis of blockchain data is useful for both scientific research and commercial applications. We present BlockSci, an open-source software platform for blockchain analysis. BlockSci is versatile in its support for different blockchains and analysis tasks. It incorporates an in-memory, analytical (rather than transactional) database, making it orders of magnitudes faster than using general-purpose graph databases. We describe BlockSci's design and present four analyses that illustrate its capabilities, shedding light on the security, privacy, and economics of cryptocurrencies.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/technical-sessions"
