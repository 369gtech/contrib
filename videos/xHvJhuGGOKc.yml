title: 'HBase Coprocessors - Deploy shared functionality directly on the cluster'
recordingDate: 1322685479
description: "The newly added feature of Coprocessors within HBase allows the application designer to move functionality closer to where the data resides. While this sounds like Stored Procedures as known in the RDBMS realm, they have a different set of properties. The distributed nature of HBase adds to the complexity of their implementation, but the client side API allows for an easy, transparent access to their functionality across many servers. This session explains the concepts behind coprocessors and uses examples to show how they can be used to implement data side extensions to the application code.\n\nAbout Lars George:\n\nLars George has been involved with HBase since 2007, and became a full HBase committer in 2009. He has spoken at various Hadoop User Group meetings, as well as large conferences such as FOSDEM in Brussels. He also started the Munich OpenHUG meetings. He now works for Cloudera to support Hadoop and HBase in and around Europe through technical support, consulting work, and training."
