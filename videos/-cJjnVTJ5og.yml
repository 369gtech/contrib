David Fowler and Damian Edwards will show you why your app isn't scaling and gives you the DOs and the DON'Ts of making big apps do big things in ASP.NET Core.\n\nWe'll talk about async, parallelism, and appropriate use of multiple threads. Are you misusing some APIs and inadvertently crashing your apps? \n\nDavid Fowler and Damian Edwards, will show you the errors of your ways and make sense out of these techniques and when they're useful - or when they should be avoided.\n\nThis will be a demo-heavy and highly technical session.\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
