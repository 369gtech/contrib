description: "Jared Reimer, CTO at Cascadeo - ChefConf 2017\n\nCascadeo will demonstrate how they use Chef to deploy and manage operational infrastructure in multi-cloud environments for their managed services customers. Chef-driven automation deploys, configures, populates inventory, and validates the telemetry application stack in a distant customer-owned cloud account. Our engineers will demonstrate visualization and reporting based on this data: tickets, device performance graphs, etc. as well as connectivity to services like Slack and PagerDuty for notification and escalation. Companies struggling with operational, monitoring, performance and analytics challenges will find this presentation particularly engaging, as will individuals interested in self-healing distributed systems at scale."
