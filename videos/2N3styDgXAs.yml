description: 'Jhon and Dave from the Roaring Elephant Podcast http://www.roaringelephant.org talk about the state of the world of big data and advanced analytics, across a variety of topics like security, adoption, cloud, cybersecurity and more. Also expect audience participation and the typical Roaring Elephant style of interaction, discussion, open questions, debate and commentary. We won’t always agree but we do always enjoy what we do! There will be plenty of time for Q&A as well, so whether it’s questions about Big Data in general, or more specific topic areas we’ll answer anything as best as we can.'
