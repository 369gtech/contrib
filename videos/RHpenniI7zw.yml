description: "Distributed Tracing in Serverless Systems - Nitzan Shapira, Epsagon \n\nServerless and FaaS naturally fit microservices architectures. Observability of such systems is very complicated, since each microservice is separated and working asynchronously from the others. Distributed tracing is a key approach to understand such systems. In serverless, there are new challenges and opportunities which make distributed tracing a very interesting and useful technique for high observability.    I will go quickly over the history of tracing and the popular tools. I will focus on the key differences between observability using distributed tracing in generic microservices environments compared to serverless. Examples from the popular cloud vendors will be shown, including full visualization of asynchronous transactions in a highly distributed serverless system, and detecting business flows across multiple asynchronous communication resources (e.g. SNS, Kinesis, and more). \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrXp"
