title: 'Damian Dulisz — Vue.js: Forms & validations in the composition age'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1605876267
description: "Ближайшая конференция — HolyJS 2020 Moscow\n25-28 ноября, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://holyjs-moscow.ru/\n\n. In this talk we will explore how to approach one of the most common problems in web apps – forms and form validations. With the incoming release of Vue.js 3.0 the ecosystem of supporting libraries is meant to change and embrace new possibilities. We will be looking closer at two of them, one being Vuelidate, as well as how we can build an ecosystem around those libraries that could make working with forms a breeze."
