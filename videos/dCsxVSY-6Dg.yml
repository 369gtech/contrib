title: 'Web Components as micro apps - Craig West - NDC London 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1624875588
description: "Web Components are custom HTML Elements and are part of the browser specification\n\nJust like regular HTML tags, they can be used on any HTML platform and be part of any build process.\n\nWeb Components allow applications to be built using a range of frameworks that are 'exported' as Web Components.\n\nWeb Components are true micro-services and micro-apps.\n\nIn this workshop, we use a sSTEP BY STEP process to build a range of Web Components that focus on data-driven APIs enabling functionality and content to be deployed in any app or website.\n\nThe first part of the workshop focuses on the core theory of Web Components.\n\nIn the second part we build highly functional Web Components that connect to a back end database and have AJAX forms, Lazy Loading techniques, authentication and the use of IndexedDB to enable 'instant' and offline pages.\n\nAlthough not covered in this workshop, we will add a service worker and manifest file to create an installable PWA."
