title: 'CON2711   Java 8   Unleashing Lambdas by Executing in a Distributed System'
language: English
recordingDate: 1449807930
description: "Lambdas are a cornerstone of the Java 8 release, greatly enhancing the language with highly expressive constructs to capture functions. Dividing application logic into functions facilitates parallel execution across CPU cores, and a further step involves making lambdas truly dynamic by unleashing them for execution across a distributed system. This session’s presenters entirely deconstruct the compilation and runtime execution of lambdas (bytecode uninitiated, beware) in the JDK. This then leads to a discussion of the concepts and traits that are summarized as dynamic lambdas—which ultimately enable lambdas to be consistently executed across a distributed system—and the benefits for applications.\n\nSpeaker:\nBrian Oliver, Architect, Oracle\nBrian Oliver is an Architect at Oracle Corporation. He works within the Oracle Coherence and Fusion Middleware Engineering groups, primarily focusing on in-memory technologies for the Java Platform, which mostly end up being used to implement massively scalable and high-performance transactional applications. Over the past 20 years he's been leading the development of large-scale multi-language and multi-currency Web, E-Commerce, Sports Gaming, Insurance and Financial systems making extensive use of Java technologies, working and with almost all of the top 10 financial institutions globally. He's the founder of the Coherence SIG, one of the only regularly meeting In-Memory Data Grid Special Interest Groups in the world, and the Coherence Development Community, a site dedicated to providing reference implementations of architectural patterns on top of Oracle Coherence. He was a co-specification lead of the Java Platform Caching Standard and recently awarded Java Rockstar."
