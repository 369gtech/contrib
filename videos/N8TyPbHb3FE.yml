description: "Java does not provide an API to directly support the expressiveness and power of SQL. All attention is given to object-relational mapping and abstractions on a higher level, such as OQL, HQL, JPQL, CriteriaQuery. jOOQ is a dual-licensed open source product that fills this gap. It implements SQL itself as a type-safe, domain-specific language in Java. jOOQ is a good choice in a Java application where SQL and the proprietary features of the database in use are important.
