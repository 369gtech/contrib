description: "In this talk I'll introduce radio hacking, and take it a few levels into hacking real world devices like wirelessly controlled gates, garages, and cars. Many vehicles are now controlled from mobile devices over GSM and the web, while even more can be unlocked and ignitions started from wireless keyfobs over RF. All of these are subject to attack with low-cost tools (such as RTL-SDR, GNU Radio, HackRF, Arduino, and even a Mattel toy).\n\nWe'll investigate how these features work, and of course, how they can be exploited. I'll be going from start to finish on new tools and vulnerabilities in this area, such as key-space reduction attacks on fixed-codes, advanced \"code grabbers\" using RF attacks on encrypted and rolling codes, exploiting mobile devices and poor SSL implementations, and how to protect yourself against such issues.\n\nBy the end of this talk youâ€™ll understand not only how vehicles and the wirelessly-controlled physical access protecting them can be exploited and secured, but also learn about various tools for hardware, car and RF research, as well as how to use and build your own inexpensive devices for such investigation!\n\nEVENT: \n\nAppSec California 2016\n\nSPEAKER: \n\nSamy Kamkar\n\nPERMISSIONS: \n\nThe original video was published on the OWASP YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS: \n\nOWASP YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe8j61ABYDuPTdtjItD2veA\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RipwqJG50c&t=21s\nVideo Thumbnail: Shreyas Amargol"
