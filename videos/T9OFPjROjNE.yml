description: "Over the course of past years I have gotten into trouble with my co-workers and I would like to share this with others in hope that perhaps some of these you have not yet made. The focus will be on 3 habits: MissDoesALot, MissKnowsALot, MissFearsALot. I will list the negative downsides, how to identify and some steps to take to improve from there. My personal conclusion is that I was not as helpful to my teams as I have hoped. It’s amazing how sometimes one gets blinded by the good intentions that also contributes to growth of own ignorance and blindness. Luckily it is not all that grim and I have a list of 10 golden rules I’d love to share. These lessons were learned while volunteering at different conventions and conferences. Cheers!\n\nP.S. This video starts not from very beginning, we apologise for inconvenience."
