description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012 in Washington, DC.\nSpeakers:Juergen Hoeller (SpringSource) and Marius Bogoevici (JBoss/RedHat)\nThe continuous evolution of both the Spring Framework and the Java EE platform presents us with new challenges and opportunities for collaboration. Several recent EE services are very commonly used with Spring, e.g. Servlet 3.0, JPA 2.0 and Bean Validation. This session presents an up-to-date analysis: How do recent Spring versions (3.1/3.2) integrate with Java EE 6? How is this going to be affected by Java EE 7 in a year's time?\n\nWhat kind of services may a Spring application expect from a modern Java EE server, beyond the pre-packaging of common Java APIs? How much effort does it take to add a custom selection of Java EE services to e.g. Tomcat, for use in Spring-based applications? Does it make sense to use Spring and Java EE component models such as EJB 3.1 or CDI together? What are the integration options?"
