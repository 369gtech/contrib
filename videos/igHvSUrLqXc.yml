Teams can use new tools like Feature Policy and the Reporting API to catch errors before they grow out of control, ensure site performance stays high, keep code quality healthy, and help avoid the web's biggest footguns.\n\nCheck out featurepolicy.rocks for more information about Feature Policy, code samples, and live demos.\n\nSubmit new ideas for policies or feedback on existing policies at  → https://bit.ly/2B3gDEU\n\nTo learn more about the Reporting API see https://bit.ly/rep-api.\n\nFind the event schedule and more info on the website → http://bit.ly/2AA1R87\n\nAll Sessions playlist → https://bit.ly/CDS18-AllSessions\n\nSubscribe to the Google Chrome Developers channel! → https://bit.ly/ChromeDevs1"
