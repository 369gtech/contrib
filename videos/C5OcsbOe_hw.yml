description: "Thomas Broell, Principal Consultant, Trivadis GmbH\n\nJPA is still one of the most-used technologies for data persistence. Due to the data access abstraction, performance can be hard to master. In microservice architectures, performance and response times become even more important than they used to be. This session provides insights into common problems and how to solve them as well as some best practices, antipatterns, and a deep dive into advanced topics such as caching."
