description: 'If there is bad press about Node.js it''s because of performance issues and how hard it is to track them down. Usually these problems are hiding during development but start to kick in under high load. Not good. In my talk we will briefly go through the "hall of fame" of Node.js performance problems and the technical details behind them. By doing so, we will also get some valuable insights on how Node.js (V8, libuv) works internally. Then we will learn how to create metrics that the V8 engine provides to us out of the box and learn about tools that help interpreting them.'
