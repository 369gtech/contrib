description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nService Authentication - Tokens or Certificates?- Marc Boorshtein, Tremolo Security, Inc.\n\nThe audience for this talk is anyone that is interested in rolling out a services infrastructure. Authentication is generally offloaded to the infrastructure, rather then handled by individual services (or at least it should be). In addition to the daunting number of decisions to be made at the service layer for configuration, authentication is often one of the hardest because it bridges both technology and business requirements and control of decisions may fall outside of the implementer’s ownership path. Having a roadmap for how to choose the right mechanism can either free or hamper implementation and future expansion because it is so foundational to the security of a service."
