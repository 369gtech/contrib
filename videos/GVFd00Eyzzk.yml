description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMartin Westergaard Lassen - Software Pilot at Trifork\n\nABSTRACT\nJava developers always tend to declare types themselves. Even when using other APIs where types already have been declared. Do we really need to do this redundant work over and over again?\nThis is an induction to my typeless Java coding lifestyle.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
