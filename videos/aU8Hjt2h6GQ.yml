title: '"What''s next for Bluetooth in PulseAudio?" - Sanchayan Maity (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612445304
description: "Sanchayan Maity\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/72/\n\nBluetooth is becoming more common as phone manufacturers decide to drop \r\nthe once common-place headphone jack. The Bluetooth specification has one\r\nmandatory audio codec (SBC) and allows multiple other codecs to be used\r\n(such as AAC, aptX, aptX-HD, LDAC and others).\r\n\r\nWhile PulseAudio has been a standard component of the Linux desktop for\r\na decade now, it still only supports the SBC codec. Community efforts have made\r\nother codecs available, but, these are not integrated upstream and not available by\r\ndefault on most Linux distributions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will first survey the Bluetooth audio landscape, talking about various\r\ncompeting codecs.\r\n\r\nWe will then examine existing and on going community efforts in supporting these\r\ncodecs and some of the challenges that needed to be addressed to exposed them\r\nto users in PulseAudio.\r\n\r\nWe then move on to new work on top of this to make multiple codec support more\r\nflexible by using the GStreamer multimedia framework and the path to getting this\r\nall upstream and in everyone's favorite distribution.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
