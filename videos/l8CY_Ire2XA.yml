description: "Lab 200 will build upon our knowledge and deploy the product catalog database, Java RESTClient, TwitterFeed and AlphaOfficeUI containers. Once our application is up and running, Evin will make a few changes to the AlphaOfficeUI portion of the application, save the updates as a new Docker image and create a NEW container based on that image. Satisfied with the changes he will push the latest version of the image up to Docker Hub for others to share.\n\nHands on Lab Material & Code: \nhttps://go.oracle.com/docker\n\nHands on Lab Overview: Containerized Development with Docker\nhttps://youtu.be/ivNEREBsH9k\n\nHands on Lab Setup: OCI Development Environment\nhttps://youtu.be/4-zHfxopV_s\n\nLab 100: Containerized Development with Docker\nhttps://youtu.be/F7We8xx1_Lw\n\nLab 200 : Containerized Development with Docker \nhttps://youtu.be/l8CY_Ire2XA\n\nContinue your Development Journey:\nhttps://go.oracle.com/container-native-development\n\nPlaylist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPIzp-E1msrYGLKIgW3njO3uUkvXD0bAH"
