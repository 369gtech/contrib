description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nPatterns to Build Stateful Apps with Serverless - Tanmai Gopal, Hasura \n\nServerless computing has gained increasing popularity amongst developers, who are promised an experience of finally being able to Just Write Code. Serverless providers make this possible by forcing developers to remove \"state\" from their business logic. Serverless code cannot access disk or share in-memory data with concurrent invocations. This makes it easy for infrastructure solutions to provide on-demand scaling, but makes it hard for developers to build \"real\" applications.  In this talk, Tanmai will review different architectures, solutions and tools in the ecosystem to solve 3 common stateful problems that developers face. 1) Accessing data 2) Persisting data 3) Sharing data across concurrent executions.  This talk will focus heavily on \"brownfield\" and incremental adoption type use-cases, like mobilizing existing data/state and adding serverless to existing stateful applications. \n\nhttps://sched.co/aYqL"
