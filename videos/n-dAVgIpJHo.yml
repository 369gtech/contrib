description: "Randy Shoup, WeWork\n \nThe best response to a system outage is not \"What did you do?\", but \"What did we learn?\" This session will walk through three system-wide outages at Google, at Stitch Fix, and at WeWorkâ€”their incidents, aftermaths, and recoveries. In all cases, many things went right and a few went wrong; also in all cases, because of blameless cultures, we buckled down, learned a lot, and made substantial improvements in the systems for the future. Looking back with the perspective of 20-20 hindsight, all of these incidents were seminal events that changed the focus and trajectory of engineering at each organization. You will leave with a set of actionable suggestions in dealing with customers, engineering teams, and upper management. You will also enjoy a few war stories from the trenches, none of which has been previously told fully in public.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
