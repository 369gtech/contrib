description: "Elephant in the Blameless War Room—Accountability\n\nChristina Tan and Emily Arnott, Blameless\n\nHow do you reconcile the ideal of blamelessness with the demand for blame? When is it constructive to hold someone accountable, and how? To change a blameful culture, we must empathize with those that point the finger and see how their goals align with our own. We'll show you how to communicate that their goals can be achieved blamelessly. Lastly, we'll share how to hold true accountability well.\n\nChristina is on the strategy team at Blameless, architecting interpersonal dynamics for conflict resolution, high performance teams, and executive alignment. Prior to that, Christina coached TED speakers for public speaking and startup founders for fundraising. Her clients have collectively raise over $240M. In her spare time, she runs the mindfulness community Serenity Lounge.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
