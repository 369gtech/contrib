description: "HotSpot promises to do wonders for us by Just-in-Time (JIT) compiling the \"right\" code for us, but how does it makes those decisions? And, perhaps more importantly, what happens when it's wrong?\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn through real code examples just how the JVM decides to compile your code, deoptimize your code, and stop-the-world for a GC.\n\nDouglas Hawkins has been passionately developing software for the past 10 years -- creating applications for bioinformatics, finance, and retail.\n\nBut Doug's true interest has always been VM internals. Now a VM engineer at Azul Systems, he works on Azul's Zing VM full-time and is the lead developer of Azul's ReadyNow technology."
