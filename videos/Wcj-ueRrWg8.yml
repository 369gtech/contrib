title: 'Cache Me Outside - Caching Methodologies & Architectures - Anthony Dang - NDC Sydney 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630507219
description: "Caching methodologies have not been given much serious attention. Adding cache in your solution architecture may show some initial benefits, however there are also some heavy penalties. This can especially be the case with multi-layered caching strategies. A poor cache implementation could mean the difference between blazing fast performance, experiencing inconsistent usability, unexplained random timeouts, and even random stale (out of date) database entities which you cannot explain.\n\nThis is a presentation about caching architecture. We will demo and compare different caching methodologies, and their perceived real world uses. We will discuss donut cache, custom memory cache, cached proxies, Redis, Varnish, Cloudflare, CDNs, and more. We will dive into the pitfalls of real world implementations and actual code samples. We will discuss the considerations of each caching methodology, and how they might be improved to mitigate the real world penalties.\n\nAt the end of this presentation you will be aware of the different trade-offs with each caching methodology, and which might best for your situation."
