title: 'Toby Crawley - Developing Asynchronous Polyglot Applications with vert.x'
recordingDate: 1388149379
description: "Vert.x is an asynchronous application platform built on top of Netty that supports several JVM languages, and recently gained Clojure support. It uses a multi-reactor model to efficiently serve a high number of concurrent connections, and greatly simplifies distributed component coordination by providing built-in message passing between components within the same JVM, or on separate cluster nodes, up to and including the browser! In this talk, I'll provide an introduction to Vert.x, and cover the trade-offs of using it for developing either pure Clojure or polyglot applications.\n\nAs a core member of the Immutant and TorqueBox teams at Red Hat, Toby helps drive the integration of Java and other JVM languages. Prior to joining Red Hat in 2010, Toby spent far too many years as a contractor developing applications in a plethora of languages."
