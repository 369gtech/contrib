description: "CODE IS HERE: http://goo.gl/RinOf\n\nBest Java Book : http://goo.gl/FtKp0m\n\nHere I begin what will be a massive Java Video Tutorial. I start with all you need to start writing Java programs.\n\nI then cover just about anything you'd want to know about Javas primitive data types. I cover declaration statements, expression statements, all the types and how to convert them.\n\nThis tutorial starts out slow, but by the end you will be a Java expert!"
