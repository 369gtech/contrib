This video comes from Marakana's 5-Day Android Bootcamp Training Course which Marko Gargenta taught in San Jose, CA earlier this year. \n\nIn this tutorial, Marko will show you how to set-up a SQLite database to store local data for your Android application. The database service will run in the background and periodically update the database to ensure that the data needed for your Android app is relatively fresh.\n\nThis tutorial will:\n- Introduce you to SQLite\n- Show you how to create a helper class that provides a \"connection\" to the database\n- Introduce you to the database schema and its creation\n- Cover the four main operations for application databases\n\n** Get the source code for this tutorial here: http://marakana.com/f/267"
