recordingDate: 1338936125
description: "Pig has added some exciting new features in 0.10, including a boolean type, UDFs in JRuby, load and store functions for JSON, bloom filters, and performance improvements. In this webcast presented by Alan Gates, author of Programming Pig, we will cover these new features, as well as talk about work we plan to do in the near future. In particular, we will cover how Pig can take advantage of changes in Hadoop 0.23.\n\nPresenter: Alan Gates is an original member of the engineering team that took Pig from a Yahoo! Labs research project to a successful Apache open source project. In this role he oversaw the implementation of the language, including programming interfaces and the overall design. He has presented Pig at numerous conferences and user groups, universities, and companies. Alan is a member of the Apache Software Foundation and a co-founder of Hortonworks. He has a BS in Mathematics from Oregon State University and a MA in Theology from Fuller Theological Seminary.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
