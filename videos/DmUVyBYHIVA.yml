title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: All Performance is Mobile Performance'
recordingDate: 1523510696
description: "Whatever performance challenges you face, mobile visitors\_experience\_it worst. Mobile connections remain\_slow and expensive. Wireless and satellite hops\_add latency that amplifies back-end slowness. Phones throttle their CPUs to squeeze out extra battery life and run\_complex, slow operations to free up memory that's in use by other\_apps.\n\nThere's an upsite, though: solving mobile front-end performance means desktop users will have good performance, too.\_That's important because everyone needs good performance:\_the stakes couldn't be higher.\n\nIn this presentation, we'll break out the latest tools for analysis, tuning, and caching. We'll talk about the changes you can make today that will improve visitor experience the most. Some changes will be in Drupal, but we'll also lean heavily on CDNs, HTTP/2, and IPv6. Finally, we'll look at the latest\_in \"edge computing,\" which evolves the capabilities of CDNs (and other edge deployments) into personalization, image optimization, paywall management, and other tasks that traditionally had to activate Drupal.\n\nNote\_to track chair(s): Some parts of this presentation will include updated content from\_Life on the Edge: CDN and HTTPS Delivery in 2017, which I presented at DrupalCon Vienna. I will have one of the\_co-founders of Fastly as a co-presenter, but I don't think his account is set up on this site yet for me to add him above."
