description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2015\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nArno Candel - PhD - Chief Architect at H2O.ai\n\nABSTRACT\nH2O is fast scalable open-source machine learning and deep learning for Smarter Applications. Using in-memory compression techniques, H2O can handle billions of data rows in-memory — even on small compute clusters. The platform includes interfaces for R, Python, Scala, Java, JS and JSON, along with its interactive graphical Flow interface that make it easier for non-engineers to stitch together complete analytic workflows. H2O was built alongside (and on top of) both Hadoop and Spark [...]\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttp://gotocon.com/chicago-2015/presentation/Scalable%20Data%20Science%20and%20Deep%20Learning%20with%20H2O\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
