title: 'Higher-order functions and function_ref - Vittorio Romeo [C++ on Sea 2019]'
language: English
recordingDate: 1550394003
description: "Most modern languages treat functions as first-class citizens, and Modern C++ is no different. The introduction of lambda expressions and utilities such as std::function enable countless functional programming patterns that can increase the flexibility and safety of APIs, and help reduce code repetition on the implementation side.\n\nIn this talk we're going to see examples of how higher-order functions can be used in practice to increase the quality of production code and the productivity of developers. A new abstraction proposed to the Standard Library for C++20, function_ref, will also be covered and compared to other techniques for the implementation of higher-order functions. function_ref aims to be a lightweight wrapper over any Callable with a given signature that is easy for the compiler to optimize and inline.\n---\nVittorio Romeo is an Italian 23 year old Software Engineer at Bloomberg LP. He completed his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at \"Universit√† degli Studi di Messina\".\n\nHe began programming at a very young age and is now a C++ enthusiast. While following the evolution of the C++ standard and embracing the newest features, he worked on several open-source projects, including modern general-purpose libraries and free cross-platform games.\n\nVittorio is an active member of the C++ community: he participated as a speaker at CppCon 2014/2015/2016, ++it Florence 2015 and at his local Linux Day 2013/2014 events, as a Student/Volunteer at C++Now 2015/2016, at Meeting C++ 2015/2016.\n\nHe currently maintains a C++-related blog and a YouTube channel featuring well-received modern C++11 and C++14 tutorials.\n\nhttps://cpponsea.uk/sessions/higher-order-functions-and-function_ref.html\n\nFilmed and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
