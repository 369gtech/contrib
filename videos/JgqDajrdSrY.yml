title: 'Microservices made easy with cote.js - lecture by Armagan Amcalar - Code Europe Autumn 2017'
recordingDate: 1521551883
description: "The concept of microservices is extremely hot. Unfortunately, we see a lot of ideas from the past rebranded as microservices; whereas the thinking behind microservices imply and promise a bigger change. This talk will go over the details of what actually makes a microservices architecture and how other distributed systems — that rely on queues and other mechanisms to function — fail to fulfill the promise. A modern microservices implementation should be: \n* Zero-configuration \n* Highly-redundant \n* Fault-tolerant \n* Self-healing \n* Auto-discovery We will specifically focus on such an implementation with Docker and cote, a Node.js library."
