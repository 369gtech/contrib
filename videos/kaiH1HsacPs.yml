description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeaker: Jon Brisbin\nThe Spring Data REST project is a library for exposing Spring Data Repositories via the web. Version 1.0 supports JPA Repositories and upcoming versions will support other Spring Data Repository implementations like MongoDB and GemFire. This talk will walk you through the process of exposing JPA entities via the Spring Data Repository abstraction and then exporting them to HTTP using Spring Data REST. \n\nWe'll do a bit of live coding to create an HTML 5 application to discover and consume these RESTful endpoints. HTTP also makes a simple and interoperable wire protocol for machine-to-machine communication, so we'll cover a few ways to consume your REST services in other systems by using tools like curl, Ruby, or Node.js."
