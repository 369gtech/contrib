recordingDate: 1510717678
description: "Better Governance – Banking on Continuous Delivery\n\nJennifer Brady, Technology Governance Director, Capital One \nTopo Pal, Senior Director & Senior Engineering Fellow, Capital One \n\nContinuous Delivery in a regulated environment can be challenging. Being a regulated company, Capital One must ensure that it remains focused on managing risk and strong governance while adopting DevOps and Continuous Delivery. Often this question is asked “Are you exposing the company to undue risk if you are doing Continuous Delivery?” Our experience tells us that “You are not well-managed and as effective as you could be if you are not doing Continuous Delivery.” In this presentation, we will dive deep into some of the core governance areas and describe how Continuous Delivery is helping us in better IT Governance. We will describe how we have created (a) Shift-Left of many controls (b) Automation of control monitoring and (c) a better engineering experience. We will share some results of this work and discuss some questions that are still un-answered.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
