description: "With all the hubbub over functional programming in JavaScript, you might be confused what it’s all about. Functional programming can solve many problems more elegantly than imperative programming. In this presentation, explore functional programming’s mathematical roots and then learn to use ES6 (JavaScript) to dive into important concepts such as recursion, immutability, and currying. Functional programming will reveal itself to be an important tool in the programmer’s bag for enforcing modularity and readability, making code more understandable and easier to test.\n\nSPEAKER: Jeremy Fairbank\n\nJeremy's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIF0e4G6TQ7RNqauicoy10g\n\nJeremy's Twitter account: https://twitter.com/elpapapollo\n\nPERMISSIONS: Coding Tech received permission to republish this talk from the owner."
