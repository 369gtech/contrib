description: "Joe Robinson\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/233/\n\nTech writer management offers its own challenges. With stories from recent interviews in the field, I'll identify some fundamental skills for new managers, or managers looking for a refresh of their knowledge.\r\n\r\nI'll talk about psychology with reference to the role of schemas. I'll talk about the role enthusiasm plays, as well as language and listening.\r\n\r\nThis talk largely follows my own career pathway, which I use as an example of how schemas work in the field.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 11:25:00 2020 at Room 8"
