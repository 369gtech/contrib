description: "James Bromberger\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/171/\n\n20 years of web cryptography, and its amazing how frequently its configured sub-optimally. We've had numerous encryption algorithms, digests, protocols come, and should have GONE, but everyone has just left them on. Its time to shut out the legacy browser. The vast majority of the worlds browser install base now auto-updates, and with strict (and prescriptive) compliance in force, we get to drop the bloat form the past. In this talk we'll cover the current TRANSITIONS we're going through from a web admins perspective: TLS, Cipher Suites, HTTP Security Headers, CAs, the move to an encrypted-by-default web, and more.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
