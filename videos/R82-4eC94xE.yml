description: "JFuture 2019, Minsk â€“ November 16, 2019\n\nCollaborating on Open Source Software, Marit van Dijk\n\nThere are several reasons you might want to contribute to open source software. For me, it was that I wanted to learn in a more useful way than doing programming challenges. So I looked into how I could contribute to open source projects that I use myself. After contributing for almost two years, I notice that I have learned a lot from my contributions (which has been useful at work), as well as have made friends and have become part of a community.\n\nIn this talk I will share my experience with contributing to Cucumber, including an early mistake (merging something that wasn't ready yet) and fixing it with the support of core maintainers, and still feeling welcome!\nYou'll learn how how to find your project and contributions to start with, how to connect with the community to make sure your contributions are useful and the many different types of contributions you can make.\n\nContributing to open source is a way of giving back to the community. In addition, it is a way for you to learn, collaborate and become part of a community. Getting (constructive) feedback on a pull request and collaborating to make things even better is a great feeling!"
