description: 'We can achieve efficiency not just by running things faster but also by avoiding things that shouldn’t be done in the first place. Lazy evaluations are a core feature of many functional programming languages. Your code can benefit from lazy evaluations with lambda expressions and, even more, with the power of Streams. This presentation starts with a discussion of lazy evaluations, with short examples from Haskell and Scala. Then it dives into Java to see how we can achieve similar benefits with lambdas and the Stream API.'
