description: "Lightning Talk: How Fast Was My Database? - Josh Berkus, Red Hat \n\nI know my database will be slower on Kubernetes and cloud native storage, but HOW MUCH slower? This is a question everyone thinking of moving traditionally hosted stateful services like database to Kubernetes ask all the time. And until now, we haven't had good answers. This presentation will detail a series of microbenchmarks on PostgreSQL running on and off Kubernetes in a variety of configurations, including bare metal, local storage, gluster, and rook. You'll get a solid idea of what the cost in latency and throughput is for abstracting away your storage problems, and be able to make platform decisions for yourself. \n\nTo Learn More:  https://sched.co/GrVS"
