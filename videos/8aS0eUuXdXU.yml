language: English
recordingDate: 1449594475
description: "Apache Lucene is the de facto standard open source library for Java developers implementing full-text-search capabilities. Although it’s thriving in its field, it is rarely mentioned in the scope of Java EE development. This session shows the features that make many developers love Lucene, with some concrete examples of common problems it elegantly solves. You’ll see some best practices for using it in a Java EE stack and how some popular OSS projects such as Hibernate ORM (JPA provider), WildFly (Java EE runtime), and Infinispan (in-memory data grid, JCache implementer) actually provide great Lucene integration capabilities and how they can help resolve some modern challenges such as deployment in the cloud.\n\nSpeaker:\nSanne Grinovero, Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat\nSanne Grinovero is one of the core developers of the popular Hibernate project, where he leads the integration with Apache Lucene known as Hibernate Search. He also contributes to the integration of Lucene with the Infinispan project, known as JBoss Data Grid, aiming to make high performance Search and NoSQL capabilities easy to use and well integrated into the mainstream Java stack. He lived in Holland, Italy, Chile, Dominican Republic, Portugal, Newcastle and currently hacks in London."
