title: 'DevOpsDaysRiga 2017 | Niek Palm | Serving Docker containers in an immutable infrastructure on AWS'
recordingDate: 1510222845
description: "Niek Palm is Software Architect for Philips Research on rapid prototyping. \nHe has more than 10 years experience working in various function in IThe did a lot of open source based development, had architecture roles, setup continuous delivery for several projects and made several trainings and workshops. Currently, he is working with technologies like AWS, Terraform, Spring Cloud, React, React Native, GitLabCi, Docker, Elastic Search and much more.\n\nThe Docker slogan 'Build, Ship, and Run' advertises easy setup, but Running is not always easy. During this talk, Niek will show how to create an immutable infrastructure on AWS with Terraform. He will be using a real-world example to explain how you can get micro-services live on AWS and continuously apply changes.\n\nSetting up immutable builds with Docker is pretty straightforward and shipping is just a matter of pushing the image to a repository. The next step is building the cloud infrastructure to run the containers. In this talk, Niek will briefly touch upon building immutable software. But the main focus of the talk will be on creating an immutable infrastructure. In this talk, he will show how to create an immutable infrastructure on AWS with Terraform. Niek will use a real-world example to explain and show live how easy you can get micro-services live on AWS and continuously apply changes to the same cloud environment."
