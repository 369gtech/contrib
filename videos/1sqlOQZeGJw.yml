description: "The moment when you code. You type. You type a lot. You type `LocalDateTime`. The moment you know you are doomed.\n\nHow hard can time be?\n\nSometimes, time gives us a hard time. This time, we will have a deeper dive into what it takes for a String of `2019-05-15T09:00:00` to become an instance of `java.time.Instant`. This is what this lightning talk will be about.\n\nJakub is a software craftsman with over a decade of commercial experience in programming, wearing multiple hats, getting hands dirty in multiple environments. Some languages, some frameworks, blah blah blah - doesnâ€™t really matter. Architect, programmer, manager, technical trainer, tech lead, wannabe entrepreneur, JUG leader. There is a fair chance he does non of those right."
