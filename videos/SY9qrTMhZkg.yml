description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Amsterdam 2015\nhttp://gotoams.nl\n\nBenjamin Hindman - Founder of Mesosphere & Co-creator of Apache Mesos\n\nABSTRACT\nAs you grow the number of machines in a cluster, you also grow its complexity. Docker is great on a single machine, or small handful of machines, but can it be used to build applications that scale across an entire datacenter or cloud? Can it be used to deliver large-scale distributed systems, including datacenter services like Hadoop, Cassandra and Kafka?\nIn this talk, Benjamin Hindman, Co-creator of Apache Mesos, will explain how leading companies like Twitter bring high degrees of automation to large container-driven clusters. He will also explain how to build new distributed systems using Docker.\nIn this talk, Ben will take you beyond managing individual machines and show you how create highly-elastic, highly-available systems that manage failures [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttp://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2015/presentation/Docker%20as%20the%20Building%20Block%20for%20Datacenter-Scale%20Applications\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotoamst\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
