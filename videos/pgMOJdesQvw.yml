title: 'Immutable Infrastructure on Azure - Evgeny Borzenin - NDC Oslo 2020'
recordingDate: 1600781877
description: "When you design your infrastructure provisioning model, you need to choose whether you want your infrastructure to be mutable or immutable.\nIn a traditional mutable infrastructure, infra components are incrementally updated and modified in place. An immutable infrastructure is another paradigm in which infrastructure components are never modified after they are provisioned.\n\nJoin me at my session where I will show you how to model a blue-green infrastructure provisioning process. You will learn what tools and options are available at the market, how to structure resource groups and how to use Traffic Manager or Azure Front Door to implement canary testing of your services under new infrastructure with “close to 0” down time.\n\nThis talk is rated level 200-300 with a target audience of developers and architects working with Azure infrastructure. You will hear a lot about automation, infrastructure as code and will learn what load-balancing options are available on Azure."
