description: "Disrupting an Enterprise from the Inside: Our Story of Building a Start-Up to Compete with Ourselves\n\nChris Jackson, Director Cloud Product Engineering, Pearson\n\nWorking for a company as old as Morse Code that is trying to make a wholesale pivot to digital education services in a market ripe for disruption from new entrants is a recipe for an exciting challenge. In this talk we discuss Pearson's approach to managing this shift in focus and how we have taken the start-up mentality to heart building a new team with a new approach to challenge and drive change from within. We will touch on how we see our emerging DevOps capabilities scaling in a global company of over 40,000 people and what a seismic shift in technology does to the varied silos of a large distributed enterprise. We will share what has worked for us to create an opportunity to drive change and where we see our next challenges as we launch our first production services.\n\nDOES16 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
