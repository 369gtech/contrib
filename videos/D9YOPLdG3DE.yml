description: "Scale up at the Speed of Sound - Akshay Mankar & Oleksandr Slynko, Pivotal \n\nImagine a world where you don't have to wait for your deployments to finish. Imagine if you had just enough time to get a cup of tea but not more before your deployment was done. If you like this world, this talk is for you. This talk will explore an idea which makes bosh releases a bit unconventional, but it will make deployments super fast. The talk will go deep on stemcell customisation in order to skip compilation and network usage all together. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
