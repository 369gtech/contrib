There are a number of solutions for global/app-wide state management, however a more localized state was left behind. Let me introduce the latest addition to NgRx family of libraries - @ngrx/component-store - a standalone library for managing local/component state, which intends to be a replacement of \"services with a Subject\". In this talk we'll discuss what \"state\" is, go over some APIs of ComponentStore and peek into \"best practices\".\n\nFabian Gosebrink - Architecting Angular Applications with Angular Libraries\n\nAbstract: Angular offers a large ecosystem when it comes to separation and architecture of your application. There are often pieces of code that you don't just want to reuse within your application, but to make available to other applications in your organization or via package managers like npm over the Internet. This is where angular libraries come into play. In this talk, Fabian Gosebrink explores the way Angular Libraries are built, what the Angular Package format is good for, and how we can move code from an existing application to an Angular Library to reuse the code across one or multiple applications! This makes scaling and the architecture of angular applications a breeze.\n\nOrestes Carracedo - As fast as possible: pre-rendering your Angular projects with Scully.\n\nLevel: Intermediate\n\nBio: Entrepreneur, software engineer, speaker, mentor and community lead.
