description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io\n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nKubernetes provides well defined interfaces to integrate storage and networking through CSI and CNI. However, deploying Kubernetes on hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) poses multiple challenges.\n\nIn this session, we will explore the evolution of public cloud infrastructure and explain how they have overcome some of these challenges using hardware offloads. We will further demonstrate how Diamantiâ€™s bare metal hyperconverged infrastructure has solved these challenges for private cloud environments by leveraging Kubernetes orchestration to deploy containers as well as virtual machines to co-exist on the same platform."
