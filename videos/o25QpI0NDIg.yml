description: "Peter Hilton is a software developer, writer, speaker, trainer, and musician. Peter’s professional interests are business process management, web application development, functional design, agile software development and documentation. Peter currently works as a programmer and technical writer for Signavio, working remotely from Rotterdam, and delivers the occasional lecture and training course.\n\nPeter’s software development interests include web applications, service architecture, software development methodology and practices, and web-based collaboration. Peter has presented at several European developer conferences, including ACCU, Scala eXchange, Devoxx, øredev, Jfokus, Javazone, geecon and TopConf. Peter co-authored ‘Play for Scala’ (Manning Publications) and has taught ‘Fast Track to Play with Scala’.\n\nTalk Summary \nDocumentation’s lack of popularity among programmers is at least partly due to time wasted on too much documentation, and producing docs the hard way. However, neglecting software documentation and technical writing skills holds us and our projects back. The solution is to improve basic skills, integrate documentation with modern software development methods, and learn about modern tools. Topics include:\n\nDocumentation requirements – understanding why we need system documentation\nContent guidelines – deciding what to document\nTechnical writing – learning techniques for effective writing\nDocumentation types – comparing essential documentation with special-purpose docs\nProduction pipelines – using tools to produce software documentation\nArchitecture and code improvements – reducing the need for documentation\nProject management – agile documentation planning and project risk reduction\nThis workshop teaches what to document, what not to, and how to produce documentation without the pain of traditional approaches. Attendees will learn to write and publish effective documentation with less effort, and develop a long-term skill. This benefits all software development teams, because good system documentation is a universal software requirement."
