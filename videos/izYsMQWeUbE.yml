Most of this metrics are only valuable when they’re made available as soon as the associated events happened. In our company we are looking for a system able to produce this kind of real-time indicator, which must handle massive amounts of data (400,000 eps) with often peak loads (like New Year’s Eve) or out-of-order events like massive network disorder. Low latency and flexible window management with specific watermark emission are also a must-haves. Heterogeneous format, multiple flow correlation, and the possibility of late data arrival are other challenges. Flink being already widely used at Bouygues Telecom for real-time data integration, its features made it the evident candidate for the future System. In this talk, we’ll present a real use case of streaming analytics using Flink, Kafka & HBase along with other legacy systems."
