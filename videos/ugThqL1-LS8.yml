description: 'When you open your browser and type www.yougottalovefrontend.com in the address bar, there is an amazing amount of things that happen in just a split of a second. Thousands of IP packets are being exchanged by your browser and remote servers involving many protocols such as HTTP, TCP, DNS and SSL to ensure fast, smooth and secure experience. There is so much going on behind the scenes, things such as routing, NAT, retransmissions, Nagle''s algorithm, ack piggybacking just to name a few. In this session, we are going to do a deep network surgery and cut through the different protocol layers as we use the browser.'
