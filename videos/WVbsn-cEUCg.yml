The Machine Learning training will provide deep understanding of Machine Learning and its mechanism. As a Data Scientist, you will be learning the importance of Machine Learning and its implementation in python programming language. Furthermore, you will be taught of Reinforcement Learning which in turn is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence. You will be able to automate real life scenarios using Machine Learning Algorithms. Towards the end of the course we will be discussing various practical use cases of Machine Learning in python programming language to enhance your learning experience.\n--------------------------------------\nWhy Learn Machine Learning with Python?\n\nData Science is a set of techniques that enables the computers to learn the desired behavior from data without explicitly being programmed. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science. This course exposes you to different classes of machine learning algorithms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms. This course imparts you the necessary skills like data pre-processing, dimensional reduction, model evaluation and also exposes you to different machine learning algorithms like regression, clustering, decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes and Q-Learning.\n--------------------------------------------\nWho should go for this Course?\n\nEdurekaâ€™s Python Machine Learning Certification Course is a good fit for the below professionals:\nDevelopers aspiring to be a â€˜Machine Learning Engineer'\nAnalytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts\nBusiness Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques\nInformation Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics\n'Python' professionals who want to design automatic predictive models\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nGot a question on the topic?
