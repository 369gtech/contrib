description: "Talk recording from AmsterdamJS Conference 2017, June 8 https://amsterdamjs.com\n\nIvano Malavolta, Assistant professor in the Software and Services group of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam \n\nMobile web apps represent a large share of the Internet today. However, they still lag behind native apps in terms of user experience. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are a new technology introduced by Google that aims at bridging this gap, with a set of APIs known as service workers at its core. In this talk Ivano presents an empirical study that evaluates the impact of service workers on the energy efficiency of PWAs, when operating in different network conditions on two different generations of mobile devices. This talk presents the results of the first empirical investigation on PWAs, showing that the PWA and service workers technology is promising in terms of energy efficiency."
