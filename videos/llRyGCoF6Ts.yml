recordingDate: 1456224739
description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\n10 Ways to be a More Productive Java Developer\n\nDevelopers shouldn't work faster and more effectively, they should work harder. Too much energy is spent learning how to improve and not enough is spend crushing every hour with manual repetitive tasks to get the job done. This tongue in cheek session takes a look at 10 development tools/projects/products, explaining what they do and how they 'supposedly' help your development practices. Fear not, padawans, I'll uncover what these vendors, and project owners don't want you to know about how they're ruining your development environments and rotting your development projects from the core. We'll cover JIRA, Confluence, Tomcat/TomEE, JRebel, XRebel, Arquillian, JBoss Forge, IntelliJ, Jenkins, and Gradle.\n\nSimon Maple, ZeroTurnaround\n\nSimon is a Developer Advocate at ZeroTurnaround and founder of the vJUG (virtualJUG), in addition to being an active member of the London Java Community (LJC) organising group and LJC JCP EC committee member. All of his community efforts culminated in him being awarded Java Champion status in 2014. Simon used to be a tester, developer and technical evangelist for IBM on the WebSphere Application Server for 12 years prior to joining ZeroTurnaround. He's married with a son and dog who he tries to spend as much quality time with as he can."
