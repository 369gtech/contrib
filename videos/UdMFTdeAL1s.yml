description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nTutorial: Attacking and Defending Kubernetes Clusters: A Guided Tour - Brad Geesaman, Brad Geesaman Consulting; Jimmy Mesta, KSOC, Inc.; Tabitha Sable, Independent; & Peter Benjamin, Teradata (Limited Available Seating; First-Come, First-Served Basis)  \n\n Please bring your laptop fully charged as we will have limited charging stations available in the room.   Is your Kubernetes cluster able to resist the most common attacks? And, are all the necessary detection mechanisms in place to know if a security issue did occur?  In this hands-on workshop, the instructors will dive into the art and science of Kubernetes security through a series of interactive attack and defense scenarios. Attendees will learn through instructor-led exercises how to identify and exploit realistic misconfigurations in Kubernetes clusters to achieve full cluster compromise. Each attack step will be matched with hardening measures and specific methods for detection and response workflows.  Each workshop attendee will be provided with a pre-configured Kubernetes cluster running realistic workloads in a cloud-based lab environment. The tools and methodologies covered by these exercises will directly help attendees secure their own organization's clusters. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaew"
