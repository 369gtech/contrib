title: 'YOW! 2015 - Randy Shoup - Pragmatic Microservices: Whether, When and How to Migrate'
recordingDate: 1451485573
description: "One of the most powerful trends in software today is building large systems out of composable microservices, often deployed in containers. Many large-scale web companies have migrated over time to this architecture – and for good reason. But, as with any powerful technique, microservices come with their own brand of tradeoffs, and it is important to be aware of them before deciding whether they are appropriate in any particular case. They are not for every scale of problem, for every stage of company, or for every team.\n\nThis session takes a pragmatic approach to microservices, and compares them to the alternatives at different stages of company evolution. Using examples both from Google and eBay as well as smaller organizations, it makes practical suggestions about whether, when, and how an organization should consider migrating. Assuming migration is the appropriate choice, it outlines an experience-based, incremental approach to making such a rearchitecture successful.\n\nRandy has worked as a senior technology leader and executive in Silicon Valley at companies ranging from small startups, to mid-sized places, to eBay and Google. In his consulting practice, he applies this experience to scaling the technology infrastructures and engineering organizations of his client companies. He served as CTO at KIXEYE, and was Director of Engineering in Google’s cloud computing group, leading several teams building Google App Engine. He was CTO and Co-Founder of Shopilly, an ecommerce startup, and spent 6 1/2 years as Chief Engineer at eBay. Randy is a frequent keynote speaker and consultant in areas from scalability and cloud computing, to analytics and data science, to engineering culture and DevOps. He is particularly interested in the nexus of people, culture, and technology.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
