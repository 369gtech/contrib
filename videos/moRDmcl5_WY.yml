description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Amsterdam 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOams\nhttp://gotoams.nl\n\nSteven van Beelen - Axon Framework Lead Developer\nBen Wilcock - Established Technology Blogger & Advisory Solution Architect in Cloud Application Transformation\n\nABSTRACT\nWe hear a lot about ‘Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)’ and ‘Event Sourcing’ these days, but have you already tried building such a system yourself? CQRS describes a way of developing applications that cleanly separate application models and data sources - the write side and the read side. The read side is populated by the write side typically through events.\nEvent Sourcing is a specialized pattern for data storage. Instead of storing the current state for an entity, every change of state is stored as a separate event that makes sense to a business user.\nThere are many things to learn when writing a proper CQRS / ES application and in this live coding presentation we will guide you through the concepts of building message focused, cleanly structured applications using Axon Framework and Pivotal Cloud Foundry.\nWhy do it this way? PCF allows deliver and scale your system into production fast, while Axon’s command, query and event messaging focus brings clean code and the power to evolve your architecture as the need arises. After this talk, you will be well equipped to begin your own CQRS and Event Sourcing applications, just as [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotoams.nl/2019/sessions/780\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOamst\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\n#CQRS #EventSourcing #AxonFramework #PivotalCloudFoundry #PCF #DDD \n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
