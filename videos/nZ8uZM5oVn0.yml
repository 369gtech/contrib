title: 'Jacek Kunicki - How (not) to use Reactive Streams in Java 9+'
language: English
recordingDate: 1531299553
description: 'Reactive Streams is a standard for asynchronous data processing in a streaming fashion with non-blocking backpressure. Starting from Java 9, they have become a part of the JDK in the form of the java.util.concurrent.Flow interfaces. Having the interfaces at hand may tempt you to write your own implementations. Surprising as it may seem, that’s not what they are in the JDK for. In this session we’re going to go through the basic concepts of reactive stream processing and see how (not) to use the APIs included in JDK 9+. Plus we’re going to ponder the possible directions in which JDK’s Reactive Streams support may go in the future.'
