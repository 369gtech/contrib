description: "You might think a robot that can play Angry Birds on a tablet is the most ridiculous idea you've ever heard of -- and you'd be right. However, you can use that little 'bot for automated testing of your app on any mobile device. You already write tests, right? So you *need* a robot! (You always wanted one, anyway; now you have an excuse to make one!) I'll show you how to make it, and how to program it JS.\n\nFor reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
