description: "The Cloud is fast becoming the default deployment target for new applications. But cloud providers offer a wide range of deployment options ranging from bare metal, VMs, containers, and functions. All of these are legitimate deployment alternatives, but how do you choose? What are the characteristics of each that support (or hinder) application deployment and ongoing management?
