We have seen also otherwise: managers might be the crucial make it or break it force within organization that is ongoing change.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation several aspects  of change management, leadership and coaching are touched. Real-life examples from Ericsson Finland: team formation and operation (managers and coaches role), Change Roadmap, coaching Leadership Teams, different levels of coaching (individuals, teams, PO, portfolio, line management on different levels). \r\n\r\nWhat is required from a management coach?
