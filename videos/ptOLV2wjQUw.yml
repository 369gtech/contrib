description: "Embracing Upstream Kubernetes in Web Scale Organization - Lei Zhang, Alibaba & Jun Chen, Ant Financial \n\nHow does a web-scale organization meet the demands of performance & scalability without forking Kubernetes while still offering a fully integrated and secure offering?  Actually, for any large scale organization or public cloud, we believe the problems we share are the similar: Should I maintain a swarm of small clusters or a single \"monster\"? What would be the challenge when I scale the cluster to 1k nodes or more? How to fix issues or add features without breaking Kubernetes code? How often the cluster would be upgraded? And how to make engineers think in a “Kubernetes Native” way?  In this talk, we will share some experience & lessons we learnt from applying upstream Kubernetes in Alibaba ecosystem. We will list every challenge we faced, and the \"upstream native\" practice we fixed it. We will share our unique way of upgrading our Kubernetes with keeping pace of upstream as well. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPXu"
