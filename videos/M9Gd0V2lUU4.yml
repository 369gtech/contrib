title: 'SREcon19 Asia/Pacific - Reliable by Design Adding Value in the Design Review Process'

description: "Laura Nolan, Slack\n\nReviewing designs written by other engineers becomes an increasingly large (and important) part of our work life as we become more senior in our careers. We review designs for entire new systems written by partner developer teams. We review designs for pieces of automation to be developed and run by our own teams. Eventually we may find ourselves using review as a way to keep many teams in sync technically.\n\nMost of us however, don't have a systematic way to approach reviews. We read the proposal or attend the meeting, and we look to our experience to try and predict problems. This is valuable, and experience can't be replacedâ€”but I believe we can do better by applying both our expertise and a checklist of things to consider for each design.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
