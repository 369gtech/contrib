description: "Cloud environments provide everything you need to develop a conventional application as a Service, completely obscuring the underlying infrastructure. This style of software development is called ’Serverless’ development.\n\nThis could be the holy grail that saves development teams from maintenance and platform/server dependence. Many development teams are in the process of maintaining a monolithic application and are planning to migrate this application to a Serverless solution for this particular reason. But is this a valid reason in the context of the monolith?\n\nIn this talk we will go through a brief history of how we got here, and look at the steps that need to be taken when you are considering such a migration. I will provide the insights from my own experience so far. Building a Serverless solution is completely different from conventional application development, which raises a ton of questions about whether this is a suitable replacement for the monolith. Development teams need to be aware of both the technical and cultural impact on their team and even the company itself before initiating the migration."
