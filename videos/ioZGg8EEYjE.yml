title: 'Weighing up the pros and cons of build vs buy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623059988
description: "Every engineering team has had the great idea of building their very own product, only to find the excitingly simple vision is much more complex in practice. Similarly, we’ve often been surprised by how easy it is just to splash out and purchase a product, only to find out further down the line that it isn’t fit for purpose.\n\nHow do you make sure you’re making the right decision?\n\nIn this session, our panelists will discuss their own experiences approaching this decision, looking back at the times it hasn’t gone according to plan, and finally examine the scalability, security, and simplicity of both methods."
