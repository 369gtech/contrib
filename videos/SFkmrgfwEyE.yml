description: "PyData NYC 2018\n\nThis is a cautionary tale of how I spent a large amount of money running PySpark clusters and what I discovered about deploying a recommendation engine at scale. I’ll describe how I finally chased down an intermittent error and lessons learned along the way including why you can’t always write PySpark code like Python code and how important it is to check third party library integrations.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
