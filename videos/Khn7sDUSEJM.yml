title: 'Blazor, a new framework for browser-based .NET apps - Steve Sanderson'
language: English
recordingDate: 1581602543
description: "Blazor is a new web UI framework that has become one of the headline features of .NET Core 3 and beyond. It lets you build rich interactive user experiences in C# and Razor, offering the benefits of a single-page app (SPA) framework while keeping all your code and data in .NET. It gives you a modern component-based architecture for powerful code reuse, first-class development tools, and all the productivity of .NET.\n\nThis talk will focus mostly on Blazor WebAssembly, which lets you create true client-side applications. We'll go right from \"getting started\" up to much more advanced features such as strongly-typed API access, testing, deployment, and offline support. We'll even take an early preview of future features that are still being prototyped by the team.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
