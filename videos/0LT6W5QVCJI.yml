description: 'Polymer started as an experiment in pushing the web platform. In the two and a half years since, we’ve helped ship a lot of standards, a developer preview of Polymer, and learned a lot and heard a lot of feedback from developers. Matt will share what we’ve learned, the state of the art of Polymer today, and most importantly what’s next.'
