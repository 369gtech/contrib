But every dependency you rely on is also a vulnerability. Multiple high profile packages across platforms have been hijacked and modified with malicious code. This talk is about the value of auditing dependency updates and the tooling to make it less of a chore, including the introduction of a web-based diffing app and other tooling that helps you create an effortless auditing process.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/johanna-larsson/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - JOHANNA LARSSON\nContributed to Elixir core that one time\n\nJohanna is a polyglot developer working with anything from edge computing to data processing pipelines.
