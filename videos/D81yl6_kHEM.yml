title: 'How C++20 Changes the Way We Write Code'
language: English
recordingDate: 1612643973
description: "The upcoming C++20 standard is the biggest update in a decade. Its feature set and their impact on how we write C++ will be as large, and possibly larger than that of C++11.\n\nIn this talk we will look at how new features like concepts, coroutines, and modules will fundamentally change the way we design libraries, the way we think about functions, and even the way we compile our code. We will also mention some long-standing warts in C++ which are finally cured.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nThe CppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish CppCon Tech talks."
