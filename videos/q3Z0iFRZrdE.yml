description: "Speaker: Sergey Golovin\ngithub: @daynin\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/_sgolovin\n\nThis talk about how we improved our developer experience in CSSSR (https://csssr.com/en) with Github Actions. What we used before to automate linting, testing, building, and deploying all our projects.

I'm a big fan of open source, contributor in some projects, podcaster and co-organizer of a developers community\n\r\nEvent Page: https://github.com/SingaporeJS/talk.js/issues/42\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael Cheng"
