recordingDate: 1499244233
description: "Oculus, Daydream, Hololens, Gear VR and Vive are new worlds for computing. But if as web developers we think they have nothing to do with us, we are wrong. Web content and Progressive Web Apps for virtual and mixed reality will become the most important way to distribute content for these devices. Let's see how to start with them today.\n\nIn this talk we will introduce the new ways to browse web content on virtual and mixed realities that will become the main platform for content as users don't want to install native apps for short and temporal experiences. We will also see the new specs in the Web to support them, including how to connect to devices in the Physical World with pointers, space orientation and Bluetooth besides the main WebVR spec and the available extensions.\n\nWe will cover with live examples on stage: WebVR, 360 and 3D picture and video formats, WebBluetooth, how to serve 3D content and the experience of browsing the Web through Microsoft Hololens, Oculus, Daydream and other devices.\n\nWe will test Edge on a real Microsoft Hololens on stage, Samsung Internet Browser and Oculus Carmel Browser, Chrome on Daydream and more. We will even see how iPhone users can also take advantage of VR from Safari. We will analyze how to create interactive immersive experiences for each device today, the main new concepts we need to understand as web developers and how the experiences can be in a few years.\n\nOnce you are in the the new world, we will see how to interact with the real world using new APIs."
