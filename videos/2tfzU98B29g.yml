description: "Most of the teams are still in a never-ending quest for the documentation sweet spot. The place that you donâ€™t have spend too much time maintaining it, yet it brings a lot of value and is up to date.\n\nFor some the starting point was from agile manifesto or software craftsmanship misunderstanding, which is not-documenting at all. Others decided to build a comprehensive documentation, soon to discover it is a challenge to keep it up with the reality (which is the code).\n\nThere is a better way to build a good Developer Experience. I will share several options, that you may take advantage of, including:\n\npartially executable documentation without (non-docstring)\nhuman- and machine-readable HTTP API documentation\nautomated tests as documentation"
