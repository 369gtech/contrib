We will then learn about the basics of LUTs and how we can use them with Renderscript for creating filters. Finally, we will focus on the challenges that we faced while implementing filters on Android with the Renderscript framework.\nWe will try to use graphical representations wherever possible to explain all these concepts.\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/droidcon-italy\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
