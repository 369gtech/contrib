title: 'Quantum Computing Exposed: Hacking Nature''s Computer, with James Weaver & Johas Vos'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526553368
description: "The buzz about quantum computing has been rapidly increasing lately, and a growing number of developers have been looking into the subject. Concepts developers typically find challenging after cursory investigation of quantum computing include: superpositions of quantum bits (qubits), quantum gates, quantum entanglement (Einstein’s “spooky actions at a distance”), and the relevance of Schrödinger’s famous cat.\n\nIn this session, James Weaver will give a thorough introduction to quantum computing, including: A brief history of quantum computers, visualizing superpositions, composing quantum algorithms with quantum gates, understanding Shor’s potentially RSA encryption busting algorithm, and current status of quantum computers."
