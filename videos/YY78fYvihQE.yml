description: "Software teams at Atlassian are discovering Docker as their ultimate hammer to nail (allthethings). From setting up portable development environments, to deploying services on an internal PaaS which supports Docker as a first class citizen. It is also finding it's way into Atlassian's products, with support for Docker-based builds in Bamboo and delivering Software to the customer inside containers, starting with Stash.\n\nOne of the teams that have an even more spectacular use-case is Atlassian's Files Team. Hear about the team's architecture, and how they're using Docker spin up millions of short-lived containers in their processing infrastructure to convert assets of over 40.000 companies in a reliable, secure and scalable fashion."
