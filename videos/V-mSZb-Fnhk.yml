description: "Kubernetes is like an onion. Many layers. Each layer brings its own set of vulnerabilities; learning how to mitigate them is important.\n\nDuring this presentation you will learn how to analyze, scan, and fix your vulnerabilities, starting from the infrastructure and moving all the way up to the application runtime.\n\nJulien is a Solution Engineer at Giant Swarm. Having background as a Java developer and a lot of frustration acquired, he was able to find his way in DevOps culture, Docker and Kubernetes, and containerization stuff & OSS community. He fell in love with Go and tries to bring other people along. He likes to share his passion with Belgian Tech Communities. He currently helps on running applications securely and successfully on kubernetes."
