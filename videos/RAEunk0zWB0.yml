description: "Bryan Robbins (FINRA) and Daniel Koo (FINRA)\n\nDelivering software faster without compromising quality is not a trivial task. We all desire to move at speed by developing tests early and executing tests faster, with a minimal maintenance footprint. At FINRA, we developed MSL (pronounced \"Missile\") to enable Agile teams leveraging layered architectures such as MVC to test their UI code sooner and faster in isolation.\n\nMSL supports integration testing of UI code (such as Javascript, HTML, CSS) by deploying locally on a Node.js server and configuring mock HTTP responses from test code using one of our clients (Java, Javascript, or Node.js). This talk will introduce key features of MSL with a few examples."
