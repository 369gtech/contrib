The Heroic-era huts of Scott and Shackleton lay abandoned for decades before the US Navy briefly visited Antarctica in the late 1940s. The establishment of American and New Zealand scientific bases in the 1950s resulted in a range of interventions that have had significant impacts on the huts, their environs and associated artifacts.\n\nSpeaker: Bryan Lintott\nLintott is Director of the Ferrymeade Heritage Park in Christchurch, New Zealand. He has conducted historic preservation research of American and New Zealand research outposts in Antarctica and presented his findings internationally."
