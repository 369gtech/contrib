title: 'Dist::Zilla and My Bundle - Dave Rolsky'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623183899
description: "Dist::Zilla (dzil) is a fantastic tool for anyone who releases modules to CPAN. It automates many of the test and release steps, allowing you to focus on your code, not your packaging.\n\nI'll tell you what Dist::Zilla can do, then explain how I use it, and in particular how I've structured my dzil plugin bundle. A bundle takes dzil's meta up another notch, making it much easier to apply a complex dzil config across many distributions."
