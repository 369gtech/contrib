But scientific research (and any fan of concerts!) has shown that our senses are interconnected: they intermingle to create a full-bodied moment.\n\nTo explore the intersection between our senses, we created a new musical experience: the performer at her (tiny and portable) piano extends her gestures to the audience, triggering (via a Kinect) sounds and tones through the speakers of their mobile phones. The audience also becomes an involved performer, by augmenting and distorting the sounds with their own movements.\n\nDuring this talk, we’ll break through the fourth wall of performance and demonstrate how this musical experience was technically accomplished via JS / Web Audio / your ears, as well as invoke the piece itself in a meta experience with the audience (as long as the wifi cooperates!).\n\nhttp://rejectjs.org - http://twitter.com/rejectjs\nMusic by: https://soundcloud.com/7digits\nVideo by: http://wecap.de"
