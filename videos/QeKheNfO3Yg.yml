We all have worked with architects, some good, and some that could be better.\n\nWhat are the traits of a good architect?\n\nWhat are the skills and qualities we should pick to become a very good one?\n\nCome to this presentation to learn about things that can make that journey to be a successful architect a pleasant one.\n\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston. He has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences.
