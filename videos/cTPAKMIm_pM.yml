description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA.\nSpeaker: Dr. David Syer and Phil Webb\nAre you an impatient programmer who wishes the keyboard could keep up with you? If you've ever wished Java and Spring could do more to keep up, then this is the place to be. We present Spring Boot, a toolkit and runtime platform that will get you up and running with Spring-powered, production-grade applications and services faster than you believed possible. The goals are:\n\n    Radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for Spring development\n    Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults\n    Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration)\n    First class support for REST-ful services, modern web applications, batch jobs, and enterprise integration\n    Applications that adapt their behavior or configuration to their environment\n    Optionally use Groovy features like DSLs and AST transformations to accelerate the implementation of basic business requirements We illustrate how these goals can be achieved through a series of demonstrations, and in-depth reviews of the design principles and codebase of new features in Spring Framework 4.0 and in the wider Spring Ecosystem .\n\nLearn more about Spring Boot at http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/"
