description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nIntro & Deep Dive: Kubernetes SIG-Storage - Xing Yang, VMware & Michelle Au, Google \n\nKubernetes SIG Storage is responsible for ensuring that different types of file and block storage are available wherever a container is scheduled, storage capacity management (container ephemeral storage usage, volume resizing, etc.), influencing scheduling of containers based on storage (data gravity, availability, etc.), and generic operations on storage (snapshotting, etc.). In this session, we will give an introduction to SIG Storage and then deep dive into some projects that SIG Storage is currently working on, provide an update on the current status, and discuss what might be coming in the future. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekHD"
