description: "Karthik Nilakant, Xero\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss the different aspects of incident management and how we've built automation around each part at Xero. This includes: transforming manual alerts into automatic notifications through an issue report pipeline; a chat bot that streamlines incident coordination by facilitating effective communication and providing guidance through the process; and how we extract data from each incident for postmortem review. I'll also discuss how our tools have evolved and the lessons we learned on the way.\n\nView the full SREcon18 Asia/Australia Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
