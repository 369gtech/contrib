description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nTune It Up! Enabling Low Latency in Kubernetes Clusters - Francesco Romani & Yanir Quinn, Red Hat \n\nNow that Kubernetes has conquered the cloud it’s time for it to move on other domains, like CNF (Cloud-native Network Functions), the cornerstone of 5G deployments! However, to make that happen, we need to address an important limitation: ensuring low latency. In this talk we will first and foremost give an overview of the most important setting relevant to optimal low-latency behaviour, demonstrating the level of detail we can achieve in fine-tuning a cluster. We will explore the kubelet settings (topology and cpu manager), the kernel settings on the node (using tuned) and how they interact to deliver the workload guarantees. The talk will help in gaining a better understanding of what Kubernetes provides for this specific and demanding class of workload, considering the planned enhancements coming in the next releases, like the kubelet memory manager. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekDp"
