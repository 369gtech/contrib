description: 'When humanity is inevitably subjugated by intelligent machines, which language will power the minds of our cruel overlords? Clojure, I hope. One of the more popular tools for machine learning today is Google’s Tensorflow library. Earlier this year, Google made it possible for any language to leverage Tensorflow’s plumbing via a C API. Guildsman is a library that brings the power of Tensorflow to Clojure. This talk will cover machine learning and Tensorflow, as well as the design and usage of Guildsman.'
