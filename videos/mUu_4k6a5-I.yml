recordingDate: 1556891150
description: "\"Speaker: Luciano Ramalho\n\nObjects and classes are part of Python since version 1 -- not an afterthought. But all languages implement and support OOP in different ways. \"\"Classic\"\" patterns that make sense elsewhere may not be as useful in Python, and Python provides unique solutions to some familiar problems.\n\nThis tutorial is about modern, idiomatic OOP in Python 3.7. Most of the discussion will be relevant to previous versions all the way to Python 2.7, but newer features will be highlighted.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
