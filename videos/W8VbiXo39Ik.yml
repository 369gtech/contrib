title: 'How to migrate a MySQL Database to Vitess'
language: English
recordingDate: 1584734110
description: "Though starting off new projects on Vitess is generally a friction-free process, in a lot of cases, the need for horizontal sharding doesn’t become apparent until rapid growth has already pushed the boundaries of a single MySQL instance. This webinar will discuss a basic process that will allow you to test and gradually cut over to Vitess when your application can’t afford to go down in the process.\n\nPresenter: Liz van Dijk, Solution Architect and Field Operations @PlanetScale"
