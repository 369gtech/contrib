description: 'Java, the runtime, likes memory. And it is also a fact well known to those who know it well, that subtle differences in code, result in drastic changes to applications memory and runtime profiles. I''ll take you through the memory lane part of my work, and show how do I approach analysis, problems and troubleshooting. Tools, what information can they surface, and how to navigate back to the code. Techniques and libraries, how do they affect what the application does. Feel invited if you believe troubleshooting memory in Java is ''magic'', or ''only tuning the GC can save us''.'
