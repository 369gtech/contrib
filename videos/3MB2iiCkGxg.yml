title: 'Curiously Recurring C++ Bugs at Facebook'
language: English
recordingDate: 1518983556
description: "I've spent the last few years watching Facebook's C++ codebase grow by several orders of magnitude. Despite constantly improving abstractions, constantly improving tooling, frequent internal courses, and ongoing internal discussion, there are bug-patterns we simply cannot stop from being reintroduced into our code. My hope is to show some of the most common (and infamous) bugs in our history, and the surprising complexity that arises in some apparently simple situations.\n\nThis talk serves the dual purpose of educating the intermediate (and perhaps the occasional advanced) C++ programmer about some really nasty common pitfalls, as well as serves as a plea to experts to help further improve the language, libraries, and best practices to help educate and eradicate some of these problematic patterns.\n\nEVENT:\n\nCppCon 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nLouis Brandy: Engineering Director, Facebook\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nCppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video."
