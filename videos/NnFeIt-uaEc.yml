description: "From OSCON 2014: \"Anticipating the Future: An Introduction to Value Chain Mapping.\" Apparently we are living through a time of disruptive innovation, with the creation of new value and the destruction of old norms. Cloud computing, Big Data, the rise of open source and the internet of things are all examples of this -- or so we are told. But whilst we all have inertia to change, disruption implies that the change is unexpected, even unpredictable. However, if you have 20 years to plan for something, can you really call it surprising, random or unexpected?\n\nAlas, it turns out that companies are being disrupted by broadly predictable changes. But how can this be? The problem is poor situational awareness to the point of blindness. In this keynote, I will present the general principles of industry change and describe what can and cannot be predicted. I will then examine how companies can better understand the environment around them and by anticipating the nature of change then manipulate the market in their favor through open techniques.\n\nAbout Simon Wardley (Leading Edge Forum [CSC]):\nSimon Wardley, based in the UK, is a Researcher for CSC's Leading Edge Forum, a global research and advisory programme that explores new thinking and develops next practice roadmaps that address the major challenges at the intersection of business, IT and management.
