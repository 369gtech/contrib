title: 'Resiliency and Availability Design Patterns for the Cloud by Sebastien Stormacq'

description: "We have traditionally built robust architectures by trying to avoid mistakes or failures in production, or by testing parts of the system in isolation. However, modern techniques take a very different approach: embracing failure instead of trying to avoid it. Resilient architectures enhance observability, leverage well-known patterns such as graceful degradation, timeouts and circuit breakers but also new patterns like cell-based architecture and shuffle sharding.\n\nIn this session, will review the most useful patterns for building resilient software systems and especially show the audience how they can benefit from the patterns.\n\nSeb is inspiring builders to unlock the value of the AWS cloud, using his secret blend of passion, enthusiasm, customer advocacy, curiosity and creativity.\n\nSÃ©bastien worked as consultant and pre-sales engineer for the last 20+ years with large enterprises and startups helping them transform business requirements into technical solutions, unlock the value of middleware, mobile applications, and scale systems to meet customer demand.\n\nBefore joining the AWS Evangelist team, Seb built & lead the AWS technical training team in EMEA, and the Alexa solution architecture team in UK, France, Italy and Spain."
