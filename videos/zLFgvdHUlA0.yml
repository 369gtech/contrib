In this talk Iâ€™ll show you the most common and daily spring usage for implementing design patterns which will make your code more: clean, flexible and maintainable. We wall not talk about patterns and concepts which already comes with spring and everybody knows, like factory, singleton and inversion of control, but patterns or technics which naturally can be implemented with spring, like: chain of responsibility, strategy, command, lazy initialization, scala traits, AOP, proxy, decorator and more."
