description: "Vince Knight\n\nThis talk will culminate in describing a Django Rest Framework I have built to keep track of the behaviours (\"tricks\") that my dog has learnt for the sport of discdog which involves acrobatic catches of frisbees. The tool also generates a particular sequence of these behaviours (a \"routine\") which ensures our training sessions always serve the purpose of being mentally stimulating.\n\nI will start by describing some modern concepts of dog behaviour and present their parallels to higher education pedagogy (my day job is an educator).\n\nFollowing this I will describe the sport of discdog and show some videos and photos of what it entails. (This is the cool part of the talk.)\n\nI will then describe the tool that has been built and describe how it assists with our training.\n\nThis talk should be of interest to people who don't dislike dogs, like cool things and/or want to see how someone who is not a web developer used the Django Rest Framework to improve a part of their life.\n\nDepending on how much time I have to work on the tool there's a chance that there will be some machine learning as well (because \"machine learning\", who knows maybe even some blockchain). That's a joke, there will not be blockchain."
