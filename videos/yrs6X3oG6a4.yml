title: 'Concierge: Bringing OSGi (Back) to Embedded Devices'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784749
description: "OSGi is a set of open standards maintained by the OSGi Alliance that describes a dynamic module system for the Java language. Concierge strives to be a minimal-footprint implementation of the OSGi core standards targeting resource-constrained embedded devices. Although the existing version has targeted OSGi R3, there are ongoing efforts to bring Concierge under the Eclipse umbrella and make it compliant with the current OSGi R5 standard. In this presentation, hear about the systems issues involved in downsizing and optimizing OSGi for embedded systems and see demonstrations of how Java and OSGi can be effectively used in this realm.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJan Rellermeyer\nJan S.
