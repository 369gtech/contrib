The early goal was to enable teams to deploy and operate ML solutions at Uber scale. Now, their focus has shifted towards developer velocity and empowering the individual model owners to be fully self-sufficient from early prototyping through full production deployment & operationalization.\n\nThis presentation was recorded at QCon San Francisco 2018: https://bit.ly/2uYyHLb \n\nThe next QCon is Qcon New York 2019 – June 24-26, 2019: http://bit.ly/2Uyj39C \n\nFor more awesome presentations on innovator and early adopter topics check InfoQ’s selection of talks from conferences worldwide https://bit.ly/2tm9loz\n\nInterested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Engineering?
