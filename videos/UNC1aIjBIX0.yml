title: 'Monitoring And Metrics With Grails 3'
recordingDate: 1472205601
description: "Note: We are aware, that audio after the intro is very low. We're trying to fix it, mean while turn up the volume when Jeff starts to speak.\n\nKnowing what is going on inside of a running Grails application can be an important part of optimizing a production environment. This can be particularly important in a micro-service architecture where there are multiple pieces of the system which may need to be scaled up/down independent of the rest of the system in response to changing load conditions. Grails 3 offers very powerful capabilities related to monitoring and metrics. This session will discuss and demonstrate those capabilities."
