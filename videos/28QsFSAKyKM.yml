title: 'Ruben Mak - The causal problem of overexposure to repetitive ads: instrument variables and pymc3'
language: English
recordingDate: 1610574264
description: "PyData Eindhoven 2020\n\nRise of the internet has created opportunities to specifically target consumers. Counterintuitively, this has resulted in overexposure of users to repetitive ads. In this talk, I will show why this is a result of causality problems using a case study. I will demonstrate how we apply instrumental variables and pymc3 to solve these problems.\n\n===\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
