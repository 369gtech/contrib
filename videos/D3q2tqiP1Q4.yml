description: "This is a video of Mike William's talk at Lonedon Erlang Factory Lite 2012 http://www.erlang-factory.com/\n\nFor many years, I have been trying to define the \"ideal programmer\" only to come to the realisation that they don't exist. This talk will be about the people and skill you must have in your team if you are to run a successful project. It will also touch on what you need to avoid as well"
