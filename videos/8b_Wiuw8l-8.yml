language: English
recordingDate: 1627416337
description: "JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) on Azure App Service is now generally available. Azure App Service is a managed hosting service for web and API applications, providing features for auto-scaling, networking, authorization, and more.\n\nOur speakers will show you how to deploy Web Application Archive (WAR) and Enterprise Application Archive (EAR) Java applications to JBOSS EAP using Azure App Service’s deployment API’s, or CI/CD integration. We’ll also cover how to enable auto-scaling to automatically handle periods of higher volume and load.\n\nWe'll also share details on the latest Maven plugin for Azure Web Apps, which provides a brand new experience that enables you to deploy not only application artifacts such as JAR, WAR, and EAR files but also application dependencies like libraries, module definitions, and startup scripts -- using one single Maven Goal."
