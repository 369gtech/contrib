description: "A talk from Barcelona Ruby Conference 2013 (http://baruco.org)\n\nThis is a scary story about scary Ruby internals -- told as a fairy tale, but with a rather gloomy ending. There's a lot going on under the hood in MRI, YARV and Rubinius. The C and C++ layer that interacts with the OS is a tangly mess full of tricky bugs and arcane issues; the kind of issues that don't raise exceptions, but kill whole processes and make them bleed rainbows. The kind of issues that only show up when you deploy massive Ruby systems at a large scale. This is a talk about how we discover, tackle and fix these fundamental flaws in the Ruby VM at GitHub, one of the largest Ruby deployments in the world. Ruby internals are hard. This fairy tale may not have a happy ending.\n\nhttp://www.baruco.org/talks/once-upon-a-time-ruby\n\nRecorded & produced by El Cocu (http://elcocu.com)"
