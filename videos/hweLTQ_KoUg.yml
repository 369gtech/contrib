title: 'Building DSLs with Scala - Alon Muchnik (Hebrew)'
recordingDate: 1484583306
description: "DSLs are everywhere. Have you ever used SQL, Ant or maybe HTML? If so you were using a DSL, maybe without realizing it. Domain-Specific Languages, or DSLs, provide convenient syntactical means of expressing goals in a given problem domain. A well-crafted DSL communicates the essence and means of the domain it represents in a natural way, so that you don’t even think about its underlying technology.\n\n?Scala’s rich, flexible syntax combined with its OO and functional features makes writing DSLs a breeze. In this talk I'll introduce the concept of DSLs, where to best apply them, their pros and cons, and how to integrate DSLs into your core application. We will see a practical example of how to lever the tools Scala gives us and build our very own tax calculation DSL."
