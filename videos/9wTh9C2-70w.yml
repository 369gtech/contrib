description: "# Talks:\n\n## Ben Smith (AWS) - Growing your serverless app\n\nSo your serverless proof of concept became an MVP (minimum viable product) and launched to your customers with great success. Now you need to grow and expand that serverless application in functionality and complexity to deal with increased business needs. How should you think about tackling challenges such as when to break apart functions, create new APIs, and create new AWS Lambda “microservices” to overcome organizational challenges? How can you use features of AWS to help facilitate this? In this session, learn how to tackle the real scaling challenges, not getting your application to handle more requests, but getting your team to scale its development and do less while seeing more of the benefits of serverless.\n\n## Taavi Rehemägi (Dashbird) - Well-Architected Framework through the Serverless lens\n\nTaavi will be covering the AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) through the serverless lens. He’ll be working through the importance of the WAF and how to build and operate complex Well-Architected serverless applications, allowing developers to layer on complexity in time while maintaining a reliable infrastructure. Including the challenges, risks, and solutions when building a Well-Architected infrastructure, as well as how to implement and test workload throughout its lifecycle."
