description: "CF Killed the ITSM Star - Kyle Campos, CSAA Insurance\n\nThe enterprise change process is filled with tickets, approvals and all forms of non-deterministic change review and time wasting gates that dominate the ITSM landscape. Cloud Foundry has thrown a monkey wrench into ITSM in the form of high velocity change via CI/CD and a healthy embrace of the DevOps \"automate all the things\" mantra.\n\nOur DevOps and PCF platform leader, Kyle Campos, will talk about how we at CSAA are raising the quality and security bars of the platform even as deployment velocity increases through infrastructure and application CI/CD pipelines and how automation can serve the ITSM overlords through higher levels of determinism.\n\nAbout Kyle Campos\nKyle is a digital transformation and cloud operations leader who for the past 20 years has worked to turn non-scalable, resource intensive and painful systems into automated, scalable and efficient systems. Currently at CSAA Insurance Kyle leads the digital security, QA, support, analytics and platform teams who are working hard to deliver to application teams all the promises of a highly available, highly performant PaaS through Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Kyle is also the Co-Founder of Commit.to and a previous speaker at CF Summit Europe and OpenStack Conf."
