description: "Silicon Valley spent the last 10 years building digital addiction machines. And during the 2016 U.S. Election, Russia, Trump and their allies hijacked them. All across Europe, elections have been targeted by Russian propagandists determined to aggravate underlying cultural divides. Alt-right data & AI strategists at Cambridge Analytica are targeting democracies in India, Australia, Kenya, and South America. As platforms struggle to determine their role in the new emerging world order, our biggest strategic advantage as technologists has become fluency in three areas: The motivations and behavior of the international actors at play, a systems understanding of the political and economic drivers of technology, and a deep focus on how to protect the tools that we build every day.\n\n# Berit Anderson\nBerit Anderson is the CEO and Editor-in-Chief of Scout.ai, which creates media to help you anticipate the impacts of technology. She frequently speaks about her work on Weaponized AI Propaganda and its impact on international democracy. In 2017 she won a debate with the former prime minister of Sweden about whether the internet is a force for democracy.\n\nShe has worked closely with her family to run Strategic News Service, a predictive newsletter read by Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos, as well as the SNS FiRe conference, which brings together C-level technology executives, world-class scientists, and Oscar-winning documentary filmmakers to discuss how science and technology are reshaping our world."
