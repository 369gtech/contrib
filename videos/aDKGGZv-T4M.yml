description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nOctober 22, 2009\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Jeremie Lenfant -Engelmann, Google, at the 4th Annual Google Test Automation Conference, October 21st, 22nd, 2009, Zurich, CH\r\n\r\nThe proliferation of JavaScript unit-testing frameworks in the JavaScript community shows that no one has yet found the magical combination of features to make JavaScript testing a no-brainer. We like to believe that JsTestDriver will change that by redefining JavaScript testing frameworks and as a result will deliver something which at first glance seems impossible. As a developer of JavaScript I want to write my production and test code in my favorite IDE. When I make a code change, I want a save action to trigger a rerun off all of my tests on all browsers and platforms and report the results under 1 second. All of this without ever leaving my favorite IDE. JsTestDriver achieves all of the above by capturing any number of browser slaves from multiple platforms. In order to run at high speed we do not render our results in the browser but report the errors on the command line. JsTestDriver also loads and parses JavaScript files eagerly, only reloading files that have changed. JsTestDriver can execute hundreds of tests per browser and execute them on all of the captured browsers in parallel. Thanks to these practices we achieve extremely high throughput. We want to be a test-runner platform and allow others to build assertion frameworks on top of JsTestDriver. This way the open-source community can focus on building a better way of testing and not worry about how to run the tests across all of the browsers, platforms and in a continuous build environment.\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver\r\n \r\nBio: Jeremie Lenfant-Engelmann works for Google and is the lead developer of JsTestDriver."
