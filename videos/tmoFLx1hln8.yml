title: 'Agile Adria 2013 / Andrea Tomasini: Why Practices Are Not As Important As Principles'
language: English
recordingDate: 1373211022
description: "One might wonder why it's not so easy to adopt agile engineering practices and to achieve technical excellence.\nWhen we think of practices, we tend to think of simple things: sticking a shopping list on the fridge with a magnet, having a clear and prioritized list of things to do, and doing them in that order.\nWhy is it then that with Agile practices, things don't work out quite so well? What is it that Teams aren't getting right? Is it that we don't have the right Software tools? Perhaps it's that we're not collocated?\nThe Agile dilemma is this: \"To effectively apply practices, you need to under the principle, but to understand the principles, you need to practice!\" Simple... And yet incredibly complicate"
