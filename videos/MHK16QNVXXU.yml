Often misunderstood is the culture required to foster dedicated talent.\n\nWalmart prides itself on having a culture of grassroots driven improvement and the approach to Continuous Delivery has been no different.\n\nHear from members of a Walmart development team as they describe the actions they took to move towards CD: what worked, what didn't work, and what they've learned. They'll explain why driving to CD builds the kind of teams that are a strategic advantage to the enterprise.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
