recordingDate: 1519313108
description: "Why should we monitor our system? Why can’t we just rely on the operations team anymore? They use to be able to do that. What’s currently changing? Presentation content: - Why do we monitor our system - How did it use to work? - Whats changing - Why do we need to shift focus - Everyone should be on call. - Resilience is the goal (Best way of having someone care about quality is to make them responsible)\n\nCarl Bergquist, Grafana Labs\nCarl always had one foot in operations as well as development. Loves watching people learn more about their systems and customers using metrics. Strongly believes that the community can do better then any organisation by itself.\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp"
