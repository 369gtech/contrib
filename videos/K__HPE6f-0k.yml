description: 'Since the Kickstarter campaign in August 2012, Oculus Rift targeted games for Virtual Reality. "If a game works, then everything will work". Even though VR has been used a lot for business and industrial purposes, the community of VR and game developers pushed forward the platform and the limits of this new medium. In this talk I will analyze the process of design and development of Yon Paradox, sharing our results on what went good and what didn''t work.'
