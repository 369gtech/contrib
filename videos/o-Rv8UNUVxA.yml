language: English
recordingDate: 1543408705
description: "If your team uses velocity for planning but you don't find it very useful, this session is for you. If your manager or scrum master or other pseudo-authority figure keeps obsessing over your velocity, this session is for you. If you want to know about better ways to forecast when a piece of work will be done or how to gather data that actually helps your team, this session is for you. Doc Norton shares stories and science detailing why velocity isn't a very good metric, talks about some common velocity anti-patterns, and shares what metrics you could use instead. You'll be able to better forecast when work will be done and you'll be better able to diagnose issues with your process and work toward correcting them.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
