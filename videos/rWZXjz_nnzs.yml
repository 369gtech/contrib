title: 'Internals of Exceptions - Adam Furmanek'
recordingDate: 1531982763
description: "You know how to throw and catch exception. But do you know how are they implemented internally? Do you know what is SEH, VEH and VCH in Windows? Or do you know why C# introduced exceptions filters or how to catch everything, even StackOverflowException?\nIn this presentation I show internal mechanisms used by Windows for handling exceptions. We will see constructs used by C++ and C# languages, CLR instructions and machine code details of those. There will be some live debugging and low to high level code."
