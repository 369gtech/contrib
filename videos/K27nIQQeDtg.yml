description: "From Velocity Santa Clara 2015: Verizon Digital Media (formerly Edgecast)'s Chief Architect on the company's role and purpose.\n\nAbout Robert Peters:\nRob Peters is one of the early members of Verizon Digital Media Services’ engineering group. He currently leads teams that work with the company’s core http cache/proxy engine and its surrounding infrastructure ecosystem of software and hardware. He enjoys deliberating about deployment methodologies, looking at graphs and grids full of colorful numbers, and is often mistaken for a subversion and perl fan.\n\nRob completed a Ph.D. in Computation & Neural Systems from the California Institute of Technology and spent several years in post-doctoral work at the University of Southern California building biologically-inspired computer vision software.
