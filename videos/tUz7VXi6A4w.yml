description: "LUIS is launching a new set of features that\nEnable a more integrated experience for building end to end bot intelligence with NLU interfaces. LUIS is fully integrated with Speech, Text Analytics, and machine translation from Cognitive Services to enable bots that you can text or talk to, converse with in multiple languages and even further get sentiment and do key phrase extraction.\nEnhance the core language understanding capabilities including patterns, regex entity, and the conversation state as a feature to the intent and entity models for more accurate prediction.\nThe session will focus on illustrating the new capabilities, show examples of how to use them, and demonstrate their usage in some bot scenarios"
