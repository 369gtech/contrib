description: "\"From development to production: the many uses of serverless observability\" by Emrah Samdan\nServerless observability is commonly thought of as something useful while running your large serverless applications in production. But, did you know how it can be a valuable tool for dev and test as well? What about small or simple serverless applications? Or, if you're just running a few simple functions? How helpful can observability really be? The answer: VERY! The basics of observability and why it's useful for both known, predictable failures AND unknown, non-predictable failures Why observability is particularly useful for serverless applications How observability is valuable during development and while debugging How observability can be used to test your application How observability is useful in production with both small and large deployments."
