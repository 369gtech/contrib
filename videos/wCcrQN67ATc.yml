recordingDate: 1253915813
description: 'This is Part 2. Presented by Dr. Saul Griffith of energyliteracy.com. This webcast takes a scientific look (physics and chemistry based) at all of the earth''s energy resources, both stored (nuclear and fossil fuels) as well as renewable (solar, wind, wave, geothermal, tidal, wave, photosynthetic). This talk aims to inspire people that the problem is solvable with rational, data-driven development of the appropriate technologies, both in clean energy generation and in energy conservation. It aims to inject a rational perspective on the energy debate by showing the real numbers and potential of various energy sources to contribute to a balanced future energy supply.'
