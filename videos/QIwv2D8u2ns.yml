description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nSponsored Session: Sysdig - Securing Containers and Kubernetes on AWS  \n\n As containers and Kubernetes become the standard for application deployment the lack of visibility creates a security challenge. You need granular visibility with context to secure the build pipeline, detect and respond to runtime threats, continuously validate compliance, and monitor and troubleshoot cloud infrastructure and services. By leveraging an OSS security stack, including Falco and sysdig OSS, you benefit from community innovation. Watch this video to learn how to confidently secure containers running on Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, and AWS Fargate. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff1w"
