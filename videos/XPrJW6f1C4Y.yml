description: "20 years ago, a rebellious gang of developers got fed up with waterfall software development and started an agile revolution. The revolution spread from enterprises to startups and back to enterprises.\n\nBut the revolution has failed. We'll look at stories of how it's failed. We'll talk about why it's failed. We'll talk about why, even when everything goes right, agile still too often succeeds at building the best possible *wrong* thing.\n\nAfter talking about how it's a failure, we'll talk about why it's absolutely necessary if we're to win the new revolution to come.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/agile-the-bad-parts\n \nMatt Parker, Head of Engineering, Pivotal Labs, Pivotal\nMartina Hodges-Schell, Head of Product Design, Pivotal Labs\nPivotal\n\nJoanna Beltowska, Head of Product Management, Pivotal Labs\nPivotal \nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
