description: "Useless \\?yüs-l?s\\ use·less: not fulfilling or not expected to achieve the intended purpose or desired outcome. [Synonyms: futile, (in) vain, pointless, to no purpose, ineffectual, ineffective, to no effect, unprofitable] If you want to stop building useless software, you have to start understanding your customers. Empathy mapping is a simple activity for your team, stakeholders & anyone who is responsible for delivering products & services. You collectively explore what your customers see, hear, say & do, as well as consider what they think & feel. You gain insights into their pains & potential wants which are the keys to building more useful software. In this session, Diane shows you how to build an empathy map & points out the potential biases to watch out for as you go. You will learn how easy it is to work collaboratively to create a shared understanding of the customer. And that is the first step to start building software that customers find useful.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
