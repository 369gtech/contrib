recordingDate: 1486032866
description: "The production of software is a complex, collaborative process that stretches our ability as human beings to cope with its demands.\n\nMany people working in software development spend their careers without seeing what good really looks like.\n\nOur history is littered with inefficient processes creating poor quality output, too late to capitalise on the expected business value. How have we got into this state? How do we get past it? What does good really look like?\n\nContinuous Delivery changes the economics of software development for some of the biggest companies in the world, whatever the nature of their software development, find out how and why.\n\nDave Farley is a thought-leader in the field of Continuous Delivery, DevOps and Software Development in general. He is co-author of the Jolt-award winning book ‘Continuous Delivery’ a regular conference speaker and blogger and one of the authors of the Reactive Manifesto.\n\nDave has been having fun with computers for over 30 years. During that period, he has worked on most types of software, from firmware, through tinkering with operating systems and device drivers, to writing games, and commercial applications of all shapes and sizes.He started working in large scale distributed systems about 25 years ago, doing research into the development of loose-coupled, message-based systems - a forerunner of MicroService architectures.\n\nDave has a wide range of experience leading the development of complex software in teams, both large and small, in the UK and USA. Dave was an early adopter of agile development techniques, employing iterative development, continuous integration and significant levels of automated testing on commercial projects from the early 1990s.\n\nDave is the former Head of Software development at LMAX Ltd, home of the OSS Disruptor, a company that are well known for the excellence of their code and the exemplary nature of their development process.\n\nDave is now an independent software developer and consultant, and founder and director of Continuous Delivery Ltd.\n\nFor more on YOW!
