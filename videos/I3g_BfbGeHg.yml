recordingDate: 1515770023
description: "Building infrastructure in the cloud is a different paradigm to that of physical data centers. The infrastructure we deploy today has no guarantee to be there tomorrow. You therefore need to change how you design infrastructure.\n\nIn this talk, Paul will look at some real world examples of how to deploy infrastructure to the cloud that self heals and is scalable to withstand 3rd party provider outages. This should help you think about ways to avoid that 4am pager alert."
