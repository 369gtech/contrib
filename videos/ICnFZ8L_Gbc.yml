title: 'Keynote | Flink First: Designing Modern Trading Systems - Peter Chalif'
recordingDate: 1604056109
description: "When thinking of data-driven industry sectors, financial services might not be the first that come to mind. However, when we consider the 3Vs of big data  — volume, velocity, and variety — there is probably no other industry that embodies all three big data aspects like Finance! \n\nCoupled with a constant stream of new regulations and reporting standards, the numerous types of trading platforms with specific dimensions (such as their functions, speed, user interactivity, etc.), and the ever-changing regulatory requirements, Big Data in the financial services sector has been one of the hardest problems to solve. \n\nAnd while Lambda architecture and its ability to combine both batch and stream processing under the same, shared serving layer brought new hope, Big Data processing in financial services is still one of the hardest problems to solve. Data professionals in our sector need to consider industry-specific requirements when designing their software and deploying their code, such as the intersection of conflicting performance characteristics, the importance of data replay for financial services as well as any additional regulatory and auditability requirements.\n\nAs we transform ourselves and our teams to a new data reality, we have come to view Apache Flink and a stream processing infrastructure as a fundamental building block to our technology stack instead of a special component for a specific problem. Join us to learn how this mindset change directly affects your design mindset specifically when it comes to your: \n- Data Infrastructure\n- Software Continuity & Redundancy\n- Software Design\n- Data Design\n- Logging & Metrics, and more.\n\nJoin this keynote, to explore how modern, stream processing frameworks like Apache Flink can fundamentally change Big Data in the financial services industry."
