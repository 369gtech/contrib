description: "Reject.JS 2014 – Berlin, September 11, 2014\n\nWeb developers like us who attend such beautiful conferences in beautiful cities tend to follow the “Scratch your own itch” mantra as a gospel. We’re good at building solutions to our own problems and those of our peer groups, but we’re too often bad at thinking beyond. And it’s time that we scratch that.\n\nOne of my main comprehensions throughout my work as a web developer and Open Source contributor was: when I want to become a better developer, I have to stop doing nothing but solving the same problems in just slightly different ways over and over again.\n\nIn this talk, I want to show you what I learned, how this is related to cultural topics and getting aware of my own privileges – and what there is to be done beyond scratching our own itches.\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
