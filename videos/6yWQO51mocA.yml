description: "A note on this interview’s audio quality\nThis was one of the first Unscripted interviews we recorded in a busy live conference setting and without our usual recording setup, which is reflected in the somewhat low audio quality you’ll hear in this episode. This is not reflective of the audio quality featured in most of our videos, and we hope you’ll find that the fantastic content more than makes up for it.\n\nThis interview was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2019 for GOTO Unscripted. #GOTOcon #GOTOUnscripted #GOTOchgo\nhttps://gotopia.tech\n\nRead the full transcription of this interview here:\nhttps://gotopia.tech/articles/real-life-quantum-computing\n\nJessica Pointing - Award-winning quantum computing researcher\nGuen Prawiroatmodjo - Quantum Physicist making quantum programming possible\nJørn Larsen - CEO of Trifork\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:27 What led you to study quantum computing?\n03:46 What is quantum computing?\n04:56 Quantum computing and Albert Einstein\n05:40 Do we have a notion of certainty?\n08:16 What are potential applications of QC?\n09:52 Cybersecurity risks with quantum computers\n11:35 Is traveling through time possible with quantum computers?\n14:08 Quantum computers & how they are built\n17:54 Clustering quantum computers\n20:26 Quantum computing algorithms\n22:10 Gates in quantum computing\n26:50 How long can the superposition be maintained?\n28:08 Implementing quantum computers\n30:00 What can you do with quantum computing today?\n32:22 Quantum speedup, advantage or supremacy\n34:00 What are the problems quantum computing is solving right now?\n35:50 Is there a Moore's Law in quantum computing?\n37:58 How can you get started in this field?\n39:39 Outro\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOinterview #QuantumComputing #Quantum #QuantumPhysics #QuantumComputers #QuantumMechanics #JessicaPointing #GuenPrawiroatmodjo #Cryptography #Qubit #Quantumbit #superposition #QuantumSpeedup #QuantumAdvantage #QuantumSupremacy #RentRule\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
