description: "The code we write changes peoples lives, but we often don't think about our impact as IT professionals. The revolution in job automation is a current example of technological impact on society.\n\nExamples of automation, including self-driving cars and other IT choices, will be discussed to illustrate the need to reflect on the consequences of our work.\n\nSysadmin at Purdue University and member of Purdue Perl Mongers and Hack Lafayette."
