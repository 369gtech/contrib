title: 'Webinar: Platform Observability - Building the Foundation for 5G and Edge Automation'
language: English
recordingDate: 1599245105
description: "The holy grail for networks is complete network platform automation. The foundation of network platform automation is observability, including telemetry, monitoring, logging, and tracing. The data collected feeds into analytics leading to automated optimization of applications placement. We will discuss specific Intel platform features and show how they can be used with telemetry methodologies to enable network platform automation. One example we will demonstrate is how Telemetry Aware Scheduling and Prometheus optimize performance-sensitive cloud-native workloads placement. We will also touch on our future plans and show opportunities for additional community engagement and involvement. \n\nPresenters:\nSunku Ranganath, Network Software Engineer @Intel\nKillian Muldoon, Software Engineer, Cloud Native Networking @Intel"
