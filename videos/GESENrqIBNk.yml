description: "Upgrading From CF-Release to CF-Deployment: The Unusual Way - Johannes Hiemer & Yannic Remmet, evoila\n\nWhile there is a good documentation on how to upgrade Cloud Foundry deployments that are still using cf-release, we came up with an easier way to do it. \nProven to have a zero downtime for running applications and the possibility to roll back in case some things don’t work out it’s what everybody, who is still running an cf-release deployment, should be doing.\n\nIn this talk we will give a step by step instruction how we upgraded Cloudfoundry on several occasions and an insight of what mistakes were made.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyx/upgrading-from-cf-release-to-cf-deployment-the-unusual-way-johannes-hiemer-yannic-remmet-evoila"
