title: 'Define before Diving: An Introduction to Product Strategy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601975189
description: "In this Webinar, we get an extensive overview of product strategy from Anna Youngs and Lydia Selim, Product Design Leads at the digital product agency Novoda.\n\nDefining your product and what you expect from it can be as important as creating the product itself. It is what allows a company to align their strategic vision with short-term and long-terms results, allowing companies to reach their users and market in a more direct and clear way, instead of producing a product whose strategy is too general and ambiguous.\n\nThis talk provides an enriching and useful insight for companies and stakeholders looking for a more effective way of making their vision a reality and wanting to know more about the components of a good product strategy.\n\nDuring the webinar, Anna and Lydia explore the essential concepts of product strategy and the steps to a product definition, the key phases and importance of design thinking and the innovation value it adds plus research methods and tools to analyse the obtained information. We also learn about the huge value of clear communication and good practices when working with the rest of the team.\n\nThank you Anna and Lydia for this fascinating and informative talk!\n\nFind out more about Novoda here: https://novoda.com"
