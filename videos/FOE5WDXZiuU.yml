description: "The idea behind the “Apple I” personal computer, was dismissed by \nHP - the Google of that time. Apple’s co-founder - Woz, really wanted to build the personal computer as an HP product. \n\nMost of us have amazing ideas for improving our company’s products or culture. Unfortunately - many of them get rejected. HP’s decision, is just one example of many - where history teaches us that we are not alone. It also shows us, that our managers, who rejected our ideas, are not stupid - even the greatest minds in all areas have missed great ideas.\n\nHow can we successfully convince our managers, employees or investors to support our ideas, despite the natural resistance to different ideas? And where do most engineers get it wrong?"
