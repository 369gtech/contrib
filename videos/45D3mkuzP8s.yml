Today, success hinges on an ability to learn and rapidly evolve offerings based on feedback from clients and prospects alike. To achieve this dramatic level of agility, today’s businesses are adopting DevOps to collapse barriers between business leaders, developers and customers, enabling them to rapidly build and market new products, experiment with disruptive innovations, and continuously assess user feedback to align those innovations with expectations and demand. DevOps leads for Lloyds Banking Group, and Monitise PLC, in discussion with Sanjeev Sharma, IBM, will unpack what the “new normal” is for disruptive software delivery. Learn how to assess your own organization’s readiness for DevOps, and to identify the next steps to adopting its practices.\n\nDOES16 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
