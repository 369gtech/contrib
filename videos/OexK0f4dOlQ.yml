title: 'The IoT Requires Upgradable Security - Lars Lydersen'
recordingDate: 1533029030
description: "The Internet of Things (IoT) allows us to optimize and improve most aspects of modern life at an unprecedented scale. As billions of IoT devices unleash billions of dollars in economic value, the tremendous potential of the IoT is also attracting malicious adversaries and attackers.\nTo achieve secure IoT devices and thwart attacks, it is necessary to ensure upgradability across all IoT end nodes. The longevity of IoT devices, combined with rapid advances in knowledge and tools used by adversaries, makes it infeasible to design devices that will remain sufficiently secure at any security level for their lifetime. Therefore, for devices to remain secure, it is necessary to ensure that their security is upgradable via software updates."
