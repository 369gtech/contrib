description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nOpen source software licenses are intended to provide a way for software authors to protect their own rights, and the rights of the users of their software, but many developers are unaware of how they work, why they are important, and how to apply them to their projects.\n\nIt may never have occurred to you, but software licenses are much like programs: they are developed to meet requirements, they live in a world of external influences and constraints, and they use documented techniques to solve problems.\n\nIn this session, the attendees will participate in a fun, interactive process to choose the components of a software license through real-world examples, with the goal of every attendee leaving with a basic understanding of the more important aspects of software licenses. Along the way they will learn the basics of copyrights and how they apply to software; what 'derivative work' and 'distribution' mean in these contexts; and many other useful concepts, including the most important differences between common licenses like the GNU General Public License family and the Apache 2 license.\n— \nI manage community development and evangelism at Bloomberg, spanning our activities in the open source, open standards and academic communities. Ask me about open source software, open source licensing, and C++!\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
