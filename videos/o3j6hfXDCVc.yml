description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nReading structured data from a file or network stream remains cumbersome and error-prone in C++, especially when data validation is required. Existing approaches require too much boilerplate, aren't always portable, and may be restricted to specific data sources. Despite these limitations, there have been few alternatives in the past.\n\nThis talk introduces\_blobify, an experimental serialization framework for C++17 designed to convert user-defined structs to binary data blobs and vice-versa. Contrary to similar frameworks, blobify largely automates the process, and it includes an embedded domain specific language to handle data validation.\n\nI will describe blobify's API design and usage, explain how it works under the hood, and provide an outlook at what the Reflection TS has in store for future improvements.\n\nLink to the library on GitHub: https://github.com/neobrain/blobify\n— \nTony Wasserka\nConsultant\nBerlin, Germany\n\nLow-level anything: Tony is a consultant and long-term C++ enthusiast who has worked on the console emulator projects Dolphin (GameCube/Wii), PPSSPP (PSP), and Mikage (3DS) since 2010. More recently, he has worked on Vulkan graphics drivers for PowerVR graphics processors. His main interest is exploring C++'s zero-cost abstraction capabilities and applying them to create better software for resource-constrained environments.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
