title: 'Fabio Collini, Android Engineer, The New York Times: Using Hilt in a multi module project'
recordingDate: 1615586597
description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nUSING HILT IN A MULTI MODULE PROJECT\nFabio Collini, Android Engineer, The New York Times\n\nModularizing a project is never easy, a lot of files to move and the dependencies between them is not always what we expect. Then the Dagger configuration used in a single module project often doesn't scale well to a multi module project. Hilt is opinionated about the configuration to use (we don't need to argue anymore about using component dependencies or subcomponents!) and this configuration works perfectly even in a multi module project.\n\nIn this talk we'll see first an introduction to Hilt and a comparison with Dagger to understand why it's easier to configure. Then we'll see how to leverage it in a multi module project (both in a standard layered architecture and in a Clean Architecture that uses the Dependency Inversion) to improve build speed and code testability. Spoiler alert: using sample apps that include a single feature in the app helps a lot!\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/droidcon-italy\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
