description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeakers:  Barrington-Hughes, Ramaswamy, Premier Healthcare Inc\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/no-outage-database-development-with-spring-boot-and-liquibase\n\nPavi and I work on a project in Premier where we've embedded Liquibase into the start of our Spring Boot applications to upgrade our database in-direct coupling with the code we are deploying.\n\nUsing a measured and planned approach to agile database development and careful refactoring of the database with more frequent but smaller changes, we facilitate having no outage deployments along with database schema upgrades.\n\nThis talk touches on some key concepts in agile database refactoring with working examples of embedded Liquibase change sets within a Spring Boot application, demonstrating a no outage deployment using nginx to simulate a blue green deployment. While upgrading blue, green would still be available and functioning. Performing the cutover etc.\n\nTying these concepts together was very cool for us and greatly reduced the friction and risk of deploying a code update."
