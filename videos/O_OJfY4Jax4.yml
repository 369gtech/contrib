recordingDate: 1523529600
description: "A great deal of what makes a website accessible is fairly straightforward to achieve, but only once we know what to look out for! Over 70% of websites are broken for disabled users, including those who rely on assistive tech, such as screen readers and magnifiers, to navigate the web. That's a good 10%-20% of your user base who can't access your content or pay for your product, even though they may want to.\n\nIn this talk we will go over some common front-end (anti)patterns and how they affect accessibility while otherwise going virtually undetected. We'll cover how to get the same results without breaking your site for disabled users, including real-life examples of how we've avoided these pitfalls at The Financial Times."
