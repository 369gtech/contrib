description: "We love data, and today we generate data in astronomical amounts.\n\nWhen we hit save on a document, snap a photo, or fill out a form online, we want to know that this data will persist, and we want to know that we can share, access, or reference it in the future.\n\nFor any meaningful use, we need to how data relates to other data.\n\nBrian Aker\n\nHP\n\nBrian has spent his life working on the details of how to build and scale out systems. He is currently working on a new MicroKernel designed MySQL called Drizzle and is building the plumbing required for a new generation of large scale computer deployment. He also spends time working on Apache Modules, Memcached, and Gearman.\n\nIn the past, he has been involved with projects for the Army Engineer Corps, The VirtualHospital, Splunk, MySQL, Slashdot, and was a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems. He calls Seattle his home since that is where his dog Rosalynd is."
