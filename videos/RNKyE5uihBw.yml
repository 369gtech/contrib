recordingDate: 1622680404
description: "Welcome to June's #WednesdayStreams, this month we're diving into Laravel development at the deep end!\n\nNorfolk Developers use some software affectionately referred to as Marketeer. It provides Buffer-like facilities, and some more bespoke functionality.\n\nJoin us, in this first episode as we take a tour. Alex will show us the whats, whys, and where-fors and we'll discuss how we going to approach our todo list:\n\n- Fix Repeating Events\n- Refactor away from Laravel's notifications\n- Add a Member area\n- Integrate Dom's #golang bot\n\n---\n\n## About your Host\n\nAlex Scotton is an Organizer at Norfolk Developers and an Author of such informational posts as \"Welcome to Norfolk Developers Website\". He can mostly be found commenting on benign tech worries and first world problems on Twitter, when he's not swearing at 'NaN'.\n\n---\n\n## About Norfolk Developers\n\nYou might want to try something new or wish to take your software development up to the next level. We want to jump into the detail and bring you practical value. We want to make it easy for you to access knowledge, progress and prosper in the highly specialised and valuable field of software engineering.\n\nOur community goes beyond our regular events, we're a thriving support network. Our membership include those that are just starting out, juniors, seniors, and the curious.\n\nRead more at https://www.norfolkdevelopers.com/"
