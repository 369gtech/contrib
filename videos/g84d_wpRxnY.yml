description: "As Internet access expands to the far corners of the world, product makers have the chance to see their work used by millions of people worldwide. To create products for international users, we must be aware of the full range of human diversity with respect to language, culture and other forms of human difference. If the product doesn't adapt to users' differences and the rapidly changing world, our work will not truly meet the users' needs. Join this talk to hear how Jenny designed for users in Europe, North- and South America, Asia, and Southeast Asia.\n\nSlides: https://noti.st/jennyshen/hhjR0Q/build-bridges-not-walls-design-for-users-across-cultures\nAbout Jenny: http://jennyshen.com\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
