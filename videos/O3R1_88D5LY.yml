description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nWe're Marketers. If we can Learn Distributed Systems + K8s, so can you! - Betty Junod, VMware & Paul Burt, HashiCorp\n\nWhy is Kubernetes designed the way it is? Distributed systems are hard. That's the short and unsatisfying answer. The long answer is that like quantum mechanics, it's something that tends to make most of us uncomfortable. This talk is an introduction, and a way to build intuition about what makes a system like Kubernetes \"correct.\" We'll do so by contrasting Kubernetes's design choices against other modern systems. We'll look at the implementation details of Docker Swarm, HashiCorp Nomad, K3s, and a \"batteries included\" Kubernetes distro like VMware Tanzu. In doing so, we'll discuss a number of distSys concepts. We'll learn about CAP theorem, Gossip protocols, High Availability (HA), and the RAFT consensus algorithm. Finally, we'll look at real world cases. Why do so many tools rely on Etcd's RAFT? What caused Target's 2019 cascading failure? Attendees will walk away with a better idea of the problems confronting distSys, and an intuition of what \"correct\" looks like."
