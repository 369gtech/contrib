description: "Kubernetes is Still Hard for App Developers, Let’s Fix That! - Aaron Schlesinger, Microsoft \n\nIn this session, I’ll present two case studies that reveal the general needs of most small to medium size application developers. I’ll show that that these developers are severely underserved in the community and that we can drastically improve their experience and grow the Kubernetes community significantly.  I’ll use these case studies to detail the technologies a new developer needs to learn before they can get their app running, and I’ll demonstrate the workflow most new developers follow to launch and maintain their app in production.  I’ll then describe a hypothetical toolchain based on real world tools that would significantly simplify app creation and deployment for these users. The audience will leave with a deep understanding of a large class of underserved Kubernetes users and ideas for how to meet their needs. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrTQ"
