description: "Slides: https://speakerdeck.com/jonbretman/ask-not-what-javascript-can-do-for-you\nThere are lot of tools (CoffeeScript, Typescript, Dart, JSLint / JSHint etc..) that we can use to help us write better JavaScript and many frameworks (Backbone, Ember, Angular etc..) that can help us structure large applications. But...\n\nWhat if you already have a large code base and are not able to re-write your whole application in a new way?\n\nWhat if your organisation does not want to depend on some open source or third party tool or framework?\n\nI am going to talk about some of the key things that most of these tools / frameworks do and how you can apply them to your existing or new project. Topics covered will include:\n\nType checking\nData hiding (Public, Private, Static)\nInheritance\nAsynchronous Code\nPerformance\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/jon-bretman-ask-not-what-javascript-can-do-for-you.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
