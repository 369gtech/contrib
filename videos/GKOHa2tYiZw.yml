description: "(Recorded at Jfokus 2016. http://www.jfokus.com)\n\nIsomorphic JavaScript apps\n\nIsomorphic (greek: \"isos\" = equal, \"morph\" = shape) JavaScript apps are JavaScript applications that can run both client-side and server-side. Isomorphism describes that if you look at the same entity in two different contexts, you should get the same thing. Here the contexts are server and client. Although the term has been mostly used in mathematics until now, it's an apt term to describe a web programing pattern where the code is shared by the front-end and back-end. Just take an MVC-based Java framework, integrate it with Nashorn and use a famous JavaScript templating engine like React - that's it. Now you can render templates on the server- as also on the client side - or start rendering serverside, send them to the client and finish there! Nothing is impossible - even Netflix uses it\n\nNiko KÃ¶bler, Freelance Consultant\n\nNiko works as an independant and self-employed software architect, developer and trainer for Java and JavaScript enterprise solutions, integrations and web development.
