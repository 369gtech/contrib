recordingDate: 1272404274
description: 'Nilofer Merchant, author of The New How, explains how we can use collaboration to co-create for kick-ass results: "Curiosity and passion" said Thomas Friedman, "are key components in a world where information is readily available to everyone and global markets reward those people." This implies that there''s a different set of rules by which we''ll thrive and succeed in this new, networked society. Consequently, we need to question many of the assumptions that have guided our way of working so far.'
