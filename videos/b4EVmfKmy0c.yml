description: "If you've read the IPCC reports, you'll know all about Climate Change and how urgent our need for action is. If not, come to this talk! Find out what's happening now, what's likely to happen in the future, and what our governments and our media are — and aren't — doing about it.\n\nIt's not all scary though! There's plenty that we can do as human beings and technologists — and even if we can't save everything, there's still a lot left to save.\n\nWith Doughnut Economics, debunking of a few myths, pics of dinosaurs and other animals, and lots and lots of data.\n\nThis talk was originally recorded on 9 September 2021 at P3X — People Product Process eXchange 2021"
