language: English
recordingDate: 1433260675
description: "Java EE 7, released over a year ago, introduced several new technologies such as WebSocket, Batch, and JSON. There are already three compliant application servers: WildFly, GlassFish, and Tmaxsoft. NetBeans, Eclipse, and IntelliJ provide extensive tooling support for the APIs. What are the best practices for building and deploying Java EE 7 applications? What to do and not to do? This session takes three Java EE 7 applications running in production and shares lessons learned from each one. It attempts to answer questions such as Is WebSocket ready for production? How do we migrate from Spring Batch to JSR 352 batch? Any change in DevOps? Are additional libraries still needed? Which is more prominent, EJB/JSF or REST/JavaScript?\n\n\nAuthor:\nArun Gupta\nArun Gupta is Director of Developer Advocacy at Red Hat and focuses on JBoss Middleware.
