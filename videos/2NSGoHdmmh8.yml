language: English
recordingDate: 1549371566
description: "F# is a powerful and expressive multi-paradigm language with high performance and focus on functional programming. It leverages all capabilities of .NET framework and introduces lightweight functional syntax. With latest effort of F# community SAFE stack appeared. \n\nSAFE stands for: * Saturn (Suave, Giraffe) as back-end web framework * Azure (AWS, GCE) for cloud-based systems (it also works equally well on premises) * Fable - F# to JavaScript compiler * Elmish - Fable implementation of Elm (MVU) architecture.\nThis combination of technologies allows full-stack development with only one language - F#. \n\nSince SAFE is pretty flexible and not strict at all, it can be applied fully or partially. This presentation covers the most common use cases and best practices of SAFE development."
