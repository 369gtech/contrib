description: "From OSCON 2015 in Amsterdam: The popular container virtualization has arrived on many developer desks and is now approaching more and more production environments. However, many Ops teams are concerned about the security impact of containers. This talk examines the security features of Docker, introduces the technology behind it, and thus allows participants to assess whether Docker corresponds to their individual requirements. Furthermore, it presents a series of best practices that users should implement in Docker to increase their security performance.\n\nAbout Nils Magnus (LinuxTag Association):\nNils Magnus is a system architect and journalist.
