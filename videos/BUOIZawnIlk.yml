description: "Data Without Borders - Using Rook Storage Orchestration at a Global Scale - Jared Watts, Upbound \n\nThe Rook project has established robust and reliable patterns for orchestrating storage systems running on-top of Kubernetes clusters. However, storage systems often need to extend beyond a single cluster to provide data to end users in many different locations. How can these globally distributed storage systems best be orchestrated and managed to meet the needs of their users on a global scale?    In this talk, we will examine the key concepts of storage orchestration for cloud native applications in multicloud environments, as well as the major benefits of these types of deployments. We will learn about the challenges that arise and best practices to address them, such as replication, mirroring, snapshots, and disaster recovery. All of these lessons will be in the context of the Rook project, including a live demonstration of storage orchestration on a global scale. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPfq"
