description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nMulti-Cluster is Easier Than You Think with Linkerd and Ambassador - Thomas Rampelberg, Buoyant & Daniel Bryant, Datawire \n\nMulticluster is becoming the new norm; practically everyone runs multiple dev and staging clusters, and running multiple cross-AZ/DC production clusters is a best practice for high availability. However, connecting multiple clusters is often seen as challenging. We’re here to convince you that it’s easy to get started with Linkerd and Ambassador. Join Thomas and Daniel to learn: - The motivations for cross-cluster communication - Key requirements for multi-cluster comms, including: providing a unified trust domain, separating failure domains, support heterogeneous networks, and providing a unified model with in-cluster comms. - An exploration of the “service mirror” pattern and how this is implemented within Linkerd - How to connect and manage an Ingress to a multi-cluster deployment using service mirroring (including live demo) \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekD9"
