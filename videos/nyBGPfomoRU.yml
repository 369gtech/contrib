description: "Raffaele Rialdi\nVevy Europe\n\nA conversation and demos about NetCore 2 running on Linux\n\nDo you have doubts, questions on Netcore? Do you want to see the demos running on Linux (and Windows, why not) and on the Raspberry PI? This slot is dedicated to all of you that want to understand the use-cases, the practical problems and want to touch the code and evaluate what is going on. I reccomend to participate to my other session \"Writing IoT applications with NetCore 2.1 on the Raspberry PI\" before, even if it is not mandatory :)\n\nhttps://codefest.ru/"
