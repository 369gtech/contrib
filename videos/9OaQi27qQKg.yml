description: "The new movie \"Moneyball\" starring Brad Pitt is about to be released. Based on the bestselling book of the same name, the movie explores the use of \"sabermetrics\" to build winning baseball teams. In this webcast, Jonathan Alexander, author of Codermetrics, suggests that these same ideas be applied to software teams. Jonathan will discuss how you can apply similar ideas to improve your software teams, giving examples of specific metrics and techniques to help you identify, analyze, and discuss the successes and failures of your software engineers and to help make the team a more cohesive and productive. If you manage or lead teams of software developers and engineers, and want to make sure that your focus is on success, you can't afford to miss this entertaining and instructive event.\n\nAbout Jonathan Alexander:\nJonathan Alexander is VP Engineering at Vocalocity, a leader in cloud-based business telecommunications. Previously he built and managed software teams at vmSight, Epiphany, and Radnet. He studied computer science at UCLA, and began his career writing software for author Michael Crichton."
