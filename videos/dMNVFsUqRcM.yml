description: 'Today’s applications are getting more and more distributed everyday and it is well-known that distributed programming is hard. With Hazelcast though, distributed programming is easy and lots of fun. A common reaction of Hazelcast users is “Ooh my God, this cannot be that easy”. Hazelcast is an open source, highly scalable, transactional, distributed/partitioned implementation of queue, map, set, list, lock and executor services for Java. Hazelcast is for you if you like to easily: share data/state among many servers (e.g. web session sharing), cache your data (distributed cache), cluster your application, partition your in-memory data, send/receive messages among applications, distribute workload onto many servers, take advantage of parallel processing or provide fail-safe data management.'
