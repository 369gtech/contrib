description: "Off the Beaten Path: Moving Observability Focus from Your Service to Your Customer\n\nMohit Suley, Microsoft\n\nObservability systems are usually designed to answer two broad questions: \"Is my service doing OK?\" and \"Is my business doing OK?\" There is a third perspective that often doesn't get enough attention (unless it's clearly linked to the first two): \"Is my Customer Experience OK?\"\n\nCustomer Experience is a part of Site Reliability for us. While SLOs are a great way of measuring service, we realized they didn't paint a representative picture of how our customers felt while engaging with our product. In other words, we wanted to humanize the numbers we see.\n\nThis talk explains our motivations for stepping out of our metrics-centered \"comfort zone\" and the journey that ensued: developing a habit of engaging face-to-face with some of our customers, figuring out ways to experience what they did, open-sourcing a high-scale tool to capture this data, setting up broader direct-to-team channels of communication from customers, and re-thinking performance metrics.\n\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa19/conference-program"
