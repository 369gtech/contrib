description: "In this 2018 GDC talk, Facebook's Seth Gibson explores how developers can abate long-term muscle damage by explaining how to create a daily restorative practice based on research-backed mobility techniques and methodologies designed to restore normal joint function, range of motion, and healthy muscle and connective tissue quality.\n\nUpdate: At 35:00, Gibson leaves the stage to perform excercises with the crowd, which was not caught on camera. You can listen to him describe the exercises for your own benefit. \n\nRegister for GDC: http://ubm.io/2gk5KTU\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
