There are very few bright spots in today's economic environment, but the good news is that in many parts of the world, loans of just a few hundred dollars still have the capacity to change people's lives. Join Casey Wilson, nonprofit startup entrepreneur, to talk about her work with Wokai, the first foreign-funded microfinance organization in China. Casey will share her experiences building an organization that gives the poorest of China's poor the financing to build businesses that lift them from poverty.\n\nSpeaker: Casey Wilson\nA co-founder of Wokai, Casey leads business strategy and development, Field Partner due-diligence evaluation, and public outreach. Casey's background is in economic development and its applications in China. Casey has also studied Chinese at Tsinghua University, the University of California at Berkeley, and Middlebury College."
