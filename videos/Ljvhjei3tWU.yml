title: 'Datomic Made Easy Datomic in the Cloud - Stuart Halloway'
language: English
recordingDate: 1507849645
description: "Clojure devs are increasingly being called upon to deliver cloud-native applications on AWS. What if you could press a button and start Datomic running on AWS? Datomic that:\n\n– lets you retain operational control and security without taking on a large operational burden,\n– is inexpensive to run, with hourly billing akin to EC2 and other AWS services,\n– deeply integrates with AWS services to deliver the flexibility, monitoring and elasticity you seek from the cloud.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the work we’ve been doing to wed the information model and core simplicity of the Datomic architecture with a set of resource decisions, best practices, and automation to make Datomic the simple *and easy* database for Clojure developers who want to leverage AWS."
