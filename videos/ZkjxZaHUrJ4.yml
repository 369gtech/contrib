description: 'Jeff Dean, Angelica Willis, and Jehron Petty will share their unique perspectives and experiences, the work they do now, and how they got to where they are today. We hope the conversation will give students an enhanced understanding of computer science and research, the impact they can have on society through these fields, and the many paths available to undergraduate students interested in a research career.'
