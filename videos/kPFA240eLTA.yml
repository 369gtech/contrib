description: "This presentation was recorded at Chicago's GOTO Night \nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nLaura Frank - Engineer Codeship\n\nABSTRACT\nDocker is a powerful platform for building and managing applications that is rapidly gaining momentum on development teams of all sizes. Even if you don't work in devops, if your application is deployed with Docker, you'll likely need to change up your development workflow. The good news is that Docker is a great tool for creating standardized environments -- whether you're on the back-end or the front-end. Although 'dockerizing' your workflow can feel daunting, you'll learn what Docker is, understand why development teams are adopting it, and walk away with what you need to quickly set up your own development environment and get to work.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOchgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
