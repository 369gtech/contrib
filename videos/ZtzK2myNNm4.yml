description: "Released last month, Indivisible from developer Lab Zero is an action RPG platformer that hosts a wide range or memorable characters with unique personalities and motivations. That required a whole lot of writing.\n\nIndivisible lead writer Brandon Sheffield was tasked with imbuing the game's characters with life. The Gamasutra contributor, former editor-in-chief of Game Developer magazine, indie game dev and longtime friend of Game Developers Conference joined us on this month's GDC Podcast to talk lessons in character writing, tips for young writers, and other scintillating topics.\n\nSubscribe for more episodes of the GDC Podcast!
