description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph\r\nhttp://gotocph.com\r\n\r\nTim Berglund - Senior Director of Developer Experience at Confluent\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nWhen you examine the write path of nearly any kind of database, the first thing you find is a commit log: mutations enter the database, and they are stored as immutable events in a queue, only some hundreds of microseconds later to be organized into the various views that the data model demands. Those views can be quite handy–graphs, documents, triples, tables—but they are always derived interpretations of a stream of changes.\nZoom out to systems in the modern enterprise, and you find a suite of microservices, often built on top of a relational database, each reading from some centralized schema, only some thousands of microseconds later to be organized into various views that the application data model demands. Those views can be quite handy, but they are always derived interpretations of a centralized database.\nWait a minute. It seems like we are repeating ourselves.\nMicroservice architectures provide a robust challenge to the traditional centralized database we have come to understand. In this talk, we’ll explore the notion of unbundling that database, and putting a distributed commit log at the center of our information architecture. As events impinge on our system, we store them in a durable, immutable log (happily provided by Apache Kafka), allowing each microservice to create a derived view of the data according to the needs of its clients.\nEvent-based integration avoids the now-well-known problems of RPC and database-based service integration, and allow the information architecture [...]\r\n\r\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\r\nhttps://gotocph.com/2019/sessions/926/the-database-unbundled-commit-logs-in-an-age-of-microservices\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcph\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\r\n#EventSourcing #ApacheKafka #Microservices\r\n\r\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\r\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
