description: "This is Not a Technology Problem: Leveraging Culture and Process to Make the Most of Cloud Foundry - Colin Simmons, EngineerBetter\n\nThe road to running Cloud Foundry at scale is not without its challenges. Oftentimes it is easy to search for a software solution for everything but what if there is a better way? Through delivery of dojos, healthchecks, training, and continuing enablement Colin Simmons has found that sometimes changes to culture and process yield better results.\n\nAs an engineer at EngineerBetter, Colin has the privilege of helping many companies deploy and manage their Cloud Foundry foundations in industries including financial, energy, security, and medical. The industries may differ but the challenges are often the same. Common ones include: struggles reducing cycle times, difficulties on-boarding new team members, or managing a globally distributed team. Sometimes a non-technical approach can move mountains.\n\nJoin Colin as he leverages his experience to identify symptoms, drill into causes, and more importantly explain actionable solutions to these and other problems that made him say “This is not a technology problem…”\n\nAbout Colin Simmons\nColin is an Engineer at EngineerBetter where he works with Cloud Foundry, Concourse, and BOSH on a variety of projects.
