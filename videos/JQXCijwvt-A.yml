description: "by Witold KrÄ™cicki\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.601/dns_bind9_refactoring.webm\n\n\nBind9 code is 21 years old - it was written in times without all the modern buzz-words like test-driven development, QA and code quality. Having working on refactoring the code I want to guide the audience through the process of refactoring one particular function - query_find, showing the mistakes made on the way, cul-de-sacs entered, hours and days lost, for others to learn on my mistakes. \n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 10:45:00+01"
