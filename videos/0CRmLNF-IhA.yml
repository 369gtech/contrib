title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2017 Brian McKenna - Haskell on the JVM with Eta'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498915566
description: "Eta is a fork of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler which provides a JVM backend. Most of GHC’s extensions are supported, allowing a lot of existing Haskell code to run without modification. A few extensions are also provided to allow comprehensive interoperability with Java.\n\nI have worked on Eta and understand some details about how it works. I’ll describe how Eta compilation generates JVM bytecode, how Eta’s runtime works to evaluate lazy programs on the JVM and what hope we have of making Eta solve the “JVM problem” for practical programs.\n\nBrian McKenna is a functional programmer from Tasmania who works remotely for Atlassian. He has been using Nix personally and professionally since 2014, contributing back packages and configuration. He has been playing with Eta in an attempt to help solve The JVM Problem and to learn more about GHC’s runtime and compilation. He believes functional programming is the only ethical way we should be developing software.\n\nFor more on YOW! Lambda Jam, visit http://lamdajam.yowconference.com.au"
