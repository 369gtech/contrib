description: "Many different roles contribute to building software: product owners, business specialists. testers. Yet knowledge of programming keeps these roles at a distance. In this talk, I will share how I have come to programming: not through wanting to program and taking courses on it, but through working with programmers in a style called mob programming. This talk serves as an inspiration for programmers to invite non-programmers to learning code a layer at a time, immersed in the experience of creating software together to transform the ability to deliver. Lessons specific to skillsets rub in both ways, leaving everyone better off after the experience. In this talk, you will learn: What is mob programming and why you should care about working in that style? How to use strong-style pairing as a means of connecting everyone regardless of their programming skill level? What contributions non-programmers make in a mob before they learn to program? How I became a programmer through working in mobs at work and at community meetups over learning by studying programming?\n\nLink: http://agiledayriga.lv/index.html#session11"
