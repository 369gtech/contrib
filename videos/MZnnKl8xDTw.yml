description: 'Join Ben for an informal let’s play of @mediumrehr’s Hardware Hacking Village challenge 6. Some topics we will cover include: radare2 , AVR assembly, 7 segment displays, and sigrok. It should be fun and relaxed with plenty of time to stop and re-do some steps if something needs more deliberation. See you there.'
