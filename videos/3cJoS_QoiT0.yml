description: "by Ilias Apalodimas and Lorenzo Bianconi\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.1308/xdp_and_page_pool_api.webm\n\nXDP support is an increasing trend on the network devices. XDP main goal is\nprocessing packets at the lowest point in the software stack avoiding\noverheads. Memory recycling of received buffers achieved through\nthe in kernel page❮em❯pool API plays a fundamental role in the increased performance.\nAdding XDP support on a driver can be non-trivial. In this talk we'll demonstrate\nhow porting a standard ethernet driver (mvneta/netsec) to XDP and the page❮/em❯pool API can\nboost performance.\nPart of the page_pool evolution involves adding the recycling support\nin the kernel's SKB stack and leverage the increased performance\nattributes of the API.\n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 12:10:00"
