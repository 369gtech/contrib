title: 'Autonomous Exploration Robotics with a Raspberry Pi - Christian Catchpole & Rachael Colley'
recordingDate: 1539887179
description: "Nyx is a prototype autonomous exploration robot. High-efficiency solar panels and battery systems allow it to operate completely self-sustained, capable of nautical journeys of indefinite length. Its in-built camera allows it to Tweet photographs directly from the robot, overlaying telemetry and map data.\nNyx’s long term challenge is to self-navigate from Melbourne, Australia to the coast of Antartica, a distance of 3190 kilometres. Of course this robot wasn’t manufactured by a large corporation, or even a small one. Its simply a side project a 9 to 5 software developer. Using off the shelf parts, some zip ties and a little duct tape, this presentation will show you how anyone can get involved in the world of robotics and the Internet of things.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
