title: 'How Streaming Helps Your Staging Environment and Sandboxes Stay Up To Date - Mike Solomon'
recordingDate: 1588067705
description: 'In this session, we will look at how Apache Flink can be used to stream anonymized API request and response data from a production environment to make sure staging environments are up-to-date and reflect the most recent features (and bugs) that comprise a service. The talk will also examine how to deal with issues of data retention, throttling, and persistence, finishing with recommendations for how to use these sandbox environments to rapidly prototype and test new features and fixes.'
