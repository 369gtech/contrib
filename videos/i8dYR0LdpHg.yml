title: 'Introducing the Flowable Process Engines by Paul Holmes Higgin & Joram Barrez'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510260670
description: "The Flowable Project provides a set of Open Source engines for BPMN, CMMN and DMN in Java. They're used around the globe to drive business critical applications in all kinds of architectures, whether orchestrating microservices or soft-wiring the behavior of the microservices themselves; embedded, as a service, on-premise or in the cloud.\n\nThis talk introduces working with business processes, decision tables and case management with the open source Flowable libraries, then shows some of its unique dynamic process capabilities being used to integrate Machine Learning into business processes. All illustrated with demos and code.\n\n# Paul Holmes-Higgin\nPaul has a long history with technology, currently with edorasware. Previously, he was a co-founder of Alfresco, holding a number of executive positions there. He was instrumental in bringing the Activiti BPM engine to market (of course, the engineers maintain it was their hard work). Before that, there were a couple of start-ups, plus time with Documentum, Resumix and IBM. All after a spell in academia with an AI group, somehow blagging a PhD in the process. In his spare time, he enjoys sprint and marathon kayaking.\n\n# Joram Barrez\nJoram is a Flowable core developer at edorasware with many years experience in open-source software and of building scalable process engines."
