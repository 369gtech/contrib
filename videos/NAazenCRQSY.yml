description: "Business track breakout session presented by Andrew Clay Shafer.\n\nNew technology can only do so much if people in your organization do not understand how to take advantage of it. Various reports describe a 'shortage' of technical capability facing many industries. The pace of technology change makes this gap more apparent and more dire. The reality is most organizations do not utilize, let alone fully develop, the talent they already have. Why is that? What can be done?\n\nThis presentation will reference research showing the advantages learning organizations have developing, attracting and retaining talent, not to mention improved decision making and execution. The audience will get some ideas for self assessment of their organizational learning capabilities and ideas for improving them."
