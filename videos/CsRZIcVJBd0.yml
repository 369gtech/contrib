description: "Visual Search, Particle Collisions and Content Popularity Prediction: Hands-on Success Stories of Computer Vision\n\nAs humans, we have spent thousands of years to learn through evolution how to interpret our surroundings using our eyes. Thanks to the advancements of artificial intelligence methods, computers gained this skill in only a couple of decades. How was it possible? Are machines au pair or better than humans in solving visual tasks now? What are the next challenges we need to face in this domain? In this talk, I will give an overview of several computer vision methods and real-life applications that I work on, ranging from fast simulations of particle collisions at CERN, through visual search for localisation and e-commerce to visual content popularity prediction in social media.\n\nThe speech was given on 2018-05-22 at infoShare 2018 (Tech Plus II Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
