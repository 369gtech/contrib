description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/string-and-text-processing-in-java-on-a-scale/\n\nOur Java applications handle millions of strings per second. We work with different platforms, including mobile. On a scale, even rare things happen. You can bet that eventually, an innocent text will crash your server… or the whole cluster. Over the years we have tried many performance tricks. Or should we call it premature optimizations?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll share what we have learned about heavy string processing in Java:\n\n– Upgrading to Java 11. New java.util.String – expectations and reality\n– JVM string optimizations and hacks – which ones do you need?\n– Tips for fast and robust regular expressions\n– Emoji that make you cry\n– Services in other languages – what is the true length of my Java string?"
