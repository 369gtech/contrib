description: "Functions in the sky - sounds like fun doesn’t it? OK yes, fine, there are servers involved, but you don’t have to manage them, which means you can spend more time focusing on your business rather than hardware and infrastructure.\n\nWouldn’t it be nice to eliminate Docker once and for all? In this talk Rob Conery will show you how he leverages Firebase Functions (from Google) with his business, bigmachine.io. We’ll work with the Firebase realtime database as well as PostgreSQL, hosted by compose.com."
