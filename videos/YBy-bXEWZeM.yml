description: "Mark Jessop, Michael Wheeler\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/179/\n\nRadiosondes are scientific instruments carried aloft under weather balloons to measure characteristics of the upper atmosphere. Thousands of these devices are launched around the world on a daily basis, and are generally left to litter the countryside wherever they land.\r\n\r\nUsing a low cost software-defined radio, a Raspberry Pi, and all open-source software, it is possible to decode signals from these devices. You can then track their flight path, collect the weather data they transmit, and even recover and repurpose them!\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover the development and worldwide use of the radiosonde_auto_rx project, and how we have been re-purposing Vaisala RS41 radiosondes for use on our own high-altitude balloon flights.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
