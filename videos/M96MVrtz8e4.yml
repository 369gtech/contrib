description: "This video was recorded at Lambda Days 2019 http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019\n\nGet involved in Lambda Days' next conference http://www.lambdadays.org\n\n---\n\nSTATE VS STATEFUL ACTORS\nby Krzysztof Otrębski\n\nABSTRACT\nDuring this talk I will show you how we can move the logic from actors into a monad state. We will see the benefits of the logic implemented in composable, side-effect-free way.\nThe talk is based on a project that keeps all of the business logic inside actors. Our goal is to refactor actors into a monad state. The changes will make the application more testable and comprehensible.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2019/krzysztof-otrebski\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - KRZYSZTOF OTRĘBSKI\nFP wanna be\n\nKrzysztof is a software developer with 10 years of professional experience.
