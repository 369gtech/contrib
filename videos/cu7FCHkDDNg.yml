description: "by Maxime Guyot\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UB2.252A/multicloud_ci_cd_openstack_kubernetes.webm\n\n\nWith over 50 Public cloudbased on OpenStack, distributing workloads closer to customers is now a reality. Expect to learn how to leverage CI/CD to build multicloud Kubernetes clusters across several OpenStack Public Clouds. We’ll start by presenting the benefits of multicloud and how Kubernetes and OpenStack fit in that strategy. \n\nMulticloud architecture\n\nThen we’ll explain the setup of a geo-distributed Kubernetes environment and this translates in OpenStack terms. \n\nCloud agnostic tools\n\nAn important part of multicloud is to have adapted tooling, so we’ll compare several tools to manage OpenStack resources (heat, ansible, terraform, …) and to install Kubernetes (kops, kubespray, kubeadm, …) in a cloud agnostic way. \n\nDemo\n\nWe’ll put it all to the test with a live demo with a CI/CD application deployment across the globe. \n\nWrap up\n\nFinally we’ll wrap it up with lessons learned and challenges of multicloud. \n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:00:00+01"
