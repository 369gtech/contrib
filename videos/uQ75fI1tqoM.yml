description: "The demands on applications have never been more intense. The users on the web, combined with mobile devices, ask for highly responsive applications. Our customers, thanks to open competition and perceived agility, expect tomorrow's features be delivered today. “Are you done yet” are the dreaded words of the corporate grind.\n\nSeveral tools have risen to address those demands for speed. While that's wonderful, speed in the absence of discipline is hard to sustain. In this keynote we will discuss the practices that can help alleviate the pains while helping us cope with the demands, the reasons to do so, and the approach we can take to achieve that.\n\nDr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of agilelearner.com, and an instructional professor at the University of Houston.\n\nHe has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences. Venkat helps his clients effectively apply and succeed with sustainable agile practices on their software projects.\n\nVenkat is a (co)author of multiple technical books, including the 2007 Jolt Productivity award winning book Practices of an Agile Developer.
