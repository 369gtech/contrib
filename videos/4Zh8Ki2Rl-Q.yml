recordingDate: 1514644245
description: "Blockchain is is arguably the most significant technological innovation to emerge in recent years. In this talk I will provide an overview of what blockchain is and why it’s considered game-changing. This will be followed by a run down of the current state of play in the blockchain eco-system, before discussing key considerations for organisations wishing to work with this technology – based on my experience building a platform on top of Ethereum.\n\nConor Svensson is the author of web3j, the Java library for integrating applications with the Ethereum blockchain. He also co-founded a couple of startups Cohome and Huffle, before joining Othera (https://www.othera.com.au/) as their CTO, to build their blockchain lending platform and exchange.\n\nFor more on YOW!
