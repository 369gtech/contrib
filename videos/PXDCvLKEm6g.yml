description: '#Codemotion Rome 2018 - In the last 6 years I''ve been involved in building, evolving and running in production IT systems based on the microservices architectural style. I''ve had the privilege to be in one of the early teams within ThoughtWorks adopting this architectural style. Along the way I took part as developer and tech lead in multiple projects, across various technological stack and industries, witnessing failures and successes. This talk is a collection of tips and lessons learned from the frontlines.'
