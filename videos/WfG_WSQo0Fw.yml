title: 'Jimmy Bogard - Domain-Driven Refactoring'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620226571
description: "Books, workshops, storming and more, all build up an idealized domain model. All describe great techniques for domain-driven greenfield applications. But what about the code we have? How can we take what's already built, and move it towards a better, more cohesive design?\n\nIn this session, we'll look at anemic, procedural, boring code and examine code smells that can point us in the right direction. We'll also look at standard design patterns for more complex behaviors and models, and how to recognize when (and when not) to apply them. Finally, we'll cover how to safely apply refactoring techniques to achieve our domain-driven model nirvana."
