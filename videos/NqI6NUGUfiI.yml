description: "Apache Spark is a distributed computation framework optimized to work in-memory, and heavily influenced by concepts from functional programming languages. Hazelcast - open source in-memory data grid capable of amazing feats of scale - provides wide range of distributed computing primitives computation, including ExecutorService, M/R and Aggregations frameworks. The nature of data exploration and analysis requires data scientists be able to ask questions that weren't planned to be askedâ€”and get an answer fast! In this talk, Viktor will explore Spark and see how it works together with Hazelcast to provide a robust in-memory open-source big data analytics solution!\n\nSpeaker: Viktor Gamov"
