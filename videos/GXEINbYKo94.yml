title: 'Azure SQL VM: Caching and Storage Capping (Ep. 1) |  Data Exposed'
language: English
recordingDate: 1627565753
description: "Optimizing Virtual Machine storage is one of the most critical areas to focus on when architecting for performance with SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VM). Virtual machines have input/output operations per second (IOPS) and throughput performance limits based on the virtual machine type and size as well as storage. In part one of this seven-part VM series, we'll cover how capping occurs at the virtual machine and storage levels and how caching can help remove the impact of these performance limits.\n\n0:00 Show begins\n0:40 Optimizing Storage Performance\n2:46 Azure Virtual Machine and Storage\n3:49 Disk IO Capping\n6:46 Azure VM IO Capping\n8:48 Host VM Caching and IO Limits\n10:30 Enabling Host VM Caching\n11:26 Benefits of Host Caching\n12:40 Azure SQL VM Storage Best Practices\n\n✔️Resources:\nChecklist: Best practices for SQL Server on Azure VMs: https://aka.ms/SQLVMChecklist\nVM size: Performance best practices for SQL Server on Azure VMs: https://aka.ms/SQLVMSizing\nStorage: Performance best practices for SQL Server on Azure VMs: https://aka.ms/SQLVMStorage\nHow to get the biggest bang for your buck with SQL Server on Azure VMs: https://aka.ms/AzureSQLVMPricePerf\nDeep Dive: Azure SQL Virtual Machine Sizing | Data Exposed Live: https://aka.ms/SQLVMSizingVideo\n\n📝Azure SQL Virtual Machine Reimagined Series: https://aka.ms/azuresqlvmyt\n\n📌 Let's connect:\nTwitter: David Pless, https://twitter.com/dpless​\nTwitter: Anna Hoffman, https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna​​​\nTwitter: AzureSQL, https://aka.ms/azuresqltw​​​\n\n🔔 Subscribe to our channels for even more SQL tips: https://aka.ms/msazuresqlyt​​​\n\n#AzureSQL​​​ #AzureSQLVM​ #AzureSQLVirtualMachine"
