title: 'Building Machine Learning Models with Clojure and Cortex - Joyce Xu'
language: English
recordingDate: 1507842338
description: 'While functional programming continues to rise in popularity, the machine learning and data science communities have been slow to adopt its practices. As a result, we at ThinkTopic have developed Cortex, an open-source Clojure library built for machine learning. With the introduction of Cortex, it is now easier than ever to build AI in a functional manner. This talk will cover the basics of machine learning, the rationale behind using Clojure, and a tutorial on building a classification model in Cortex.'
