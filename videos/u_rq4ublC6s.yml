description: "Achieving CI, ARA or CD can be difficult – even for unicorns. But, for large enterprises (“horses”) with complex application and organizational structures, it can seem downright impossible.\n\nBut it can be done! Accelerating the pace of the service delivery requires teams reboot their culture, and implement automation across existing processes and tools.\n\nJoin our panel of industry practitioners from Intel, QuickenLoans and Bluware along with well-known Forrester analyst Amy DeMartine as we discuss real-life examples of DevOps transformation.\n\nWe’ll cover:\n\n1) Challenges operating pipelines at enterprise scale\n2) How to approach technical debt and tool consolidation\n3) Key capabilities required for automation at scale\n\nAfter their discussion, we will provide time for a live Q&A."
