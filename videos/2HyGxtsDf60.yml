title: 'Broken Buildtools and Bad Behaviors; The Maven Story by Robert Scholte'

description: "\"Why is my build broken? Again?\"\n\nWe all recognize the frustrations when things are not going as planned. Software development just isn't that easy. But how do we solve the issue? In case you have full control over the problem, you'll be able to fix it yourself, hopefully. But in case you depend on something or somebody else it often results in temporary workarounds, in theory. In practice nothing is as permanent as a temporary solution.\n\nOver the last decade Maven has improved a lot, but still only a small percentage of the available features are used by the average developer.\n\nThis session demonstates the evolution of Maven based on user experiences and explaining the proper solution for workarounds like \"clean install\".\n\nIn 2011 Robert joined the Apache Maven team (between the releases of Maven 3.0.3 and 3.0.4). Since then he has been one of the most active committers on the project and has been the chairman for the last couple of years. \nDue to a partial overlap of the goals of Maven and the Java Platform Module System Robert has joined the expert group of JSR-376, better known as project Jigsaw. He has done most of the implementations for the Maven project to support the Java Modular System."
