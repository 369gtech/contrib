description: "Going through a technology transformation with the help of Pivotal Labs enabled me to understand techniques and processes that accelerate product development. \n \n These techniques and processes can be leveraged within any type of organization no matter how big or small. The important thing is to choose what works best for your specific teams. After experiencing building products for both start-ups and fortune 500 companies, I have learned from the many mistakes, failures, and successes throughout my journey.\n\nNicholas Kalpakis, Lead Software Engineer at Dispute"
