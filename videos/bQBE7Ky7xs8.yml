description: "Now is the time to bring the collaborative DVCS workflow to your deployments. This talk walks you through the essential steps of making the collaborative DVCS workflow a reality at your company, and then discusses the strategies GitLab utilizes to make the most of this process. \n\nSid saw the first ruby code in 2007 and loved it, so he learned to program and made this his profession. Previously, he engaged in various businesses, from selling programmable infrared receivers to starting a recreational submarine company. He is always looking to publicly document answers and make processes more efficient.\n\nAbout Git Merge:\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content, user case studies and training workshops for Git users of all levels.\n\nVisit: http://git-merge.com/"
