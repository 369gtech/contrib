title: 'What''s new for Flink''s Table & SQL APIs? Planners, Python, DDL - Aljoscha Krettek & Timo Walther'
recordingDate: 1571147893
description: "About three years ago, the Apache Flink community started adding a Table & SQL API to process static and streaming data in a unified fashion. It makes data processing accessible to non-programmers and significantly reduces the effort to solve common tasks. Today, Flink SQL already powers production systems at Alibaba, Huawei, Lyft, and Uber. But we are only getting started! The community is currently re-shaping the future of data processing.\n\nEven for followers of the Flink mailing lists, it can be quite difficult to keep track with all the developments that happen on Flink's relational APIs. In this talk, we give an overview of recent contributions, such as pluggable optimizers, the new type system with consistent type inference, SQL DDL support, and the Python Table API. We elaborate on how all these efforts interact and discuss the future roadmap."
