title: 'Three Developers Walk Into a Bar: Getting Lost and Finding your way on Container Road'
language: English
recordingDate: 1494276353
description: 'The containerization journey can be a long and winding road. In this presentation, we meet three weary developers who stop along their way to swap stories, perspectives, and lessons learned. One is a skilled enterprise Java developer just beginning her container quest. The second is a seasoned cloud-native Docker developer well-versed in the ways of Kubernetes and martial arts. The third is a DevOps engineer more comfortable with Puppet and Chef - knee deep in trying to deploy and manage Docker apps in production.'
