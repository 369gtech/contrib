description: "Speaker: Cornelia Davis\n\nCloud Foundry is an open source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that changes the set of things that a devops individual interacts with when developing, deploying and managing cloud-based applications. No longer is that developer concerned with virtual machines, networks and storage, instead they are focused on and working with applications and the services they leverage.\n\nAfter a brief introduction to the platform, in this meetup we will take a multi-tier application that was originally built for deployment onto physical or virtual machines, necessitating the deployment of numerous prerequisite softwares, and we'll deploy it to Cloud Foundry, which provides all of those prerequisites out of the box.  Only minor changes were made to the application with major benefits.  We'll provision services (i.e. database and messaging instances), deploy applications, bind them to those services and start up the app.  The session will be light on slides and heavy on live demo.\n\nThe Cloud Foundry PaaS is entirely open sourced, available on Github and can be deployed on any number of IaaS including vSphere, OpenStack and AWS, plus there is an option where you can even run it on your laptop. Pivotal also offers it in the cloud at run.pivotal.io.  If you come with a run.pivotal.io account and with the cli installed you'll even be able to follow along and have a working app by the end of the evening."
