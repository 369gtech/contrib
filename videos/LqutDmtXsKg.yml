description: "Panellists:\nKevin Stewart (Head of Engineering, Harvest)\nMichelle grover (Chief Information Officer, Twilio)\nJossie Haines (Senior Director of Platform Engineering, Tile)\nYvette Pasqua (CTO/VPE)\n\nFinancial crashes are cyclical in nature and although we can’t predict the timing of the next crash, we know that they are an inevitability. Any financial downturn will materially affect the individuals in your team, So why do we spend so little time thinking about them on an organisational scale, and how can we do better to prepare for them?\n\nAnd when a financial crisis does hit, what are the new situations that you’ll be put into, and what are the new skills you’ll have to quickly hone to handle them?\n\nIn this session, we’ll be discussing the preparations that you can make for your teams, the skills that you can start developing right now, and how to handle the difficult situations that will arise."
