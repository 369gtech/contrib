recordingDate: 1351636676
description: "The world of web standards can be a daunting place, especially to the uninitiated. In this talk, Divya Manian, Advanced Web and Interactivity Designer at Adobe, helps explain the web standardization process.\n\nStarting with her own history with web standards, Divya goes from the reasoning behind standards, to how a standard is developed, and ultimately how you can contribute to the process. This talk is a great place to start if you're at all interested in web standards, and how they can make your life (and everyone else's) a little easier.\n\nThis talk was given in front of the San Francisco HTML5 Usergroup on October 18, 2012"
