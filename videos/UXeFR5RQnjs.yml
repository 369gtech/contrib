description: "F# has been a part of .NET since the early days of the Framework, yet it still is relatively unknown for a large majority of the .NET developer community. But why is this? With the rise of .NET Core, and with C# going through a large transition at the moment with features such as tuples, pattern matching and non-nullability all influenced from F#, it's never been easier to start using F# today.\n\nThis talk will cover the discuss the fundamentals of functional programming, cover the basic value proposition of F#, illustrate the philosophy and key language features behind the language, with examples comparing equivalent solutions in C# and F#, as well as looking at the typical life cycle for F# developers.\n\nWe'll finish up with some demos that show use cases of F# and how, when using a language that has functional programming at its heart, you can \"level up\" and achieve large boosts in both productivity and developer satisfaction.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
