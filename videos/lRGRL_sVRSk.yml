title: 'Raku, the Big - Bruce Gray'
language: English
recordingDate: 1623171469
description: "The Swiss-Army Chainsaw of Perl is now the full carpentry shop of Raku.\nWhich new tools are the Shiniest? Sharpest? Most-likely-to-cut-you-est?\nShould other languages be inspired, or warned by its evolution?\nCome see how the power of the 100-year language moved it from Perl 6.0 to First-of-its-Name.\n\nMultiple paradigms, chained data flows, Types, Sets, Lazy Lists, Async.\nLurking among the many additions are a few key bits, that take Raku from Wow to Whoa!\nThose bits also trigger most of the divergence from old mindsets and Perl solutions.\n\nAll the new moving parts fit like clockwork! Success!\nBut more tools, working together in new ways, means more to teach. Far more than was planned for.\n\nAlso relevant to Perl 7, and any other languages planning a growth phase."
