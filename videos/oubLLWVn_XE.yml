Knowing how IT systems are planned and constructed helps you to understand the development process and the cost justification. Being able to understand your fellow IT collegues will certainly make a better team.\r\n\r\nIf you're someone already in the IT field, you probably already know about architectures. Knowing the 4 levels of architecture allows you to be an effective communicator, if your team/organisation still has trouble understanding one another. To speak in a team, requires common understanding of terms of words.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/197182374119251\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/6IqM/"
