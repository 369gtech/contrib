description: "For over a decade Emma Jane Hogbin Westby has been teaching people how to use version control systems. Most people she's encountered still find Git hard to learn on their own. In this session you will learn why most approaches to teaching Git fail to appropriately address the adult learner, and what you can do to make the on-boarding experience easier for others. She will touch on adult education best practices, and also share the secrets that make it easier for very large (and corporate) teams to transition to Git.\n\nEmma Jane Hogbin Westby is a member of the field information services development team at United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) and the author of the O'Reilly titles Git for Teams and Collaborating with Git."
