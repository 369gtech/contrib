It has the potential to be a great tool for a practical approach to software correctness. We contribute a new approach to taming the complexity of a state-of-the-art generate and test algorithm. Our approach runs this algorithm several times with carefully chosen inputs of smaller size: signature inference. We implement this approach in a new tool called EasySpec. The results suggest that this approach is several orders of magnitude faster, fast enough to be practical, and produces similar results.\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2018/tom-sydney-kerckhove"
