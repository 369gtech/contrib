title: 'Take AR anywhere with post capture AR'
language: English
recordingDate: 1618962088
description: "Most AR applications implement a separate “live view” mode that loses the experience when the live session is over. The same scene needs to be captured over and over again to create the same AR experience. With this release, a scene can be captured once and referred to again to augment them with 3D effects or filters.\n\nRegister for I/O → https://goo.gle/2OTj06K\n\nSpeakers: Ian Zhang, Nitin Suresh\n\nWatch more:\nGoogle Developers at Google I/O 2021 Playlist → https://goo.gle/io21-GoogleDevelopers\nAll Google I/O 2021 Technical Sessions → https://goo.gle/io21-technicalsessions\nAll Google I/O 2021 Sessions → https://goo.gle/io21-allsessions\n\nSubscribe to Google Developers → https://goo.gle/developers​ \n\n#GoogleIO"
