Some do it well, others struggle. There are numerous methodologies and frameworks out there to manage your projects well, but what about just managing the entire process, from conception to execution? How do we document that process? Who does it? How often should it be updated?\n\nIn this session weâ€™ll answer these questions and take a look at some tools that will help us manage the process, understand the importance of documentation, learn how to interact with clients and the team, and establish some really easy techniques that will make the whole thing run much smoother.\n\nDaniel Schutzsmith\nCreative Technology Director, Mark & Phil\nhttp://www.twitter.com/schutzsmith\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/danielschutzsmith\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
