description: "http://strataconf.com/strataeu/public/schedule/detail/26835\nIn this presentation Mikael Bisgaard-Bohr will discuss why the Big Data Wave is arriving now, what spawned it and how it will impact how we manage organisations whether they be private or public, and how organisations interact with their customers and stakeholders. As Mikael will show in his talk, Big Data will enable profound changes that will impact each one of us as consumers, workers and manager as well as the organisations that we function in today. He will also explain why \"Big Data\" is not really about the data but more about how the data itself and the new technologies enabling Big Data will be used."
