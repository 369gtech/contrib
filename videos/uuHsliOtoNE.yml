title: 'Making Responsive Websites Fast - O''Reilly Webcast'
recordingDate: 1421879403
description: "Originally aired on July 1, 2014.  Responsive Web Design is quickly becoming the standard way any organization should tackle the post-​iPhone web. The client-side approach it embraces makes adapting to the current device easy—and makes it just as easy to make your site painfully slow. Mistakes such as downloading hidden or oversized images, triggering unnecessary scripts, and building massive page sections (only to have them hidden) plague RWD implementations across the Web.\n\nHowever, being responsive DOES NOT mean being slow. In this webcast, we'll review the most common performance pitfalls and show how you can avoid falling into them, keeping your responsive site snappy and fun. We'll discuss how to combine a smart front-end and a smart server, and offer practical advice on how and when to use each one. Finally, we'll mention some of the standardization efforts underway to help make this work easier in the future.\n\nAbout Guy Podjarny\n\nGuy Podjarny (Guypo) is a web performance researcher/evangelist and Akamai's Web CTO, focusing primarily on mobile and front-end performance. As a researcher, Guy frequently runs large-scale tests, exploring performance in the real world and matching it to how browsers behave, and was one of the first to highlight the performance implications of Responsive Web Design. Guy is the author of Responsive & Fast: Implementing High-Performance Responsive Design, coming from O'Reilly and Akamai in late June 2014.\n\nGuy is also the creator of Mobitest, a free mobile measurement tool, and contributes to various open source tools.
