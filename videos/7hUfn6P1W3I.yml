title: 'Eric Meadows-JÃ¶nsson - Elixir Tooling: Exploring Beyond the Language'
language: English
recordingDate: 1407156362
description: "You may have been introduced to Elixir before. The language features have been shown; strong meta-programming, protocols, and Erlang interop. This talk is about the less talked about, but equally important, surrounding features of Elixir.\n\nEric will cover the great parts of the standard library, including lazy collections, Unicode strings, and the parallel compiler. Additionally, he will talk about Elixir tooling specifically Mix the build tool and Hex the newly created package manager. The talk will go in-depth about Mix's project and build structure, how dependencies are handled, how to create custom Mix tasks and what Hex brings to the table. Eric will also show how the standard library and tooling can be used by Erlang developers."
