title: 'JavaScript Nirvana in NetBeans'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474423329
description: 'NetBeans is not just a Java IDE. It supports JavaScript as a first-class citizen and provides a complete integrated development environment. It also provides project types for server-side JavaScript (Node.js) as well as web browsers and mobile (Apache Cordova). In addition, it supports Grunt, Mocha and Selenium, Angular and Knockout, and more. This session provides an update on NetBeans 8.1 and demonstrates the top new JavaScript features. You will see a Node.js application in action, look at the support for JavaScript unit testing, and also see how easy it is to debug an Apache Cordova application running on a tethered iPhone.'
