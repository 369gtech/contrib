description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nThis short talk presents how easy it is to replace some cases of dynamic polymorphism with std::variant. During the lecture, we will analyze and compare 2 implementations of the same simple Finite State Machine. It turns up that variant-based code is not only much faster but also it gives us the opportunity to define our interfaces and program flow much better. The talk will end up with the discussion of pros and cons of each approach and will try to give guidelines on when to use them.\n— \nMateusz Pusz, Epam Systems\nChief Software Engineer\n\nSoftware architect, chief developer, and security champion with more than 14 years of experience in designing, writing and maintaining C++ code for fun and living. C++ consultant, trainer, and evangelist focused on Modern C++. His main areas of interest and expertise are code performance, low latency, stability, and security.\n\nMateusz worked at Intel for 13 years and now he leads C++ Community at EPAM Systems. He is also a founder of Train IT that provides C++ trainings to corporations. Mateusz is an active voting member of the ISO C++ Committee (WG21) where, together with the best C++ experts in the world, he shapes the next official version of the C++ language. He is also a member of WG21 Study Group 14 (SG14) responsible for driving performance and low latency subjects in the Committee. In 2013 Mateusz won “Bench Games 2013” – worldwide competition in the C++ language knowledge.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
