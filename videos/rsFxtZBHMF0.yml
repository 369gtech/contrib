description: "Address Me Properly \nby Dan Cooper (@Dan_AlliesCom) \n& Stephen Hill (@Stephen_J_Hill)\n\nAllies explore why there’s more to UK addresses than meets the eye, and how they’ve built a Norwich tech company from developing addressing APIs and software. \n\nWe’ll look at what you might need to remember if you’re building address forms or data structures.  And why you should even care. \n\nWe’ll also find out why your address might not be in Royal Mail’s PAF database… and why that’s ok as long as you’re using an Allies API. \n\nDan is CEO for Allies Computing, the team that wants to rid the world of bad addresses through an API called PostCoder Web.  In addition to this noble cause, Dan has a keen interest in UX and CX, both of which influence how Allies build products and do business. \n\nStephen Hill is Quality and Testing Manager for Allies and describes himself as a pedantic testing craftsman.  Stephen is an active member of the UK tester community and sits on the board of the Software Testing Club and the organising committee for BCS SIGiST conferences. \n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/222590777/\n\nhttps://www.alliescomputing.com/"
