description: "Can I use a t-test if my data are non-normal? What if the sample size is small? What's an exact test? And how many tests are there, anyway?\n\nPeople working with real data are often confused about hypothesis testing and paralyzed by the number of tests and their requirements. But for many common problems, you don't need specialized tests at all.\n\nIn this talk, I present a framework for using simple simulations to estimate p-values. This framework works well for a wide range of problems, which is why I say that there's only one test.\n\nYou don't need prior knowledge of statistics (and you might be better off without it). I show programming examples in Python, but the talk is accessible to anyone with basic programming skills.\n\nAbout Allen B. Downey:\nAllen B. Downey, author of Think Stats.
