title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2017 Alexey Kotlyarov - Instances for everyone, free: generic programming in Haskell'
language: English
recordingDate: 1498916814
description: "Haskell encourages creating as many data types as are needed to model the problem domain correctly. However, often they need to implement one or several helper typeclasses, with trivial implementations possible. Generics make it possible to describe the rules for producing such implementations once, and use those for all the created data types, reducing the amount of boilerplate and errors.\n\nAlexey has learned many programming languages in anger, but recently found that the best documentation includes types and type systems. After having been criticized for “writing Haskell in any language”, they decided the solution was to learn and apply even more different languages and paradigms.\n\nFor more on YOW!
