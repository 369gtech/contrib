language: English
recordingDate: 1593165172
description: "Recently, with the release of Metals version 0.9.0 we added basic support for Scala 3. Though it already has a number of features implemented, it is still not one the same level as the support for Scala 2.\n\nIn this talk you can learn about the current effort being made to fully support Dotty in Metals and the surrounding ecosystem. We will discuss current capabilities, what is still lacking, main challenges and the general roadmap for advancing the Scala 3 tooling ecosystem."
