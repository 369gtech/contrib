description: "Alright ninjas, so I think it's about time I introduced you to JavaScript events in this tutorial. JavaScript events dictate how and when our scripts are executed, and introduce the whole concept of interactivity on our web pages.\n\nFor example, when the window loads, that's an event which could fire some code. When a user clicks on a button, that's an event that could fire some code. YOUR job as a JavaScript developer is to write code that reacts to these events to create that interactivity.\n\nAny questions, fire away :). \n\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== JavaScript for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i9Ae2D9Ee1RvylH38dKuET\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n\n========== HTML for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
