description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nUsing Kubernetes to Make Cellular Data Plans Cheaper for 50 Million Users - Chandrasekhar Reddy Dodda, Mirantis & Amar Padmanabhan, Facebook Connectivity \n\nA year ago, the CNCF Telecom User Group envisioned NFVi architecture where K8s replaces OpenStack as the virtual infrastructure manager. Today the first real-world use case of this has emerged, at an APAC telco with 50 million mobile subscribers.  The speaker will discuss the use case and technical implementation, where pure K8s based NFV infrastructure is used in production to run an open source evolved packet core. The system is designed to offload cellular data to WiFi and uses K8s to orchestrate all components of the packet core, including containerd pods and Virtlet pods running VMs. The talk will explain how Genie provides connectivity between various pods with multiple, different network interfaces per pod.  A demo will show how K8s powered NFVI makes it possible to seamlessly authenticate and roam between WiFi and LTE access points with no handover lag.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZepN"
