title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2014 - QuickCheck: Beyond the Basics - David Laing'
recordingDate: 1421915580
description: "The goal of the talk is to demonstrate non-trivial uses of QuickCheck for testing Haskell programs. Outside of papers and book chapters, most of the information on QuickCheck only covers very basic usage. This talk is about the more advanced uses of QuickCheck, including the use of QuickCheck with monadic code, as well as how QuickCheck can be used in the parallel development of code and specifications.\n\nThe talk will begin with a very brief overview of the usual basic level QuickCheck as described in Real World Haskell and various sources on the internet. This will introduce some tests involving sorting and searching. These tests will be iterated on to demonstrate the development of QuickCheck specifications, along with some of the more advanced features of QuickCheck and how to avoid some common errors.\n\nThe next part of the talk will develop a purely functional queue and show that it is correct via both an algebraic specification and a model-based specification. This should give a really good feel for how to develop useful specifications and what they typically end up looking like.\n\nThe final part of the talk will cover the use of QuickCheck with monadic code. As well as demonstrating the use of the monadic interface to QuickCheck, this will work through a few small examples to help build an intuition for the kinds and scopes of problems which QuickCheck can be applied to.\n\nExtended versions of the example code, slides and links to the reference materials used will be available via github.\n\nFor more on YOW!
