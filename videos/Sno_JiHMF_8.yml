description: "If you want to go fast, you need abstraction. Uncle Bob says that a good architecture is one that maximizes the number of decisions NOT made. I agree. Abstraction is what in object oriented programming enables us defer decisions and thus to follow the ever changing demands of our customers as quickly as possible.\n\nIn some sense... Abstraction is pragmatism. Let's talk about why.\n\nBy the way if you're wondering why the numbering seems off. The battery died a while into this video and so I wasn't entirely happy with the material that I did have. Which is why this video was left collecting dust on my disk. But I decided to supplement the \"lost\" part with slides which is why I'm uploading it now :)\n\nOriginal upload date:\nJun 4, 2016"
