description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCNCF TAG 网络和服务网格工作组 | CNCF TAG Network and Service Mesh Working Group - Lee Calcote, Layer5; Ed Warnicke, Cisco; Ken Owens, Fiserv\n\n随着基于微服务的分布式系统的日益盛行，确实如此：网络作为一门学科，在云原生部署的高效运行中从未如此关键。包括负载均衡、可观察性、认证、授权、策略、速率限制、QoS、网状网络、传统基础设施桥接等在内的网络基元现在正得到整个行业的大量开发和投资，并且是CNCF TAG网络和服务网状工作组的重点关注对象。聆听我们的简介并深入了解工作组内正在管理的服务网状项目。 With the increased prevalence of microservice-based distributed systems, it’s true: networking as a discipline has never been more critical in the efficient operation of cloud native deployments. Networking primitives, including load balancing, observability, authentication, authorization, policy, rate limiting, QoS, mesh networks, legacy infrastructure bridging, and so on are now receiving substantial development and investment throughout the industry and are the subject of focus of the CNCF TAG Network and Service Mesh Working Group.\n\nJoin us for an introduction and deep-dive into the service mesh projects being stewarded within the working group."
