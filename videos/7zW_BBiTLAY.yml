language: English
recordingDate: 1588633202
description: "Measure Twice, Cut Once by Alec Clarke\n\n\"Woodworking and writing code go hand in hand, right?\n\nOn the surface these two activities may seem different, but the skills, tools, and mindset required to create quality furniture are consistent with the qualities required to write code that delights both the customer and developer.\n\nAs a woodworking hobbyist and software developer, I was amazed at how learning to build a table taught me to be a more impactful developer. In this talk weâ€™ll discover how woodworking can teach us to move fast and not break things, be more consistent in our execution, and deliver lasting value to customers.\"\n\n__________\n\nAlec is a software developer and woodworking enthusiast who works remotely from Kingston, Ontario for Clio where he focuses on creating an enjoyable and effortless experience between law firms and their clients."
