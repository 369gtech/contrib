description: "Category Theory has become one of the hot topics in our community. Why is this theory suddenly so interesting for developers? Why are the cool kids talking so much about it?\n\nDuring this talk, you will explore the general principles of Category Theory in a pragmatic, non-mathematical way. You will discover practical examples of how this theory has managed to simplify and solve common challenges that we encounter in our code daily, such as nullable values, error handling, parallel and sequential operations and data validation. Also, you will learn how to apply them to create our own category theory library from scratch in Scala with scalacheck as the only dependency.\n\nMore details on website: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2017/daniela-sfregola"
