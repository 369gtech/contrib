title: 'Broadening implementation options of a .NET platform by adding a JavaScript SDK - CFS2006'
recordingDate: 1557257204
description: "For years, we have been a Microsoft-first company. Our web experience platform runs on Windows, our developers are .NET developers, and our customers implement custom web experiences using MVC.\r\n\r\nWith the rise in popularity and capabilities of front-end JavaScript frameworks, we saw an opportunity to give our customers more implementation and UX options. But we faced a challenge -we needed to build a JavaScript API for front-end developers who are unfamiliar with our system and ideologies. We wanted to enable them to harness all the features of our platform without being opinionated about framework specifics or forcing them to change how they code.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will share the journey of building our JavaScript SDK. Session takeaways:\r\n- Insights into the architecture decisions that allow our JavaScript layer to control our .NET layer.\r\n- How we designed an implementation workflow to ensure the best developer experience (DX).\r\n- What it takes to support multiple front-end frameworks."
