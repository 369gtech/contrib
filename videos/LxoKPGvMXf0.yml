description: "Python and GraphQL\n[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-27 - Lammermuir]\n[Edinburgh, UK]\n\nBy Alec MacQueen\n\nGraphQL query language is gaining popularity and seeing more adoption.\nThis is mainly due to the efficiency with which consumers can get their data, the ease with which you can document and explore your API and the powerful tooling that has been built around the query language.\n\nThis talk is for novices and experts of GraphQL alike and aims to cover the basics of the query language, how to implement it using Flask and SQLAlchemy and to take a deeper dive into how Python’s type-hinting can be used to generate your GraphQL schema. \n\nI’ll also be talking about some of the tooling that can be used to provide consumers and developers working on your API with a great development experience. Next I'll cover some ways you can use these tools to empower your development process and get you developing 'API First'. \n\nTo get the most out of this talk you should have a general understanding of APIs, Python frameworks and Python ORMs. However, my aim is to make it as accessible as possible for developers of all experience levels.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/speaker-release-agreement/"
