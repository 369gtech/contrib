description: "Learn how to use Azure Maps (https://aka.ms/MapsTechCommunity) to analyze a catchment area around a retail store. ShiSh Shridhar, Principal PM in the Azure IoT Team, who spent 15 years on the Microsoft Industry Retail team, will demo how to build a catchment analysis for a café in downtown Seattle. You will see how Azure Maps can pull in data on locations, competitors, traffic, and public transit through Microsoft partnerships with TomTom and Moovit. Azure Maps also ingests data from any data provider including companies that offer human mobility data. You’ll see how a catchment analysis can help a retailer analyze business disruptors, decide where best to open a store, or identify opportunities for expanding business. You’ll walk away from this show understanding why Azure maps is much more than a map rendering platform.\n\nResources\nAzure Maps product page                        https://azuremaps.com \nCatchment analysis Github code            https://aka.ms/RetailCatchment\nAzure Maps on Twitter                             https://twitter.com/AzureMaps\nAzure Maps on reddit                               https://reddit.com/r/azuremaps \nAzure Maps on IoT Tech Community     https://aka.ms/MapsTechCommunity\n\n#azureiot #iot #azuremaps"
