description: "Code is Here: http://goo.gl/lDM30\n\nBest Java Book : http://goo.gl/FtKp0m\n\nIn this tutorial I do something kind of crazy. I try to teach programming logic by writing code right out of my head. You probably won't understand everything in this video, but that's OK.\n\nI continue making a simple game in Java. I specifically make a method that allows my monsters to move on the game board without landing on each other and blocks them from falling off the board."
