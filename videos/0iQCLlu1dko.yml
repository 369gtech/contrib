description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nJuly 28, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Misko Hevery.\r\n\r\nAngular teaches your old browser new tricks. It is what HTML would have been like, if it was designed for building web-applications. Angular is radical because it eliminates boilerplate code with declarative rather than imperative syntax.\r\n\r\nAngular: \r\n\r\n  * Allows you to create custom HTML elements and attributes that provide dynamic behavior\r\n  * Declaratively describe web-applications behavior with little JavaScript.\r\n  * Creates an environment that provides trivially reusable widgets, data-binding, \"automatic MVC\", server resources, and other primitives useful in building AJAX apps.\r\n  * Builds apps that have orders of magnitude less JavaScript than equivalent apps written in classical way.\r\n * Eliminates waiting on compiling for UI changes."
