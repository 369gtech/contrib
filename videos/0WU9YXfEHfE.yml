title: 'Tech3camp#75 (Java): Maciej Przepióra - The new wave of Java web frameworks...'
language: English
recordingDate: 1616686396
description: "You might have heard about some of them or maybe even about all: Micronaut, Quarkus and Helidon. And you probably wonder: What are those frameworks? What is the difference between them? What makes them stand out when compared to JEE and Spring Boot? Would I have to learn a lot of new stuff if I wanted to start using them? My goal is to answer those and other questions and help you decide if the new wave of Java web frameworks is worth your time.\n\nWystąpienie w języku polskim. Prezentacja miała miejsce 23.03.2021."
