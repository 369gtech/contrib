description: "Antonio is an Agile Delivery Consultant for OpenCredo having joined the company in 2015 and responsible for enabling the delivery of a number of projects across various clients for OpenCredo. Antonio comes from a technical background with experience in Spain, France and United Kingdom, where he acts as the bridge between the business and the development team in order to maximize results and customer satisfaction.\nBefore OpenCredo Antonio was a project manager for TUI group. Antonio is a Certified Scrum Master and Certified Scrum Product Owner. Antonio is passionate about creating and implementing the best solution while continually seeking to improve work methodologies. Sharing his experience with others is his real passion.\n\nThe DevOps movement is gradually changing IT organisations. Project managers are often forgotten, but they also need to change. Are project managers ready for the DevOps change?\nThe wall between Dev and Ops has now broken thanks to DevOps, but there are other walls needed to be broken. One of them is between developers and project managers, making the communication and understanding between them difficult. We need to break this wall as the project manager needs to work alongside the DevOps team in order to help the company to change the old mindset and working together sharing goals and responsibilities.\n\nAgenda:\n\n- Project Management Archaeology: Stone Age\nThis part is about project management and project delivery before Agile. Explaining the mindset and interactions between team members.\n\n- Project Management Archaeology: Renaissance\nOn this part Agile arrived to project management and project delivery, changing interactions within the team and making people to educate and learn more about other ways of delivering projects.\n\n-  Project Management in the DevOps Era\nThe next step after agile, how DevOps is changing the mindset and the place/tasks of project managers on this time.\n\n- Wrapping up"
