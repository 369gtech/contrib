recordingDate: 1493345896
description: "Fig Leaf Software recently completed a large Drupal migration effort for the United State Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. A key portion of this effort was the programmatic migration of almost the entire corpus of content from the Ektron CMS into Drupal. The complexity of this effort was magnified due to a requirement to ensure that all migrated content, especially PDF-based content, was made 508 compliant as part of the migration effort. During this session Fig Leaf Software will discuss:\n\n\nThe ins and outs of planning a migration from a .NET CMS, like Ektron, into Drupal. Specifically, the retrieval of content from Ektron, how to match it with its \"home in Drupal\", and ensure completeness\nThe steps required to complete the migration, and plan around the issues dealing with the \"delta\" between the first download of the content and the final migration\nA review of the \"gotchas\" in dealing with a site build out, along with a migration, along with a large effort to convert PDF content into 508 compliant format"
