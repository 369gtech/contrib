title: 'The Jugaad Way: WordPress Code for Non-Developers - WordCamp Singapore 2016'
recordingDate: 1473666851
description: "Speaker: Mahangu Weerasinghe\n\nIn this talk, I explore how customisable WordPress is by design, and show, with examples, how easy it is for non-developers to dive into WordPress coding. Thanks to WordPress hooks, and how well they are documented in the Codex, it’s possible to begin playing with WordPress code, even if you have little or no knowledge of PHP.\n\nThe Jugaad Way is just that: using existing resources and a task-based approach to get into WordPress code. It’s an approach that only requires that you know how to cut and paste, and is how I myself got into WordPress code.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nMahangu Weerasinghe hails from Colombo, Sri Lanka. He first found WordPress when he stumbled upon 0.70 in the dark recesses of #wordpress on Freenode. He has used and provided support for every major release of the software, and is excited about the impact the platform can have on South Asia.\n\nThough once a high school English teacher, his desire to make online publishing more democratic led him to Automattic, where he now works as a Happiness Engineer. He sincerely believes that stellar support will play a pivotal role in helping WordPress power the next 26% of the web!\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.singapore.wordcamp.org/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VfF5/"
