description: "Jan-Joost Bouwman, Enterprise Process Owner Change Management, ING\n\nIngrid Algra, IT Chapter lead, ING\n\nING is a worldwide financial institution, based in the Netherlands. The IT department of the Netherlands manages a mix of off the shelf applications and in house built software. Traditionally development was governed by CMMi and IT Servicemanagement by ITIL processes. Three years ago the developers started working in Agile/Scrum teams, dropping CMMi. The next step was to involve Operations as well and transform to an DevOps organisation, striving for Continuous Delivery.\nIn a lot of Agile organisation ITIL is considered the evil soul sucking epiphany of bureaucracy. But is it really? If we look at the tasks you perform in the ITIL processes Incident management, Problem management and Change management, you will find that a lot of those you still need to perform in an Agile/Scrum way of work. And that there actually is a lot of value in making some rules on how we want to interact in these processes between teams. But we may call the task differently than we were used to in ITIL. And we may choose to use different tools to handle parts of the process. We call this adaptation of ITIL Agile ITSM.\nThis talk focuses on the adaptations we have made to our ITSM processes to accommodate the requirements of an Agile/Scrum way of work. Proving that there is still value in a lot of the things we used to do in ITIL And that there is no real conflict between Agile and ITIL.\n\n- About Jan-Joost:\n\nJan-Joost stumbled into IT almost 20 years ago, starting on a temp job in the voice response industry for 5 days that lasted 7 years. He started as a tester but quickly became one of the leading dialogue designers in the Netherlands. He switched to IT Service Management when he joined ING, riding the wave of ITIL implementation to become Change Manager and finally Process Owner Service Management for the IT department of the Retail bank in the Netherlands. In that last capacity he has been one of the DevOps evangelists within ING, running an internal community dedicated to sharing knowledge over hundreds of teams, trying to help his co-workers to make the transition to DevOps and Continuous Delivery and have fun with it at the same time! He tries to facilitate his DevOps colleagues with a more Agile approach to the traditional ITIL Service Management processes, while automating as much as possible.\nIn his spare time he enjoys traveling the world to watch birds, or cooking, but rarely at the same time.\n\n- About Ingrid:\n\nIngrid Algra is an effective team leader who has built, guided and developed team members to become high performing teams to achieve objectives ahead of schedule and under budget. She has more than 15 years of experience in IT environments, with focus on maintenance and IT operations, delivery of new functionality, the Dev/Ops way of working, project management, change management, outsourcing, and supplier management. Ingrid is an effective communicator able to develop strong relationships with internal and external stakeholders, building consensus across multiple organizational levels. She is always looking at opportunities to continuously improve business processes with IT solutions."
