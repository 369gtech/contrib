description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-boot-for-the-web-tier\nWeb / JavaScript Track\nSpring Boot is a single point of contact for developers with the increasingly varied Spring stack,and it has many features that are useful and relevant in the web tier. This presentation shows you how to understand and harness those features for maximum benefit. We will cover the basics of opinionated application configuration, showing what Spring Boot has to offer the web developer out of the box: content negotiation, internationalization, view templates, security, messaging with websockets, etc. We will look at the embedded servlet container abstractions in Spring Boot, showing how to customize the containers, and how to extract the most from the containers at runtime. We will also show how Spring Boot can embed some other interesing and popular web technologies, like Jersey and Ratpack, giving developers instant access to a wide range of useful features, and zero-effort integration with the Spring for middleware integration."
