description: "Patrick works as a Software Craftsman, passionate Agilista, Coach and Trainer at 42talents. His biggest goal is to improve everyone’s workplace in IT.\n\nLearning new stuff from others and with others is a thing Patrick enjoys very much. Because of this, he started with a good Friend the Software Craftsmanship Zurich Meetup series.\n\nHe likes to make a difference, running experiments and having discussions with a wee dram.\n\nTalk Summary \n\n“Impact mapping can help you build products and deliver projects that make an impact, not just ship software. Impact mapping is a strategic planning technique that prevents organizations from getting lost while building products and delivering projects, by clearly communicating assumptions, helping teams align their activities with overall business objectives and make better roadmap decisions.”\n\nIn this interactive workshop, you will learn the basics of Impact Mapping, and try it out in practice on realistic examples.\n\nBased on the Open Source Workshop from Gojko we adapted a version that suits in 100mins and shows the main benefits of the Impact Mapping Technique."
