description: "Intro: KubeVirt BoF - Daniel Gonzalez Nothnagel, SAP & Scott Collier, Red Hat\n\nKubeVirt extends Kubernetes with the ability to run virtual machine workloads, as Kubernetes itself is not able to launch those. To do so KubeVirt introduces dedicated custom resources around virtualization to have enough flexibility to build and tune VMs towards existing and new use-cases. While Kubernetes is a great platform for cloud-native workloads there are also many workloads that require more isolation than containers can provide, or are just in general better served with VMs than with containers. KubeVirt aims at a seamless integration with Kubernetes in order to create one consistent cloud-native API for container and virtual workloads, sharing the same storage, network, and compute resources. In this BoF we will be discussing the basics and different use-cases of KubeVirt and adjacent projects. As an example we will explore how KubeVirt VMs can be used as nodes for a Kubernetes cluster, effectively allowing to run Kubernetes on Kubernetes. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/Ixrt"
