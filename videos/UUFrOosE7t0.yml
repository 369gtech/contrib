description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\r\nApril 4, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Chetan Kumar.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThere has been a tremendous growth in the amount and range of information available on the Internet. The users' requests for online information can be captured by a long tail model. A few popular websites enjoy a high number of visitations while the majority of the rest are less frequently requested. In this study we investigate this phenomenon using real world data from ten proxy servers in four US time zones. We demonstrate that both users' physical location and time of access affect the heterogeneity of website requests. The effect may partially be explained by differences in demographic characteristics at locations and diverse user browsing behavior on weekdays and weekends. These results can be used to design better online ad pricing strategies, affiliate advertising models, and Internet caching algorithms with sensitivities to user location and time of access differences. This may be of interest to online services providers such as Google and Facebook, given the increased interest in localized and customized online deliveries.\r\n\r\nShort bio: \r\nChetan Kumar is an Associate Professor of Information Systems and Operations Management at California State University San Marcos.
