description: "Data access and application scalability are closely related. Applications employ threads until they are done with their work while most of the time is waiting for I/O. Reactive infrastructure shifts responsibilities to where they can be handled best. It’s a move towards data streaming that does not require upfront fetching and therefore optimizes memory and computational resources.\n\nThis talk covers what a stream is and how reactive data access leverages scalability bounds by applying the most natural way of data access with Spring Data and Project Reactor. If you are a developer looking to consume data in a functional reactive style, this is your chance to gain the experience how your application can benefit from streaming data access and to learn why not everything should be reactive.\n\nKey takeaways\nYou will learn about Project Reactor and Reactive Streams.\nWe will cover types like Flux and Mono but also have a look at RxJava1 and RxJava2 types.\nWe'll have a look at building reactive APIs using Spring Data reactive support for MongoDB and Redis.\nIf we have enough time we'll see how to use all that in combination with Spring 5 WebFlux.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
