But Dan Larsson, a chemical manager and environmental consultant based in Undersåker, Sweden, isn’t so easily fooled. In an interview with Alexa Morales, Oracle Director of Developer Content, Larsson explains that “Even small companies may be dealing with 200 or 300 different chemicals in the workplace.” And unless they hire an expert like him, it's almost impossible for very small companies to have a comprehensive view of the chemicals they are exposing employees to or to comply with legislation. \n\n“Especially carcinogenic, teratogenic chemicals -- these can create a false sense of security when you use them every day and nothing happens. Everyone knows how to manage a fire hazard. But these kinds of dangers are much more sneaky.”\n\nThat’s why he founded Kemdb in 2017 to make it possible for everyone to handle the chemicals in their workplace correctly, comply with strict European chemical legislation — and make safer choices in the first place.\n\nThe “cocktail effect”\n\nThere’s a long history of discovery around the dangers of chemicals, starting in 1775 when it was first noted that chimney sweeps had a high rate of testicular cancer. The 1920s saw the introduction of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in various industries, while in the 1940s dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) became a common pesticide. In the 1970s, both PCBs and DDT were banned, and since then there’s been a drumbeat of attention paid to how chemicals in drugs, plastics, foods and more may cause cancer, disrupt the endocrine system, cause birth defects, and more. \n\nA critical concept for workplace and consumer safety, Larsson says, is the “cocktail effect”, which refers to how a safe dose of a single chemical may not be so harmless when combined with exposure to others.

The problem is that you cannot look at one chemical and say, this is OK in small amounts, because you have maybe 1000 different chemicals,” he says. “You start finding more and more chemicals that you didn't think were dangerous, but are in combination, especially for pregnant women.”\n\n#APEX #AppCreator #OracleAPEX"
