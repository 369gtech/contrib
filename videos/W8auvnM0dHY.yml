description: "You’ve always known that continuous integration is a critical part of shipping great software. Thanks to a dark-arts blend of JUnit, TestNG, and Selenium, you built a deflector shield that keeps bugs at bay. Then your team switched to Git. CI was challenging enough, with just a trunk and a release branch. Now with the explosion of active branches, things can feel downright chaotic. But never fear: CI with Git is not only possible but it's also powerful. Attend this session to learn\n&bull; How CI and Git join forces to get releases out the door faster and easier\n&bull; When to use shallow clones and repo caching\n&bull; Strategies for painless CI on feature branches\n&bull; Why Git hooks are the perfect CI sidekick\n\n\nAuthors:\n Sarah Goff-Dupont\nSarah has worked in software for over 12 years as a test engineer, scrum master, and now as a marketer for developer tools. As a champion of all things agile and automated, she loves talking to developers about their triumphs and frustrations, then blending those insights with her own experience and sharing it. It’s all about making life easier for the nerds.\nView more trainings by  Sarah Goff-Dupont at https://www.parleys.com/author/sarah-goff-dupont\n\nAshley Edwards\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Ashley Edwards at https://www.parleys.com/author/ashley-edwards\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
