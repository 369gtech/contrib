description: "G3 Model – A Practical Lean Approach to Improve Technology Delivery in Banks\n\nMr. Philippe Guenet, Executive Delivery Manager, GFT\n\n2008 was not only the bursting of the credit bubble, but also the explosion of the technical debt in banks. Years / decades of silo-organisations, growth based acquisition and IT legacy led to high cost of ownership and quasi paralysis when faced with high demand on technology resulting from Regulatory changes and Digitalisation. The adoption of Agile aimed to change this but it is slow coming. As a professional service organisation we often feel powerless, like most of our stakeholders, in driving better software delivery lifecycle. We have analysed the blockers step by step and established a new delivery model mixing Lean and Agile to overcome the constraints. In this talk we will review the typical patterns of IT waste and the practical solutions we experimented with to drive a more efficient delivery of technology – now in its 3rd generation (G3 model).\n\nDevOps Enterprise Summit London 2016\nevents.itrevolution.com/eur\nIT Revolution\nitrevolution.com"
