description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Renaud Mathieu, NEOS.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=172261\n\nAndroid does not provide a native solution to detect barcodes in your application. However, some barcode image processing libraries are available but it is not always easy to use them for top performance.\r\nThrough this talk, we will see how to implement barcode detection in your Android application from camera management to optimization of barcode recognition thanks to machine learning."
