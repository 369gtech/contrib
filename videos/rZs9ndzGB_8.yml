description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nIterator Haiku: How five iterator categories blossomed into seven, and Sentinels trimmed them back to five again. Recently proposed changes to the ranges TS distill its seven iterator categories back to five without sacrificing any expressive power. Removing operations that are extraneous in the Sentinel world eliminates a potential source of programming errors. \n— \nCasey Carter\nSoftware Engineer II, Microsoft\nCasey Carter is longtime user of C++ who recently ended his career in aerospace manufacturing to participate in C++ standardization. After attending a WG21 meeting, his enthusiasm for Concept library design and semantics somehow turned into authorship of the Ranges TS. He is currently pursuing interests in Ranges, world domination, and doughnuts at Microsoft Redmond.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
