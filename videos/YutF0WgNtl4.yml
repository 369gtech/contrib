description: "Join CÃ©drick Lunven and special guest Mark Paluch as we show you how to build a ToDo app on Apache Cassandra using Spring Boot and Spring Data. Mark is a Software Craftsman, Spring Data Project Lead and Lead of the Lettuce Redis driver, so we are very excited to have him join us for this workshop! From Data Modelling to Endpoint Exposure, you will have to create the data model and develop the service. We will cover multiple frameworks and implementation strategies: Spring, Spring-Boot, Spring Data Spring Web MVC.\n\nWe'll explore the power of these frameworks and you will get hands-on experience in building a ToDo application!\n\nWe will do all of our work in the cloud with Gitpodâ€™s open-source, zero-install and collaborative development environment. We'll use Apache Cassandraâ„¢ as the database to fit the highly concurrent, non-blocking nature of our reactive application. Build a Reactive app in Apache Cassandraâ„¢ with Spring Framework\n\nðŸ“¥ Workshop resources:\nhttps://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-data-cassandra\nLearn more about Cassandra at Apache and DataStax documentation websites.\n\nðŸš¨ Register for DataStax Astra now (http://dtsx.io/3e9RrR7) - No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.\n\nðŸ”” Sign up to our event alert:\nhttps://bit.ly/subscribe-datastaxdevsâ€‹\n\nAbout DataStax: DataStax is the company behind the massively scalable, highly available, cloud-native NoSQL data platform built on Apache Cassandraâ„¢.
