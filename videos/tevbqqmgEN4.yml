description: "More and more everyday objects are getting connected – fridges, doorbells, thermostats – even kettles. The present state of the art, along with the Maker movement, makes it really easy for anyone to design and prototype digitally connected or augmented objects – this is the real internet of things. Some very interesting and useful tools are being built. But there is also, inevitably, a lot of dumb stuff too.\n\nBetter design can help this. This talk presents some ideas about how to resist the bewitchment of new technological possibilities, and about how a naturalistic, human-centred approach to design can work better. Recent experiences developing real products are shared to help illustrate how prototyping is more important than ever, and how surprised we can be by how we react.\n\nMark Rigley\nPlayground Director, Fuel Youth Engagement\nhttps://twitter.com/markrigley\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
