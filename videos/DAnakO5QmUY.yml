description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nHow Many CPU Cycles I Need to Invest in Cloud Native Security? - Ben Hirschberg, CyberArmor \n\nTLS is the de-facto standard protocol for creating point-to-point secure communication between applications. Ideally, it should be used on every application all the time; however, the industry has a love-hate relationship toward TLS. Now, we need to protect traffic between our microservices. TLS presents additional deployment complexity and operational costs, such as considerable CPU use and high maintenance of keys and certificates. How do sidecar proxies fare against native application implementations? Which TLS implementation to use? How can TLS be optimized to deliver security and performance? In this talk, we will present an in-depth performance review of TLS over different cryptographic suites, different implementations, and different deployment models from the perspective of practicality.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZerP"
