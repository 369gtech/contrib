description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nEconomics of Zero Trust - Frederick Kautz, Sharecare & Ed Warnicke, Cisco\n\nTechnology has attempted to endlessly and mindlessly increase the cost of exploits to attackers.  This is a losing game, because the *cost to defenders* of increasing the *cost to attackers* has become a game of diminishing returns.\n \nEconomics teaches different lessons.  It teaches that ultimately the system is about the interplay between costs and benefits.  Costs and benefits for the attackers.  Costs and benefits for the defenders.\n \nIf you really want to understand Zero Trust, come here how to think beyond the technology to the economics of security and learn how SPIFFE can play a critical role in increasing the risk and decreasing the value of attacks."
