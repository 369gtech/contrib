title: 'Serverless: Functions, Containers and Beyond (Arun Gupta, USA)'
recordingDate: 1557039706
description: "https://jeeconf.com/program/serverless-functions-containers-and-beyond/\n\nServerless computing is one of the preeminent technologies driving cloud adoption and modern applications. Serverless is predicated on the simple mantra: never manage servers. While AWS Lambda enabled this new style of computing, today, serverless has grown to be more than just AWS Lambda. Container technologies have evolved to bring developers the same serverless benefits – never manage clusters. Just write code. Firecracker provides an open source virtualization technology specifically designed for serverless computing. There is innovation happening at all layers of the stack. In this talk, we’ll take a look at how the serverless computing has evolved and the myriad of serverless offerings that have been created since then. As the serverless landscape evolves rapidly, we’ll dig into what’s coming next. Is orchestration still relevant in this new paradigm? How will serverless fundamentally change the way we think about application architecture and where do we see the next wave of innovation?"
