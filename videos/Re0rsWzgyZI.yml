description: "Are you still stuck in Java EE 5? Eager to move and boost developer productivity with all the cool things introduced in Java EE 7? Attend this session to hear about some of the solutions Tomitribe had to implement to completely migrate an application called Segurnet from Java EE 5 to Java EE 7. Expect a very technical session that delves into the details. Segurnet is a platform held by APS (Portuguese Insurance Association) that has served as an integration network for the insurance sector in Portugal for the last 20 years, with more than 33,000 active users.\n\nSpeaker:\nRoberto Cortez, Senior Software Engineer, Tomitribe\nMy name is Roberto Cortez and I was born in Venezuela, but I have spent most of my life in Coimbra – Portugal, where I currently live. I am a professional Java Developer working in the software development industry, with more than 8 years of experience in business areas like Finance, Insurance and Government. As a Freelancer / Independent Contractor I travelled around the world (an old dream) to customers, but also to attend Java conferences. The direct contact with the Java community made me want to become an active member in the community itself. For that reason, I have created the Coimbra Java User Group, started to contribute to Open Source on Github and launched this blog, so I can share some of the knowledge that I gained over the years. I hope you find it useful! Currently, I’m working with Tomitribe. After working for a few major corporations, I’m eager to help and grow something from the ground up. I’m very excited to work with all the amazing tribers working hard to make TomEE a compelling Java EE server."
