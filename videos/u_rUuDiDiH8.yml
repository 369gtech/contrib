title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: 100 Ways You Can Be An Ally'
recordingDate: 1493342277
description: "Once people see how exclusionary technical communities (and groups in general) can be, they often ask “How can I help? What can I do?” \_This short session will provide attendees with achievable, attainable and approachable next steps in their paths as allies. \_ (Yes, there will be at least 100 ways!)\n\nThe theory behind why communities are exclusionary is important, and the Drupal Diversity & Inclusion group works hard to provide that theory to anyone who wants to hear it. \_An unlimited amount of theory is still useless without action, and oftentimes people who are steeped in understanding can still be immobilized by the sheer volume of ways to get involved. \_This session is about breaking through that immobilization.\_\n\nWe will briefly define what allyship means and discuss characteristics of a good ally and then we will talk about specific categories of actions that individuals can take as they negotiate how to best be of service to those around them without burning out. \_We will work together to find a way for everyone to participate in making our community as inclusive as it can be.\_\n\n\n\nAttendees Will Leave With:\n\nAn understanding of the ways they can be most beneficial\n\nA list of actions they can take that they can do in 5 minutes… a weekend… a little bit every day.\n\nResources to grow as allies to better support a more diverse and inclusive community"
