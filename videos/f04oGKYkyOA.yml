title: 'Static Analysis in iOS - Dulma Churchill'
recordingDate: 1574361422
description: 'At Facebook, new code is being produced and shipped fast in a big code base shared by hundreds of engineers. Thus, we use a number of techniques to ensure good quality of code in this environment, such as unit and end-to-end tests and static analysis. Static analysis is a technique able to detect software errors statically, before a product is actually shipped, and without running the code. In this talk we describe the Infer Static Analyzer, an open source tool developed at Facebook that can find complex bugs such as Null Dereferences and Memory Leaks. It can also run fast in the CI, so that we can catch and fix bugs before code gets committed.'
