language: English
recordingDate: 1539618943
description: "How does your system perform under load? What are the bottlenecks, and how does it fail at its limits? How do you stay ahead as your system evolves and its workload grows?\n\nPerformance theory offers a rigorous and practical (-- yes!) approach to performance tuning and capacity planning. In this talk, we’ll dive into elegant results like Little’s Law and the Universal Scalability Law. We’ll explore the use of performance theory in real systems at companies like Facebook, and discuss how we can leverage it too, to prepare our systems for flux and scale.\n\nSpeaker: Kavya Joshi"
