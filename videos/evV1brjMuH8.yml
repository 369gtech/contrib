description: "Free and correct elections are the linchpin of democracy. For a government to be formed based on the will of the people, the will of the people must be heard. Across the world, election systems are being classified as critical infrastructure, and they face the same concerns as all other fundamental systems in society.\n\nWe are building our critical infrastructure from hardware and software built by nations and companies we canâ€™t expect to trust. How can this be dealt with in Election Security, and can those lessons be applied to other critical systems society depends on today?\n\nSave the date for NDC TechTown 2020  (31st of August - 3rd of September)\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
