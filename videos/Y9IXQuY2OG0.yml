description: "Managing my App Fleet on CloudFoundry and Kubenetes via Unified Application Model - Dimitar Donchev, SAP SE\n\nMost business applications comprise of multiple micro-services with intricate dependencies on each other, backing services, configuration as well as external dependencies. It is not unusual that in some cases these are even spanning over multiple platforms. The development, deployment, and configuration of such polyglot, distributed applications introduce a variety of lifecycle and orchestration challenges.\n\nTo address these challenges, the MultiApps project provides a declarative model, which developers utilize to describe their composite applications. Then tools, interpreting the app structure description, automate deployments and zero-downtime updates, always making sure the app is in the desired by the developer state.\n\nThe MultiApps project started by covering composite applications on Cloud Foundry. Come and see how this model is now applied also to Kubernetes workloads and even to apps spanning between the two platforms.\n\nAbout Dimitar Donchev\nA software engineer, closing a decade of experience and passion in the topic of cloud lifecycle management and software logistics. During last few years contributing to the cloudfoundry-incubator **multiapps** project.\nModel your application structure and dependencies in a declarative fashion, have it deployed with a single command, consistently and repeatable in many spaces, orgs, landscapes. Update with no down time with an out-of-the box blue-green deployment of the whole solution and do it even faster by parallelizing the process!
