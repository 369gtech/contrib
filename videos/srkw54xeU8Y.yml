description: "From Zero to Production with Kubernetes - Daniel Lopez Ridruejo & Gus Lees, Bitnami \n\nThis session provides a practical intro to deploying Kubernetes applications into production.  Kubernetes is becoming the standard platform for deploying applications in the enterprise. The Helm project provides tooling for packaging and an extensive catalog of ready to run applications. However, deploying applications in production requires much more: monitoring, logging, certificate management and so on. The community has adopted a de-facto ‘production stack’ that includes popular projects such as Prometheus, Vault, ElasticSearch, Fluentd and others. Unfortunately, putting together this basic plumbing is not standardized, and results in a lot of wasted, duplicated efforts.   This session will introduce the Kubernetes production runtime, an open source stack that can simplify and automate production deployments, and explain how it relates to Knative and Gitlab's Autodevops. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrYb"
