description: 'This talk will describe every small detail that has been changed from Rails 2 to Rails 3 in just 19 minutes, with the final minute dedicated to reading the code of ActiveSupport aloud, in its entirety. Obviously kidding! With only 20 minutes this talk will give an overview of what has improved with a highlight reel of some of the best parts (think touchdowns, field goals, and often shouting "Look at how much code I''m not writing").'
