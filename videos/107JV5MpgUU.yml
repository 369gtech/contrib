description: "CSS, and what is possible and supported in browsers, is developing and changing at a rate far faster than we have ever seen. Things that were deemed impossible a few years ago are now possible and available to explore. Learn how you can begin to incorporate some of these new creative possibilities into your work. Rachel will share practical ideas for using the new CSS. She’ll show us how it solves problems that were hard to solve in the past, and the creative opportunities it holds. She’ll explore the newest features, from fonts to colour options, layout, and animations.\n\nEVENT:\n\nØredev 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRachel Andrew\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nØredev Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish Øredev videos."
