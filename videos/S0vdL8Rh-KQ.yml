description: "Navigating Network Topologies in CFCR - Neil Hickey & Urvashi Reddy, Pivotal\n\nKubernetes is founded upon the principles of portability and plugability. This is what makes it so popular, but with greater flexibility comes greater complexity when components within Kubernetes need to communicate. The Cloud Foundry Container Runtime [CFCR] projects uses BOSH, the underlying technology which Cloud Foundry runs on, to manage the lifecycle of the infrastructure of a production Kubernetes Cluster. \n\nThis adds a new, additional layer of networking complexity to Kubernetes. This talk will be a deep dive into the networking components of CFCR and Kubernetes. Attendees will learn about the layers of networking within CFCR, both core Kubernetes networking and what additional components are used by a CFCR deployed cluster. We'll take a closer look at the Kubernetes Services layer, the overlay options, as well as what BOSH provides in the platform.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyC/navigating-network-topologies-in-cfcr-neil-hickey-urvashi-reddy-pivotal"
