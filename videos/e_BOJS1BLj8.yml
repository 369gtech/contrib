description: "How are machine learning and neuroscience related? I'll discuss some of the discoveries in neuroscience that have produced breakthroughs in machine learning from the past, present, and that will in the future in this video. Neural Networks were inspired by the brain and some of the most recent breakthroughs in AI continue to be inspired by discoveries in neuroscience (like episodic memory in the case of Deep Q). \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/machine_learning_and_neuroscience\n\nPlease Subscribe!
