title: 'Functional data that adapts to change - Don Syme - NDC Oslo 2020'
recordingDate: 1599849276
description: "Functional data is simple, safe and productive, right! However, it's also immutable, requiring recomputation when change happens. And change is everywhere....\n\nIn this talk, I'll describe how the same patterns used for functional data can be applied to \"adaptive data\". Based on internalised event sourcing, example applications include high-performance adaptive UIs for Web, mobile and also incremental computation engines. I'll be using the F# library FSharp.Data.Adaptive, though the techniques are general.\n\nSee more videos like this @NDC Conferences"
