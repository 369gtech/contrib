description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/how-cloud-foundry-is-cid\n\nFind out how Cloud Foundry does continuous integration, from a GitHub pull request against a small repository to an official final release. See how we're striving to raise the bar for open source projects when it comes to rigor, automation, and transparency of our CI. We’ll talk about how we: integrate work from community contributors and core Foundation contributors, spread across multiple teams and continents; test at multiple layers, from fast, tightly-scoped unit tests, to full blown deployments and acceptance tests across multiple IaaSes; and keep the full end-to-end process transparent to the community; not just the source code, but also the build pipelines and the discussions that surround artifact promotion.\n\nSpeaker: Amit Gupta"
