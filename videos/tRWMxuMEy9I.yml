description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nWhere Are Your Images Running? Stop Worrying and Start Encrypting! - Brandon Lum & Harshal Patil, IBM \n\nContainer image signing has made it possible for cluster operators to cryptographically verify that images are trusted. However, the same cannot be said of whether the nodes that run these images are trusted to view and use the contents of these images. This can be particularly important if compliance requires knowledge of WHERE a container image is running.  In this talk, we will show how DevOps, trust bootstrapping, and key management, in conjunction with container image encryption can achieve geofencing of execution. We will demo the new encrypted container images worker node model in containerd and cri-o working in such a context. In addition, we will explore how to bootstrap node trust, from simple setups to advanced key distribution using HW Root of Trust/TPM technologies like Keylime.  At the end, one should be able to “create an image only be usable by clusters in the EU region”.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zepc"
