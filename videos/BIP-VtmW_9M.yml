description: "*Note: Audio quality is not very clear\n\nIn this webcast presented by John Myles White, author of Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization, Machine Learning for Hackers, and Machine Learning for Email, we'll describe how to build better websites by using a family of algorithms called Bandit Algorithms. Bandit algorithms provide tools for moving beyond simple A/B testing and give developers a comprehensive framework for iteratively optimizing websites. We'll describe some simple algorithms and show how they both subsume traditional A/B testing and extend upon it.\n\nAbout John Myles White\n\nJohn Myles White is a Ph.D. student in the Princeton Psychology Department, where he studies how humans make decisions both theoretically and experimentally. Outside of academia, John has been heavily involved in the data science movement, which has pushed for an open source software approach to data analysis. He is also the lead maintainer for several popular R packages, including ProjectTemplate and log4r."
