title: 'Micronaut: Natively Cloud Native'
recordingDate: 1586856919
description: 'Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full stack microservices framework designed for building modular, easily testable Microservice applications in Java, Kotlin or Groovy. Micronaut is developed by the creators of Grails and takes inspiration from lessons learnt over the years building real-world applications from monoliths to microservices using Spring, Spring Boot and Grails.Micronaut was designed from the ground up for building microservices for the cloud. As a result, many key features that typically require external libraries or services are available within your application itself. To override one of the industryâ€™s current favourite buzzwords, Micronaut applications are "natively cloud-native".The following are some of the cloud-specific features that are integrated directly into the Micronaut runtime:Distributed Configuration Service Discovery Client-Side Load-Balancing Distributed Tracing Serverless Functions'
