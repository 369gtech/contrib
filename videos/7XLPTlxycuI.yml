title: 'Complete Code Craft by Alastair Smith'
recordingDate: 1439550671
description: "Complete Code Craft \nby Alastair Smith \n(@alastairs)\n\nSoftware Craftsmanship is a topic close to Alastair’s heart, and he’s here to explain why. Sometimes misconceived as a dedication to gold-plating and perfectionism, we’ll explore the general theme of craftsmanship and the pragmatism underpinning it. We’ll look at the skills required of us as modern software craftsmen, the tools available to us to help us to grow our teams, and our responsibilities to our colleagues, the products we build, and the organisations we work for. \n\nAlastair is a developer at Redgate, based in Cambridge. He enjoys writing C# on the back end and HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the front end, but he's tried a number of languages and found his real interests lie in good coding practices and ensuring software quality with automated tests. He is the founder of the Cambridge Software Craftsmanship Community and a co-organiser of DDD East Anglia.  \n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Norfolk-Developers-NorDev/events/222590777/"
