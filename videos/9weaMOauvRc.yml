description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nThere is no shortage of AI startups today that are productizing methods in specific domains to solve problems in a repeatable way. While this frequently works in areas with very consistent data sources and fixed fields, many companies still struggle to create operational models in their business domains. Challenges also remain around building organizations capable of in-house development, largely due to a shortage of individuals for hire.\n\nAt Salesforce, Einstein addresses this need by truly democratizing AI. In this talk we will cover how we are reducing the human effort for our customers to solve cases in their service centers by building models on their data in Service Cloud. We will describe the underlying framework enabling models specified for each of our individual customers and return results back to massively decrease the time it takes to solve cases.\n\nIn describing the approach we will provide an overview of the platform and how it enables our customers at every step. This will include how we specify timeliness of data ingest, automation of feature engineering, model selection and tuning specific to each customer via Optimus Prime, and making the model immediately actionable by pushing the results back to Service Cloud. The platform overview will emphasize how various components function and result in scalable services by leveraging technologies such as AKKA, Spark, SparkML and the AWS lambda architecture. Through this we will demonstrate how Einstein accelerates the process of developing operational models and brings AI to all our customers."
