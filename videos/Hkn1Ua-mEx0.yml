description: "Service Oriented Architecture has been around for a while, now Microservices is the new black, that’s cool, but can we learn from when we failed and succeeded implementing SOA? There are some really useful lessons we can take and avoid the pitfalls.\n\nSean Farmar holds the world record for answering the most NServiceBus questions - even more than Udi :-).\nWith over 20 years of experience, he specializes in providing simple solutions for complex business requirements using NServiceBus and applying SOA principles inspired by Udi Dahan.\nAs a solution architect with Particular Software, the creators of NServiceBus, Sean provides support, training and consulting for customers using NServiceBus and the Particular Platform."
