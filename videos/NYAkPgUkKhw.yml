title: 'Tanzu TV - Between Chair and Keyboard - The one with Baruch Sadogursky'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630354765
description: 'Please join Nate Schutta and Baruch Sadogursky, (a.k.a JBaruch), the Head of DevOps Advocacy and a Developer Advocate at JFrog. His passion is speaking about technology. Well, speaking in general, but doing it about technology makes him look smart, and 19 years of hi-tech experience sure helps. When he’s not on stage (or on a plane to get there), he learns about technology, people and how they work, or more precisely, don’t work together. He is a co-author of the Liquid Software book, a CNCF ambassador and a passionate conference speaker on DevOps, DevSecOps, digital transformation, containers and cloud-native, artifact management, and other topics, and is a regular at the industry’s most prestigious events including KubeCon, DockerCon, Devoxx, DevOps Days, OSCON, Qcon, JavaOne and many others. You can see some of his talks at jfrog.com/shownotes'
