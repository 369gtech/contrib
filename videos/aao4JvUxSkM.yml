description: "Join Cris and Gavin for a chat about database performance tuning with Cecilia Grant (Architect, Oracle Development). Please review Cecilia's performance tips post on the Exadata blog (link below) ... we bring you the expert, and you bring the questions!\n\nHighlights:\n\n00:11 Welcome \n00:43 Blog post http://blogs.oracle.com/exadata/ten-tips-for-database-performance-tuning\n00:58 Discussion is about Database Performance everywhere, not just on Exadata\n01:39 Gavin introduces Cecilia Grant\n02:34 Safe Harbor slide\n02:49 The 2-3 most important performance tips\n02:57 -- Let the data guide you\n03:50 -- Database tuning doesn't change much for Exadata\n04:20 -- Keep good baselines\n05:09 -- Recap & discussion\n06:08 Should you tune performance on Exadata?\n06:25 -- \"Smart features\" let you get away with a lot, but ...\n07:01 -- You still need to write good SQL and design schemas properly\n07:32 What is a Storage Index - the best I/O is the I/O you don't do\n08:19 -- Storage Indexes/Indices are ephemeral - how are they rebuilt?\n08:41 -- Conventional Indices/Indexes are still relevant - persistent and less CPU cost\n09:19 How do I keep a baseline?\n09:52 What is IORM? Should I use it?\n09:55 -- IORM is on by default on Exadata\n10:09 -- IORM useful to control I/O when hosting multiple databases\n10:34 -- Backtrack: IORM defined\n11:05 -- Plans and tiers with IORM\n11:24 -- Examples of tiers\n11:51 I/O outliers on Exadata?\n12:13 -- Make sure it's an I/O problem\n12:26 -- We expect workload to be distributed evenly\n12:59 -- We saw recently a case like that, but...\n13:20 -- Normally you reach max capacity on all disks\n13:35 -- Apply top tips: use AWR, look at the data\n14:15 Where do I find data showing Exadata performance benefits?\n14:28 -- Reducing I/O, AWR shows SI savings and CC savings\n14:45 -- The SQL monitor report - cell offload efficiency\n15:08 -- Comparing to non-Exadata machines \n15:33 What about performance on Autonomous DB?\n15:50 -- You get an AWR report, but restricted to the PDB\n16:12 -- The data you get is ...\n16:25 -- Performance tuning?\n16:52 -- Concentrate on the upper level / application\n17:07 How to architect your data?\n17:29 -- Normal forms are good but denormalization may be useful\n17:48 -- Beyond the model, look at access patterns\n18:01 -- Access patterns, explained\n18:34 -- Example: model too complicated\n19:24 Persistent Memory (PMEM) in write-through instead of write-back mode?\n19:47 -- How it works with flash - write-through\n19:58 -- How it works with flash - write-back\n20:03 -- How it works with PMEM\n20:20 -- Why use write-through with PMEM\n20:32 -- -- DB writes are asynchronous, i.e., user doesn't wait for them\n20:53 -- How is it different from flash?\n21:54 Is the PMEM cache write-through by default?\n21:58 New features planned for PMEM?\n22:22 -- See also last month's AskTOM on Exadata X8M, with Jia Shi\n22:49 -- We used PMEM in the architecturally best manner\n23:20 How Cecilia got into performance tuning?\n24:13 What it takes to work in performance\n25:09 How do the customer experiences connect with our technology design and tuning?\n25:30 -- A number of teams  bring different facets of experience with the product to dev\n26:08 -- Similarly with the Support escalations\n26:51 If PMEM is not available, can I still benefit from, e.g., RAM cache features?\n27:15 -- Flash speeds v. PMEM speeds\n27:34 Websites, whitepapers and other resources?\n28:45 Your ideas and questions for topics and experts are welcome\n29:00 Do old DB performance methods / tools still apply?\n29:27 -- Example recent escalation\n31:12 Can Storage Index be stored in Flash cache?\n31:28 What can cause increasing logfile parallel writes?\n32:17 When is the Storage Index built?\n33:09 Storage Index across Storage Servers / Cells\n34:00 End remarks\n\nAbout the Exadata Office Hours\n\nA monthly opportunity to interact with the Oracle Exadata development experts and technical leadership. Exadata is engineered to deliver dramatically better performance, cost effectiveness, and availability for Oracle databases.
