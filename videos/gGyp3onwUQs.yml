description: "Who can ignore microservices in 2015? Everybody is talking about them and telling how they will save your projects and your organization. However, nobody is telling you about the cost of implementing microservices. This talk will be organized in 3 parts:\n\n- In the first part, I will show what benefits you can expect from using microservices; then let you decide by yourself if you are in the case you need them.\n- In the second part, I will highlight the consequences of what using microservices imply, both in terms of organization and from a technical point of view.\n- Despite all of this, the last part will contain a glimmer of hope. I will present some features of libraries that you can already use right now though you don’t have the latest hype architecture.\n\nAfter attending this talk, you’ll be able to decide by yourself whether microservices is the right architecture for you."
