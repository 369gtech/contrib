description: "http://solidcon.com\nA conversation with Joi Ito (MIT Media Lab)\nand Jon Bruner (O'Reilly Media), \n\"Manufacturing, Design, Hardware, and the Code that makes sense of it all\"\n\nPhysical things—machines, devices, components—are about to experience a profound transformation. The Internet fundamentally changed how software is developed and deployed, and now hardware is on the brink of a similar disruption. Consumers, already carrying smart phones and driving cars that park themselves, have come to demand more from their objects than ever before. They expect their belongings to \"know\" them, to interact with them, and to adapt to their needs. Industry is realizing that smart, networked machines can bring them the efficiencies and new capabilities to do more, faster and cheaper. Devices from thermostats to jet engines that were once strictly mechanical are now seamless blends of hardware and software—packages of microcontrollers, sensors, and, above all, networked software that can ingest lots of data, understand context, and make intelligent decisions. Hardware and software are fusing into a single fluid entity.\n\n - Don't miss an upload! Subscribe! http://goo.gl/szEauh - \nStay Connected to O'Reilly Media.
