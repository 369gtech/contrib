description: "Running MySQL on Kubernetes - Patrick M. Galbraith, Oracle \n\nMySQL is the world's most popular open source database and there are a number of ways to run it on Kubernetes. This talk will explain and demonstrate how running a complex stateful application such as a database is made easier using Kubernetes.     MySQL deployment patterns covered will start with simple MySQL asynchronous replicated master/slave MySQL and Galera synchronous multi-master replication both deployed as StatefulSets using a Helm charts.     Following the simple patterns, a detailed discussion and demonstration will showcase the MySQL Operator which uses group replication and the MySQL router and makes creating MySQL clusters, backups, and restorations trivial.    Next to be covered will be the Vitess Clustering system and its operator for horizontal scaling of MySQL which has numerous benefits such as built-in sharding and shard management, connection-pooling, query sanitization. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/Grb4"
