description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nScaling Fluentd From 0 to Millions of Events- TK Kubota, ITOCHU Techno-Solutions America, Inc \n\nWe have seen the impact of data formats, messaging sizes, event rates, and even data sources causing challenges. For the successful operation in a large scale environment, understanding the performance characteristics of Fluentd and designing a proper solution architecture are important. TK has had the opportunities to work with many large institutions with thousands of servers deployed with Fluentd / Fluent Bit and will show how internals of Fluentd / Fluent Bit impact performance as well as benchmark results. We will share tips and tricks on how to optimize and tune parameters for your own deployments based on characteristics of input, filter, buffer and output pipelines. Lastly, we will discuss how to go beyond tuning and how to increase performance with additional compute / multi workers / and deployment architectures."
