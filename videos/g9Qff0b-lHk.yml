description: "ARIA 1.1 Spec: https://goo.gl/1rGD7S\nARIA Authoring Practices 1.1: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/\n\nHere on a11ycasts I always try to encourage developers to use native controls rather than roll their own mainly because you get semantics and keyboard functionality for free. But there are situations where you need to build something and there's no native analog in the platform. For these occasions when you need to go offroad and build your own control, the Web Content Accessibility Initiatives Accessible Rich Internet Applications spec (WAI-ARIA) can help you add in the semantics your new custom control is missing. Today on the show I'll cover what ARIA is from a high level and show off some of the features and relationships ARIA let's you take advantage of.\n\nWhy do semantics matter?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2tzEil5TL0\n\nWatch all A11ycasts episodes: https://goo.gl/06qEUW\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers YouTube channel for updates on new episodes of A11ycasts: http://goo.gl/LLLNvf"
