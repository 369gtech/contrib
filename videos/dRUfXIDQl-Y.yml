recordingDate: 1493242213
description: "In many organizations, especially in the agency world, the sales team that is responsible for bringing in new business can be isolated from the rest of the staff. They operate on their own and often bring in opportunities through a process that does not incorporate input from the various departments within their company. There is a\_constant struggle to bring in new projects and grow revenue, and that should not create conflict with other departments. Our session will focus on how to solve this issue and provide insights on how to develop a process that brings everyone together during the sales phase.\n\nCreating a sense of shared responsibility for new business and developing an environment where it is a whole agency discipline is critical. We will talk about our approach over the recent years and how we have shifted our process to reflect this idea. Our agency, Elevated Third, has learned a great deal about how to improve this aspect of our business through various experiences that we will highlight to illustrate this point.\n\nWe will explain how both the design and creative team, as well as the technical team are involved in evaluating opportunities, estimating, creating a proposal and presenting a final pitch. The group presenting will include our CEO, development director, and a member of our business development team. We want to provide useful information and highlight real examples that can help other organization using Drupal in making sure that the sales team does not live in a silo and that everyone has a role in winning new clients.\n\nDuring our presentation we will show the details of our process to help provide as much useful information as possible. Our team will present the deliverables that we use internally to explain exactly how we connect the different groups within our agency to create a fluid and inclusive procedure. We want to show the “how” and provide attendees with the tools to execute within their own organizations.\n\nThis session will be helpful for anyone who provides Drupal services for clients."
