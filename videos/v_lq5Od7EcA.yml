recordingDate: 1518781221
description: "GitHub is an important part of a developer's workflow. It helps developers coordinate and collaborate on software. But most of the help that GitHub provides is in the browser, waiting for developers to reach out to it. Meanwhile, developers write code on their own machines with text editors and IDEs. We can reduce friction and improve workflows by bridging that gap.\n\nThe GitHub Client Apps team extends GitHub beyond the browser to fill that gap. This team consists of Atom, Electron, Desktop, and Editor Tools. In this talk, you'll learn about the tools we've shipped and some new stuff we're working on to make your GitHub workflows better."
