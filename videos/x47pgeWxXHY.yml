description: "More rapidly then ever, companies are adopting new technologies, tooling and practices, that allow them to be so agile that it changes their culture overnight. Disruptors are being disrupted within the year. Fast movers are overhauled quickly due to instant response of competitors. Longterm strategies, roadmaps and plans appear useless.\n\nDuring this inspiring talk Kim van Wilgen shows you how moving towards continuous delivery and DevOps changes the DNA of your company. Learn how continuous delivery will speed up your company at all levels. How your thinking changes through the presence of fast feedback, short cycles and data-driven decision making. Itâ€™s time to move to the continuous culture."
