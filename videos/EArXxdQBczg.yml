description: "Join us on this weekly Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database, where Hadi Javaherian, Senior AppDev and Integration Platform Specialist will explain all the benefits of the integration between Oracle Stream Analytics and Oracle Machine Learning Services.  He will share how this is directly related to the concept of Data Mesh at a high level, and will also show how easy it is for a user to create models using OML AutoML UI and deploy them in seconds to OML Services, which then are made available immediately to Oracle Stream Analytics for real time scoring.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks offers an easy-to-use, interactive, multi-user, collaborative interface based on Apache Zeppelin notebook technology, and support SQL, PL/SQL, Python and Markdown interpreters. It is available on all Autonomous Database versions and Tiers, including the always-free editions.\n\nOML includes AutoML, which provides automated machine learning algorithm features for algorithm selection, feature selection and model tuning, in addition to a specialized AutoML UI exclusive to the Autonomous Database.\n\nOML Services is also included in Autonomous Database, where you can deploy and manage native in-database OML models as well as ONNX ML models (for classification and regression) built using third-party engines, and can also invoke cognitive text analytics.\n\nVideo highlights\n00:40 Topics for Today\n00:52 Upcoming Sessions\n01:34 GGSA and AutoML UI - Data Mesh in Practice\n02:31 Data Fabric, Stream Processing and Data Mesh\n03:04 Data Capital\n03:28 Attributes of a Trusted Data Mesh\n05:15 Data Products\n06:08 A Decentralized Mesh\n07:23 Streaming Data Pipelines\n08:03 GoldenGate Stream Analytics\n08:58 Tangible, Trusted Data Products\n10:15 AutoML UI Experiment - OML Simplified\n10:55 GGSA and AutoML UI Integration\n12:33 Data Mesh with Stream Analytics and AutoML UI\n14:37 Live Demo - Oracle Stream Analytics\n16:18 Live Demo - Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI\n17:09 Live Demo - OML Models\n17:58 Live Demo - Oracle Stream Analytics\n21:42 Q&A"
