description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nReturn of the Kraken: Bioinformatics at Scale with Kubernetes - Cab Maddux, Day Zero Diagnostics \n\nKraken, the legendary sea monster of Scandinavian lore, whose supposed size and appearance would strike fear into the toughest of Nordic sailors, has nothing on the Johns Hopkins-developed taxonomic sequence classification bioinformatics tool that shares its name. A complex C++ and Perl codebase, coupled with an intense resource footprint - including requiring 220G of RAM at runtime - makes applying Kraken reliably at scale as daunting as meeting a colossal cephalopod on open water. In this talk, we’ll discuss how we’re using Kubernetes, Prometheus and Helm at Day Zero Diagnostics to run complex, research-oriented bioinformatics tools, like Kraken, to support the rapid profiling of pathogenic bacteria at scale. More broadly, we’ll address the growing intersection of complex, specialized academic software and its non-academic application at scale with modern tooling and infrastructure. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekDm"
