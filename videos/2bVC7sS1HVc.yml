description: "Flink Forward Berlin, September 2018 #flinkforward\n\nComputing aggregates over windows is at the core of virtually every stream processing job. Typical stream processing applications involve overlapping windows and, therefore, cause redundant computations. Several techniques prevent this redundancy by sharing partial aggregates among windows. However, these techniques do not support out-of-order processing and session windows. Out-of-order processing is a key requirement to deal with delayed tuples in case of source failures such as temporary sensor outages. Session windows are widely used to separate different periods of user activity from each other. Current versions of Apache Flink use Window Buckets to process stream aggregations with session windows and out-of-order tuples. This Approach does not share partial aggregates among overlapping windows. In our talk, we present Scotty, a high throughput operator for window discretization and aggregation in Apache Flink. Scotty splits streams into non-overlapping slices and computes partial aggregates per slice. These partial aggregates are shared among all overlapping windows including session windows. Scotty introduces the first slicing technique which (1) enables stream slicing for session windows in addition to tumbling and sliding windows and (2) processes out-of-order tuples efficiently. Scotty was first published at ICDE 2018 (http://www.user.tu-berlin.de/powibol/assets/publications/traub-scotty-icde-2018.pdf).\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
