description: "Flutter, now one year stable, is becoming the de facto standard for multi-platform apps. But what does this mean for companies and agencies? A huge opportunity to build better products! Combining teams which usually never touch each others code creates friction. But given all the benefits of a large diverse team, working on the same codebase is definitely worth it. Learn from teams which actually moved from native to Flutter and their best practices. \n\nAbout:\n\nPascal Welsch, Freelancer, Google Developer Expert for Flutter\n\nPascal is Google Developer Expert for Flutter with a strong Android background.
