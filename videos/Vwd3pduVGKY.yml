description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2016\n—\nThis talk builds on the date/time library presented last year and shows how one can handle conversions among multiple time zones in a type-safe manner. \n\nThe entire library is very much chrono-centric, and so inherits desirable features from chrono such as type safety and arbitrary precision. \n\nThis time zone libraries have divided themselves by structure and concepts such as absolute time and civil time. While these concepts are useful, and found in this library, this library cuts in other dimensions. \n\nThis library draws a clear distinction between calendars and times. Thus this library has been designed from the ground up to not only work well with the Gregorian calendar, but with other calendars as well. Even with calendars written by you. It accomplishes this by using the chrono library  as its chief communication channel with the calendar. \n\nThis talk is a sequel to my Cppcon 2015 talk a date/time library: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzyGjOm8AKo \n\nIf you can, see my talk earlier this week about chrono, and my talk about an example calendar from last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzyGjOm8AKo. This talk builds upon these foundational tools.\n— \nHoward Hinnant\nSenior Software Engineer, Ripple\nLead author of several C++11 features including: move semantics, unique_ptr and . | | Lead author on three open source projects: A std::lib implementation: http://libcxx.llvm.org | An Itanium ABI implementation: http://libcxxabi.llvm.org | A date/time/timezone library: https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
