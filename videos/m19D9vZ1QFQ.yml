Two years ago they started using Kubernetes, betting on namespace-level multitenancy to provide isolation between teams and projects. Today they have over 40 internal tenants, 100,000 pods, 4,000 nodes, and… an embarrassing number of KubeDNS replicas.    This session will take you through the motivations, story, and results of migrating to multitenant Kubernetes, along with some hard-earned Pro Tips from the trenches.     You’ll also learn about the open source tooling they built around Spinnaker, Vault, Google Cloud, and Istio in order to integrate with our multitenant Kubernetes.     Come see how they went from barely isolated to very isolated and saved a few million dollars doing it! \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaaO"
