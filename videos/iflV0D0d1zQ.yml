description: "Let’s live code in Flutter!\n\nTo kick off DartConf, let’s live code a Flutter app from start to finish We’ll look at designing a UI using hot-reload, pulling in data over a network and even accessing some native code for those tricky platform-specific APIs. Let’s see how far we can get building an app in half an hour!\n\nAbout Emily:\nEmily is a Senior Software Engineer on the Dart team. When not hacking on compilers and evangelizing the awesomeness of Flutter, she can be found working on improving fairness in Machine Learning or acting on the stage and screen. She is an avid member of the nerdy joke appreciation society.\n\nAbout Matt:\nMatt leads developer relations for Flutter from Google’s Mountain View campus. He recently joined the Flutter team, having spent three years working on Android and Wear. He’s a bit of a language geek, and is thoroughly enjoying adding Dart to the portfolio of languages to write cool thing in. When he’s not hacking on Flutter, you’ll probably find him in the gym wearing far too many fitness sensors.\n\nWatch the rest of the Dart Conference 2018 session videos here: https://goo.gl/4bwhE5\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L"
