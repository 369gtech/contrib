title: 'Analysis of FOSS Gaming Failure: A history of PokerSource and Open Source Online Poker'
recordingDate: 1579158081
description: "Bradley M. Kuhn\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/187/\n\nPokerSource, a now-defunct project, was AGPL'd/GPL'd end-to-end online poker system that was deployed for play-money games.  The server was written in Python and its most popular client, jPoker, was written in pure Javascript using jQuery, and was the very first deployed online poker system with a functioning pure Javascript client.  The project had a long hobbyist lifespan, dating back to the base C fast hand-evaluator library begun in the late 1980s.  During a brief period in the late 2000s, many developers were funded both full and part-time to work on the system, and the system was deployed and widely used on a major Facebook-competitor site.\r\nThe history of the PokerSource project is an interesting case study to analyze how proprietary software technologies, particularly for interactive online systems, readily and handily beat FOSS: even when FOSS was early to market and when the proprietariness of the software actually directly hindered trust in the userbase.\r\nThis talk will tell the history of this project, how a team of developers worked together to make a successful business out of of FOSS online poker.  The talk will unabashedly analyze both the successes and failures of our effort.  Attendees can learn what we did absolutely right in trying to build a FOSS business ecosystem for poker, and also the mistakes we also made along the way that assured FOSS demise in the world of online poker.  Attendees can learn from the successes and mistakes to assure your FOSS project isn't ultimately made obsolete by proprietary technology.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
