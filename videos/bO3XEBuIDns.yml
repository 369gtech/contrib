language: English
recordingDate: 1260156616
description: 'Layout Tests are the tests we inherit from the WebKit project and are a very important part of the Chromium''s testing infrastructure.  Pam Greene talks about what they are, how to run them, how to debug problems within them, and even touches on how to write your own.  She also covers advanced (but easy to use) tools for rebaselining and tracking flakyness.  Any Chromium developer that works on WebKit really should check this out!'
