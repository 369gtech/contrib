description: "Web application projects often have to deal with a mismatch between web design and software development. No matter whether these roles are taken by different teams, different people or simply different personalities of the same developer, there has always been conflict between the tools that bring data to the view layer and those in charge of representing such data in the most useful and visually appealing way.\n\nThymeleaf is a modern Java server-side template engine that aims at bringing together both worlds by allowing templates to be developed in a designer-friendly way, with maximum respect to HTML markup and minimum interference of template logic in design or prototyping artifacts.\n\nAs a plus, Thymeleaf's philosophy also allows the easy integration of client-side technologies like JavaScript libraries/frameworks so that developers can benefit from the best tools on the server and browser sides at the same time.\n\nThis talk will guide you through the capabilities of Thymeleaf and prepare you to start developing Thymeleaf templates, as well as show the new exciting features in Thymeleaf 3 that will make those already familiar with the project even more productive."
