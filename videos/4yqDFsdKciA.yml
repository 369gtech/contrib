description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nAt Twitter, weâ€™re working with millions of lines of Scala code, and that makes intelligent developer tools especially important. Multiple aspects of our development workflow, including code browsing, code review and code evolution, can be significantly improved if we go beyond just grep and ctags. In this talk, we will present our vision and hands-on experience with a next-generation code analysis toolkit based on the newly introduced scala.meta semantic API."
