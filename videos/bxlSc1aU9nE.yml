description: "Speaker: \r\n\r\nIn recent years, we've seen an explosion in the use of microservices in order to avoid the limitations of backend monoliths. However, many organisations continue to struggle with large, monolithic frontend codebases. In this talk, we'll explore how micro frontends can help make your code cleaner, your teams more autonomous, and enable incremental upgrades to your tech stack. By exploring real-world examples, you'll gain an understanding of when this architectural style can be helpful, and how to begin using it in your own projects.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/ThoughtWorks-Talks-Tech/events/249111916/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/kMi8/"
