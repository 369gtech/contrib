recordingDate: 1403721784
description: "This is the second video in a 3-part series. In this video, Barak Michener introduces you to graph processing using Cayley, an open source graph database written in Go.  Cayley is fast, free, and easy to get started with. Clone it from this repository: https://github.com/google/cayley or try the demo dataset in a live instance running on Google App Engine: http://cayley-graph.appspot.com/. \n\nThe the first video in this series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9pRpSW_KqA) covers creating and processing linked data using Schema.org and JSON-LD in the context of Schema.org Actions (http://goo.gl/vw8rOJ). The third video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB94dIamAQc) details activating the small Knowledge Graph with Schema.org Actions. \n\nAfter watching the videos you will have a solid foundation to embark upon the Google I/O 2014 Actions Codelab   (http://goo.gl/4ykgZ6).\n\nSpecial thanks to: https://www.youtube.com/user/dualcoremusic."
