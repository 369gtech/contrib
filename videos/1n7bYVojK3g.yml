description: 'Limundo/Kupindo websites daily have more than 300 000 visitors which generate 10 million page views per day. During peak hours around 10 000 users are online simultaneously. On the other side, speed, stability and scalability are three main requirements that need to be matched. Currently, Limundo is a self-configurable High Availability system that achieves page loads of under 1s and 99.999% uptime, while manipulating more than 15 TB of data on a monthly basis. This paper describes software and hardware architecture spread over several server clusters hosted in the private cloud, that makes this possible.'
