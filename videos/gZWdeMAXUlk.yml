description: "Javascript, the internet lingua franca. Many developers have embraced and love javascript, many hate it as a language. Why is inheritance handled in such a weird way? Why do I have to put 'strict' at the beginning of every script? What, there is no more ES6? What is this ES2017? What is Rhino and V8?\nI will try to answer these questions and guide you through a history of Javascript, since its inception to the latest language drafts. We won't talk about the \"good/ugly parts\", we will talk about the language evolution and how it compares with other languages. See this as computer language archeology."
