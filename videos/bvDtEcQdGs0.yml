description: "Transitioning a large organization to a new technology stack can be exciting, exhausting, and fraught with peril. Weâ€™ll look at how PayPal is using Node.js as both a technology and philosophy and what successes and pitfalls have been encountered along the way.\n\nErik Toth (@eriktoth) is the core maintainer of Kraken.js and currently manages the team that is the driving force behind Node.js at PayPal. He began his career as a software engineer at the enterprise level, working in both .NET and Java, but eventually gravitated toward front-end engineering. After several enlightening years as a front-end engineer (and some time working in Java exclusively) at Netflix he moved on to help drive Node.js as a first-class platform at PayPal, which he has been doing since 2012."
