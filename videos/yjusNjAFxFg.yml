description: "Experiments for SRE\n\nDebbie Ma, Google LLC\n\nIncident management for complex services can be overwhelming. SREs can use experiments to attribute and mitigate production changes that contribute to an outage. With experiments to guard production changes, SREs can also reduce a (potential) outage's impact by preventing further experiment ramp up if the production change is associated with unhealthy metrics. Beyond incident management, SREs can use experiments to ensure that reliable changes are introduced to production.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
