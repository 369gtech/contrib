description: "RabbitMQ (http://www.rabbitmq.com) is a popular 100% Erlang-based Open Source message queuing system that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It was been estimated that there are 50,000+ production deployments of RabbitMQ across the globe, and this number is continuing to grow.\n\nMost of these deployments are business-critical, underpinning everything from internet-based pizza ordering systems through to providing the central nervous system for large scale cloud-based application deployments.\n\nOne of the reasons for RabbitMQ's popularity is that it is easy to install and to start doing something useful with it; however despite this apparent ease of use, RabbitMQ is a complex software product that is highly flexible in terms of the use-cases that it can support and highly configurable, with a large number of tuneable parameters (many courtesy of Erlang).\n\nAccordingly, specialist skills and knowledge are often required in order to obtain best results in terms of scalability, reliability, security, application design, and performance.\n\nIn this short talk, Brett will provide a brief overview of RabbitMQ in terms of its history and general capabilities, and will discuss options available to RabbitMQ users (or prospective users) requiring assistance in terms of product support, training, and consulting services.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/brett-cameron/"
