description: "The world of old-school approaches to develop software look like are going away. We have no rights to ignore errors that might never happen; connections that might never will be broken or interrupted, processes that might never be killed; networks that might never be slow and this list could continue further…\n\nLet’s endue our software with capabilities to survive in the wild world of reality. In this talk I’m going to depict fault tolerance concepts and patterns, to provide guidance for implementing resilient software."
