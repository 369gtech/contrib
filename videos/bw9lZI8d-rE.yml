title: 'Turn Your XML into Binary: Make It Smaller and Faster'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433261172
description: "There are a lot of advantages to XML. Using XML schema is probably one of the best ways to define a model and messaging standard, but the messages we pass around and store are horribly verbose. For years now, we’ve been binding the XML to Java and working with tools such as JAXB, but they often inflate the in-memory size even further, not to mention the number of objects they create. Incept5 developed a Java XML binding tool with the same API but where the content is stored as a single byte array. So, just one object per message, a fraction of the memory footprint, and at least an order of magnitude more speed than traditional Java binding. Taking XML back to binary means getting big data in memory, and 100 GB of XML in your laptop’s RAM is entirely feasible. Learn more in this session.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJohn Davies\nJohn Davies is a veteran speaker on global-scale enterprise architectures and high performance computing.
