title: 'DEF CON 29 Adversary Village - Marc Smeets - Exploiting Blue Team OPSEC Failures with RedELK'
language: English
recordingDate: 1629143895
description: 'Blue teams and CERTs are increasingly better equipped and better trained. At the same time offensive infrastructures are increasingly diverse in components and growing in size. This makes it a lot harder for red teams to keep oversight but also a lot easier for blue teams to react on the traces that red teams leave behind. However, do blue teams really know what traces _they_ leave behind when doing their investigation and analyses? RedELK was created and open sourced to help red teams with these two goals: 1) make it easy to have operational oversight, 2) abuse blue team OPSEC failures. Come to this talk to learn about blue team detection and how RedELK can help you.'
