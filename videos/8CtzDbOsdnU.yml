description: "Code First: Girls’ 20:20 campaign aims to train 20,000 women to code for free by the end of 2020. The campaign builds on Code First: Girls’ achievements in teaching over 5,000 women to code in the last 3 years.\n\nCode First: Girls works to close the gender skills gap by helping women develop the coding and leadership skills they need to fill these roles and increase their representation in technology and entrepreneurship, for their benefit and also for the benefit of the entire U.K. digital economy."
