description: "Intro to Dominic Williams and Fabrice Nourisson's talk 'High Availability Erlang from the Trenches' at Erlang Factory Lite London on the 8th of November: http://bit.ly/T0cpRM\n\nErlang is a simple language specially designed for robust, high availability (HA) systems. In six years of working on telco systems, we have learned the hard way that there are a few pitfalls. We present the most common problems and the coding guidelines and design idioms we have adopted to deal with issues such as the atom table, memory and the garbage collector, message queues, flow control, configuration and hot code upgrades.\n\nTalk objectives: Warn developers of HA Erlang systems about common pitfalls and lessons learned, and provide coding guidelines and design idioms to avoid them.\n\nTarget audience: Developers and architects, aspiring Erlang experts, especially of high availability systems.\n\nMore about Extreme Forge here: http://extremeforge.com/\nMany thanks to Fabrice Nourisson for creating this video and giving us permission to use it.
