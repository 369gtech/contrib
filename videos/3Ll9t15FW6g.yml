title: 'Machine Learning simplified for Developers with ML.NET - Jernej Kavka'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620662509
description: "Do you want to try machine learning, but don't want to invest too much time learning a new programming language or some other complicated API? We will look at ML from a developer's perspective. We start by prototyping our solution with the help of ML.NET Model Builder, tweak it with elementary data science knowledge, and finally generate code that we can use in our applications. In the end, we will not only learn how to make our own machine learning but also how to apply simple data science to improve our model.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
