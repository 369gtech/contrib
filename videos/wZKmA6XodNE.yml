description: "Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.\nSpeaker: Simon Ritter, Azul\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/jdk8-lessons-learnt-with-lambdas-and-streams\n\nLambda expressions and the streams API add a more functional style of programming to Java; something developers have not really had in the past.\n\nThis session will start with a short summary of the key features of both Lambda expressions and streams before moving on to some real world examples of how to use them effectively, including a number of lessons learnt from trying to apply an imperative style of programming when it should have been functional.\n\nWe'll finish off with a quick look at some of the ideas for improvements to streams in JDK 9."
