title: 'Orchestrating Data Microservices with Spring Cloud Data Flow - Mark Pollack'
language: ""
recordingDate: 1513269137
description: "In this session you will learn how you can create data integration and real-time data processing pipelines using Spring Cloud Data Flow and deploy them to multiple platforms – Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and YARN to name a few. Spring Cloud Data Flow’s DSL and Designer User Interface will be demonstrated to show how you can easily assemble data pipelines without writing any code for common use-cases. When the need for custom code arises, you can create new application components using the programming model offered by Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Task.\n\nThe latest features of Spring Cloud Data Flow will be showcased, which include managing the entire lifecycle of data processing pipelines, allowing for a subset of the applications that compose a stream to be updated independently or rolled back to previous versions and also data provenance of data flowing through the pipelines.\n\nMark Pollack, Software Developer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2017"
