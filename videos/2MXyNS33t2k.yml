description: "Data structure intuition is something that develops naturally for most software developers. In all languages, we rely heavily on standard containers and collections. Need fast insertion/lookup? Hashmap. Need a sorted data structure that stores unique values? Set. Duplicate values? Multiset. And so on. \n\n\nHowever, most software developers don't develop algorithm intuition quite as easily. Algorithms aren't taught as widely as data structures are, and aren't relied on as heavily. This talk aims to introduce some STL algorithms, show how they are commonly used, and show how by developing intuition about them (+ a little help from lambdas), you can unlock their true potential.\n\n\nEVENT:\ncode::dive 2019\n\n\nSPEAKER:\nConor Hoekstra\n\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nConference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish code::dive talks."
