title: '"A New Type of Instruction for Power" - Jordan Niethe (LCA 2021 Online)'
recordingDate: 1612053935
description: "Jordan Niethe\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/44/\n\nIn the Linux kernel there are many times where we need to examine, manipulate and patch instructions, which is of course deeply tied to the instruction set of each architecture.\r\nLike any good RISC architecture, Power has had a fixed instruction size. That only gives you so much space to play with, and we were running out of room.\r\nPower10 presents a solution to that by introducing a new class of instructions which are twice as long.\r\nThis means our faithful \"unsigned int\" is no longer going to cut it as our instruction type and raises questions as how both types of instructions should be represented. Can we move to using \"unsigned long\"? Or a struct? How will this impact 32 bit and 64 bit systems? What about little and big endian ones? Do we have to change anything at all?\r\nWe will see how the mailing list's form of dialectic helps answer these questions.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
