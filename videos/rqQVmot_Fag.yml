recordingDate: 1493027252
description: "We've been hearing a lot about chatbots recently. Are they the next new hot thing in tech? Well, yes and no, there is a lot of hype for something available since late 90s, but they are much smarter and (sometimes) \"more human\" nowadays, thanks to more accessible AI algorithms in speech processing, NLP, computer vision, etc.\nIn this session we will touch on their history, look at the current technology stack, build a simple, but smart (sort of) bot using one of the bot frameworks. You will learn how to deploy it and make it available to use in different messaging applications (FB Messenger, Skype, Telegram, etc.). You will discover the challenges and opportunities observed by the industry right now. And perhaps you get some ideas how you can take it further and ... maybe develop that one bot, which will make you rich, or at least entertain your friends!"
