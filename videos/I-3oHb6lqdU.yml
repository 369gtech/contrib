description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nFine Grained Mesh Metrics for Better Visibility With Native Performance - Mandar Jog & Kuat Yessenov, Google  \n\nKnowing granular traffic patterns is crucial in understanding the functioning and health of a service mesh. The existing Envoy extensions collecting metrics are either not granular enough or can consume too many resources.    In this session, attendees will learn about an efficient way of producing granular metrics. This method introduces a new metadata exchange protocol between peer workloads and uses the new Envoy/WASM metrics API to produce richly dimensioned metrics based on the exchanged metadata.    The operator can add arbitrary peer dimensions like availability zones and locality to get additional insights into the traffic. Istio will use this technique to efficiently produce highly dimensioned Istio standard telemetry.    Attendees will see a demo of rich telemetry collection to Prometheus at near native performance. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaYV"
