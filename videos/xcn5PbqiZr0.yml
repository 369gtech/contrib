description: "Ricky Brundritt, PM in the Azure Maps team, walks Olivier through data driven styling with Azure Maps. Data driven styling allows you to dynamically style layers at render time on the GPU using properties on your data. This provides huge performance benefits and allows large datasets to be rendered on the map. Data driven style expressions can greatly reduce the amount of code you would normally need to write and define this type of business logic using if-statements and monitoring map events.\n\nAzure Maps documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/about-azure-maps \nCode samples: https://aka.ms/AzureMapsSamples \nAzure Maps Blog: https://aka.ms/AzureMapsBlog\n\nCreate a Free Account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aft-iot"
