description: "Learn Live: Foundations of Data Science for Machine Learning - Introduction to machine learning: September 21 – Episode 02\n\nJoin the chat and ask questions live at https://aka.ms/LearnLiveTV\n\nStarting Tuesday, September 14, 2021 (PST), join Jason DeBoever and Glenn Stephens live on Learn TV and explore this nine-part “Foundations of data science for machine learning” series. Each week, we will be walking through Learn modules and answering your questions live. From basic classical machine learning models to exploratory data analysis and customizing architectures, you’ll be guided by easy to digest conceptual content and interactive Jupyter notebooks and will learn about the underlying concepts as well as how to get into building models with the most common machine learning tools.\n\nSeptember 21 - Episode 2 :\nFollow along and complete the free, hands-on Microsoft Learn modules at https://aka.ms/LearnML-Introduction\n\nSupervised learning is a form of machine learning where an algorithm learns from examples of data. We progressively paint a picture of how supervised learning automatically generates a model that can make predictions about the real world. We also touch on how these models are tested, and difficulties that can arise when training them. In this episode, you will:\n\nDefine supervised and unsupervised learning.\nExplore how cost functions affect the learning process.\nDiscover how models are optimized by gradient descent.\nExperiment with learning rates, and see how they can affect training.\n\nMiss an episode? No problem, catch it on-demand: https://aka.ms/learnlive\n\n#AI #ML  #MachineLearning #Jupyter #LearnLive #Microsoft"
