description: "The Rust programming language purports the bold claim that it guarantees thread safety while retaining the ability to write zero-cost abstractions. In this talk we'll explore precisely how Rust can make such a claim. We'll also explore the ecosystem that makes up the concurrency toolkit in Rust to see how these language principles are extended to common abstractions such as channels, thread pools, work stealing algorithms, concurrent data structures, and asynchronous I/O.\n\nEVENT:\n\ncode::dive 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAlex Crichton\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\ncode::dive Conference Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\ncode::dive: http://codedive.pl/index/speaker/name/alex-crichton/year/2017/"
