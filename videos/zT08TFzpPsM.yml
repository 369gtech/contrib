language: English
recordingDate: 1402652633
description: 'Erlang is poised to be at the center of a massive disruption in computer networking -- the shift from hardware-defined to software-defined systems. Stu will explore the many benefits that software-defined networks (SDN) deliver in cost, scalability and control. The emergence of SDN also raises important questions about the future of proprietary vs. open-source networking software. Stu will discuss why the Erlang community is uniquely positioned to drive the debate.'
