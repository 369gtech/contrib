title: 'Where’s my free lunch? - Hadi Hariri'
recordingDate: 1494487391
description: "Have you ever thought about how many amazing things we get in this day and age for free? Think about it, whether it’s articles in daily newspapers, social media, your code repository, your continuous integration server as a service. And that’s not even mentioning all the amazing open source libraries, frameworks that are all out there.\nIt’s all free, and it’s awesomesauce! But (isn’t there always a but) in reality, someone is paying for all this. Sometimes it’s being paid for with cash, other times in the form of data and in many cases in the form of liabilities. Many of us choose to ignore this and gaze at the wonder of it all. One day however, we’ll wake up and ask where our free lunch has gone and surprised that things start crumbling down."
