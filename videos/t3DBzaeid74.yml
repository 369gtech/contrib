description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nFrom Assembler, over Fortran and C to modern Kotlin, we came a long way and improved the way we can express our thoughts in code.\n\nOne thing that happened during this journey is that languages allow us to use types for our problem domain, independent of the underlying computer architecture. Types became a powerful tool.\n\nTypes improve readability which probably is the most important aspect of programming! But types also prevent you from making mistakes at compile time. This is why Kotlin translated the null problem into the type system.\n\nWe can use these powers in our daily lives. We can write better code by avoiding “primitive obsession”. Il'l show you how!\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nDanny built mobile applications for companies like Viacom, Groupon, eBay and Alcatel.
