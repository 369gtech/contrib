description: "Presented at droidcon Italy 2020\n\nPRIVACY IN THE WRONG CENTURY\nMost likely you have already been told that if you were looking for privacy you were born in the wrong century. Is that true? And if so, how do our mobile devices, our Android phones, help us to keep the amount of privacy that we want?\nIn this panel, a group of Android developers will discuss some of the more relevant aspects about the intersection between Android App development, security, and privacy.\n\nPanelists: Jorge D. Ortiz Fuentes, Marcos Holgado, Sebastiano Poggi, Marco Porcaro, Sebastiano Gottardo, Jason Pearson\n\nhttps://it.droidcon.com/2020/​​​​\nhttps://twitter.com/Droidconit​​​​\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dro​​​​...\nhttps://www.instagram.com/droidconit/​​​​\nhttps://www.facebook.com/droidconIt"
