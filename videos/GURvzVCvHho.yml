recordingDate: 1487764657
description: 'As software engineers we''re fundamentally builders. Whether its for business or just as a hobby, we set out to solve problems through code. Sentry is another story of that simple idea, but one that has continued over the better part of a decade. We''ll talk about how Sentry was started as an unambitious side project and grew into the open source, venture-backed business it is today. Additionally we''ll cover what it''s taken to build a company as an extremely technical software engineer, including lessons learned along the way.'
