description: "As developers we all like to use tightly couple systems where possible and loosely coupled ones where necessary. In the closed world of the pre-Cloud era, traditional relational databases have gained  tremendous leverage from tight coupling of B-tree storage, transaction managers, and query optimizers, providing developers with an efficient, consistent, and easy to use ACID programming model. In the open, distributed, asynchronous, and heterogeneous world of the Cloud, we must consider more loosely coupled computational models that are designed with distribution and concurrency in from the get go, and accept that our knowledge of the world is never fully consistent. Actors as envisioned by Carl Hewitt fit the bill perfectly. In this talk we will show how highly-available stateful Actors provide a flexible and easy to use programming model for the Cloud on the outside, while still allowing for the traditional programming models on the inside.\n\nErik Meijer is an architect in the Microsoft SQL server division where he currently works together with the Microsoft Visual C# and the Microsoft Visual Basic language design teams on data integration in programming languages. Prior to joining Microsoft he was an associate professor at Utrecht University and adjunct professor at the Oregon Graduate Institute. Erik is one of the designers of the standard functional programming language Haskell98 and more recently the Cw language.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
