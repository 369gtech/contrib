title: 'Ditching Promises and Socially Acceptable Callback Hell - Brandon Satrom'
recordingDate: 1533564354
description: "Promises were supposed to free us from nested callback hell. But if we're being honest with ourselves, did promises really free us from anything? Aren’t promises just a socially-acceptable form of callbacks?\nPromises are a tantalizing step in the right direction. But they don't make it that much easier for us to reason about the flow of asynchronous code in our applications. But, the story of async JavaScript doesn't end with Promises, and there are some key new features of ES6 and ES7 that make it easier than ever to write async code that looks and feels more synchronous. After reviewing the history of callbacks, promise libraries and the benefits of native promises, we'll look at how you can build your own synchronous async code with ES6 Generators. Finally, we'll dig into ES7's upcoming Async/Await features. By the end of this talk, you'll be forever free from the shackles of callback hell."
