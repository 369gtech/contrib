title: 'GopherCon 2021: Akhil Indurti - Writing a Static Analyzer for Go Code'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639791501
description: 'You’ve turned on all the analyzers and written all the tests, but preventable errors keep popping up in production. There’s too much code being merged to catch every mistake during code review. If only there was a tool to catch this kind of bug. This talk will teach you how to write it yourself.'
