description: "Alerting Patterns against Toil\n\nŠtěpán Davidovič, Google Inc.\n\nNobody likes to get paged, and especially not needlessly. But nobody likes to write an incident retrospective due to missing alerts. As we focus more on alerting on user–perceived behavior (that is, SLO alerting), can we take it too far? We'll take a look at patterns and problems in managing our alerting.\n\nŠtěpán Davidovič is an SRE at Google. He currently works on internal infrastructure for automatic monitoring and alerting. In previous Google roles, he developed Canary Analysis Service, maintained an internal Cron system and was oncall for AdSense. He obtained his bachelor's degree from Czech Technical University in Prague."
