description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nChad Fowler - CTO at 6Wunderkinder\n\nABSTRACT\n We work in a time and culture of incredibly hard work. When someone asks how you're doing, how often do you use the word \"busy\" in the answer?\n\nBut, what are we busy doing?\n\nAs a professiional musician, I learned that the most successful musicians are rarely the best musicians. This holds true in the technology business world.\n\nIt's also true that the busiest, hardest working among us aren't necessarily the most accomplished.\n\nSo, what is accomplishment, and how do we get it?\n\nLet's explore this topic with examples from my career as a professional musician, conference organizer, programmer, open source contributor, author of multiple books, public speaker, and high level technology manager. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
