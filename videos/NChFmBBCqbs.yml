description: "Starting with JDK 8u20, Java Flight Recorder (JFR) and Java Mission Control (JMC) can help you look under the hood of the JavaFX runtime to better understand the behavior of your application. This session takes you on a tour of all the steps from launching your app to visualizing collected data in the JavaFX plug-in of JMC. It provides a brief overview of the JavaFX architecture required to correctly interpret and analyze presented data. JavaFX developers will learn how interaction with JFR is implemented in the JavaFX runtime and how it can be extended to collect and visualize information they need.\n\n\nAuthors:\nMarcus Hirt\nMarcus is one of the founders of Appeal Virtual Machines, the company that created the JRockit JVM.
