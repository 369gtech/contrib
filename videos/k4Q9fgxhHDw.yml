You can just call an API and you get the answer! You can treat them completely as black boxes and use them directly in your applications! But beware - all the algorithms have some cases when they fail to deliver what you're expecting. \n\nThis talk is packed with live demos that show failure cases of popular algorithms, from linear regression to cutting-edge deep learning. Evelina will look at practical examples, use standard algorithms as black boxes and observe when they fail and why. You will learn that although you can treat the algorithms as black boxes, they can fail silently and what to do about it.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/evelina-gabasova/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - EVELINA GABASOVA\n\nEvelina is a machine learning and data science researcher. She works as Principal Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. She is a member of the research engineering team where she is connecting academic research with real-world applications. She did her PhD at Cambridge in mathematics and has been applying machine learning methods to everything from cancer bioinformatics to air traffic control. Her passion is to make data science understandable and accessible to everyone. When not wrangling data or training machine learning models, she is an active member of the F# community, Microsoft MVP and a technical speaker. \n\nMore on Evelina Gabasova: https://codesync.global/speaker/evelina-gabasova/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
