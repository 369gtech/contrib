This session will explore how we can use Drupal together with that rapidly growing Jupiter Notebook platform and extensions and services developed in languages such as Python and R for practical and accessible data science in government and beyond.\n\nKey takeaways\n\n1. There are continuous improvements in our and Drupal’s ability to collect, process, analyze, and communicate complex data that we can use.\_\n\n2. We can extend our existing content management systems and web applications to use this enriched data through the Open Data initiative and languages such as Python and R.\_\n\n3. Jupyter, along the thew Python and R languages, are relatively easy to learn and extend to benefit optimally from this enriched data."
