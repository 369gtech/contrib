description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014 in Dallas, TX.\nSpeaker: Damien Dallimore, Splunk\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/gaining-application-lifecycle-intelligence\nToday we are facing an ever-increasing speed of product delivery. DevOps practices\nlike continuous integration and deployment increase the dependence of systems \nlike task tracking and source code repositories with build servers and test suites. \nWith data moving rapidly through these different tools, it becomes challenging to \nmaintain a grasp of the process, especially as the data is distributed and in a variety of formats. But it is still critical to maintain full visibility of the product development journey – from user stories to production data. By starting at the beginning of the \nProduct Development Lifecycle, you can track a problem in production all the way back to the code that was checked into the build and the developer responsible for the code. \nIn this session I'll demonstrate some of the ways in which Splunk software can be used to collect and correlate data throughout the various stages of the lifecycle of your code, to ultimately make you more efficient and make your code better."
