description: "PyData London Meetup #47\nTuesday, August 14, 2018\n\nConventional recommendation services like Netflix, News Feeds, Spotify and in commerce trap you in a filter bubble. A watched movie continues to be suggested; new items do not appear immediately; you cannot interact with the results to improve personal relevance; data security and privacy is abused. The AI has all the control leaving you open to behavioural manipulation.\n\nThingy pops the bubble to give people control of their AI.\n\nThe work, in collaboration with Professor Zoubin Ghahramani (http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) at Cambridge University, is show-cased in 3 articles with must-see results using images:\nhttps://medium.com/@DineshVadhia/realtime-ai-is-no-longer-a-myth-9d43dc55342f https://medium.com/@DineshVadhia/interactive-ai-with-tom-cruise-977e1b128def\nhttps://medium.com/@DineshVadhia/the-end-of-dumb-ai-c4c021b9a132\n\nThe talk will walk through why Thingy solves the problems of conventional recommendation engines and show example results.\n\nSponsored & Hosted by Man AHL\n\n****\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
