recordingDate: 1556783938
description: "How would you feel if your boss asks: Can you download the whole Instagram?\nIn this talk, we will tell you the story of an adventurous journey.\nFrom using test automation tools to fool a protective signup system, to the hidden features that make Postgres a tool capable of digesting millions of read/write requests.\nFrom a single machine to a network of over 100 EC2 nodes that worked together and were able to kill each other.\n\nAli and I started as senior/junior, mentor/mentee and we ended up as highly motivated colleagues, that are just thrilled to be working in a moment where big-data and data mining are affordable and doable. In Javascript.\n\nAli Alfredji is a full-stack developer and co-founder at Mysocial. His bread and butter are high performings React mobile UI that are distributed as web, iOS and Android apps with Cordova. He is also curious how indexes can affect the disk I/O charts on a database machine.\n\nMarco Pegoraro is a full-stack developer and co-founder at Mysocial. His bread and butter are making things that just work. Lately, he fell in love with DevOps and he is constantly pushing new open source projects to NPM or Docker. Marco loves to coach new developers so that they can love coding as much as he does.\n_____________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
