Or on the other side, do you think others are often too confrontational? These are Ask vs Guess Culture differences. Ask folks believe it’s ok to ask anything, because it’s ok to say no, while Guess folks prioritise not imposing on others. It’s a culture clash that isn’t often recognised, yet causes quite a bit of tension and frustration.

Gaining an understanding of these differences and learning specific tactics for a professional context will make you a drastically more effective communicator.\n\nAbout Katherine Wu\n\nKWu is a Ruby developer at Heroku.
