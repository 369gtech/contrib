description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nLooking outside-in from a user perspective at the ongoing saga of making objects appear in C++ from out-of-process (file mappings, message queues, device drivers, etc).\n\n---\nStaffan has been busting latency issues since the mid-80's. These days he's a C++ subject expert at Susquehanna International Group, where he spends his days working in an MSVC environment using Powershell and emacs.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
