description: "http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/data-science-driven-malware-detection\n\nMalware detection within enterprise networks is a critical component of an effective information security strategy. Instances of malware attacks are increasing – making them especially important to detect – and data science can help. In this webinar, one of Pivotal's principal data scientists discusses data science driven approaches to finding domains that have time and user-based co-occurrence relationships. The session also includes a demonstration of a scalable and operationalizable framework to detect domain associations by analyzing the web traffic of users in any organization.\n\nAdditional information: \nhttp://www.datasciencecentral.com/video/dsc-webinar-series-data-science-driven-approaches-to-malware\n\nSpeaker: Bill Vorhies, Data Science Central; Anirudh Kondaveeti, Pivotal"
