description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nServerless Container With Extreme Low Overhead and High Performance - Feng Shaobao, Huawei \n\nServerless compute engines，like Fargate on AWS，ACI on Azure，CloudRun on Google and CCI on HuaweiCloud， emerges on public cloud platforms since 2018，with these services， users can easily launch their computing task on clouds， without provisioning and managing their servers.Although the billing can be computed by the second, which can reduce many costs for users, there is still no end for cloud providers when refering to reducing costs while perserving a high performance.     In this session, we will share how we reduce our management costs through offloading, management slimming, and schedule optimizing. we provides container service with extremly low overhead.
