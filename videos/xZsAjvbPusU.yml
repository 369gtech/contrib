description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io\_The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nDeep Dive: Volcano - Da Ma & Zhonghu Xu, Huawei \n\nVolcano is a batch system built on Kubernetes. It provides a suite of mechanisms that are commonly required by many classes of batch & elastic workload including: machine learning/deep learning, bioinformatics/genomics and other \"big data\" applications. These types of applications typically run on generalized domain frameworks like TensorFlow, Spark, PyTorch, MPI, etc, which Volcano integrates with. This deep dive session will will give an introduction on project Volcano, including the features that required by many batch/elastic workload, e.g. big data, AI, and HPC. And demonstrate the benefit of using Volcano in those scenarios. At the end of the session, the roadmap and future plan will be introduced and the target scenarios. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpAw"
