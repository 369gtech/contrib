description: "There’s a lot to be said about pressing pause, resetting and unfolding that roadmap often to see if you’re still going in the right direction.\n\nBeing a brilliant dev is great, but being a brilliant dev who understands balance, how to manage time, how to focus and be aware of when they’re most productive and effective… well, this person becomes a super dev.\n\nOMG JSConf EU is coming back in 2019 https://2019.jsconf.eu/"
