description: "Members of the Erlang and Elixir communities often receive the question: \"why should I use this language?\" The answer to this nuanced question remains elusive, because the answer is not primarily technical.\n\nThis talk provides a history of functional programming, of Erlang and Elixir more specifically. It begins with Lambda Calculus, and charts a path to the present moment. This talk argues that the future success of Erlang and Elixir will be marked by how we learn from the history of functional programming. More importantly, this talk presents a strategy for increasing language adoption, which centers around community-building, based on real-world experiences and historical analysis.\n\nOsa's profile can be viewed here: http://codesync.global/speaker/osa-gaius/\n\nJoin us for our next functional and non-mainstream conference, Code Mesh LDN 2018 https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-2018/"
