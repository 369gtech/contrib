description: "K8s Conformance Working Session: Supporting Multiple Environments - Dan Kohn, CNCF \n\nThe K8s Conformance program and test suite will play an integral role in ensuring that customers have a consistent experience when porting their workloads between K8s providers. However, not all environments in which K8s will be hosted will be identical - either due to hardware differences, or the use of optional features. The question before the K8s Conformance WG is how to deal with these variants with respect to the Conformance Certification program. Several options have been put forward. This session will focus on trying to develop a generic solution, while using Windows as our first concrete use-case to address. This session is not introductory and will be more of a brainstorming session for interested parties. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/J06P"
