description: 'Throughout this year, we had the chance to analyze two different models of electric scooters, three different models of smart locks, various kind of smart home devices and lastly one robot assistant which is in use at airports. During the analysis process, we have found some critical security vulnerabilities including privilege escalation, insecure communication and taking over the servers which these communications are being performed on. Additionally, we have identified two hard-coded secret keys and lastly one cryptographic key in the result of our analysis. In this presentation, we will be sharing the details of the vulnerabilities that we have identified during our analysis.'
