description: "Loops are bullshit. Loops are bullshit. Hey, and we have tail-call elimination es6, which means recursion is on the menu. I'll provide as many alternatives to those dreadful loops as I can. Impress your loved ones with catamorphisms, anamorphisms, bifunctors, fix points, f-algebras, co-recursion, and more. Plus, if I'm not too lazy, i'll show how it all applies to Streams - no promises though (so many puns!)\n\nBrian Lonsdorf is a faux academic seeking attention."
