description: "The Human Face of Big Data\n\nhttp://strataconf.com/stratany2012/public/schedule/detail/26979\n\nOver the past two decades, Rick Smolan, creator of the best selling \"Day in the Life\" books, has produced a series of ambitious global projects in collaboration with hundreds of the world's leading photographers, writers, and graphic designers. This year Smolan invited more than 100 journalists around the globe to explore the world of Big Data. The Human Face of Big Data captures, in fascinating photographs and moving essays, an extraordinary revolution sweeping, almost invisibly, through business, academia, government, healthcare, and everyday life. Big Data is already enabling us to provide a healthier life for our children, to provide our seniors with independence while keeping them safe, to help us conserve precious resources like water and energy, to peer into our own individual genetic makeup, to create new forms of life, and soon, many predict, to reengineer our own species... and we've barely scratched the surface."
