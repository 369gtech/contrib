description: "Pitfalls of Kubernetes Adoption\n\nKing'ori Maina, Zappi\n\nKubernetes is an amazing piece of technology certainly not without it’s odd quirks. The team at Zappi got into Kubernetes about 4 years ago and we’ve hit some snags and surprises along the way. This talk lists some of the tissues that stood out along the way that hopefully will give a heads up to anyone looking to get started or even those who’ve been using it for a while.\n\nKing'ori (or \"King\") is a software developer turned Infrastructure/Operations (DevOps) Engineer passionate about unlocking developer productivity by automating their problems away or providing/building the tools for them to work faster, smarter, and more efficiently. He is currently a part of the devops team at Zappi and a huge fan of Kubernetes, Golang, Ruby, open source, and automation."
