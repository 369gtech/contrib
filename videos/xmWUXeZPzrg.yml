title: 'Beating the large scale web app monster - Gonen Jerbi'
recordingDate: 1532328300
description: "We all know that in order to build a good application - it has to be modular. But what does modularity mean when it comes to large web applications? Is it extracting reused code into a separate module? Extracting it to an npm package? Maybe we can do better?\nFurthermore, a large-scale web application will probably be developed by multiple teams, raising even more challenges and problems.\n\nIn this talk, Gonen defines the large scale web application problem, the challenges him and his team faced (and still are) and the ways to overcome them."
