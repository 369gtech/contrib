description: "New Java releases are coming faster than ever now that we are well into the new six-month release cadence. The number of new features and APIs in each version is less than we’re used to, but the overall rate of change is actually faster than before. \n\nIn this session, we’ll take a tour of the new features that will help developers, as well as things that improve Java deployments. We’ll also discuss issues that will affect migration of applications from earlier versions and choices for which version to choose for deployment. \n\nOracle has changed the license for their JDK and the way updates are are made available is also different from what we’re used to. We’ll finish with a quick discussion of the best approaches to take to adapt to this and the choices available. \n\nSpeaker: Gil Tene, CTO, Azul Systems\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/keeping-up-with-java-look-at-all-these-new-features"
