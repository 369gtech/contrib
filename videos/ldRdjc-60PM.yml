And why should you care?\n\nThere are important differences between the map operator and higher-order mapping operators such as concatMap, mergeMap, and switchMap. For example, higher-order mapping operators automatically subscribe to their inner Observables.\n\nThis session examines several higher-order mapping operators using real-world scenarios. If you’ve ever wondered why you use a switchMap instead of a map, what the heck an “inner Observable” is, or what a higher-order mapping operator does, this session is for you.\nWatch all the ng-conf: Hardwired presentations/videos at https://videos.ng-conf.org\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nng-conf: Hardwired is brought to you by:\n- https://thinkster.io/ The best Angular and JavaScript tutorials on the web\n- https://herodevs.com/ Engineering and consulting by web development experts\n- https://xlts.dev/  Extended support for AngularJS\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
