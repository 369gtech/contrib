description: "Building a NLU application like a chatbot seems easy nowadays, but getting it right architecturally is harder than expected. Let's dive into the problems I've encountered and an elegant-yet-simple solution to make it really work. We'll look at understanding conversation not as a pipeline, but as an orchestra of many components playing together towards a shared goal.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
