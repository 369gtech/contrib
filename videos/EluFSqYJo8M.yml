description: "Simpler Releases, Faster Upgrades: BOSH Package Vendoring and Colocated Errands - Maria Ntalla & Maya Rosecrance, Pivotal\n\nUntil now, authors of BOSH releases have had to package any dependencies their software needed in their release. While this offers great flexibility, it means that for more complex deployments, there is unnecessary duplication of third-party dependencies. This also makes it difficult to patch external dependencies as they are kept in so many places.\n\nOne-off tasks are typically packaged as BOSH errand jobs. Until now, running BOSH errands would require spinning up a VM at the IaaS level. Thatâ€™s costly and can take up to several minutes, depending on the IaaS.\n\nBOSH recently introduced two very powerful features: package vendoring and errand colocation. Attendees will learn how to use them to simplify release package management, make deployments smaller in footprint, speed up operating and upgrading BOSH deployments.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/GATl/simpler-releases-faster-upgrades-bosh-package-vendoring-and-colocated-errands-maria-ntalla-maya-rosecrance-pivotal"
