title: 'NoSQLâ€™s biggest secret  SQL never went away - Laurent Doguin'
recordingDate: 1464358763
description: 'NoSQL databases threw out SQL for querying, while their authors focused on solving problems of scale, speed, and availability. The need for rich query never went away. Neither did SQL. Today, non-relational databases are bringing back SQL-like languages to help them integrate with existing data query and to fit in with the weight of database practice of the past 40 years. In this talk I''ll cover the journey from key-value, through novel ideas such as Jsoniq, to academic papers proposing a SQL++ language, and projects including Cassandra and Couchbase providing their own SQL-like languages.'
