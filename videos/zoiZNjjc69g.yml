description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nWhat’s in a Name? A WG Naming Deep Dive - Celeste Horgan, Cloud Native Computing Foundation \n\nWG Naming was formed in June 2020 as a direct response to the Black Lives Matter protests occurring across America. Its goal is to remove harmful and unclear language in the Kubernetes project as completely as possible, and to do so in a way that is portable to other CNCF projects.   This session will be a deep dive into the work that WG Naming is doing for the Kubernetes and broader CNCF communities on the topic of language, looking at how we evaluate language and phrases in the project and beyond, and why that matters.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/eukp"
