description: "Extending agile beyond software development comes with controversy - how to scale it, lead it, adopt new language, certifications, models and org design. What was wrong with simply going back to agile's origins in the generic lean and systems thinking theory of the previous 30 years? That thinking had mostly been lost, quietly murdered in the snowy Utah mountains in February 2001. Whodunnit? What can we dig up from that icy grave to develop a new way of working in the internet age?\nNigel Dalton, the reputed 'godfather of Australian agile', presents a personal view of the path forward in non-software team's adoption of agility in the 21st century.\n\nAfter 5 years as Chief Information Officer of the REA Group, Nigel has transformed into the Chief Inventor – having handed the technology reins to a proper Chief Engineer, Tom Varsavsky. His scope is global, looking 2-5 years ahead to technologies that impact the currencies of online real estate – time, trust, and transparency. Those technologies are predicted to be Virtual Reality, Augemented Reality, and Robotics (with the accompanying digital brainpower provided by machine learning and data science). Nigel runs a small team in REALABS in Melbourne focused on those 3 T’s. Nigel is an active member of the agile community globally, and from that earned the unlikely title of ‘Godfather of Agile’ 10 years ago.\n\nFor more on YOW!
