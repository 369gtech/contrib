description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nSTL algorithms are something every C++ programmer should know. With ranges being voted in C++ 20, there are even more useful tools that we should at least be aware of, if not use daily.\n\nUsing ranges helps writing a code which is great in expressiveness and safety and does not fall behind in performance. In this talk we will cover what ranges add to the C++20 standard library, as well as go over all the different views and actions available in range-v3 library which can be used today.\n\nThis talk is inspired by Jonathan Boccara’s talk \"105 algorithms in less than an hour\".\n— \nDvir Yitzchaki\nVerizon Media\nSr. Software Engineer\nIsrael\n\nDvir is a senior software engineer at Verizon Media. He has been doing C++ for 12 years, lately only for a hobby. He has contributed to a number of open source projects including Hunter package manager and Catch2 unit testing framework. He has spoken for Core C++ meetup and conference.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
