description: "Events are all around. With Redis Streams, we can capture those and store them in Redis. Redis Streams represent a journal-like data structure that allows sequential processing of messages.\n\nLetâ€™s have a look at how to integrate Redis streams into applications, and how to consume and produce messages to build a message-oriented Java application with Redis the Spring way.\n\nSpeaker: Mark Paluch, Spring Data Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/eventdriven-java-applications-with-redis-50-streams"
