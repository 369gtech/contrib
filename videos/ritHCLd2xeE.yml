Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nThe Release Team Shadow Program - Mentoring For the Future - Guinevere Saenger, GitHub & Lachlan Evenson, Microsoft \n\nEach Kubernetes release is guided by a team of specialist community members to shepherd the process and to culminate in a new release of the worldâ€™s most popular container orchestration tool. After Release Day, the team members update some docs, and then disband to re-focus their efforts elsewhere in the project, giving room to others to fill their former roles. But have you ever wondered how the Kubernetes Release Team gets formed in the first place? Come to this talk to find out how YOU could be part of a future Kubernetes Release Team! This talk will discuss the purpose and implementation of the Kubernetes Release Team Shadow Program, give examples of success and areas of growth, and may help you decide if this is an area where you would like to start your journey as a Kubernetes contributor. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uahk"
