description: "Diversity is a very hot topic, and even more so in tech. It also happens to be a big selling point and a marketing tool for individuals and companies alike. People and companies use diversity for many different purposes. Some because they genuinely care, some to fill in a quota, others to appease the gods. However, independent of your intentions, you could actually be doing a lot of harm without knowing it. How do you create a working environment that is truly safe for the under-represented and historically oppressed people, without inadvertently doing the opposite of what you set out for?\n\nAbout: \nChinenye Onuegbu, Software Engineer - Yilu\n\nI am passionate about everything tech, especially interested in JavaScript and I love tinkering with transistors."
