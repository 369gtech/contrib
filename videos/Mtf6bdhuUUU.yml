recordingDate: 1532649603
description: "Enterprises hold data that has potential value outside their own firewalls. We have been trying to figure out how to share such data at a level of detail with others in a secure, safe, legal and risk mitigated manner that ensure high level of privacy while adding tangible economic and social value. Enterprises are facing numerous roadblocks, failed projects, inadequate business cases, and issues of scale that needs newer techniques, technology and approach.\nIn this talk, we will be setup the groundwork for scalable data augmentation for organisations and visualising technical architectures and solutions around emerging technologies of data fabrics, edge computing and a second coming of data virtualisation.\nA self-assessment toolkit will be shared for people interested to apply it to their organisations.\n\nTL;DR:\n    I was like her according to Pearson-R;\n    We were both outliers\n \nI believe i am better at data science than some data engineers while I am better at engineering than some data scientists. \n \nFull Version:\nI am a data geek in a suit and occasionally don a hat. I work for a Melbourne based Big Data startup called Zetaris where I help draft solutions for customers and prospects around customer experience, life sciences research, data monetisation, big data analytics and everything in between, occasionally fixing vlookups in excel. My favourite pastime is nagging our development teams for feature requests and user stories with success. \n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
