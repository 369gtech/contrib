title: 'DEF CON Safe Mode Crypto and Privacy Village -Kelley Robinson- What if we had TLS for phone numbers?'
language: English
recordingDate: 1597879048
description: 'If you''ve noticed a surge in unwanted robocalls from your own area code in the last few years, you''re not alone. The way telephony systems are set up today, anyone can spoof a call or a text from any number. With an estimated 85 billion spam calls globally, it''s time to address the problem. This talk will discuss the latest advancements with STIR (Secure Telephone Identity Revisited) and SHAKEN (Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs), new tech standards that use well accepted public key cryptography methods to validate caller identification. We''ll discuss the path and challenges to getting this implemented industry wide, where this tech will fall short, and what we can do to limit exposure to call spam and fraud in the meantime.'
