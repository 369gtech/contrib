title: 'JVMs in Containers - Best Practices by David Delabassee'
recordingDate: 1581886620
description: "JVMs and containers are like raggmunk and lingonberries â€“ better together!\n\nThe JVM is a robust and mature platform that hosts Java and a myriad of other languages. Container technologies are now the de-facto way to deploy applications. In addition, emerging platforms, projects and tools (ex. Knative, JIB, Fn Project, etc.) either simplify or fully abstract away building container images, which in turn makes leveraging containers with Java natural.\n\nThis session will present techniques, tools and best practices to improve the cohabitation of JVM applications running in containers. Attend it to understand how you can better leverage one of today's most used programming platform, the JVM, with the most common tool to deploy apps, i.e. container.\n\nDavid Delabassee\nOracle\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 4th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
