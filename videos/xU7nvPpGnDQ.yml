title: 'Spring One Tour Oct -  Spring Boot Omakase: A fast-paced "chef’s choice" dive into Spring topics!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1603740594
description: "Spring Boot has revolutionized the Java space and continues to do so, evolving constantly to increase developers’ superpowers and advance the state of production-grade software development.\n\nPresenting a dynamic technology before vastly different audiences often limits what can be proposed & presented. Let’s fix that!\n\nThis session is an omakase, a \"chef’s choice\" of key points and latest/coolest capabilities for developers in the Spring Boot ecosystem. Known by French chefs as m’étonner (\"Astonish me!\"), the goal is to combine useful patterns and new possibilities in one fast-paced live-coding adventure from which everyone leaves with something tasty to chew on. Come for the apps, stay for dessert, leave satisfied & excited for the next \"course\" of production software!"
