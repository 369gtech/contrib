title: 'One kata, three languages -  Mark Seemann'
recordingDate: 1472473372
description: 'First, we''ll do a brief overview of the FizzBuzz kata, and see one ''idiomatic'' way to implement it in C# (the Java, Javascript, Visual Basic, etc. version would be similar, so all OO programmers are welcome). Next, most of the talk will be a live demo showing approaches to the kata in Haskell and Clojure. If you''ve never seen Haskell or Clojure before, but are curious about these languages, this is the talk for you! Finally, we take some of the ideas from the Haskell and Clojure implementations, and bring them back to C# for a second attempt at the kata.'
