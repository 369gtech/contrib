title: 'Database as API with PostgreSQL and Massive.js - Diane Fay'
recordingDate: 1532425068
description: "Node.js has been around for a while, and it's not showing any signs of slowing down yet. More and more developers are using JavaScript on the server, and PostgreSQL is a popular choice for applications with relational data needs.\nBut what does data access look like in a dynamic language running on a single-threaded platform? Do purely object-oriented architectures and techniques still make sense in a language with an expressive functional toolkit and few compunctions about type safety? How does closer integration with the database change application development? This talk looks at the theoretical and practical sides of Massive.js, a Postgres-exclusive data mapper for Node, and at how Node applications can get the most out of their data by moving past the conventional wisdom of object-oriented and object-relational approaches to leverage Postgres to the fullest possible extent."
