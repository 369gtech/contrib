description: "Seems like we’ve been waiting for Java 9 for eternity. We’ve been hearing all about Jigsaw since Java 7, so we’ll be forgiven for thinking that’s the most interesting thing about the next Java release. What we should be wondering is, will Java 9 it change the way we develop, like Java 8 did? Will my tools break when I try to use it? Is it worth playing with it before it comes out, or should I just wait until everything stabilises?\n\nIn this talk, Trisha will take a look at some of the features in Java 9, including modularity, the REPL, and the nice new Collections features. Trisha will demonstrate, via live coding, these features in IntelliJ IDEA, and talk a bit about the current and future support for Java 9 in IntelliJ IDEA.\n\nTrisha Gee has developed Java applications for a range of industries, including finance, manufacturing, software and non-profit, for companies of all sizes. She has expertise in Java high performance systems, is passionate about enabling developer productivity, and dabbles with Open Source development. Trisha is a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group, a MongoDB Master and a Java Champion. She believes we shouldn't all have to make the same mistakes again and again. She’s a Developer Advocate for JetBrains so she can share all the cool stuff she's discovered so far.\n\n[JNW-6691]"
