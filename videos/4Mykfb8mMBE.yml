description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune 13, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSome topics that we've heard about from other points of views are fruitfully re-examined through some explorations using Matlab. First, we have a bit of code that reads ICC profiles and shows us what's in them, including some plots so that we can see what sorts of data are used to represent colorspace transformations. Second, we look at ray tracing for a non-Gaussian, non-paraxial, real-world situation, in which tracing rays numerically leads to an understanding of an aberration that we always need to deal with in digital cameras: the effect of a flat filter in the optical path. Third, brute-force numerical simulation of light's propagation as waves leads..."
