The place that you donâ€™t have spend too much time maintaining it, yet it brings a lot of value and is up to date.\n\nFor some the starting point was from agile manifesto or software craftsmanship misunderstanding, which is not-documenting at all. Others decided to build a comprehensive documentation, soon to discover it is a challenge to keep it up with the reality (which is the code).\n\nThere is a better way to build a good Developer Experience. I will share several options, that you may take advantage of, including:\n- partially executable documentation without (non-docstring)\n- human- and machine-readable HTTP API documentation\n- automated tests as documentation\n#SoftwareDocumentation #DeveloperExperience\n\nPresented by Wojtek Erbetowski\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevoxxPL\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/grzegorz.duda.official/\n\nJoin us also here:\nTechnology Radar Review: https://dworld.pl/radar\nDevelopers World Academy: https://dworld.pl/akademia\nDevflix: https://devflix.pl\n\n#Devoxx #DevoxxPoland #IT #Development #SoftwareDevelopment"
