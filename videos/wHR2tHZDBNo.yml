title: 'Webinar: Develop your Cloud Native use cases at the Edge with K3s'
language: English
recordingDate: 1591809848
description: "Containers and Microservices are transforming the way Edge and IoT platforms have been operated and managed in the past. Arm is at the forefront of this transformation with initiatives such as Project Cassini which ensures a secure cloud-native experience & enables use cases on what is a very diverse hardware ecosystem at the edge. In this webinar, we will cover the following demos:\n\nCI/CD at the Edge – As developing cloud native applications at the Edge gathers steam, the obvious need for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) arises. In this demo, we will showcase K3s and Gitlab working together to provide a platform to manage the application development and maintenance on Arm based devices at the Edge. This provides risk mitigation at the edge by supporting small, incremental changes to an application & problems can be rapidly detected and mitigated\n\nSmart City Use Case – The edge to cloud architecture paired with IoT solutions is enabling the popular smart cities use case. We will demo image detection on Arm platforms at the edge running a K3s cluster & a cloud based backend that manages the devices and aggregates the data streams.\n\nPresenters:\n\nPranay Bakre, Staff Technical Marketing Engineer @Arm\nJulio Suarez, Staff Engineer @Arm"
