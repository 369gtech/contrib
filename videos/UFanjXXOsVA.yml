description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nIn-place Upgrade Noway! Blue/Green Your Way to a New Kubernetes Version - Ricardo Aravena, Rakuten \n\nSince its introduction, Kubernetes has had a relentless pace of innovation and a significant release every three months. For an organization, it may be challenging to keep pace with new features and their Kubernetes clusters up to date. Furthermore, the constant change of the Kubernetes API + CRDs may be a barrier to minimizing downtime.  This session will showcase using different tools with automation to update the major version of your cluster using a blue/green approach. Can we take advantage of a GitOps approach using open-source tools like Flux and Keiko? How do we change manifests to support the new API? How can we verify and add more security to the upgrades?  The audience will come away with a pragmatic understanding of how to make use of different open-source tools and processes to make Kubernetes upgrades seamless with minimal to no downtime in production.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zek9"
