description: "Jeffrey Snover, Microsoft\n\nAbstract: \nIn an increasingly software-driven world, our role is more critical than ever. We are literally forging the fabric of the future and we need to stop and ask ourselves what kind of world do we want to live in? Our code impacts real people in real ways. Ethical concerns, social responsibility, and inclusive design are important to the work we do, and addressing them well takes time and resources.
