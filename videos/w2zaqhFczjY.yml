description: "Have you ever had to dig for sun.misc.Unsafe to get access to CompareAndSwap? Are you interested in eking out the last bit of parallelism from your code? VarHandles in Java 9 enable memory ordering and atomic operations on any field type. With more granularity in the memory ordering modes, Java programmers can improve the potential parallelism of their applications, while also getting the benefits of a Safe API.\n\nLearn the best practices for using VarHandles in your code, and how the JVM relies on these best practices to give you the best performance.\n\n# Tobi Ajila\nTobi is a Java Runtime developer for the J9 VM team in Ottawa, Canada. In the past he has worked on Interpreter optimizations, JVMTI enhancments, JSR 335 and more. Currently, his main focus is on Project Jigsaw and Project Panama where he collaborates with other developers in the Panama expert group.\n\nTobi has an interest in optimizing the Java Runtime for cloud environments. He previously worked on a JVM multi-tenant incubator project and has investigated enhancements for Java application deployments on Bluemix."
