description: "http4s embraces cats.data.Kleisli for service definitions and fs2.Stream for payload processing. With its foundation on these simple types, we’ll take a whirlwind tour of how http4s can:\n\n- plug into your functional business logic\n- snap together with other functional libraries\n- relate servers to clients\n- test with a simple function call\n- run on multiple backends\n- support multiple higher level DSLs\n\nThis talk will not make you an expert in http4s, but show that it’s a relatively short path to become one.\n\nEVENT:\n\nTypelevel Summit Boston, March 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRoss Baker\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urdtmx4h5LE"
