description: "Running VM Workloads Side by Side with Container Workloads - Sebastian Scheele, Loodse \n\nOn Kubernetes clusters, cloud native workloads and (legacy) VM workloads can run side by side. KubeVirt is a project to bring declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to VM creation, configuration, and management. In this talk, I will demonstrate how you can use the KubeVirt to set up and manage VM inside of a Kubernetes cluster. I will be describing how KubeVirt leverages CPU virtualization to implement a stronger security architecture for Kubernetes.   When combining both approaches, we can run a wider range of workloads, from container cloud-native applications to lift-and-shift applications with KubeVirt. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrYS"
