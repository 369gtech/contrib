description: "Accelerating External Sorting via On-the-ﬂy Data Merge in Active SSDs\n\nYoung-Sik Lee, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST); Luis Cavazos Quero, Youngjae Lee, and Jin-Soo Kim, Sungkyunkwan University; Seungryoul Maeng, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)\n\nThe concept of active SSDs (solid state drives) has been introduced in order to cope with the demands required to process the ever-increasing volumes of data. In active SSDs, some of the data-processing tasks are offloaded to SSDs, freeing host system resources and improving overall performance of data analysis.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel active SSD architec- ture focused on improving the external sorting algorithm that is used extensively in data-intensive computing. By performing merge operations on-the-fly in active SSDs, our method can remove the extra data transfer and en- hance the lifetime of SSDs. Our evaluation results on a real SSD platform indicate that the proposed scheme out- performs the traditional external sorting by up to 39%.\n\nView the full HotStorage '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotstorage14/workshop-program"
