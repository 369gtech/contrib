description: "The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace, Babbage & the Analytical Engine - Sydney Padua (Lambda Days 2017)\n\nhttp://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/sydney-padua\n\nOne hundred years before the first computers were built out of wires and transistors, the Victorian polymath Charles Babbage designed a gigantic steam-powered, punchcard-programmed, cogwheel computer, the Analytical Engine. His friend Ada, Countess of Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron, completed some of the first programs for the machine, and theorised that one day it could be used for the manipulation of any kind of information. Unfortunately Ada died young and Babbage never built his Engine, leaving their story as one of the greatest what-ifs in the history of science."
