recordingDate: 1497229188
description: "Agile has become the industry standard for software development. However, there is one problematic subject – Creativity. It’s hard to measure the value of aesthetic, sentimental features based on time, budget and impact. The subject of this talk is on improving the creative process. Also, there will be small tips that cover tools, management, and graphic design as well.\n\nHere are three topics to support the main idea:\n\n1. Tools: Software / Libraries that can polish your product faster.\n2. Collaborative design: How management, developers and other parts of the team can collaborate without design skills.\n3. Pure visual design: How can a designer boost up their artistic skills for the maximum product value.\n\nJinju Jang is the lead designer at Sportsmate Mobile. Previously, she worked at Itty Bitty Apps and Outware Mobile. She has been involved with various mobile products – OPAL, ANZ Grow, and realestate.com.au – creating delightful mobile experiences.\n\nShe has a strong passion for using mathematics and code to enhance the creative process. Since 2012, she has been sharing knowledge for designers and developers via presentations and articles.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
