recordingDate: 1632325493
description: "\"Have you asked yourself, \"\"What is Spring and what does it do?\"\" Well, this talk is for you! \n \n We'll begin with a brief history of the Spring Framework. From there, we discuss the layers of Spring and what each layer does. As we cover each layer, we'll give an overview of the key projects that comprise the layer. Finally, we'll show you how to take your Spring app and run it natively.\"\n\nGlenn Renfro, Spring Developer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/what-is-spring-250104479"
