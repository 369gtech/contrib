title: 'Testing Front-end Code the Right Way'
language: English
recordingDate: 1418401342
description: "Testing front-end code isn’t something that everyone does, but why? Testing shouldn’t be something that is done after the project is complete. It shouldn’t be an afterthought, it should be something that is practiced inline with the development process.\n\nJump right into testing front-end code the right way from start to finish. We will explore some super useful tricks and tips and examine how exactly we can improve the quality of our code and our skills as web developers by properly testing our front-end code. Learn how to create robust tests using Jasmine, refactor our code, use mocking + stubbing and then explore other methods of testing our application as a whole. Become professional software testers and transcend our abilities as web developers.\n\nMatias Niemelä\nCore Developer, AngularJS\nhttps://twitter.com/yearofmoo\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
