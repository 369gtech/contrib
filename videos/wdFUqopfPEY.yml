description: "Speaker: Ying Tong\n\nVerifying block transactions is computationally intensive and creates a throughput bottleneck for blockchain nodes. One area of active research in blockchain scalability is verifiable computation: this is where heavy computations are outsourced to a third-party, yet can still be verified remotely by a light client with limited resources. It works by requiring third-parties to produce succinct proofs of their computations: \"succinct\" because they can be verified using only a fraction of the proving time. We will explore two constructions, \"Rollup\" and \"Rollup Non-Custodial\", which use SNARKs (succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) to verifiably outsource computation on the blockchain.\n\nSpeaker Profile\n\nYing Tong is a Physics graduate student at NUS. She also works as a researcher at the Centre for Quantum Technologies and the Ethereum Foundation. She's interested in cryptography, p2p and privacy.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/NUSHackers/events/266209949/\n\nRecorded on: 8 November 2019\nProduced by Engineers.SG\nRecorded by: NUS Hackers\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/CRbDq/"
