description: "The importance of good software testing in the larger software development world is taken as a given, yet in many IoT projects, software testing is done in an ad-hoc manner if it is done at all.\n\nIn this talk I will show how there are multiple techniques for software testing your IoT projects, when each of these techniques is appropriate, and hands on examples of how to use them. I will show how Test Driven Development can be used to improve the reliability, reproducibility and speed of development of your IoT projects.\n\nWhen Charles started programming, everyone had to have a bit of hardware knowledge, and he always loved it. He's worked for some of the \"big names\" in the industry - Apple, Xerox, DEC, and Google but now he works on his own projects and consult. Most of his practice is around Continuous Improvement and Microservices, particularly in Go.\n\nOver time he's seen software development \"best practices\" change for the better, but those changes haven't always made it to the IoT world - even when they could, and arguably should. The biggest one he sees on a regular basis are modern testing practices.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference, visit, http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
