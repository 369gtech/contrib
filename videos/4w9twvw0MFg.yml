title: 'Performance is not an Option- Building services with GRPC and Cassandra - Dave Bechberger'
recordingDate: 1470646511
description: "In today's development ecosystem building a service oriented architecture based on a micro services is common practice. With the rise of Big Data and Internet of Things applications making these services highly performant services is no longer an option. In order to accomplish the scalability and performance requirements that customers expect we are required to start thinking differently about how we architect and build these applications in order to meet those demands.\nThis session will demonstrate a method for creating a highly performant service based application using Googleâ€™s GRPC and Apache Cassandra in .NET. We will show how you can combine gRPC to minimize communication overhead while leveraging Cassandra to optimize storage of time series data. We will explore these concepts by creating an Internet of Things (IoT) application to demonstrate how you can effectively meet the performance and scalability challenges posed by these new breeds of applications."
