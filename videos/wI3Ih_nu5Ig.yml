description: 'App development for developing countries introduces a slew of new challenges: smartphones function as a user''s main point of connection, local demand for use of mobile apps and web is different and the infrastructure places strict limits on users'' internet data volume. In this talk we''ll discuss how the mobile world looks like in developing countries: what apps are like, what are the common devices, what are the current initiatives to increase internet connectivity and how is all this related to financial inclusion. We''ll then discuss further potential solutions to those challenges.'
