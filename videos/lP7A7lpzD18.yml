description: "Full title: Francesca Alted, Christian Steiner: Improve the efficiency of your Big Data application | PyData New York 2019\n\nIf you're using NumPy and your data uses too much memory or requires too much computational resources this talk is for you! We'll introduce Caterva and IronArray, two libraries that, when used together, can greatly improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of your big data applications.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
