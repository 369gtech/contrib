description: "Slide shows have come a long way, from hand shadows in caves over a fire, followed by shadow puppetry, followed by magic lanterns, to Uncle Bob's endless family vacation on 35mm slide carousels, and finally, to today's generation of presentation software. One relatively recent innovation is the ability to create applications that automate creating & updating presentations. With the ability to access Google Slides from Google Apps Script, coding presentations has made it to the cloud! In this video, engineer Wesley Chun (@wescpy) demonstrates a short script that auto-generates slide decks from a small collection of images.
