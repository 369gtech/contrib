description: "Support Operations Engineering: Scaling Developer Products to the Millions\n\nJunade Ali, Cloudflare \n\nLarge scale internet infrastructure companies are increasingly relied upon by other engineering organisations, from self-serve customers to large enterprise organisations. The duty of helping customers SRE and engineering teams diagnose complex and stressful issues will likely rest with technical support. Support Operations Engineers compliment this by treating support as an optimisation problem with engineering solutions.\n\nThis talk describes the essential principles that Cloudflareâ€™s Support Operations Engineers use to scale developer support in a large-scale internet infrastructure company serving 16+ million customer domains and more than 10% of global HTTP requests, whilst driving dramatic improvements in operational efficiency and delivering exceptional business value.\n\nThis talk will cover how Stateless Testing is used to introduce proactive support and improve customer retention, how Safety Engineering strategies are used with Machine Learning to automate customer support and how Operations Research with alerting data is used to create a next-gen Security Operations Centre.\n\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
