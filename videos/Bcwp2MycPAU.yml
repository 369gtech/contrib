description: ".NET Summit 2020 Online Edition https://dotnetsummit.by - the 4th community driven .NET conference dedicated to practical experience of solving business challenges with .NET and technical challenges in .NET application.\n\nAlexandr Senichkin, Roslyn for teamlead.If something takes more than 5 minutes -write a script. [RU]\n\n\"In the process, we have gained great experience using Roslyn, which we want to share. What can Roslyn come in for? For example, to write your own microanalyzer simplifying code review.\nDuring the development process, we abandoned the ideas of many diagnostics that are too complex in the general case or that work too often and make it difficult to work with good responses.\nUsing these ideas as an example, I will demonstrate the capabilities of Roslyn for writing my own static analyzer.\"\n\nGeneral Partner - ISsoft - https://issoft.by"
