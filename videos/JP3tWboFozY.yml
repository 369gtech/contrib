description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nRandy Shoup - Consulting CTO (former eBay and Google)\n\nABSTRACT\neBay and Google operate some of the largest Internet sites on the planet, and each maintains its leadership through continuous innovation in infrastructure and products. While substantially different in their detailed approaches, both organizations sustain their feature velocity through a combination of technology, people, and process. This session will explore how these large-scale sites do it, and will offer some concrete suggestions on how other organizations -- both large and small -- can do the same.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
