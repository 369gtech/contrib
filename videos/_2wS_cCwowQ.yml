This talk will be an overview of current most popular AI techniques and concepts, full of examples from games like Crush Your Enemies or This War of Mine. This will not be very technical speech. It’s going to be interesting not only for programmers but generally to developers – especially game designers. It will help intermediate developers to systematize their knowledge about AI plus there will be a lot of examples and curiosities from development of This War of Mine or Crush Your Enemies AI. On the other hand it will be great for beginners who just want to start their adventure with creating AI for games.'
