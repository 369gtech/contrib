title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Women in the Tech Workplace'
recordingDate: 1523439895
description: "Women in tech - it's been a hot-button issue for quite some time. Are there enough women in tech? It seems pretty clear the answer is no. In a culture of harassment, booth babes, and tech bros, what can companies do to fix things within their own ranks?\n\nWhy do some companies seem to have no issue recruiting and retaining female employees when others struggle? What attracts women to tech companies? What repels them and makes them less likely to respond to a job posting? What affect does striving for meritocracy have on diversity?\n\nWe'll talk about the myth of the \"pipeline problem,\" address policies and benefits that may be more inclusive such as childcare and leave, your company culture and how it is perceived, and more things specific to the tech world, including things that have worked very well for some companies.\n\n\n\nThis talk is for everyone - business leaders, those who recruit and hire, those who are recruited and hired, and those who want to know more about what is going on in the tech world today and how to fix it."
