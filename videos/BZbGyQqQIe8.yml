description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nI would like to show how I have been using Python and its data science tools to interpret large datasets retrieved from modern equipment used in neonatal intensive care, mechanical ventilators and patient monitors. I also would like to talk about my journey to Python: why it is important for professionals without computational background to learn coding and how I think it is the easiest to do it.\n\nSlides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wwfkbfd28rm8hoi/Pydata_Berlin_2018.pptx?dl=0\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
