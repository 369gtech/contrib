description: "Talk\nComputational modules are valuable pedagogical tools to teach complex engineering concepts via enquiry-based learning (EBL). In this context, we have developed interactive online visualization-based python modules to explain science and engineering concepts through common chemical engineering applications. All these modules can be accessed at this website: https://srrweb.cc.lehigh.edu/app/.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
