description: "Since its introduction in 1989, Paxos has been a most prevalent protocol for solving consensus in distributed systems. Not long ago, researchers at Stanford published Raft protocol - a more understandable and approachable alternative to Paxos.\n\nIn this talk, I will introduce Raft, reveal its inner-workings and show how it is useful in solving reliability issues inherent to all distributed systems. Also, on the practical side, I will go through some implementation details of Rachis - a Raft implementation in C# used by RavenDB."
