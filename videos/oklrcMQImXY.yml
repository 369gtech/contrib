description: "Bert Jan Schrijver, Software craftsman, JPoint, OpenValue\n\nIn the cloud, big data, and internet division of the Dutch National Police, five DevOps teams use the latest open source technology to build high-tech, cloud-native web applications with Spring Boot, Angular 5, Spark, Kafka, and Jenkins 2. This session shares their experiences and real-world use cases for microservices. It explains their architecture, why they chose it, which challenges they face, and what this all brings them. It also shows how the five teams work together on one product and discusses how they apply the principles of DevOps and continuous delivery. You’ll learn how they handle security, build pipelines, test automation, performance tests, service discovery, automated deployments and monitoring, and more."
