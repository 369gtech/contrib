title: 'Webinar: Introducing Reactor - A framework for asynchronous applications on the JVM'
recordingDate: 1372228898
description: "Speaker: Jon Brisbin\nThe sheer volume of non-human-generated data in modern applications can easily overtake a traditional single-threaded, blocking design model. Reactor aims to address this volume, by providing a foundational framework for JVM applications -- applications that need high throughput when performing reasonably small chunks of stateless, asynchronous processing. Join Jon Brisbin as he discusses the motivations behind the project, the design patterns and existing technology that inspired the project, and how it fits in the asynchronous ecosystem today, as a teaser to his upcoming session at SpringOne 2GX 2013."
