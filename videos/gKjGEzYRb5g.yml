We'd like to give an introduction for those incubator projects, so please join us for understanding of them. In this presentation, we'll give an introduction on its background, user case, tutorial and so on. We will also cover the feature interaction with kube-scheduler for better resource utilization. This session is most useful for cluster admins or those who want to start contributing to Kubernetes scheduler.\n\nTo learn more click here: https://sched.co/FuLN"
