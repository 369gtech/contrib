description: "Who wants to write mapping code? Using reflection based solutions comes with a host of tricky problems like runtime errors, difficulty debugging and then - of course - it's not type safe.\n\nMapStruct is a new way of mapping data that generates Java code at compilation time. It's easy to debug, has no run time dependencies, is type safe and doesn't use reflection.\n\nDrop the reflection! Come along and learn how to solve typical mapping problems with MapStruct."
