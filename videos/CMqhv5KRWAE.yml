description: "Do you write backends with slow, fully-interpreted experiences? Have you ever had your cluster of compute machines fall over, paying hand-over-fist to throw more machines at the cluster due to memory constraints? Have you ever been bored with purely object-oriented languages? Not only performant, Elixir/Erlang present a completely new way of thinking when building applications through the novel language characteristics. In this talk, we'll not only discuss the advantages/disadvantages of using Elixir, but we'll also walk through building our first web-server and integration with a web-frontend.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
