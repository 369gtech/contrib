description: "Cloud environments today can be a mess. They are hard to standardize, take a long time to set up and and if you wanted to recreate an environment you would be stuck for a long time. What if you could deploy a brand new environment that you trust within minutes with the click of a button? Turns out you can.\nInfrastructure as code is on the rise. To address this, Microsoft introduced Azure Blueprints at Microsoft Ignite 2018 and made it available for public preview. Azure Blueprints allows for a way to orchestrate and deploy cloud environments in a repeatable manner, along with role and policy control.\nThis talk will give you insight into how to simplify your team's environments through infrastructure as code. After watching the talk, you will be ready to start using Azure Blueprints."
