title: 'How to Refactor Millions of Line of Code Without Alienating your Colleagues - Fred Tingaud C++onSea'

description: "At first look, Clang-Tidy looks like a convenient static analysis tool. But it is actually the emerged part of an incredible iceberg that can change the way software developers work on big projects.\n\nUsing the extension API provided by clang tooling, you can design custom tools that will allow you to get rid of bad patterns or API mistakes in your code that were historically considered \"too deep-rooted to fix\". Through concrete examples we will see what these custom tools can do and how this could impact your everyday job as software maintainers.\n\nBut wielding such powerful tools can be hard! And working on big projects also means you are likely working in an ecosystem with a lot of other developers. What happens when each time these colleagues try to sync their repository they find out one of your refactorings completely changed the API they were calling in their local work? We will see the difficulties and pitfalls one can encounter when developing and using clang based refactoring tools and how to avoid or reduce them.\n\n-------\nFred Tingaud is a Principal Software Engineer at Murex where he maintains the C++ UI and front-end APIs.\n\nHe is also the creator of quick-bench.com and build-bench.com, as well as being the organizer of CPPP conference.\n\nHis interests range from code efficiency and readability to UI ergonomics.\n\n\n-------\n\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
