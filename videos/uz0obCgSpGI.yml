description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nTelemetry is Not Having to Hope - Owen Diel, Grafana Labs\n\nTelemetry isn't new, so why is it so important now? In this nontechnical talk, Owen reflects on his unorthodox journey into software, how open source enabled him, and what monitoring means in the face of ever increasing complexity. In addition to the importance of monitoring and open source, Owen describes its natural progression from a reactive tool for managing complexity to a proactive tool for incentivizing and evaluating changes. The increasing scope of monitoring is only part of its success: it is also driven by the external growth of systems it need watch. Finally, Owen elaborates how Prometheus simplifies external complexity for both technical and organizational benefit."
