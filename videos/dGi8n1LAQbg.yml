title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: Mad Scientist Road show'
recordingDate: 1493190032
description: "As lead developer on ELMS: Learning Network, I've often been told I'm a bit of a mad scientist. We do things bold, bright, and always a bit crazy in ELMS land and so I wanted to package several deeper developer concepts from the platform in a way that's reusable by others. This talk will use elmsln as more of a implementation space for highlighting the following \"science\" experiments created to make the project possible. As a result, this will be a type of lightning talk within a talk in which many concepts are broken into digestable mini-talks. This should help increase engagement instead of being a bogged down fall asleep technical talk.\n\nSimulating accessibility in real time with field loss, dyslexia, colorblindness simulators and more (via a11y module)\nHow to talk to your Drupal site in the browser (via SpeechRecognition API / annyang\_) and have it talk back (via SpeechSynthesisUtterance) with working examples\nxAPI - Experience API; What it is, what it affords you, and why companies like Amazon are gaining interest\_in a learning standard\nHow we use the Git PHP library, 3rd party open book creation tool Gitbook\_and github to produce drupal nodes from markdown files; distributing content production and enabling a world of open, reusable Open Educational Resources (OER) in the process (via OERSchema)\nLessons learned from building an Angular 2 app for improved\_user experiences (and why we'll use webcomponents now instead)\nWhat Webcomponents / Polymer is, how it will revolutionize building applications for the web, What HAX is (and how far along we are with it) and how we envision using them both to eliminate templating in Drupal (over time) and save Drupal authoring experience from \"Website tonight\" software. #NoTPL\nPart inspiration, part showcase, part crazy, this talk will be able to hit many different audiences from the most technical to the newest drupal attendee and those completely off our island. It will be of interest to education and non-education attendees alike because even though our use-cases come from education, things like SpeechRecognitionAPI, Headless development, Polymer / Webcomponents\_and Markdown importing workflows are use-case agnostic.\n\nThe talk will be given by the @elmsln\_core development team:\_@btopro (Bryan Ollendyke) and\_@hey__mp (Michael Potter).\n\nLinks to play with during the talk (and after):\n\nLRN Webcomponents we've been building / publishing\nWordPress Gutenburg (the end of the world)\nLRNDesign Panel Card (HAX Wired)\nLRNDesign Blockquote (HAX Wired)\nLRNDesign Drawer (HAX Wired)\nHax Content (page level authoring prototype)"
