description: "Speakers: Mark Fisher & Mark Pollack, Pivotal\nThe future of scalable data processing is microservices! Building on the ease of development and deployment provided by Spring Boot and the cloud native capabilities of Spring Cloud, the Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Task projects provide a simple and powerful framework for microservice stream and batch processing.\nAt a higher level of abstraction, Spring Cloud Data Flow is an integrated orchestration layer that provides a highly productive experience for deploying and managing sophisticated data pipelines consisting of standalone microservices. Streams and tasks are defined using a DSL abstraction and can be managed via shell and a web UI. Furthermore, a pluggable runtime SPI allows Spring Cloud Data Flow to coordinate these applications across a variety of distributed runtime platforms such as Cloud Foundry, Apache Mesos and Apache YARN.\nDuring this webinar you’ll see an overview of Spring Cloud Data Flow, with live demos of streaming and batch apps, on different platforms ranging from local cluster to a remote Cloud to show the simplicity of the developer experience.\n\nCheck out\nhttps://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=EB3g-H51AN0"
