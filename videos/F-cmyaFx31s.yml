description: "The applications technology landscape surrounding the Internet of Things, also called machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, is a Wild West full of proprietary technology implementations and a highly fragmented vendor ecosystem. Java enables a standards-based platform to enable highly integrated end-to-end device-to-data-center solutions. This session outlines some of the key challenges service providers face today in developing, scaling, and extending end-to-end M2M architectures. With the help of sample architectural blueprints and reference use cases, the session elaborates on the benefits of using Java Embedded in combination with Java middleware products in effectively addressing these challenges.\n\n\nAuthor:\nJaiprakash Suri\nJai leads Java product strategy at Oracle for embedded devices and the device to datacenter platform.\nView more trainings by Jaiprakash Suri at https://www.parleys.com/author/jaiprakash-suri\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
