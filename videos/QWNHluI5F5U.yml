description: "GoWayFest 3.0, Minsk – July 5, 2019\nGeneral Partner - SoftSwiss (https://www.softswiss.com/)\nVideo Partner - SEMrush (https://www.semrush.com/company/)\n\nStop Saying \"Just Use the Standard Library\", Nathan Davies\n\nGo is a great language. Go has an excellent community. Those two make a powerful combination. However, Nathan sees and hears a lot of \"just use the standard library\" as advice given to newcomers. \nWe need to stop this, we need to be more nuanced. It indicates how powerful the language is but it minimises how great the community is. This talk will cover a number of very useful libraries across a variety of domains that they, at Turnitin, have used and found very effective. The result will be that we, as a community, can start to give better, more welcoming advice to the newcomers and to the old hands alike.\n\nSlides – https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AoOn5BI2wruxE7c-i6QwLc0cVjfSKOzmADpUo0N16lw/edit?usp=drivesdk"
