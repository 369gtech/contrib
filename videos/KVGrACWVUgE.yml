Hundreds of PayPal’s data scientists, analysts, and developers use Jupyter to access data spread across filesystem, relational, document, and key-value stores, enabling complex analytics and an easy way to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. Romit Mehta and Praveen Kanamarlapudi explain how PayPal built its Jupyter infrastructure and powerful extensions.\n\nTopics include:\n\nHigh availability: A grid of highly available servers ensures customers get a notebook instance immediately\nPPMagics (PayPal Magics): An extension containing all PayPal magics to connect to any storage using any compute\nParameterized notebooks: An extension to make notebooks more interactive\nNotebooks scheduling: An integration with Airflow to schedule notebooks\nGitHub integration: An integration with PayPal’s enterprise GitHub repository to share and collaborate with notebooks\nOne-touch kernels: A simplified way to access any compute or storage\nUnified Data API: An integration with PayPal’s unified data API to access almost any storage engine directly within notebooks\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on: \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/oreillymedia\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/8459/"
