description: "About the talk:\nA few years back, I shifted my focus to working directly in the web industry to work more with online businesses. For a few years, I'd been showing up online and thought I was being pretty ‘authentic’ – sharing my views, talking about topics that mattered to me even if controversial... but I was hiding something: my chronic illness.\n\nMy talk will be about the journey I have been on as a freelancer and how I've started aligning my business and work with the values that are important to me. We all need to make sure we don't exhaust our physical and mental self.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nRachel Shillcock – Award-winning designer, speaker + author helping independent creatives and small businesses brand their businesses with authenticity + personality.\n\nHer studio wants to empower other's with chronic illnesses to carve their own path and create a life + business that works for them, and to lead the way by creating a platform for, and being a voice alongside, those with chronic illness in business.\n\nAbout the conference:\nDesign conference that’s not about buzzwords, but collaboration between designers. Our 5th User Experience design conference on March 2020 was themed around how UX, UI, content and graphic designers can work together better. \n\nWe've had insightful talks on day 1 and hands-on workshops on day 2 by speakers with experience working in Transport for London, OpenTable, The Paciello Group, Nike, Government Digital Service, Airbnb, Shopify, InVision, DuckDuckGo and others. From A/B Testing and Content Design to Design Language Systems and Ethical design.\n \nThe event was organised by The School of UX and kindly supported by SumUp and Sketch.
