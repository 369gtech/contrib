description: "Running eBay’s High-Performance Workloads with Kubernetes - Xin Ma, eBay \n\nIn the past two years we’ve been expanding our k8s deployments significantly fast by moving more and more production workloads into kubernetes. We’re now running multiple thousand-node k8s clusters from our data centers across the world, hosting various production workloads, including software load balancers on the edge, search engine, production databases, hadoop clusters, and GPU / machine learning applications, etc. Most of these workloads are critical to eBay’s business requiring higher performance and reliability. In this presentation, I’ll share our best practices as well as lessons learned when migrating high performance production workloads into containers running with kubernetes. You will hear stories to containerize applications without code change, leverage k8s capabilities to turn them into good k8s citizens, and more importantly, how we tune and optimize their performance. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPct"
