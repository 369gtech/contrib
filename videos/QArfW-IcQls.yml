description: "Friction is a common, and necessary, part of team growthâ€”but when left unchecked, team friction is unhealthy for you, your coworkers, your company, and ultimately your end users.\n\nIn this presentation, I draw on my experiences at organizations large and small to illuminate the sources of team tension, how you can better understand and manage unexpected teammate reactions, and the best ways to give actionable feedback without escalating drama. Your coworkers, your organization, your users, and you will reap the benefits."
