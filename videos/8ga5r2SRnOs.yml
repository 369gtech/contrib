We have worked with several open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund several projects over a three month period. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together nearly 2500 successful student participants and 2500 mentors from 98 countries worldwide, all for the love of code. Stephanie Liu of the Developer Programs team sat down with Leslie to understand the history of the program, hear some of the many success stories and find out what's new for SoC 2009.\r\n\r\nLeslie Hawthorn is a Program Manager for Google's Open Source Programs Office, where she's the Community Manager for the Google Summer of Code community. She serves on the Advisory Board of the GNOME Foundation and the Open Source Business Resource, as well as the Steering Committee for the Humanitarian FOSS Project. Her personal website is http://www.hawthornlandings.org.\r\n\r\nThis is the third episode in the \"Code Conversations\" video series on YouTube and Google Code (http://code.google.com).
