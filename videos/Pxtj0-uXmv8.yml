description: "Panel: Securing Cloud Native Applications [B] - moderated by Kamala Dasika, Pivotal    \n\nThe emphasis on continual, incremental, and rapid delivery of software has inspired a reinvention of the the way apps are built, deployed, and managed. These new methods are rapidly gaining popularity, and IT organizations are evaluating how this impacts their overall security posture. The complex controls that shape traditional enterprise processes require the security community to work together and reason about them. \n\nThis session rounds up diverse perspectives from the Cloud Foundry ecosystem on topics such as \n1. Security concerns at different layers of the technology stack\n2. Bringing time tested security design patterns into a Cloud Native environment\n3. The right combination of trade-offs and optimizations to make security teams more agile\n\nParticipants include John Field from Pivotal, Tyler Shields from Signal Sciences, Joe Pindar from Gemalto, and Joe Grandja who is a core committer on Spring Security. The session will be moderated by Kamala Dasika from Pivotal.\n\nKamala Dasika\n\nJohn Field\n\nJoe Grandja\n\nJoe Pindar\n\nTyler Shields\n\nhttps://cfsummit2017.sched.com/event/6c14f8dea23d0536c730ec53b981ce21"
