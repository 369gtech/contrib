description: "Presentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nCome dive into some exciting algorithms — tools rare enough to be novel, but useful enough to be found in practice. Want to learn about \"heavy hitters\" to prevent DOS attacks? Come to this talk. Want to avoid smashing your stack during tree destruction? Come to this talk. Want to hear war stories about how a new algorithm saved the day? Come to this talk! We'll dive into the finest of algorithms and see them in use — Fantastic Algorithms, and Where To Find Them.\n— \nNicholas Ormrod: Facebook, Software Engineer\n\nNicholas is a infrastructure engineer at Facebook. If he talks too much, disable him with a well-placed nerd snipe.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
