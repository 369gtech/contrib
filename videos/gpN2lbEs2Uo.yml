description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nIn September 2017, dockless bikeshare joined the transportation options in the District of Columbia. In March 2018, scooter share followed. During the pilot of these technologies, Python has helped District Department of Transportation answer some critical questions. This talk will discuss how Python was used to answer research questions and how it supported the evaluation of this demonstration.\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/PyData/mining-dockless-bikeshare-and-dockless-scootershare-trip-data-stefanie-brodie-kiana-roshan-zamir\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
