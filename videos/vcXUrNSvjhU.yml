description: "Google Tech Talks\nNovember, 12 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPlease welcome Håkon Lie and Michael Day, who will be presenting Prince XML.\n\nPrince Overview: Prince is a computer program that converts XML and HTML into PDF documents. Prince can read many XML formats, including XHTML and SVG. Prince formats documents according to style sheets written in CSS. \n\nDynamic data-driven documents: Prince is an ideal printing component for server-based software such as web applications and database systems. Using Prince, data in XML can easily be converted to PDF documents that can be printed, archived or downloaded over the web. \n\nElectronic publishing: Prince can also be used by authors and publishers to typeset and print documents written in HTML, XHTML or one of the many XML-based document formats. Prince is capable of formatting academic papers, scientific journals, novels, and books with extensive illustrations.\n\nSpeaker: Håkon Wium Lie\nHåkon Wium Lie, YesLogic Director: Håkon is a web pioneer, having proposed CSS while working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1994. Håkon became a devotee when he found that Prince could format his book on CSS (co-authored with Bert Bos) and his PhD thesis. Håkon is a graduate of MIT's Media Lab and is also the CTO of Opera Software. \n\nSpeaker: Michael Day\nMichael Day, YesLogic CEO: Michael is the system architect for Prince. He has implemented the CSS processing module, which supports many pioneering CSS features including CSS3 Selectors and Paged Media properties. In 2003, he joined the W3C CSS working group as an invited expert."
