description: "Perry Randall, Facebook\n\nThis talk details the practical steps that we took to build Instagram's continuous deployment pipeline, highlights the problems we faced, and explains the key ideas that scaled our server release process. These steps are generic and are relevant to any development team looking for reason and/or blueprint towards a continuous deployment system. Development teams that already do some form of continuous deployment will identify with the problems and hear how we got it to work at Instagram. Others who did not already do so will hopefully be inspired to start when they learn that they can always start with the simple thing and progress step by step.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program.\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
