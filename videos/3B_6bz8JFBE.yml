language: English
recordingDate: 1624485571
description: 'Got data? Got Blazor? The “glue” between the client and server is often the weakest link in building enterprise web apps. What if you could use your domain model as the source of truth, generate a database that supports your design and easily move data between the server and your Blazor WebAssembly app with just a few lines of code? Jeremy will show you how to do this and more with the power of Entity Framework Core enhanced by GraphQL'
