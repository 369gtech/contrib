description: "JavaFX is a high-level scene graphâ€“based API that enables developers to build, render, and manipulate 2-D as well as 3-D objects in a single scene graph. This session focuses on the new 3-D features of JavaFX 8. It covers a range of 3-D topics such as meshes, lights, materials, the coordinate system, the movable camera, and the depth buffer. It also explores how to mix 2-D and 3-D objects, including the use of subscenes, and the various pitfalls to avoid.\n\n\nAuthors:\nKevin Rushforth\nConsulting Member of Technical Staff , Oracle\nView more trainings by Kevin Rushforth at https://www.parleys.com/author/kevin-rushforth\n\nChien Yang\nSpeaker Bio\nView more trainings by Chien Yang at https://www.parleys.com/author/chien-yang\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
