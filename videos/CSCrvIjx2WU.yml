description: "Metrics @UBER is a first class citizen. My talk will cover metrics collection, presentation and alerting based on metrics. It’s all about how we deal with the scale in incredibly fast growing company. I will include details on the tools we currently use, as well as our painful migration path from graphite based solution. I’ll show our build-in-house query language based on tags we’re using to query metrics and share my experience building, migrating and supporting metrics system at the fastest growing startup in the history.\nDevOps Pro Vilnius 2016 - http://goo.gl/D9eDT7"
