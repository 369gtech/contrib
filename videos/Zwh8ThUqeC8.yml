recordingDate: 1392240238
description: "http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/33761\n\nCrossing the Chasm has been a key reference point for high-tech marketing since its publication in 1990, but a lot has changed since then, especially with the rise of cloud computing, software as a service, mobile endpoints, big data analytics, and viral marketing. This has led author Geoff Moore to produce a revised edition, released on January 28, with all new examples taken from the last decade and two new appendices to help bridge the gap between what's new and what's not. Join Geoff as he highlights lessons learned in bringing disruptive innovations to market in the 21st century."
