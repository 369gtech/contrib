title: 'Specialising Linear Algebra for Geometry - Guy Davidson [ C++ on Sea 2020 ]'
language: English
recordingDate: 1595523610
description: "At last years conference the Linear Algebra library proposal was unveiled. This year we will review its progress and learn about specialising for geometry. Expect to learn a little bit of history, discover how to overcome the ghastly difficulties of working with a limited subset of the rational numbers, and look at a set of animations that wouldn't be out of place on an elderly Open University TV programme.\n\n-------\n\nGuy Davidson is believed to be operating as three clones of himself: not only is he the Principal Coding Manager at Creative Assembly, where he helps make good programmers into better ones, he also contributes to HMI development in the C++ standard, works to promote diversity in the C++ community through #includeC++, campaigns for the Green Party of England and Wales and raises children.\n\nAnd plays the piano, teaches Tai Chi and cooks. There are probably other things too...\n-------\n\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 conference was moved to a virtual event due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
