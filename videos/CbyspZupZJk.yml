The SIG IBM Cloud is now a sub-project called Provider IBM Cloud. In this session, the Provider IBM Cloud leads will discuss these recent developments and brief about the activities of the sub-project. This will be followed by a deep dive into the Kubernetes Cluster API Provider IBM Cloud and the recent development activities. We will then provide the current status of the IBM Cloud Provider. Everyone --active contributors, new contributors, and conference attendees -- with interest in the Provider IBM Cloud sub-project are welcome to attend. During the session, the project leads will be available all the time for discussions. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uakh"
