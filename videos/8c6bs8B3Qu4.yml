title: 'Testing RESTful services: The What, The How and The Automated by Alexey Buzdin'
recordingDate: 1492266113
description: 'Nowadays REST-like is a default architectural pattern for developing web services. Since Client and Server sides are completely decoupled and each web-service has a client-agnostic interface exposed over HTTP it would be a good idea to test that exact HTTP interface. Thus instead of using UI Automation for end-to-end tests we can use a more lightweight approach with testing HTTP. This presentation will cover my experience of writing robust and maintainable test suits for Java and non-Java web services with Cucumber DSL based on experience with more than a dozen projects.'
