language: English
recordingDate: 1585773042
description: "Containers are becoming the standard to build, package and deploy applications on-premises and in the cloud. Even in highly regulated environments, container terminals are accepting containers as their default package. With this growing paradigm, big challenges arise to keep everything within this movement smooth and secure.\n\nIn this talk, the audience will learn how to achieve this goal from a “security-centered” perspective. There will be a major focus on cloud native (network) security and container security. ABN AMRO will explain how container security is practiced in the entire organization to keep the containers secure and compliant during their DevOps transformations.\n\nIn this webinar, Wiebe De Roos from ABN AMRO and Keith Mokris from Palo Alto Networks will offer valuable insights and real-world examples of overcoming technical and organizational challenges any enterprise can benefit from.\n\nPresenters:\n\nWiebe de Roos, CI/CD Consultant @Flusso and ABN Amro\nKeith Mokris, Technical Marketing Engineer @Palo Alto Networks"
