description: "Let’s hack and try to test our message producers in various ways.\n\nAnd consumers too.\n\nUsing Spock, jUnit, Mockito, Spring Cloud Stream, Spring Cloud Contract\n\n---\n\nJakub is a developer advocate at VMware, blogger, programmer, and trainer. He loves to tackle complex enterprises with domain-driven design, test-driven development, and Spring. Architecture is a main area of interest, too. When he doesn’t program, he rides motorbikes, skis, or practices kitesurfing."
