description: "A Petri net is a formal mathematical modelling language for distributed systems, a bit like an advanced state machine. Petri nets can be used to model business processes as well as lower level communication protocols.\n\nUnfortunately, formal specification tools and languages are sometimes associated with big, up-front design. In this video, Aslak demonstrates how Petri nets can be used to define a distributed process, and how the model and the code can evolve incrementally with TDD.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2019, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
