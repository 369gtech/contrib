description: "Developers are flocking to Erlang because of its superb support for concurrency. Erlang's actor-based approach is particularly strong, but it's not the only way.\n\nWhat approaches are other languages and ecosystems taking? And what lessons can the Erlang community learn from them?\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- There’s more to parallelism than multiple cores\n\n- Parallelism and concurrency related, but different\n\n- There’s more to concurrency than actors\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Anyone who is interested in understanding the wide range of approaches being adopted within the software field to help us deal with the increasing importance of parallelism and concurrency."
