description: "Obelisk and the Known Unknowns (Or: The Art of Fumbling Through your Side Project to Create Something Incredible!) by Sacha Sayan\n\nI had a dream of building something cool in the realm of digital signage, no fabrication knowledge, questionable memory of high school physics equations, and a terrible track record for finishing side projects. So I did what anyone else would do: Pulled my credit card out to buy a bunch of undocumented electronics from an internet wholesaler and forced myself to sit down and figure it out. The result: Something amazing, and a deep reflection for how we should think about our pet projects.\n\nWhen Sacha (@sachasayan) isn’t getting himself into trouble committing to side projects, he’s working as a software engineer in Toronto, Canada. In his spare time he also likes to get lost on motorcycles in far flung corners of the planet, demonstrating that he really is a masochist beyond redemption."
