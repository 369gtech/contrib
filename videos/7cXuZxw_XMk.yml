title: 'YOW! CTO 2019 - Allen Wirfs Brock - Kick-starting "Inventing the Future”'
recordingDate: 1582574401
description: "The role of a CTO varies greatly among organisations. But it almost always includes the responsibility to understand technology trends and how they are likely to impact the organisation. Alan Kay famously said, “The best way to predict the future is to invent it.” What does that mean? Does it apply to your organisation? Is it actionable? Let’s talk about how to start the process of inventing the technical future of your organisation.\n\nFrom 2009 through 2015 Allen Wirfs-Brock was the project editor of the ECMAScript standard that defines the JavaScript programming language. This means that he was essentially the lead author of the ECMAScript 5 and ECMAScript 6/2015 specifications. Allen has been an architect and implementer of compilers, virtual machines, programming environments, and computer systems. For his contributions, he has been recognized as an ACM Distinguished Engineer and an Ecma Fellow.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
