description: "Google Tech Talk\nJanuary 4, 2013\n(expand for more info)\nPresented by Tim Conway\n\nABSTRACT\n\nGoPano plus uses a specially curved mirror. Its shape gathers light from all directions and re?ects it into the lens of your camera.\n\nThis single image/video shows everything in a 360° ring around the GoPano plus. On your computer, this warped image is transformed (\"unwarped\") into an interactive scene where anyone can control the view.\n\nOnce you have the raw photos and/or videos, you'll need software to edit them. We provide PhotoWarp (for images) and VideoWarp Director (for 360° videos). Whether you're shooting 360° stills, panoramic videos, or both, we've got you covered.\n\nThe GoPano plus has a standard 67mm photographic ?lter thread base which can be easily adapted to ?t almost all the digital cameras, DSLR lenses, and camcorders. GoPano Step Rings can adapt any camera or lens with a ?lter thread to connect directly to the GoPano plus.\n\nSPEAKER INFO:\n\nTim Conway (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1122112/)\n\nNot to be confused with actor in the Dorf videos, Tim Conway has been creating, supervising, and creating unique technology in the field of Visual Effects and Post Production since 1997.\n\nHis latest endeavor is a camera lens with an attached mirror which allows you to take 360 degree panoramic still images or video.\n\n\nThis Tech Talk was presented at Google's LA office."
