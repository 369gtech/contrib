title: 'Scott Wlaschin — Designing with capabilities'
recordingDate: 1631117863
description: "Ближайшая конференция: \nDotNext 2021 Moscow — 21-22 октября, онлайн.\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/3BTQype\n\n. In this talk, Scott will look at an unusual approach to designing internal interfaces and external APIs — a \"capability-based\" approach that takes the Principle Of Least Authority and applies it to software design. When this approach is used, it produces a robust and modular design that captures the domain constraints, resulting in an API that is self-documenting and hard to misuse.\n\nScott will demonstrate how to design and implement a capability-based approach, how capabilities can be quickly combined and restricted easily, and how capabilities are a natural fit with a REST API that uses HATEOAS."
