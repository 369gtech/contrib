description: 'The flood of tools and frameworks in the front-end development world caused both the developers and their employers to lose sight of the things that really matter - software craftsmanship. Itâ€™s demand for Angular over TDD, SASS over SOLID. This loss of focus from the essentials is in the long run damaging and sadly - it is all self-inflicted.
