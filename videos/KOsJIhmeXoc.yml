description: "Nick Bray\n\nNative Client brings native code to the web - as safely and securely as JavaScript.  However, code run by Native Client must follow a few rules to ensure safety and to guarantee that the code integrates smoothly with a web application.\n\nThis session will follow a line of code throughout its lifecycle: compiled, loaded across the network, and run on a user's machine.  Along the way, the nuts and bolts of Native Client's security mechanisms will be explored, as well as the APIs that let native code integrate with the web rather than be tied to a particular operating system.\n\nFor all I/O 2012 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/io/"
