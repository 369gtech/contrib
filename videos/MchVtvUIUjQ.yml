description: "HTML is special. Unlike many other languages the browser wonâ€™t show an error message when you make a mistake. Sure, that makes it easy to write bad code, but it also allows HTML to be both backwards and future compatible. It allowed the HTML5 specification to extend the existing form field types. It allowed the RICG to create the picture element. And it forms the basis of Web Components because it makes custom elements possible. And most importantly, it allows the noscript tag, which by definition does absolutely nothing. This talk will explain the concepts behind graceful degradation, progressive enhancement and feature detection, and focus on how to solve practical problems with these concepts.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/nielsleenheer/noscript-at-css-day-html-special\nAbout Niels: https://nielsleenheer.com/\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
