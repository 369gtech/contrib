title: 'Effective Communication in a Remote First World - Rob Crowley'
language: English
recordingDate: 1605697567
description: "2020 has seen a seismic shift in how we work across the IT industry. Remote working, previously the choice of a small minority of IT professionals, has become the de-facto standard. This trend is likely to strengthen as workers and companies embrace the myriad potential benefits. The companies that will thrive in this brave new world will be those who can adapt most nimbly. Unfortunately, many have lurched into this situation with little deliberate thought on how their approach to communication should evolve to suit this new operating context. Simply substituting in-person meetings for virtual ones misses the major opportunities to eliminate waste, boost organisational memory and enhance engagement. Join Rob as he shares the lessons heâ€™s learned leading delivery teams across five timezones and three continents on the path towards remote working. We will take an in-depth look at communication from three perspectives; intra-team, inter-team, and finally customer-facing. For each of these focus areas, we will explore: * How to choose the optimal channel for a given interaction * Why asynchronous communication is more important than ever and what skills are required to make it shine * Why tooling represents one aspect of the solution but is far from a silver bullet Additionally, we will see how leaders can maintain strategic alignment and avoid feelings of isolation within their team. By the end of the session, you will not only understand how to communicate effectively while working remotely but also have the knowledge to put this into practice. If you want to improve the quality of your remote interactions with others, then this is the session for you. See you there!\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
