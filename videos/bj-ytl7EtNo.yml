title: '#HITBCyberWeek D2 LAB - Hands-on Introduction to Timeless Debugging & Analysis'
language: English
recordingDate: 1609631592
description: "Timeless Analysis & Debugging builds upon captures of a time slice of a program or a full system execution to provide unique analysis features. By alleviating the need for iterative debugging sessions, it brings a new and powerful perspective to reverse-engineering problems such as vulnerability analysis.\n\n\n\nThis hands-on lab will use the Tetrane’s REVEN platform to introduce the concepts of Timeless Analysis and Debugging on a full system trace. You will be proposed exercises on pre-recorded reverse-engineering scenarios related to software running on Microsoft Windows.\n\n\nIn the end, you will learn how to combine these approaches and how to use TA&D features to rapidly navigate from a real world crash to its root-cause data or from data to a potential crash.\n\n\nThis lab will present both REVEN’s GUI and its Python API. Basic proficiency in Python is recommended but not mandatory – answers will be provided along the lab to allow everyone to progress.\n\n\n=== \n\n\nFrom the start of his career in the software industry in 2008, Mathieu has had a passion for developing performant, low-level software.\n\n\nSince his joining Tetrane in 2013 as an R&D engineer, he grew fonder of the security industry and its challenges. Now he divides his time between R&D and pre-sales activities: he regularly gives trainings of Tetrane’s timeless analysis & debugging tool REVEN, meets with its users, and is always on the lookout for new projects and features."
