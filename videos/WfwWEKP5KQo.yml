title: 'Unicode in Rust - Illustrated by Kanji - Jenny Manning'
language: English

description: 'Have you ever wondered why you can’t look up a character in a string by its index? Or why the length of a string can be wildly different from the number of characters in the string? In this talk, we’ll dive into Unicode by looking at how Kanji is represented in Rust. You’ll learn about things like the Han unification, the origins of CJK languages from Oracle bone script, and why Rust handles strings differently than we expect.'
