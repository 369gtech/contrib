language: English
recordingDate: 1608746670
description: "Identifying Hidden Dependencies\n\nLiz Fong-Jones, honeycomb.io\n\nYou don't need to write automation or deploy on Kubernetes to gain benefits from resilience engineering! Learn how Honeycomb improved the reliability of our Zookeeper, Kafka, and stateful storage systems through terminating nodes on purpose. We'll discuss the initial manual experiments we ran, the bugs in our automatic replacement tools we uncovered, and what steps we needed to progress towards continuously running the experiments. Today, no node at Honeycomb lives longer than 12 months, and we automatically recycle nodes every week.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
