language: English
recordingDate: 1573251291
description: "DOES19 Las Vegas â€” Join Shaun Norris, Pivotal CIO for APJ, and Dapeng Liu, of DBS Bank as they share how a team at DBS Bank has scaled deployments from 10 per year, to 4 per day. We will look at the operations side of this transformation, and how by building a solid foundation of automation, deployments have increased from 10 per year, to 4 per day. We will start at a high level view of why automating operations can help development teams increase velocity, and then dig into the details of typical ops activities such as HA restarts, VM lifecycle, network provisioning, patching of polyglot microservices, sharing security credentials, setting up centralized logging and more. We will also cover how DBS moved key applications from monoliths to microservices, how using an automated platform has automated a number of key operations activities and how the mindset around production change control has shifted in the organization.\n\nDOES19 Las Vegas\nDOES 2019 US\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
