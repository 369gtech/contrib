description: "The physical world is just another binary machine. Data creation, analysis, and corruption combined with JavaScript can make new and unexpected things.\n\nCan you programmatically extract joy from the subjectivity it exists in? Can it be translated into intentional forms to hook others in? This session will gently take you along on a personal journey of how you can use code to expose new expressions of the mundane secrets we hold dear.\n\nhttp://jsconfbp.com/speakers/suz-hinton.html"
