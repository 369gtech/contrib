description: 'Unsecured API endpoints are not something that we want. Beside from exposing our private data, it can also lead to uncontrolled AWS costs. In this talk, we will write a few lambda functions, using the Go language and expose it via API Gateway. Then we will see how to use Amazon Cognito to secure it. We will access them from our frontend application. Functions will be deployed by serverless framework and frontend app built with react/react-native.'
