title: 'The Science and Art of Backward Compatibility'

recordingDate: 1433255207
description: "One of the most common pitfalls developers face on larger projects is backward compatibility. This session shows how to ensure that new versions of a library do not break either source backward compatibility, binary backward compatibility, or behavioral backward compatibility. After reviewing what each type of compatibility means and why it is important, it covers the requirements for each type, along with ways to meet these requirements. The main areas of interest are API evolution and evolving classes in a way that does not break  wire compatibility  for Java serialization. The presentation also explores techniques for verifying backward compatibility through regression tests.\n\n\nAuthor:\nIan Robertson\nIan Robertson is an Application Architect for Myriad Genetics.
