description: 'Need a website for an open source project of which the code is on GitHub ? GitHub Pages might be a viable option. GitHub Pages allows you to build a site based on simple markdown text files and with a sprinkling of magic stardust you can pull in the changelog of your project from GitHub, show off a list of the contributors to the project and more. Join me to learn what GH Pages are and how to get your project web presence with little effort.'
