description: "Ближайшая конференция: \nHolyJS 2021 Moscow — 2-5 ноября, онлайн.\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/3rF5KS7 \n\n. Machine learning and JavaScript sounds tricky but is it so? Let's start from basic concepts of what tasks can be easily done with pre-made neural networks, common pitfalls that we can encounter along the way, and then we'll dive into how to convert heavyweight with billions of parameters Python models to use them on the client web side even in offline mode. Plus we'll see how to leverage the power of WASM during the migration. And in the end, we'll build a simple yet powerful pluggable library that will do sentiment analysis of the arbitrary text."
