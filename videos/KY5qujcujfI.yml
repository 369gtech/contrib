description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCloud Native Superpowers with eBPF - Liz Rice, Isovalent\n\nNetflix’s Brendan Gregg coined the term “Superpowers for Linux” to describe eBPF back in 2016. Today there are a whole crop of eBPF-based tools for cloud native observability, networking and security, such as Falco, Pixie and Cilium. What makes eBPF such a powerful platform for building this new generation of tools? This talk uses live-coding & demos from across the cloud native ecosystem to illustrate how eBPF programs can - Collect performance & behavioral insights from across an entire system - Relate observed data to Kubernetes objects - Reliably instrument workloads without making any changes to apps or configurations But eBPF isn't a magic wand. We’ll look at its limitations and potential misconceptions that are emerging from the use of this powerful new technology. Even if you’re not a Linux kernel aficionado you’ll leave this talk with an understanding of how eBPF enables high-performance tools that help you manage, debug and secure applications in the cloud."
