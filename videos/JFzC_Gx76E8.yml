description: 'Darin Fisher talks about the recently upstreamed Chromium WebKit API.  The API is a critical step in our path to becoming completely integrated into the WebKit project.  Like the other WebKit APIs, ours is a veneer which shields developers (including many of our own) from the internal details of WebKit (named WebCore).  Darin talks at a high level about the API, dives into some code examples, and talks about the history and future of the API.'
