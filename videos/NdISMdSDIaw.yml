description: "The traditional full stack was web frontend development and cloud platform backend work, but if you talk to developers today this has vastly changed. A new full stack is emerging that includes the traditional web frontend and cloud platform backend, but also includes mobile phones and tablets, API services, desktop (who thought that would explode?) and IoT. Developers are tasked to build and manage one application that has to manage all of this. And, the program environment of choice for the full stack developer: Node.js. This presentation is delivered by the Node.js Foundation community manager, who talks a bit about the history of Node.js; why it's becoming the first choice for the full stack developer; and how Node.js functions everywhere from web frontend development to IoT to create a single platform for developers to create the herculean applications of today.\n\nEVENT: Microsoft Build 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Mikeal Rogers\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on Microsoft Visual Studio YouTube channel with Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqickVjXddM"
