There is no such thing as plain text. Understanding how encoding works, how Ruby handles encoding issues, and how to strategically debug encoding snafus, can be a great asset in your developer toolbox. We will cover a bit of history, dive deep into Ruby's encoding methods, and learn some tricks for managing encoding in your application.\n\n#rubyconf2019 #confreaks"
