description: "Using future CSS features NOW without changing much of your preprocessing workflow\nYet another front-end madness or actually helpful? \nWe have been using PostCSS for a couple of new projects now and I want to give an introduction, talk about our learnings and why this is a good idea. It is a very fast and flexible system that you can use in the configuration that benefits you most. Like you would do with ES6 and a transpiler for ES% you can use PostCSS to future CSS functionality today. The transition from other preprocessors like SASS is actually fairly easy. \nHowever there are also some other very interesting approaches to solve the goals of e.g. namespacing your style modules, writing more DRY stylesheets and much more. It is part of the whole node/npm ecosystem and thus leverages the power of a large community of JS developers writing plugins.\nWhat to take away from this session:\n    •    how the system of many diverse plugins caters for many use-cases and personal preferences\n    •    how to implement that into a front-end workflow\n    •    how to transition from SCSS\n    •    why it makes sense to be able to use CSS bleeding edge functionality TODAY\n    •    the benefits and some issues with the young preprocessing system"
