description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nWriting reliable and maintainable C++ software is hard. Designing such software at scale adds a new set of challenges. Large-scale systems require more than just a thorough understanding of the logical design concepts addressed in most popular texts. To be successful on an enterprise scale, developers must also address physical design, a dimension of software engineering that may be unfamiliar even to expert developers.\n\nAfter more than two decades in the making, Large-Scale C++, Volume I: Process and Architecture, is finally here. Drawing on his over 30 years of hands-on experience building massive, mission-critical enterprise systems, John Lakos, using select excerpts from this glisteningly new volume, elucidates the essential value of (and several techniques needed for) creating and growing hierarchical reusable software a.k.a. Software Capital as the foundation for developing C++ software at virtually unbounded scale.\n\n---\nJohn Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design, serves at Bloomberg LP in New York City as a senior architect and mentor for C++ Software Development world-wide.  He is also an active voting member of the C++ Standards Committee’s Evolution Working Group. Previously, Dr. Lakos directed the design and development of infrastructure libraries for proprietary analytic financial applications at Bear Stearns. For 12 years prior, Dr. Lakos developed large frameworks and advanced ICCAD applications at Mentor Graphics, for which he holds multiple software patents. His academic credentials include a Ph.D. in Computer Science ('97) and an Sc.D. in Electrical Engineering ('89) from Columbia University. Dr. Lakos received his undergraduate degrees from MIT in Mathematics ('82) and Computer Science ('81). His next book, entitled Large-Scale C++—Volume I: Process and Architecture, is anticipated in 2019.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
