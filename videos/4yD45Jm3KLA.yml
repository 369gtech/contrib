description: "\"Measure, donâ€™t guess\"; \"time is money.\" Sound familiar? Come experience this session packed with state-of-the-art code quality tooling full of vivid demos, cutting-edge technologies, and methodologies providing you with the best mashup of available tooling for the fastest feedback loop in code quality assurance. The session focuses on efficient, agile, highly integrated code quality processes based on direct developer feedback, using the tool always used by developers: the IDE. Based on already existing functionalities in modern IDEs, such as tasks and hints, a feedback loop is created with check results, metrics, CI information, version control aspects, and much more.\n\nSpeakers:\nSven Reimers, System Engineer, Airbus Defence and Space\nSven Reimers, based at Lake Constance in southern Germany, works as a systems engineer at Airbus Defence and Space creating next generation ground segment software.
