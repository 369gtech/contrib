With each release and year, we see Flink being used for more challenging use case and applications.\n\nBut beyond the individual application (though it may be grand and challenging in itself), stream processing is a much broader building block: the foundational piece of a platform that brings together the different parts of a data architecture. A platform that integrates data analytics, data ingestion, SQL, Machine Learning, data provenance, databases, and other aspects of a data-driven infrastructure in a meaningful way.\n\nIn this keynote, we look at what goes into building a stream processing platform that is more than the sum of its parts.\n\nhttps://data-artisans.com/"
