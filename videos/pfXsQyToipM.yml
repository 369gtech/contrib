description: "Java 9 shipped the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), which brings language-level modularity to the Java ecosystem. But you already know that and even spent some time to learn the basics? That's great because this talk will take you beyond that and show how to...\n\nmodel finer-grained dependencies and APIs\ndecouple modules with services\nweigh encapsulation versus reflection\nanalyze dependencies with jdeps\nsafe the day with important command line flags\ncreate runtime images with jlink\nWith this under your belt, you're ready to become the local Java 9 modularity expert.\n\nNicolai is a thirty year old boy, as the narrator would put it, who has found his passion in software development. He constantly reads, thinks, and writes about it, and codes for a living as well as for fun.\n\nNicolai is a freelancing developer, trainer, and consultant. He writes The Java Module System with Manning, blogs about software development on codefx.org, recently started a YouTube channel, and is a long-tail contributor to several open source projects. You can hire him for all kinds of things."
