That's why it is essential for developers to be aware of every crash that happens and to know why they happen. In the world of iOS development, there are many reasons for that kind of problem. And it may be really difficult to gather enough information to find that reason for a particular case. In this talk, Nikolay will explain the main reasons for crashes on iOS to happen, how to catch different types of crashes and to collect the maximum amount of useful information to clarify the reason for them.
