description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nLearn PyTorch and implement deep neural networks (and classic machine learning models). This is a hands on tutorial which is geared toward people who are new to PyTorch.\n\nPyTorch is a relatively new neural network library which offers a nice tensor library, automatic differentiation for gradient descent, strong and easy gpu support, dynamic neural networks, and is easy to debug.\n\nSlides: https://github.com/sotte/pytorch_tutorial\n---\nPyData Berlin 2018\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
