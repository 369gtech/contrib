description: "Наша группа в ФБ: https://www.facebook.com/qafest/\nНаш сайт: www.qafest.com\n\nДоклад на конференции QA Fest 2017 в Киеве.\nThis talk will give you a quick overview of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), that goes into law in Europe starting May 25, 2018. Additionally, the talk will primarily focus on the parts that are especially important for people working with testing & quality assurance. Organisations outside EU will also be heavily affected by this, as European organizations will require \"GDPR compliance\" from service providers, no matter their location."
