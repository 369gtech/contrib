description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCNCF - SIG Network Intro and Deep Dive - Lee Calcote, Layer5 & Ken Owens, Fiserv\n\n“It’s the network!” is the cry of every system administrator, every developer. With the increased prevalence of microservice-based distributed systems, it’s true - networking as a discipline has never been more critical in the efficient operation of cloud native deployments. Networking primitives, including load balancing, observability, authentication, authorization, policy, rate limiting, QoS, mesh networks, legacy infrastructure bridging, and so on are now receiving substantial development and investment throughout the industry and are the subject of focus of the CNCF Network SIG."
