Paying this debt is expensive and in many cases seems infeasible. \n\nAs a result of several (justified at the time) decisions Google accumulated serious technical debt in how we use std::string. This became a blocking issue in our effort to open source Google’s common libraries. \n\nTo fix this we needed to break libstdc++ std::string ABI. This is the story of how we survived it kept Google still running. \n— \nGennadiy Rozental: Google, Software Engineer\n\nGennadiy Rozental is the long time contributor to Boost libraries and a developer and maintainer for Boost.Test library. After working on core infrastructure for financial markets data and quantitative research libraries he is now a member of the common libraries team in Google and is working on open source initiatives to make Google development environment accessible for everyone.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
