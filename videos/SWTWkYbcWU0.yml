title: '"Type Systems - The Good, Bad and Ugly" by Paul Snively and Amanda Laucher'
language: English
recordingDate: 1411224983
description: "Tired of esoteric conversations about theoretical type systems but not actually having any meaningful ways to compare? At Strange Loop 2012, Amanda Laucher and Paul Snively talked about Types vs. Tests: An Epic Battle? At the beginning, they put a stake in the ground: not all type systems are good. Some are better than others. In this presentation, Amanda and Paul will unpack that claim. They’ll start with an informal comparison of several type systems, move on to introduce a more formal framework for comparison, and round out the discussion with a look at pragmatic considerations that aren’t covered by the framework. They'll cover languages we all know and [ love | loathe ], some you may have heard of but never tried, and maybe a few you haven’t heard of yet. This presentation should give you the tools you need to at least have a meaningful conversation.\n\nPaul Snively\n@psnively\n\nPaul Snively was a Lisp programmer for two decades before finally growing up and using static types. He was the technical editor for ‘Beginning Scala’ and thankfully uses Scala on the job every day.\n\n\n\nAmanda Laucher\n@pandamonial\n\nAmanda Laucher (@pandamonial) has been working with technology her entire life. Some of her favorite childhood memories include working with punch cards alongside her grandmother or learning Morse code from her dad. Solving complex business problems with code is her passion, mostly using graph databases. When she isn’t busy building software to advance educational technology, or to help people find love, you can probably find her in a bar discussing intricacies of languages, development processes or American football."
