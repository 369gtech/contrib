On the other hand, serverless computing platforms such as AWS Lambda allow you to run highly scalable applications without provisioning or managing servers. The combination of columnar storage and serverless computing can drastically simplify many of the pain points related to big data analytics, data collection, and ETL orchestration, while at the same time reducing the total cost of ownership.\n\n \nAlex Casalboni \nFrom Amazon Web Services\nAlex is a Senior Technical Evangelist at Amazon Web Services, based in Italy.\n\nAlex is deeply passionate about web technologies and music. He has been building web products and helping other builders learn from his experience since 2011. His coding love spreads across the Python and the JavaScript communities, and he's been contributing to open-source projects such as the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM.\n\nHe co-organizes the serverless meetup in Milan, as well as ServerlessDays Milan (previously JeffConf).\n\nIn his free time, Alex loves snowboarding, jogging, traveling, and playing his saxophone."
