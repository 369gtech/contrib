description: "User Uptime in Practice\n\nAnika Mukherji, Pinterest\n\nAs SREs, ultimately user experience is our most important metric. At Pinterest, like many other companies, we were using success rate as a proxy for the quality of our service to our users. However, success rate is fraught with many issues when it comes to representing product quality, which made it difficult for us to understand, measure, and react to changes in \"Pinner\" experience.\n\nWe landed upon User Uptime as our solution. This is a \"time-based\" metric that presents many advantages over a \"count-based\" metric like success rate. During this talk, we will discuss how Pinterest went about implementing such a metric—in terms of technological stack and design decisions—and what we learned in the process, about both our product and our users.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
