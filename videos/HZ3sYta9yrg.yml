description: "We using an increasing amount of crypto in our code to protect our assets. However we can easily go wrong if we don't know how to use it correctly.\nIn this talk we will look at what can go wrong when crypto is used the wrong way. We will NOT dive into the algorithms themselves, but look at what the different primitives give us and what happens when our expectations are wrong."
