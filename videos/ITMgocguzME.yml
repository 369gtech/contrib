description: "Filmed at https://2017.dotjs.io on December 1st in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nCommercial airplanes continuously transmit data packages via radio while flying. The protocol is unencrypted and is what allows public flight tracking websites to operate.\n\nThomas demonstrates how a cheap $10 USB DVB-T/FM radio dongle off Amazon can be hacked to receive these signals live and directly in JavaScript."
