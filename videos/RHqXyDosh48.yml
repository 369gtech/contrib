description: "This keynote starts with first principles of why Blockchain has the potential to disrupt several industries, and how it's being adopted already by both global companies and startups. Software Developers are the driving force of this global technological shift, and ultimately the bottleneck that can prevent innovation to be built faster. During my talk I explain how Software Developers can leap into Blockchain development, by leveraging their existing experience and also by learning some foundational aspects of this new technology.\n\nThe speech took on 8th May 2019 on DevTrends Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n\n#blockchain #softwaredeveloper"
