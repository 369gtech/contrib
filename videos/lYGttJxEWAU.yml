recordingDate: 1493228851
description: "We would all love to be all Agile, all time and materials, all the time. \_But the reality is that many projects are fixed bids. \_Fixed bids come with one major flaw: \_it's difficult to accurately estimate a project based on an RFP. \_We will look at a case where client expectations and overall project budget were mismanaged, resulting in a failed project with an unsatisfied client. \_This project caused us to think about and revise our project process. \_\n\nWe came to the conclusion that we needed to implement project estimate revisions at two key points in our discovery and design phase, and improve client expectation management through increased transparency. \_These estimate revisions are coupled with thorough technical planning and provide several key deliverables for the client and tools for our internal team. \_With this new process in place, we have been able to improve our estimate accuracy rate to within 10% of total project hours. \_This has made for happy clients who get their MVP within budget and are informed and empowered as decision makers throughout the project process. \_\_\n\nTakeaways from this session for attendees:\n\nHow not to manage a fixed bid budget\nHow to implement a two-tiered process for greater estimation accuracy\nHow to deal with scope / budget incompatibility\nHow to empower your client to make prioritization decisions\nPitfalls to avoid with this process, learned over a year of implementation"
