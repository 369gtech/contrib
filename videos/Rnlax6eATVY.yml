description: "On GDC Podcast episode 16 we were thrilled to have Greg Kasavin, creative director at Supergiant Games, the studio behind awe-inspiring games like Bastion and most recently the instant-classic Hades.\n\nWe spoke with Kasavin spoke at length about his journey from a top-tier game journalist and critic to a game developer at one of today's most respected studios. We also talked roguelikes, narrative design, and how the \"dumb\" stuff in games are sometimes what makes them so memorable.\n\nSubscribe to the GDC Podcast on iTunes and Spotify\n\niTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/16-welcome-to-hades-roguelikes-narrative-design-supergiants/id1476405424?i=1000506832945\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/2StlF27xbzeudVq5HjzxTE?si=T44OsqNfR_OW8yKvqMashA\n\nJoin the GDC mailing list: http://www.gdconf.com/subscribe\n\nFollow GDC on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Official_GDC \n\nGDC talks cover a range of developmental topics including game design, programming, audio, visual arts, business management, production, online games, and much more.
