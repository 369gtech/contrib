description: "Virtual Reality (VR) is one of the most discussed emerging technologies of the past years. Especially in 2016, which marked the release of the first consumer VR headsets. Game developers all over the world are making awesome games for VR and companies are searching for cool new solutions using VR.\n\nThe most popular platform to build VR applications is Unity3D which sadly is based on .NET. As Java enthusiasts, we went on a challenging adventure to discover the possibilities of coding VR applications in Java.\n\nDuring this session we will dive into the cool world of VR and we will show the ups and downs of this adventure. We will give the attendees a good understanding on how VR works and how you should code for it. Then we will discuss if Java is a feasible platform for VR development. Whatever the outcome we aim to inspire the attendees to embark on a VR adventure of themselves and make awesome applications.\n\nAlexander Chatzizacharias \nAlexander is a 26-year old java developer at CGI. He is of Dutch/Greek nationality. Alexander has a bachelor in Game Development (University of applied sciences of Amsterdam) and a master in Game studies (University of Amsterdam). During his master Alexander developed a passion for gamification and new technologies. Combining the two in order to create new innovative solutions is one of his greatest hobbies. His biggest hobby (and this might come as a surprise) is gaming. From shooters to role playing games, he plays everything.\n\nErik Pronk \nErik is a 41-year old passionate software engineer that has been working in the ICT sector since 2001. During this period he has gained a lot of experience in a variety of technologies, roles, development environments and market segments."
