description: "This talk will provide a brief overview of NLP, and mainly focus on NLP for the Arabic language. The Arabic language has its own challenges due to its nature as it exhibits a phenomenon called diglossia, where speakers use more than one variety of a language. In particular, people use different versions of Arabic in different situations: Modern Standard Arabic (Fusha) and Arabic spoken dialects. Also, will discuss some computational tools and datasets used for NLP in general and Arabic NLP.\n\nResources:\nCode: https://github.com/sakhar/arabic-nlp-pydata\nSlides: https://t.co/SQ4uOudYx3?amp=1\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
