description: "Bay Area Vision Meeting (more info below)\r\nPerception for Robotics\r\nCaroline Pantofaru and Radu Rusu\r\nMarch 7, 2011\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPerception for robotics is growing as a field. What was once a specialized area utilizing expensive sensors and using situational information unavailable to more general computer vision problems, is merging into the mainstream. Cheap sensors such as the Kinect provide 3D data to the masses, video is readily available online, and cell phones and cameras with GPS provide situational awareness. Robotics problems are now more general issues. In this talk, we will discuss a variety of perception projects for indoor personal robots currently underway at Willow Garage, Inc."
