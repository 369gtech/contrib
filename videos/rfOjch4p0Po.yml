description: "A modular development style benefits every Java developer, whether your application is one JAR or one hundred JARs. This session will introduce the Java 9 module system that's been used to structure the JDK as dozens of reusable modules that strongly protect their internals. Then, the session will explain how you can create modules to enforce the structure inherent in your application. The session will prepare you for some of the pitfalls of modular development, notably the technical debt present in popular libraries that rely on JDK internals. Finally, the session will look at how tools are preparing for modules.\n\nAlex Buckley is the Specification Lead for the Java programming language and the Java Virtual Machine at Oracle. He holds a Ph.D. in Computing from Imperial College London."
