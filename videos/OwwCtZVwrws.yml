title: 'Simplified and Fast Fraud Detection With Just SQL'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502024411
description: "This session will demonstrate how using sql pattern matching techniques can speed up searching for fraudulent events within a dataset when compared to using other programming languages. As part of the presentation, live demos will be used to review a series of uses cases and provide conceptual simplified SQL to solve these business requirements. These examples are taken from real-life requirements from customers in the financial services, retail, life sciences and telecommunications industries, although the scenarios are also applicable across many other industries. A simple four step framework will be used to construct pattern matching queries. A live demonstration will show how easy it is to write and amend SQL-based pattern matching queries compared with other pattern matching languages.\n\nHermann Baer\nSenior Director Product Management, Server Technologies\nOracle"
