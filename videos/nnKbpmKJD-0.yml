description: "The ThinkerShield for Arduino makes it easy for anyone to get started with programming and controlling things with their computer in minutes! No need for any wiring or soldering or program knowledge. Even if you have never seen a computer program before, with the ThinkerShield you will be making things flash, buzz, beep and respond in no time! It has been designed over a 4 year period with multiple prototypes and is now going to be used in the NSW premier's code challenge and 1000's of units are in schools across every Australian state.\nThis talk will share the challenges of getting this to product form and why people should care about ThinkerShield.\n\nJames uses technology to create immersive experiences. He blurs the boundaries between gaming and learning and  builds applications and hardware using the most suitable platform for each solution.\n\nHe brings bespoke experiences of any scale from mobile applications to full exhibitions to life using bleeding edge technology. He augments existing ideas to go beyond the boundaries of science, art and engineering and provides guidance to projects to ensure the best outcomes.\n\nThe Mars Lab, for which he was the leading team member, won the ARNET award for innovation overall category. He has shipped multiple products for both education and entertainment for platforms ranging from mobile to new physical hardware. \n\nFor more information on YOW!
