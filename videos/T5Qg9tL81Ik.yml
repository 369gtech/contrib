description: "Oracle has announced the end of free public updates for Oracle Java 8, as well as new commercial licensing terms for Oracle Java 11+. This definitely changes what the industry is used to in terms of getting $free and free (as in use) in terms of using Oracle's Java. However, there are ways you can get OpenJDK/Java that is still $free and free (as in use) from Oracle as well as production-ready OpenJDK builds by other OpenJDK / Java providers such as AdoptOpenJDK, Amazon, Azul, BellSoft, IBM, jClarity, Red Hat and others.\n\nThe Diabolical Developer has masqueraded as an executive sitting on the Java Standards Body (JCP) as well as helping run the Adoption group in OpenJDK and the new AdoptOpenJDK project. He'll take you through the options with the unvarnished truth so you can make the most important strategic decision you'll ever make with Java for the next 5, 10 and 15 years."
