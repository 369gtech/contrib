description: "Mediocrity guaranteed. This sad tagline describes most of the processes we use today including typical agile process. It’s easy to see why. Software development’s an expensive risky business. To deal with the risk, the players involved adopt a client-vendor model where those in the client role give requirements and those in the vendor role estimate time and effort and agree to build what’s asked for. In this model we clearly separate responsibilities so that we know who’s accountable when things go wrong. Although we know things rarely go as planned, and innovative ideas rarely spring from such a relationship, we continue to work in processes where treating our coworkers as outsourced vendors is considered best practice and risking everything on the ideas of a select few isn’t regarded as risky.\n\nThis talk is about an alternative way of working.\n\nIn this talk Jeff explores companies beginning to adopt a style of working where everyone in the organization gets involved with identifying and solving problems. You’ll hear examples from real companies describing their practices for learning first-hand about customers and users, practices for collaboratively designing solutions for the problems found in the real world, and approaches to learning if what we created really benefited anyone. This new style of work is a process cocktail combining the best of agile development, lean software development and lean startup, user-centered design, and collaborative design thinking.\n\nThis style of work isn’t the traditional client-vendor model where knowing who’s to blame is the primary concern. It’s a co-making style of work where everyone brings their skills and experience to the table and together takes ownership for making great things.\n\nJeff makes use of over 20 years of product design and development experience to help companies create great products.\n\nJeff started in software development in the early 90s as a project leader and senior developer for a small software product company. There he learned that well written code, and fast delivery isn’t the secret to success, it’s just table stakes. It’s actually deep understanding of your customers and users coupled with a desire to create a product that’s really valuable to them that makes the biggest difference.\n\nIn 2000 Jeff worked as a product manager at one of the first companies adopting Extreme Programming. It was there he built a strong appreciation for the discipline that Agile thinking brings to software development and a deep concern for what seemed to be left out, specifically good product thinking. Since then Jeff has been an evangelist championing the inclusion of strong product design and user experience practice in Agile development. Today Jeff teaches and coaches a contemporary blend of practice that incorporates Lean and Lean Startup and Design Thinking all directed at helping organizations build products their customers love.\n\nJeff’s a Certified Scrum Trainer, and winner of the Agile Alliance’s 2007 Gordon Pask Award for contributions to Agile Development. Jeff is author of the O’Reilly book User Story Mapping which describes a simple holistic approach to using stories in Agile development without losing site of the big picture.
