description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nExploiting a Slightly Peculiar Volume Configuration with SIG-Honk - Ian Coldwater, Twilio; Brad Geesaman & Rory McCune, Aqua Security; Duffie Cooley, Isovalent\n\nWhen the hacker crew of geese collectively known as “SIG-Honk” read about a new CVE in the Kubernetes ecosystem affecting the runc project (CVE-2021-30465), they flew into action. With just a few details in the initial advisory notes as guidance, they were able to collaborate and generate a proof-of-concept exploit for Kubernetes, iterate and validate it against multiple types of clusters, and kick off a renewed coordinated disclosure process to help keep users safer. Join Ian Coldwater, Brad Geesaman, Rory McCune, and Duffie Cooley as we bring our expertise and experiences to share the details of our methodology, walk through our approach, and demonstrate the exploit and its effectiveness live on stage. Attendees will learn about the process of exploit development and disclosure, find out how to stay informed about vulnerabilities in open source dependencies that may affect the security of their clusters, and walk away with a new perspective on how to honk."
