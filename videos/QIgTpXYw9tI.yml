description: "Aurimas Adomavicius was born in Lithuania to a couple of parents that could not be more different from each other. Aurimas’ mother, a creative at heart, is a drawing and sculpture teacher that used to drag Aurimas along to drawing excursions with students twice his age. His father, a rocket scientist who still teaches atom energetics at Kaunas Technology University, assembled the first computer for Aurimas when he turned six. Aurimas and his partners founded Devbridge Group in 2008 based on the beliefs that software should go hand in hand with intuitive and elegant User Experience. In six years, Devbridge has grown to an engineering powerhouse with more than 100 employees between its three offices in Chicago, Kaunas, and Vilnius. The team produces more than 100,000 engineering hours annually, which are spent designing and developing innovative enterprise solutions for clients in manufacturing, healthcare, financial services and franchising. With over 80% annual growth, Devbridge Group has received recognition from myriad publications and associations during this time, such as the AVA Digital Awards, the Marcom Awards, The Webby Awards, IMA, the Inc. 5000 and AIGA.\n\nAgile for Fixed Bid Projects - It is Possible\n\nAgile project management is very common amongst internal teams that work on software products.
