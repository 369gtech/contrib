title: 'Konrad Kokosa — Mobius — writing your own .NET runtime running on .NET Core'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1613472295
description: 'NET application is "just" a piece of CIL bytecode to be executed by the NET runtime And NET runtime is "just" a program that can perform this task It happens that currently NET Framework/NET Core runtimes are written in C++ But what if we write NET runtime as… NET application? Is it possible at all? Does it sound like a kind of inception and infinite recursion? Konrad has decided to try this out and this is how the Mobius project has been coined Obviously, for a single person, it can be only a small vertical proof-of-concept to be written But he found it interesting to validate such an idea and find it small usages as well He''d like to share with you this mental experiment, that allows you to better understand deep NET runtime internals'
