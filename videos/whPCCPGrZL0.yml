recordingDate: 1566285632
description: "Massive datasets. Complex data pipelines. Machine learning. When faced with such a beast, how do you test it effectively? When your tests results are less \"pass\" and \"fail\", and more \"sort of\" and \"not really\", how do you automate testing?\n\nTrish Khoo draws upon her experience in testing complex data systems to demonstrate proven strategies for testing in this field. Her experience working on ultra-large-scale systems at Google in Mountain View, California shaped her technical approach to testing which she applies in her work as a consultant today.\n\nTrish Khoo is a software development consultant and international keynote speaker. She has over 20 years of experience in the software industry, specialising in software testing, infrastructure and automation. Her journey has taken her from Microsoft to Google, from London to San Francisco, and many places in between. Now she helps companies all over the world with their software needs from her home base of Brisbane, Australia. She also dedicates time towards fostering a strong local tech startup community and mentoring other technologists. When she’s not doing this, she’s working on her creative pursuits – artwork, singing and writing.\n \nLearn more about Trish at her website http://trishkhoo.com\n\nFor more on YOW!
