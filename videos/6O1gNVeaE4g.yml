From Foursquare to Farmville and from Nike to the Navy, game mechanics like points, badges, levels, challenges, rewards and leaderboards are being used in ever greater numbers. But what does this mean for \"traditional\" marketing & UI/UX and how do you leverage this trend in your engagement strategy? Moreover, how do we measure success, and why will every company have a Chief Engagement Officer in the next few years? Find out more in this in-depth discussion with Gamification Expert, Gabe Zichermann -- author of \"Game-Based Marketing\" and the Gamification.co blog, and Chair of the Gamification Summit.\r\n\r\nGABE ZICHERMANN is an author, highly rated public speaker and serial entrepreneur.
