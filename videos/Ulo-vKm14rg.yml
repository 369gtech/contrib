description: "A Google TechTalk, presented by Bin Yu, Geoffrey Hinton, Jack Gallant, Lenore Blum, Percy Liang, Rina Panigrahy, 2021/05/17\nABSTRACT: Panel discussion on the fundamental question of “Is there a mathematical model of the Mind?” (from the workshop on \"Conceptual Understanding of Deep Learning\" : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5DGBWjiULQ). We explore basic questions such as “Is there a provable algorithm that captures the essential capabilities of the mind?”, “How do we remember complex phenomena?”, “How is a knowledge graph created automatically?”, “How do we learn new concepts, function and action hierarchies over time?” and “Why do human decisions seem so interpretable?” (full list of questions at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tS-B2BTXixqucUPzLm5o6VnbvTY5EMbxzr_ox5RF3zQ)\n\nThe panelists: \nBin Yu - UC Berkeley\nGeoffrey Hinton - University of Toronto and Google\nJack Gallant - UC Berkeley\nLenore Blum - CMU/UC Berkeley\nPercy Liang - Stanford University \nRina Panigrahy - Google (moderator)"
