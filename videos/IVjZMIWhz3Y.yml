We also demonstrate use of APIs Explorer, Quickstart widget, client libraries and App Engine SDK tools that make application development easier.  This session demonstrated by Prashant Labhane is in Python and you can find the equivalent Java version at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVIIgcIqoPw by Sachin Kotwani.
