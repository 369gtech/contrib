description: "DevOps Adoption Patterns and Anti-Patterns\n\nGeoff Halprin, The SysAdmin Group\n\nEveryone is talking about DevOps. CIOs drop it casually into conversation as though they grok its true meaning, claim they are embracing it, and yet make none of the changes to the organization’s structure or culture that it requires. Enterprises continue to put their faith in ITIL and the silos of enterprise responsibility. The developers want Continuous Delivery but they don’t want the 2am calls. DevOps is being abused the same way Agile has been by the enterprise.\n\nIn this talk I will look at the enterprise setting, the challenges facing adoption, and how DevOps practices can be introduced. I will also describe seven adoption patterns and an anti-pattern.\n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
