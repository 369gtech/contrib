Before joining Pandora, Tom was the Vice President of Engineering at Kenamea, Inc. where he led the teams responsible for the design and development of an award-winning Internet-scale messaging system. Tom previously was the Technical Director for the successful video game series \"You Don't Know Jack.\"\n\nPast experience also includes engineering management positions at Berkeley Systems, Relevance Technologies, Documentum, Pets.com, and Kenamea. Tom began his career at Apple Computer developing user interface elements for the Mac OS. Tom holds three U.S. patents and a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan.\n\nTom holds both technology and music close to his heart. His personal music collection includes more than 1000 CDs -- many from artists that others on the Pandora team have never heard of. He likes to say the only instrument he plays well is his stereo."
