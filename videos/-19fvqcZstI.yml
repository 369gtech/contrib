title: '#FlinkForward SF 2017: Wang & Wang - Runtime Improvements in Blink for Large Scale Streaming...'
recordingDate: 1492195126
description: "In 2016, we introduced Alibaba’s compute engine Blink which was based on our private branch of flink. It enalbed many large scale applications in Alibaba’s core business, such as search, recommendation and ads. With the deep and close colaboration with the flink community, we are finally close to contribute our improvements back to the flink community. In this talk, we will present our key contributions to flink runtime recently, such as the new YARN cluster mode for Flip-6, fine-grained failover for Flip-1, async i/o for Flip-12, incremental checkpoint, and the further improvements plan from Alibaba in the near future. Moreover, we will show some production use cases to illustrate how flink works in Alibaba’s large scale online applications, which includes real-time ETL as well as online machine learning. This talk is presented by Alibaba.\n\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://BashFilms.com"
