recordingDate: 1567203052
description: "ETS provides a simple, familiar, and reusable way to query cached data for your application outside of functional primitives.\n\nThis talk will cover:\n\nStoring shared state in ETS\nIntegrating ETS and Ecto\nWhen to consider this decision\nOperational concerns outside code for both of these use cases.\nThe audience should leave with knowledge of this ETS pattern and a stronger awareness that queryable caching is possible outside of using ElasticSearch.\n\nA Google search also says a benchmark for this use case does not exist."
