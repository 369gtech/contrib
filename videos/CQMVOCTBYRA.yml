description: "Machine learning and artificial intelligence are becoming wide-spread and productionalized - you no longer need a mathematics PhD and months of software development time to implement and use a machine learning algorithm. You can just call an API and you get the answer! You can treat them completely as black boxes and use them directly in your applications! But beware - all the algorithms have some cases when they fail to deliver what you're expecting.\n\nThis talk is packed with live demos that show failure cases of popular algorithms, from linear regression to cutting-edge deep learning. We will look at practical examples, use standard algorithms without tuning and observe when they fail and why. You will learn that although you can treat the algorithms as black boxes, they can fail silently and what to do about it.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
