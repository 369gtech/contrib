The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nEnforcing Service Mesh Structure using OPA Gatekeeper - Sandeep Parikh, Google  \n\nOrganizations need the ability to apply rules to their workloads and services, at scale and distinct from the development of those services. Policies and policy enablement provide those governance capabilities with declarative approaches. OPA Gatekeeper integrates with Kubernetes and is able to provide the right guardrails to enforce structure and keep your deployments running smoothly. In this session we'll talk about policy management and how OPA Gatekeeper can help manage policies at scale. We'll walkthrough the high-level architecture of Gatekeeper along with applied examples and demonstrate how it can be used to manage security and traffic management mechanisms found in service mesh deployments. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uac5"
