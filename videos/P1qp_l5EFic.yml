Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include\n\nSubsecond startup time\nSmall processes that can run in as little as 10 MB of JVM heap\nNo runtime reflection\nDependency injection and AOP • Cloud Native\nGraeme will also demonstrate how you can take your Microservices to the next level by using Micronaut's Ahead of Time Compilation (AOT) support and Oracle's GraalVM to achieve instant startup and ultra-low memory footprint.\n\nGraeme Rocher \nFrom objectcomputing\nGraeme Rocher, co-founder of the Grails and Micronaut frameworks and co-author of The Definitive Guide to Grails, serves as Technical Lead for the OCI Grails & Micronaut team.\n\nGraeme has worked in the software development field for more than 20 years and has expertise in Grails, Groovy, Web Development, Dynamic Languages, and the JVM."
