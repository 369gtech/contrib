description: "David Burge described the internet as a worldwide cat picture distribution system. But historically humans have had to do all the work of taking those pictures ahead of time! I wanted to empower my three cats and one dog to take their own pictures and send them to me, but how do you design for cats and dogs? \n\nI will describe how I built a home photo booth from a Raspberry Pi, various electronic components, the Twilio API, and a ton of cat treats to allow my pets to send me selfies. \n\nIn a direct challenge to the demo gods, this talk will end with an attempt at a live text exchange with my pets from the stage!\n\nEVENT:\n\n!!Con 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nJoel Potischman\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRFQV4O0c48"
