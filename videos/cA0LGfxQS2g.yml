title: 'DEF CON 27 Conference - Jayson Grace - MOSE Using Configuration Management for Evil'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573862460
description: "Configuration Management (CM) tools are used to provision systems in a uniform manner. CM servers are prime targets for exploitation because they are connected with key machines. The tools themselves are powerful from a security standpoint: they allow an attacker to run commands on any and every connected system. Unfortunately, many security professionals do not have CM experience, which prevents them from using these tools effectively. MOSE empowers the user to weaponize an organizationâ€™s CM tools without having to worry about implementation-specific details.\n\nMOSE first creates a binary based on user input. Once transferred to the CM server and run, this binary dynamically generates code that carries out the desired malicious behavior on specified systems. This behavior can include running arbitrary system commands, creating or deleting files, and introducing backdoors. MOSE puts the generated code in the proper place so that all targeted systems will run it on their next check-in with the server, removing the need for the user to integrate it manually.\n\nCM tools are a powerful resource, but they have a barrier to entry. MOSE aims to remove this barrier and make post exploitation more approachable by providing a tool to translate the attacker's desired task into commands executable by the CM infrastructure.\n\nJayson Grace\nJayson Grace is a Penetration Tester on the Product Security Team at Splunk. Previously he founded and led the Corporate Red Team at Sandia National Laboratories. He holds a BS in Computer Science from the University of New Mexico, which gave him some great knowledge and also made him fatter and added a bunch of grey hairs. He has also previously worked as a tool developer, system administrator, and DevOps engineer. Jayson is passionate about empowering engineers to create secure applications, as well as coming up with novel automation methods to break things.\n\nTwitter: @Jayson_Grace\nWebsite: https://techvomit.net"
