We talk about mentoring, networking, feedback, and how to reach out to your manager and how to create a plan for advancing from junior to senior. We also talk how the bigger salary is nice, but there are also some ugly about advancing to senior developer and how to find out what that is. \n\n💛Megan Vallee (expert guest)\nmvallee@beseen.com\n\n💛Ingrid Kocjan (expert guest)\ningrid@beseen.com\n\n💛 Follow on Twitch and support by becoming a Subscriber\nWe record the show live Mondays 7 AM PT\nhttps://twitch.tv/funfunfunction\n\n💛 Fun Fun Forum\nPrivate discussion forum with other viewers in between shows. https://www.funfunforum.com.

Most coding content out there focus on step-by-step tutorials. We think tutorials are too far removed from what everyday development is like. Instead, FFF has created a completely new learning environment where we grow from failure, by solving problems while intensively interacting with a live audience. \n\nTutorials try to solve a problem. Failing Together makes you grow as a developer and coworker.\n\n📹 Each show is recorded live on Twitch in a 2-hour livestream on Mondays. The host, assisted by the audience, is tasked to complete a programming challenge by an expert guest. Like in the real world, we often fail, and learn from it. This, of course, reflects what the audience identifies with, and is one of the most praised aspects of the show. \n\n⏯ On Fridays, an edited version of the show is adapted for and published on YouTube. \n\nContent Topics revolve around: JavaScript, Functional Programming, Software Architecture, Quality Processes, Developer Career and Health, Team Collaboration, Software Development, Project Management"
