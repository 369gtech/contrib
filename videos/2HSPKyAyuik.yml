Ближайшая конференция — DotNext\_2020 Piter\n15-18 июня, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://bit.ly/dotnext2020piter\n\n. The NET community was closed together with the framework itself for many, many years. Recently the things has changed. The compiler, runtime any many other great tools are open source now. Have you ever thought about contributing? You want to start, but not sure how? This talk will be a story about my contributions to BenchmarkDotNet, Core CLR and corefxlab. What have I learned? What have I gained? Why should you contribute to OSS? How to start? What to avoid? What to focus on? How to challenge yourself? How can it help you to develop your skills as a developer? Can you get a public recognition? Will it help you to get a better job? This talk will give a story, a set of best practices and a lot of real life examples."
