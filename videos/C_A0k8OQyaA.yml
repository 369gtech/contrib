description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSecurity Best Practices for AI on Kubernetes - Guy Salton, Run:AI\n\nData Scientists and MLOps engineers are embracing containers and Kubernetes for building, debugging, training and deploying deep learning models. There are many advantages for using Kubernetes for AI workloads, but is it secure? In this talk, we will present the security concerns for AI workloads running on Kubernetes and how to mitigate them: Which user is used inside the container? Can the Data Scientist use privileged escalation from his container and access the host filesystem? How to allow Data Scientists to install python packages in a secure manner? Can a Data Scientist have access other researchers code and data from his container? Guy Salton, Solution Engineering Lead at Run:AI, will cover all the concerns above, and provide security best practices to MLOps engineers, to make the everyday work of Data Scientists both secure and productive."
