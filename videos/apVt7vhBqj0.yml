description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary, 25 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nCaja is a type of \"JavaScript sanitizer\" that is being tightly integrated with OpenSocial to reduce the chance of Gadgets performing malicious actions like phishing the users or interfering with other gadgets. MySpace plans to REQUIRE gadgets to be caja-safe before they can run on their platform. For developers, the process of making their gadgets caja-safe can require changing some of their coding techniques, especially in terms of interaction with the DOM. Mike Samuel of the Caja team will describe Caja in more detail, as well as how developers can \"cajole\" their gadgets to be caja-safe.\n\nSpeaker: Michael Samuel"
