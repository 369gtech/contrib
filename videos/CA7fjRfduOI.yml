description: "We are excited to share TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg), a tool that makes debugging of machine learning models (ML) in TensorFlow easier. In this video, we are demonstrating the command-line interface (CLI) of TensorFlow Debugger, which provides easy access to the structure and intermediate states of a running TensorFlow graph. \n\nHere, we're showing sample code from one of our tutorials, which you can find at https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/debugger\n\nTo report bugs, please open issues on TensorFlowâ€™s GitHub Issues Page https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues\n\nFor general usage help, please post questions on StackOverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel at http://goo.gl/mQyv5"
