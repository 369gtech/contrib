title: '#8 e-Meetup | Jimmy Bogard - Distributed Tracing Made Easy with .NET Core and OpenTelemetry'
language: English
recordingDate: 1589888324
description: "When something goes wrong in a single application, we get a nice stack trace. In a distributed system, we get almost nothing! \n\nIn this talk, we'll look at the new diagnostics capabilities in .NET Core 3, and how we can leverage them to expose and propagate tracing data. We'll also look at the OpenTelemetry project, an effort to standardize tracing APIs and SDKs. Finally, we'll extend OpenTelementry so that our infrastructure can target any distributed tracing product, such as Jaeger, Zipkin, Application Insights, and more."
