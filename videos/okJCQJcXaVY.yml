description: "From Monitoring to Feedback: The Evolution of Operational Metrics (into What They Always Should Have Been in the First Place)\n\nDavid Josephsen, Librato\n\nMonitoring is not a ritual; it is not backups or DR, or keeping our hands and arms in the vehicle at all times. It is not a check-box ceremony we perform to stave off some faceless danger than no one can quite articulate.\n\nMonitoring is part of your engineering process; Every engineer should own it. Every engineer should rely on it. It exists to provide operational telemetry about how the things you care about -- the things we all care about -- are working right now in the real world.\n\nThis talk is about how we at Librato have transformed monitoring from an operations burden to an engineering tool that helps us reason about, build, and fix our services-based infrastructure, and about how you can do the same. \n\nView the full LISA15 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program"
