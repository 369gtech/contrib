title: 'Vehicle Routing Problem: how to solve it in Java? (Stanislav Kyfenko, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1468313420
description: "Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is one of the most challenging combinatorial optimization tasks, a central problem in the areas of transportation, distribution and logistics. Decreasing transport costs can be achieved through better resources (vehicles) utilization.\n\nVRP is to design route for N vehicles with M depots and P customers in order to meet the given constraints (less time, less fuel, less trucks, less workers). Looks pretty complicated, doesnâ€™t it?\n\nWe will talk about VRP theory, real use cases, Java frameworks, which help to solve it, and best practices. This speech will show us how limited Google Maps Directions API is and how OptaPlanner and other VRP-solvers can fill this gap out. We will go through sample application and analyze how efficient it is."
