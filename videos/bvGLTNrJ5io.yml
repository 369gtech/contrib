description: "Join us for our next conference: https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\nWhether you’re a Tech Lead, Engineering Manager, or Project Manager for an engineering team, you probably weren’t handed a leadership instruction manual when you were given your first team to lead. Even experienced technical leaders usually operate from a set of instincts and the hard lessons learned from painful mistakes. However, leadership is a skill that you can learn and maintain if you know where to look. You don't have to be born a leader, but you do need a set of principles to guide the leader within you. This session will teach you how to apply the principles in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development to becoming a better technical leader.\n\nOutline\n\n• Remembering the Revolution\n• Individuals and Interactions: Beyond Gantt Charts, Org Charts, and Toys\n• Working Software: Achieving Outcomes\n• Customer Collaboration: Kill the Lawyers\n• Responding to Change: Leading through Chaos\n\nAbout Anjuan Simmons\n\nAnjuan Simmons is a technologist with a successful track record of delivering technology solutions from the user interface to the database.
