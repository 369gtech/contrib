title: 'Inserting privacy controls and due process into semi-autonomous algorithms - Matthew Carroll'
recordingDate: 1480519037
description: 'Algorithms influence our everyday decision making, and we crave greater precision of AI-driven results. As a result, we are willing to give up our private data for better results, allowing data scientists to scour our personal data to enhance the precision of their algorithms. But at what point does innovation turn into invasion? Matthew Carroll discusses how regulators and consumers can take back control by inserting legal checks and balances into the data science process.'
