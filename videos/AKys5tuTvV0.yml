description: "Take Me Down to the Paradise City Where the Metric Is Green and Traces Are Pretty\n\nRicardo Ferreira, Elastic\n\nObservability is a software discipline that goes back to when virtually any problem could be solved by tailing web server logs. But the world has changed, and systems these days are comprised of different services running in their own stacks who cooperatively build up what we understand as the end-to-end architecture. Thus, observability had to evolve as well.\n\nToday we have OpenTelemetryâ€”an observability framework for cloud-native software. OpenTelemetry provides the tools, APIs, and SDKs to create a reusable, robust, and non-vendor-driven observability strategy. But the reality is that most developers are still confused about the lines that separate OpenTelemetry from the past and which parts of the framework are stable enough to be used in production. This talk will explain how OpenTelemetry works and provide examples in Java and Go to illustrate the APIs you can use to produce traces and metrics.\n\nView the full SREcon21 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon21/program"
