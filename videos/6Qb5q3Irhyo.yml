title: '🚀 DevTernity 2015: Speed is Key: Elasticsearch under the Hood by Alexander Reelsen'
language: English
recordingDate: 1450702463
description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nThis talk moves beyond the standard introduction into Elasticsearch and focuses on how Elasticsearch tries to fulfill its near-realtime contract. Specifically, I'll show how Elasticsearch manages to be incredibly fast while handling huge amounts of data. After a quick introduction, we will walk through several search features and how the user can get the most out of Elasticsearch. This talk will go under the hood exploring features like search, aggregations, highlighting, (non-)use of probabilistic data structures and more."
