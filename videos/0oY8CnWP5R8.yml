description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotjs.io on December 5-6, 2019 in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nDates and times are one of the most common problems programmers encounter - so why is it that we so often get this space wrong?\n\nMaggie discusses where our current Date goes bad, better ways to model the date and time space in our code, and how the Temporal proposal making its way through TC39 helps us write correct code for every person in every time zone."
