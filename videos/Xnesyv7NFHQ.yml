description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nWe'll take a close look at Scala 2.12's features as well as what lies ahead in the next few years for the Scala 2.x series. I'll also take a step back and muse about what the essence of Scala is to me, why I still love working on the compiler 10 years later, and why I believe it's the best choice for statically typed functional programming on the JVM (and JS, and maybe native? :-))."
