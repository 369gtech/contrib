title: 'A Penny for Every Object - Mads Torgesen'
recordingDate: 1531824192
description: "If you missed the opening keynote, do not despair. Here it is again!\n\nObject-oriented programming started half a century ago right here in Oslo, when Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard created Simula 67, the world’s first object-oriented programming language. Looking back, it was remarkably fully formed. While we’ve learned a lot since then, we’ve also forgotten a lot, and many great ideas never found their way into the mainstream.\nBased on his own journey through the Scandinavian and American object-oriented landscapes, Mads checks in with the ideas from back then, and what they may mean to us now. Also, he reveals what was written on the lost table cloth from Casablanca."
