title: 'microXchg 2016 - Rick Buskens : Microservice Deployment Pipelines With Spinnaker'
language: English
recordingDate: 1454956079
description: "\"A core aspect of a microservice architecture is individual deployability of services. Thus, orchestrating the roll out of these services should be as easy as possible. Historically Netflix has rolled out deployments using an open-source tool called Asgard. Spinnaker – the successor of Asgard and an open-source project as well – is a complete reimplementation of its predecessor and heavily improved.\nThe talk introduces Spinnaker, the challenges it's trying to solve as well as the core concepts it's talking about. We then discuss and demo setting up a build pipeline as well as the various options in deployment targets, rollout strategies etc.\""
