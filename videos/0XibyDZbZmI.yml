description: "by Jan Grewe\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/AW1.126/open_research_oss_tools_neuro.webm\n\nThe reproducibility crisis has shocked the scientific\ncommunity. Different papers describe this issue and the scientific\ncommunity has taken steps to improve on it. For example, several\ninitiatives have been founded to foster openness and standardisation\nin different scientific communities (e.g. the INCF[1] for the\nneurosciences). Journals encourage sharing of the data underlying\nthe presented results, some even make it a requirement.\n\n\nWhat is the role of open source solutions in this respect? Where are the problems with\nopen source projects in (neuro-)sciences?\n\n\nIn this presentation I will address these questions at the example\nof the entirely open-source based workflow in our laboratory[2] and\nour efforts in developing generic solutions for storing metadata[3]\nas well as unifying data and metadata storage[4] that we take together\nwith the German Neuroinformatics Node (G-Node[5]).\n\n\n[1] https://incf.org\n[2] https://github.com/bendalab\n[3] https://github.com/g-node/python-odml\n[4] https://github.com/g-node/nix\n[5] https://g-node.org\n\nRoom: AW1.126\nScheduled start: 2020-02-01 09:30:00"
