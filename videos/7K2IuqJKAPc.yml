description: "Ближайшая конференция — DotNext 2020 Moscow\n2-5 декабря, Online\nПодробности и билеты: https://dotnext-moscow.ru/\n\n. A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the basis of modern system authentication; X.509 certificates are at the core of modern cryptography. Building your own PKI is not for the faint of heart, so we usually buy our certificates from an external Certificate Authority or operate a 3rd-party off-the-shelf PKI. But what can you do if you need to issue your certificates while keeping your costs low? What if, for example, you're in the business of manufacturing millions of IoT devices and you need to issue a certificate to each one of them? And to top it off — you want to do it in .NET?\n\nJoin Eran in this developer-focused session, as we build a Serverless PKI system in .NET on top of Azure Functions & Azure Key Vault and learn all about Key Vault's & .NET's capabilities in regards to X.509 certificates along the way."
