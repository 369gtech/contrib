description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nCompile-time constraints will likely soon become part of our routine C++ programming vocabulary. Why? Such constraints are induced by new core language features (requires-clauses and requires-expressions) that are on the horizon for C++. What are these all about? \n\nAlmost every function imposes requirements on its users; violating those requirements typically leads to incorrect programs. Historically, such requirements had to be expressed in comments or other documentation, as there was little machinery to express them in code. Soon we will be able to express more requirements in code, thus allowing compilers to detect and address more violations. \n\nThis talk aims to prepare both new and veteran C++ programmers with the necessary background, tutorial information, and advice to exploit this powerful new supplement to function declarations. A case study, illustrating an unexpected gotcha, will conclude the presentation.\n— \nWalter E. Brown: retired\n\nWith broad experience in industry, academia, consulting, and research, Dr. Walter E. Brown has been a C++ programmer for over thirty-five years, joining the C++ standards effort in 2000. Among numerous other contributions, he is responsible for introducing such now-standard C++ library features as cbegin/cend, common_type, gcd, and void_t, as well as headers ＜ random ＞ and cend, common_type, gcd, and void_t, as well as headers  ＜ ratio＞. He has also significantly impacted such core language features as alias templates, contextual conversions, variable templates, and static_assert. He conceived and served as project editor for the International Standard on Special Mathematical Functions in C++, now part of the forthcoming C++17.\n\nWhen not playing with his grandchildren, Dr. Brown is an Emeritus participant in the C++ standards process, with several more core and library proposals under consideration.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
