description: "http://strataconf.com/strataeu2013/public/schedule/detail/33000\n\nBig data has proved it's worth in a number of industries, but it's not the size or the storage that is making the difference. The organisations that are delivering most value are the ones that have realised the need to drive analytics into the heart of their decision making process. In this presentation Duncan Ross will explore why you should build analytics into your infrastructure and show how big data is turning into data science.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Teradata"
