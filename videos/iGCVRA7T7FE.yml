title: 'How Many Lives Can You Save? -- Taking Charity Seriously'
recordingDate: 1365403736
description: "Google Tech Talk\nMarch 25, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by Toby Ord\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPeople admire doctors and rescue workers and marvel at the possibility of saving someone's life -- something that few of us would ever achieve. And yet at the same time, we routinely hear that for a small sum of money we could save someone's life in a developing country and this scarcely impacts our behaviour. There is an important disconnect between these two attitudes and it has serious moral implications. I will speak about the evidence which shows that we really can make a tremendous difference by giving, and then explore the moral case for giving much more than we typically do. I will then look at the great disparity in effectiveness between different charities and show how choosing *where* to give can be even more important than the decision to give in the first place."
