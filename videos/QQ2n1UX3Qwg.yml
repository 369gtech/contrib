There are too many nodes to communicate with and many algorithms that solve the problem tend to grow linearly with the number of nodes. The underlying network is a problem too, we can’t rely on hardware solutions as they wouldn’t be available in the cloud (e.g. Multicast). It’s also really complex to maintain an updated graph of nodes and even to store the graph itself, in large systems.\n\nMany distributed systems nowadays rely on Gossip protocols to share the state of the system among the nodes because they avoid these problems.\n\nA Gossip protocol is a communication protocol, a way of multicasting messages inspired by epidemics, human gossip, and social networks.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/felix-lopez/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - FELIX LOPEZ\nResearch Master\n\nFélix López is Engineering Manager at Gocardless, During his career, he has worked on web development, video games, distributed systems and applications for the currency exchange market. He holds a Research Master in Intelligent Systems (including neural networks, speech processing, data mining, etc.). He is interested in Distributed Systems and Machine Learning.\n\nMore on Felix Lopez: http://codesync.global/speaker/felix-lopez/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
