description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V  2020 - codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nA Beginner's Guide to TLA+ Exploring State Machines & Proving Correctness | Jeff Weiss - Senior Software Engineer at Enbala Power Networks\n\nABSTRACT\nTALK LEVEL: BEGINNER / INTERMEDIATE / ADVANCED\nThis talk introduces TLA+ by taking a small package from hex, examining its properties, modeling its behaviour as a state machine, creating TLA+ correctness and liveness specifications for it, and then using the TLA+ model checker to prove correctness. No prior exposure to formal methods like TLA+ or PlusCalc are necessary. A passing familiarity with state machines is recommended, but not required.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nIntroduce TLA+ and its value\nIllustrate conversion of a state machine to a TLA+ specification\nBuilding and checking correctness and liveness models of that TLA+ specification\nTARGET AUDIENCE\nDevelopers interested in adding more rigour to their problem solving and more quickly surfacing design errors.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\n  LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/27159258\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
