description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nOperating Enterprise Grade Kubernetes Clusters at Salesforce on Bare Metal - Anubhav Dhoot & Mayank Kumar, Salesforce \n\nMany enterprises today don’t have the luxury of public cloud managed offerings, or VM’s in their private data centers. In the absence of these, it’s challenging to operate enterprise grade Kubernetes clusters and manage it seamlessly.  We will talk about specific challenges in bringing up a highly available kubernetes cluster on bare metal, securing it, upgrading it, monitoring it 24/7, and doing all of that using Puppet, while maintaining SLA for our customers.  We will cover a lot of lessons learnt in managing a fleet of 2600+ hosts across 20 + data centers over the last 4 years, including battle stories like dangers of etcd initial-cluster-state config, hairpin networking issues, and setting up service accounts with key rotation.  While we are well on the path to using managed K8s offerings in Public Cloud, this will be a cautionary tale for teams managing their own k8s clusters.\n\nhttps://sched.co/bGGS"
