description: "The war against bugs is never-ending.\n\nIn development, we have our IDE and debugger, and we can find and fix bugs quickly. But in production, we typically only have log files to rely on, incomplete ones at that. This causes us great difficulties in identifying problems or even reproducing them.\n\nAs a consequence, we spend a lot of time on production problems, which in turn costs the company regarding money and reputation. There must be a better way?\n\nWe will explain what hope there is, and provide advice on how to get the right exception logging strategy into your project and Software Development Life Cycle today."
