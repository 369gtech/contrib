description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nJava and the JVM play a critical role in the running of Ocado’s automated warehouses. During this talk, we will take a look at the role Java has to play in the orchestration of huge robot swarms within our warehouses, and show how we can achieve superior efficiencies of scale.\n\nWe’ll explore in detail some of the tools and techniques employed to develop our Java based control systems, whilst also considering the benefits and challenges the use of Java has presented. This will include:\n\nThe use of simulation to model the physical world with Java\nOur focus on determinism and places within the Java language that do not provide deterministic behaviour\nExamples of where we have used profiling and micro-benchmarking to identify algorithms and data-structures to be optimised\nGC selection, tuning and analysis\nAn example of Java and C interoperability to unlock fast and comprehensive test coverage\nThe aim is that by the end of this talk, you’ll have a new appreciation of the versatility of Java and what is possible with the language."
