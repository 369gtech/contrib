description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC. \nSpeaker: Rossen Stoyanchev\nFollowing on Juergen's talk on the upcoming Spring 3.2 release, this presentation will focus on what's new specifically in the area of Spring MVC. The presentation will explain all noteworthy features and, as is usual with every new release, there will be a lot to discuss including Servlet-based async request support, content negotiation enhancements, REST error handling, @MVC test support, and much more. \n\nThe talk does not provide an overview of Spring MVC but rather assumes a level of experience and focuses on covering what's new."
