title: 'Harmful GOTOs, Premature Optimizations, Programming Myths - the Roots ofAll Evil by Alvaro Videla'
recordingDate: 1445855408
description: 'Over the years our industry has accumulated folklore that shapes what we are as an industry. We repeat maxims like "Premature optimisation is the root of all evil" but perhaps ignoring the context on which that sentence was said. This ignorance has lead us to creating myths that sometimes do more harm than good. In this talk I will review some of those myths, see their origin and at the same time make a historical review of what was going on in our industry in the ''70s, when those myths appeared. As the old saying goes: _Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'
