description: "We’re so pleased to announce that we’ve teamed up with Dave Farley, author of “Continuous Delivery” and frequent GOTO Conferences speaker, for a monthly video series featuring ideas about continuous delivery, DevOps, test-driven development, BDD, software engineering and software development in general. \n\nFind plenty more from Dave on his Continuous Delivery YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfqyGl3nq_V0bo64CjZh8g\n\nDave Farley - Continuous Delivery & DevOps Pioneer, Award-winning Author, Founder & Director of Continuous Delivery Ltd.\n\nABSTRACT\nReactive Systems use a high-performance software architecture. They are resilient under stress, and their reactive design allows them to scale elastically to meet demand. The reactive design approach allows the creation of more complex, more flexible systems and forms the basis for some of the highest performance, and most robust, systems in the world.\n\nIn this episode Dave Farley, expert in software engineering, author of \"Continuous Delivery\" and one of the authors of the Reactive Manifesto, which describes these kind of systems, marks the event of the manifesto achieving 30,000 signatories to describe these systems, how they work and how to create real applications from them. Dave describes the use of Asynchronous messaging as the foundation of this approach and how a simple system built this way would be be fast, responsive, resilient even in the face of meteorite strikes.\n\nCD TRAINING COURSES\nIf you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses\nhttps://bit.ly/DFTraining \n\nDAVE'S NEW BOOK\nYou can grab Dave Farley's new book 'Continuous Delivery Pipelines' here:\nhttps://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOxDaveFarley #Reactive #ReactiveManifesto #ReactiveSystem #DaveFarley #SoftwareArchitecture #GOTO #GOTOcon #ContinuousIntegration #BDD #ContinuousDelivery #DevOps #Testing\n\nDAVE'S LINKS\nhttps://www.continuous-delivery.co.uk\nhttps://twitter.com/davefarley77\nhttp://www.davefarley.net\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
