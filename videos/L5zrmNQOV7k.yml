description: "Consistency is important in any web application as it allows the user to easily navigate and have a better experience. We can ensure consistency by utilizing base templates. We'll see how to create the base, and explore some of the directives we can use in the Django templating engine to display data dynamically. Weâ€™ll also add in content blocks, and see how we can override them in child pages.\n\nUseful Links:\nhttps://aka.ms/CreateWebsitesWithDjango\nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=batisteo.vscode-django\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/beginners-django"
