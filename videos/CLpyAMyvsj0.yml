Whether you are working in FinServ, a vendor or just interested in learning more about how financial institutions approach cloud native, come join us to find out more about the FSUG, what our goals are and how we plan to achieve them. Find out about the often unique challenges financial services organizations face in the cloud native space and how we are beginning to collaborate with the broader community including open source projects, vendors and our peers. We want to help solve the shared technology problems of financial services. FinServ has a reputation of not being open in the tech community. We hope through this introduction and the broader work of the FSUG to change that."
