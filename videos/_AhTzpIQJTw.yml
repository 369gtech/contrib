description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nBuilding modern web application, also known as Progressive Web Apps (PWA), depends a lot on tooling and languages built for and around JavaScript, and in many cases TypeScript. But what if you want to use Kotlin instead?\n\nIn this session, we will introduce how to use Kotlin and its support for JavaScript to Progressive Web Apps. You'll learn about Kotlin/JS, as well as how to use it with frameworks like React, Vue.js or LitElement. \n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nErik was raised in the dark woods of Sweden, where the was nothing to do but to learn how to write code for PCs. After many years of suffering through experiences of early C++, Visual basic, Delphi, and every version of Java and C#, he has now found Kotlin and feel comfortable that the future for software is bright again."
