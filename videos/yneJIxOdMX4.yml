description: "It's tough to write a machine learning algorithm that works well. Overfitting, noisy data, a problem that's too general - these problems plague the programmers who apply these algorithms to financial modeling and image labeling. But mistakes can also be fun. At her humor blog AIweirdness.com, Janelle Shane posts examples of machine learning algorithms going terribly, hilariously wrong. Here, she talks about some common machine learning mistakes - and how to use them deliberately.\n\nSpeaker: Janelle Shane"
