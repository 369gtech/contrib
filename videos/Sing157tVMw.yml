description: "Before working in tech, Carolyn studied journalism. And while she was in that field, there was always an underlying sense of competition, particularly among women. However, tech was different. Throughout her transition from journalist to developer, many people came into Carolyn’s life who were genuinely invested in my success. But she didn’t know how to deal with it because she had never encountered it before. In her mind, you either had to push yourself forward or support others - doing both seemed impossible.\n\nWithout the community, Carolyn would have never learned that investing in others was the best way to invest in herself. Or that those people who she initially saw as “competition” would become some of my most meaningful collaborators.\n\nIn this story, she will touch the concept of Shine Theory (https://www.shinetheory.com/) and give examples from my time in the Berlin community. \n\nhttps://2019.jsconf.eu/community-lounge/"
