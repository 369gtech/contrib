title: 'Technical Coaching with the Samman method by Emily Bache'
recordingDate: 1621186930
description: "My focus as a coach is specifically on technical practices and how people write code. In a modern software development organization with ambitions to be Agile, embrace Continuous Delivery and do DevOps, it actually matters quite a lot how developers write code. For frequent high quality deployments with short lead times you need great automated tests and a constant stream of small code changes all integrating smoothly. Developers don’t necessarily know how to achieve that if they’ve previously only worked in a waterfall environment.\n\nOver the years I’ve tried several approaches to help developers to learn practices like Test-Driven Development. This talk is about the best way I have found so far. I use ‘ensemble working’, a collaboration technique also known as ‘mob programming’, where the whole team works together in their production code. I also hold short ‘learning hour’ practice sessions. Those are the two main elements of the “Samman” coaching method. It leads to very positive effects on team and the way they behave in their production code afterwards.\n\nEmily Bache, ProAgile\n\nPresented at Jfokus conference 9th February 2021.\nhttps://www.jfokus.se"
