title: 'Building Brains to Understand the World''s Data'

description: "Google Tech Talk\nFebruary 12, 2013\n(more info below)\nPresented by Jeff Hawkins.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe neocortex works on principles that are fundamentally different than traditional computers.  In this talk I will describe recent advances in understanding the neocortex and how we are applying them to model millions of high velocity data streams.\nThe talk will start with a description of sparse distributed representations, which are the fundamental units of information in brains.  I will then discuss how these representations are learned and how the brain processes them to build predictive models from sensory data.  Numenta has built a product called Grok that emulates these capabilities of the neocortex.  Grok is being used to understand high velocity machine generated data in many different domains.  I will give a brief introduction to Grok and speculate on the future of machine intelligence."
