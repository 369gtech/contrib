description: "London Erlang User Group Slides for this talk can be found here: http://www.meetup.com/erlangusergroup/files/\n\nJanuary 30 \n\"Big Data\" seems to be an unavoidable business buzz phrase these days, but there is considerable debate and confusion about what Big Data actually is. A recent survey of 154 companies found that nearly 70% used a volume-based definition for Big Data; 25% defined Big Data as 'massive growth of transaction data'; 24% thought Big Data referred to new technologies for managing massive data; and 19% defined it as the 'requirement to store and archive data for regulatory compliance'. \n\nBrett Cameron and Chris Brown will share their opinions about what Big Data really means and will consider the evolving role that Erlang is playing in the Big Data space and in Cloud computing. They will also briefly discuss how they came to be involved with Erlang by porting it to HP's legacy OpenVMS operating system, the story behind this work, and some of the technical challenges that were encountered along the way."
