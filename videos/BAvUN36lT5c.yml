When rivers are born, all of the focus is on the watersheds, what feeds them and what will eventually give them the critical mass to succeed. As they grow, the focus changes, and we tend to think about the health of the river and where it will take us.\n\nCome join us on the river, where we'll talk about what's happened in the Elixir community and how the language is changing the way we all program. We'll look at technologies, community and culture.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nReminisce with the audience about Elixir's younger years\nUnderstand how the dynamics of a language changes with growth\nLearn where Elixir is going and what's likely to change as we go there\n---\nTALK LEVEL: Beginner\n---\nTHE SPEAKER: Bruce Tate\nAuthor of Seven languages in seven weeks\n\nBruce Tate is a kayaker, climber, programmer and father of two from Chattanooga, Tennessee.
