description: "Aaron Ardiri\nCEO, RIoT Secure AB\n\nPersonal computing kicked off for a limited few in the 80's with 8bit computers; it is amazing how quickly technology has changed since then. Starting from likes of the Commodore 64 through up to the cloud and then down to earth in the exciting realm of Internet of Things. Only a few have been able to experience the full evolution of computing technology, but even fewer can share experiences of always being ahead of the curve, exploring new things, failure, failure again, eventual success and a continued passion for technology. Meet a developer who still has a passion for coding but has been adapting to the ever-changing technology field - get to share in the experiences and knowledge that has been gained over the years from early tech, intellectual property, open source licensing and flexibility of working in startups through to acquisition and corporate politics of large fortune 500 companies. Hear it from someone who has been there, done that and still doing it-simply refusing to let go of technology."
