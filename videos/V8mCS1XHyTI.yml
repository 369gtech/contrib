description: "AI and machine learning are driving a revolution in text analytics that could be a game-changer for the way people interact with brands and employers. In this session, we will explore the latest developments on topic detection and sentiment analysis at Qualtrics and how we are using them to develop advanced text analytics.\n\nThe talk is open to audience of all levels. We will briefly introduce word embedding first, which is the basic building block for many of the recent neural network models. And then for topic detection and sentiment analysis, we will discuss in high level about some of the popular neural network based models targeting these two tasks, and the learnings from productizing these research models for real-life problems."
