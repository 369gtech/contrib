description: 'The Open Source is everywhere: your laptop, phone, car and even in your fridge or washing machine! But how do we get here? In this talk you''ll learn about Open Source Software, the history, the most important people involved in the movement and a little bit about licenses. We also talk about how to contribute to Open Source and you will discover that there are different ways to do it that don''t involve code. Finally I''ll share my personal experience about how I started from contributing to different projects, to lead the Madrid Groovy community, getting involved in the organization of a conference, and finally getting hired to work on the development team of the Grails framework.'
