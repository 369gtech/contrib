description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nJanuary 19, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Andrew Hogue.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nStructured search is about giving the search engine a deeper understanding of documents and queries and how they relate to real-world entities. Using this knowledge, we can build search products that lead users directly to their answers, or assemble disparate data into a more unified interface that helps users make better decisions. This talk will present a variety of ways in which a better understanding of structure and semantics is helping Google push the boundaries of search.\r\n \r\nAndrew Hogue is a Senior Staff Engineer and Engineering Manager in the Search Quality group at Google New York. He has worked on a wide array of projects including question answering, Google Squared, sentiment analysis, local and product search, and Google Goggles. His is interested in the areas of structured data, information extraction, and machine learning, and their applications to search and search interfaces. Prior to Google, he earned a M.Eng. and B.S. in Computer Science from MIT.\r\n\r\nThis Tech Talk was presented at one of the Google NYC Tech Talk series.
