Starting from Dependency Injection to how to create first spring application, integrating maven. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP), integrating Hibernate with Spring .Building application using Spring MVC. Using Apache tiles and JSF for making user view. Making your spring application secure. Using Log4j as logger and writing test cases with JUnit. At the end of the course, we will also create a web application using Spring Framework.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWho should go for this course?\n\nThis course can be taken by anyone who wants to be a Java Developer or wants to learn Spring Framework.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy learn Spring Framework ?\n\nSpring is the most popular open source Java application Framework. Most of the existing frameworks like Struts or Hibernate take care of one layer or a part of the application development.\nAs Struts take care of MVC model, Hibernate provides ease of working with databases. However, Spring Framework combines all the industry standard framework approaches (e.g. Struts and Hibernate) into one bundle.\nSpring provides Dependency Injection, Aspect Oriented Programming and support for unit testing. This gives the developer time to work on main business logic rather than worrying about non-application code. Spring makes the application development fast and increases the productivity of developers.\n\nFor more information, please write back to us at sales@edureka.in or call us at IND: 9606058406 / US: 18338555775 (toll-free)."
