title: 'GeeCON 2018: Maciek Pr√≥chniak - Stream Processing in telco - lessons learned'
recordingDate: 1532330827
description: 'Two years ago we introduced stream processing engine Apache Flink in one of the larges polish telcoms. We started with real time marketing and gradually moved to fraud detection and other areas. Today we have around 50 jobs, together they process at peak more than 150k events per second. In the talk I''d like to share our experiences. Some of them are technical: what is our architecture (Flink, Kafka and so on), what are the challenges of processing tens of thousands of messages per second, how to deal with large state and so on. Some are more organisational - how is it different to design, test and monitor stream processing jobs than to use batch jobs or ''normal'' applications. I''d also like to talk a bit about open source project that we created during this journey - Nussknacker, which is a tool for designing streaming processes with GUI - it''s used by analysts at our client.'
