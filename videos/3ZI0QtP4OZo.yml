recordingDate: 1511556480
description: "Why are there are so many disagreements in software? Why don’t we all converge on the same beliefs or technologies? It might sound obvious that people shouldn't agree, but I want to convince you it’s weird that we don't. This talk will be a philosophical exploration of how knowledge converges within subcultures, as I explore this question through the worlds of software, online fraud, and poker.\n\nEVENT: RailsConf 2017\n\nSPEAKER: Haseeb Qureshi\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on the Confreaks YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x07q6V4VXC8"
