description: "Speaker(s):\nTimothy Jordan\n\nDescription:\nWearable computing is here and the way we interact with technology will be completely different.  Building cool, fun, and delightful experiences is no longer enough.  They must also be experiences that address specific user problems and never get in the way or take precedence over the user's life.  They must give users all the benefits of technology they've come to expect, and more, while meeting them on their terms in a seamless and intrinsically human way.\nIn this session, we'll take a look at the constellation of devices that make up not just wearable, but ubiquitous computing.  We'll tie them all together with common design and development practices as well as the Google Platform.  This is the key information that'll get you ready for being part of a sea change of technology that invariably puts the user first.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
