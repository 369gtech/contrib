title: 'YOW! 2016 Andrea Burbank - Data Science as Software at Pinterest'
recordingDate: 1484112820
description: "The popular conception of data science as mining nuggets of gold from oodles of unstructured data misrepresents the importance of software engineering to the success of any data science efforts. Learning to log the right things and process data efficiently is tremendously important and easily underestimated.\n\nAndrea Burbank joined Pinterest as a data scientist in 2012, building its first successful AB testing framework, dozens of data pipelines, and a culture of testing and experimentation. Prior to Pinterest, she worked as a software engineer at Bing and as a natural language scientist on ranking and relevance at Powerset, a semantic search engine acquired by Microsoft in 2008. She has a BS in physics and a BA in linguistics from Stanford University.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
