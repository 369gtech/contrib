description: "You can build some exciting serverless stuff with a combination of Azure Functions Durable Entities, Azure SignalR Services, React, MobX and TypeScript. You just need some scaffolding.\nThat scaffolding is here: https://github.com/scale-tone/durable-mvc-starter (in form of a GitHub template repo), and I'm going to show in real-time how to use it. We'll build a simple sample appointment scheduling app, look into the internals of it and even deploy it to Azure.\n \nDocs Pages/CTAs:\nAzure Functions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nCosmos DB: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nAzure SQL DB: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nLogic Apps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps//?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nLearn Collection: https://aka.ms/azureserverlessconf/resources \n \nCloud Skills Challenge: https://aka.ms/azureserverlessconf/challenge"
