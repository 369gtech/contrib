title: 'Event-Sourced Architectures with Akka'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433260322
description: "Different JVM languages lead to different architectural styles. We all know the typical three-tiered architecture and its limitations. Akka and Scala offer event sourcing. Event-sourced apps model all state changes explicitly and store them immutably. The actor model makes this horizontally scalable. Even better are the functional benefits: a provably correct audit log and creation of new views on past data. This session introduces event-sourcing concepts. Youâ€™ll see how well they map onto actors. To prove this, the presentation shows an event-sourced application using Akka. The new Akka Persistence module provides excellent building blocks. Want to learn about the next generation of scalable architectures on the JVM? Check out event sourcing with Akka!\n\n\nAuthor:\nSander Mak\nSander crafts scalable software at Luminis Technologies.
