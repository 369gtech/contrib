We'll explore the anatomy of a Blazor component in this session and see how the code generation system operates that does its work behind the scenes.\n\nAlso, you'll experience advanced Blazor component features like chained binds, cascading values, and callbacks. And I'll show you how to reuse your components to the max by using generic templated components.\n\nYour \"Advanced Blazor Components\" achievement will be unlocked after watching this session and you'll be ready to take your Blazor application to the next level."
