description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/pcf-dev-spring-cloud-services-in-your-pocket\n\nPCF Dev is a new distribution of Cloud Foundry designed to run on your laptop or workstation. It is intended for programmers who wish to develop and debug their applications locally on a fully-featured Cloud Foundry. Or PMs who want to do acceptance offline. Or newbies interested in exploring Cloud Foundry. It is definitely intended for you.\n\nIt is also a product that has gone through its fair share of metamorphoses to be the light-weight, easy to install tool you see before you today. So whether this is the first time you've heard of PCF Dev or you're already using it daily, join us to learn a little about its history, its roadmap, and what sort of peculiarities arise when you pack an entire Cloud Foundry onto one VM."
