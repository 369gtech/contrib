title: 'Upgrading to .NET Core: Back-End Class Library - A TimCo Retail Manager Video'
language: English
recordingDate: 1572966011
description: "In a continuation of the upgrade process, we are going to upgrade our back-end library (which serves our API) to .NET Standard 2.0. That will keep it compatible with our existing API and allow it to work with the new .NET Core 3.0 API when it is ready.\n\nFull Course: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/p/timco-retail-manager/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nMailing List Signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/\n\nOne-off tutorials are awesome but they aren't the only thing you should be doing to learn C#. Another vital part of learning is learning how to put it all together. This interactive course is all about putting the pieces together. You can watch each video on its own or you can watch them in order and see a bigger picture. The choice is yours.\n\nThis course focuses on real-world development. As such, we are simulating that we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions on a brand new product, the TimCo Retail Manager. Just like in the real world, we are starting out with one set of requirements but know that over time they will change."
