description: "From OSCON 2015 in Amsterdam: We’re looking at a major revolution in cloud computing, containers, and the platforms that we use to schedule and orchestrate them. They are not only changing the way we harness our computing infrastructure, but are also changing the way we think and talk about it. In this session we’ll look at the new metaphors of computing through the lens of Kubernetes, and work out what we as developers need to do to adapt to this new mindset.\n\nAbout Mandy Waite (Google):\nMandy Waite is a developer advocate for the Google Cloud Platform.\n\nWatch more from OSCON Amsterdam 2015: https://goo.gl/VeF8tq\nVisit the OSCON website: http://oscon.com\nDon't miss an upload!
