title: '"Observability: Superpowers for Developers" by Christine Yen'

description: "Who wants to spend time dreaming about the ability to leap tall buildings with a single bound, when we can recast stories we live day to day as powers of our own... and improve our own lives in a practical way? When observability is folded into the development process itself, it represents the potential for a beautifully virtuous cycle: production stops being just where our development code runs into issues, and it becomes where part of our development process lives.\n\nChristine Yen\nHoneycomb\n@cyen\n\nChristine delights in being a developer in a room full of ops folks. As a cofounder of Honeycomb.io, a startup with a new approach to debugging production systems, she cares deeply about bridging the gap between devs and ops with technological and cultural improvements. Before Honeycomb, she built out an analytics product at Parse (bought by Facebook) and wrote software at a few now-defunct startups."
