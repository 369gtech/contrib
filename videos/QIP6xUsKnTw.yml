description: "Panel Discussion: Welcoming V3: Modernizing the Cloud Foundry API - Piyali Banerjee, Abby Chau, Reid Mitchell, Zach Robinson & Luan Santos, Pivotal \n\nMaintaining and consuming the legacy v2 API has caused frustration with the feature development process for CAPI (Cloud Controller API), CLI, and other CF teams, leading to the desire and need of a new and improved API: v3! The V3 Acceleration Team (VAT) was created to accelerate the deprecation of the v2 API. Clients, including cf CLI, are moving to primarily access v3 endpoints to empower end-users to use exciting v3-exclusive features. CF contributors, such as the Services API team, are developing v3-style features and app developers are using the GA-ed v3 endpoints. There has been a growing list of questions from the CF community on v3.  So whatâ€™s new in v3? How have the pain points from v2 been addressed? What is the transition experience like? In this session, panelists from CAPI, CLI, and VAT will address these topics, drawing from their experience designing and developing v3! \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
