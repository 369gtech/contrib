description: "If you optimize for high team performance, you’ll get high team performance. Sounds great! However, the problem is that high team performance leads to low system performance. As a consequence, the service you offer to your customers are getting worse. That’s not so good because in the end customers pay your bills and not high performing teams. \n\nTeam-focus is also the reason why most Agile frameworks fail to improve organizational agility and success. In the best case, you don’t see any organizational improvement, in most of the cases it is getting worse. Local optimization leads to global sub optimization! But what does this mean? And how can you optimize organizations beyond the team? In this talk I will answer these questions and show how one can establish enterprise flow. I will also present an example where I improved service delivery of an organization without bothering teams in their daily work."
