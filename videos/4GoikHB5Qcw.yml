description: "Anup Patel\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/204/\n\nThe RISC-V Hypervisor Extension Specification and RISC-V Hypervisor Software are being co-developed at the same time to ensure a clean and extensible  RISC-V specification for both Type1 and Type2 hypervisors. In this talk, we explain the details of RISC-V Hypervisor Specification and share our experience of co-developing hypervisors along with RISC-V specifications.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nMon Jan 13 12:05:00 2020 at Room 7"
