title: 'Study Algorithms by Playing Pick 2 by The Bit Plumber'
recordingDate: 1501229027
description: "Studying algorithms can be a rather obtuse endeavor. We are going to overcome this by playing a game of pick 2. Given the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; pick 2 numbers that sum to 11. Come to the meeting to find out why this is not a trivial problem. If you want to get a head start, check out the blog at http://rlucente.blogspot.com/2017/03/learn-algorithms-by-playing-pick-2-find.html.\n\nPresented by Robert Lucente, The Bit Plumber"
