title: 'DEF CON 29 Adversary Village - David Hunt - Prelude Operator'
language: English
recordingDate: 1629143895
description: "Prelude Operator is the new kid to the adversary emulation block party. Built by the same people who designed and built the MITRE Caldera framework, Operator is a free and largely open-source desktop platform that aims to make adversary emulation accessible to smaller organizations.\n\nThe app includes a library of RATs (agents) which can deploy into the field and supports a modular architecture of plugins and network protocols, including hundreds of TTPs mapped to ATT&CK. In this tool demonstration, we will highlight the key features of Operator and empower people to walk away with a developer-first adversary emulation desktop platform that is end-to-end free & open-source."
