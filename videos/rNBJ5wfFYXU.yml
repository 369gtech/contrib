title: 'Where 2012, Bruce Daniel, "Responsive Design--The Future of Mapping"'
recordingDate: 1333577229
description: "Responsive Design is all about how structure can adjust to various environments, user activities and form factors. First we'll look at the core concepts of Responsive Design and how they're applied in a typical web setting, noting the methods used. Then we'll see how maps naturally follow some of those basic principles. For example, maps alter both design and information based on scale -- not unlike adjusting detailed website information for small screen display.\n\nAn overview of the technical status of online mapping shows that the move away from a \"baked\" raster tileset to a vector-based world of geographic data opens the door to even more flexible display and response. What is particularly exciting is how Responsive Design might be applied to a wide variety of environmental and behavioral factors. We'll take a look at some of these factors beyond just adjustment for screen size and orientation. For instance, consider factors like: speed (main roads and type becoming more prominent as speed increases); user input (map detail responding to touch gestures); actual physical environment (location-based weather and seasonal information altering the look of the map); moods and modes; and various location-based activities (when you're in a park, showing contour information). Each factor/response demonstrates how the design and display of geographic information might shift and respond to provide the best map to meet the moment.\n\nLots of visuals.\n\nBruce Daniel\n\nCartifact\n\nA strong advocate of high quality design in all things, Bruce Daniel has honed his craft through the design of maps. Driven by a belief in the power of visual clarity and aesthetic presentation, his award winning work is found across the nation.\n\nAs Director of Cartifact Labs, he is engaged with the leading developers of emerging technology relating to map creation and usage."
