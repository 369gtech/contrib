description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nOne of the reasons why a lot of us work in C++ is because there is a huge amount of existing projects written in C++.\n\nBut existing code can be hard to understand.\n\nIn this presentation, you will learn how to make sense of code quickly, from the general big picture of the codebase all the way down to the little details of the code of a complex class.\n\nThe ten rules covered in this session will teach you to:\n- start reading code from the end\n- identify the parts of code that carry the most information\n- locate the code of any feature visible in the application\n- and many more!\n\nCode reading techniques usually come with years and years of experience. This presentation will teach some of them to you right now, supported by code examples.\n\nThere is a wealth of talks about how to write C++ code using the latest features of the language, but there are very few talks about reading existing code. In particular the everyday code that people have in their codebases. And as the saying goes, code is read much more often than it is written.\n\nThis presentation aims at filling this need in a practical way, by exposing 10 techniques that conferences attendees can use on an everyday basis to understand quickly the code they get to work on, as soon as they go back to the office after the conference.\n— \n\nJonathan Boccara\nMurex\nPrincipal Engineering Lead\nParis\n\nJonathan Boccara is a Principal Engineering Lead at Murex where he works on large codebases in C++.\nHis primary focus is searching how to make code more expressive. He has dedicated his blog, Fluent C++, to writing expressive code in C++. \nHe also gives internal trainings on C++ every day, in the short format called \"Dailies\".\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
