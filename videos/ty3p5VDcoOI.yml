description: "Twitter hashtag to ask questions: #TDDesign\n\nJB Rainsberger and Sandro Mancuso started an interesting discussion on twitter about TDD and design. However twitter is not the best place to host these kind of discussions it's better to talk. Sandro and JB will discuss and answer questions face to face in this hangout.\n\nDoes TDD mean no up-front design at all? Should everything emerge as we test-drive? What about architecture?...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/carlosble/status/589822365850296320"
