description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nMaking light art installations involves covering windows, taping up tents, creating light-tight domes… anything to block every single photon you can find. This is so that your projections or lights look the way you intended. But sometimes you have to ask yourself why you’re working so hard to get rid of something so amazing as sunlight.\n\nFacing their daylight nemesis resulted in an art installation that is an ode to the traditional light art form of stained glass – and can be seen as this years FITC poster, opening titles and physical installation.\n\nDaniel and Zander are excited to show you all the grisly bits between their first ideas and the final FITC art piece. They may have set off a few smoke alarms and weirded out Zander’s neighbours, but they made something new and surprising.\n\nDaniel Scheibel\nCo-Founder / Technical Director, Red Paper Heart\nhttp://www.twitter.com/dscheibel\n\nZander Brimijoin\nCreative Director and Co Founder, Red Paper Heart\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/RedPaperHearts\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
