description: "\"Is the documentation up to date ?\", \"Where the documentation version 1.5 ?', \"What are the differences with the previous version ?\" \"How do I generate the table of content ?\" \"How to generate the documentation in PDF ?\" \"What is the style for titles ?\" \"Damn Word again broke my numbered list !\"\n\nMost of the time, the documentation is written in files completely apart from the source code. Its format can be constraining for the developer which leads to frustration and affect the final delivery. Taking care of the form is not our (main) activity but content is. And of course, what about seeing the difference between versions.\n\nIf this introduction sounds familiar so Asciidoctor is here for you. Simple, clear, concise. During this presentation we will see the syntax, the integration in the application life cycle and how to customize the output.\n\nAnd you'll figure out you don't have to make a fool of yourself about documentation."
