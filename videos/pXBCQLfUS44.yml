description: "Google Tech Talk\nMay 23, 2012\nGoogle NYC\n\nPresented by Eyal Manor, Jacob Baskin, Nemo Semret, and Noam Wolf\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWhen you see an ad on a website, where did it come from? The answer to that question might not be as simple as it sounds. Ads on the internet take a long, often roundabout journey to make it from the advertiser to you, a journey that sends them through companies like ad servers, ad networks, data platforms, DSPs, SSPs, and more. Worst of all, the fragmentation of the advertising industry means that even trying to get these systems to talk to each other can be a daunting challenge. With all of this complexity, how does the publisher know that they are showing the right ad for you?\n\nThat's where Ad Exchange comes in. We are building an open, transparent marketplace that connects online publishers, advertisers, and everyone in between to buy and sell display advertising in an easy and efficient way. No matter what platforms or technologies you use, Ad Exchange helps advertisers put their ads where they want---and helps publishers make sure they are getting the best value for their content. And we do all of this in a way that protects ad quality and reduces user-facing latency.\n\nBut it's not easy. To make sure that we can find the right ad, we have to build a globally-distributed, real-time system that handles hundreds of thousands of calls every second. We have to use sophisticated techniques to make sure that publishers' and users' interests are protected. And we have to build a marketplace that uses tools from game theory to ensure that all participants are treated fairly. Find out how we make it happen, and get a glimpse at the future of online advertising from the Ad Exchange engineering team."
