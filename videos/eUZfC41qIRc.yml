description: "Cloud Foundry Diego Update - Eric Malm, Pivotal\n\nDo you love how simple and easy it is to push your application to Cloud Foundry but want to know what really happens to your app instances under the hood? Do you operate a Cloud Foundry deployment and need to understand how all its different components work together to keep applications running?\n\nAfter years of development, Diego has now replaced the previous DEA system as the official container runtime at the heart of Cloud Foundry, capable of managing even the largest CF deployments. In this talk, the project lead for the Diego team will survey how the Diego components interact inside of CF to run application instances and tasks and then dive into how those interactions have evolved over the past year to improve system stability, security, and scale. This talk will also review how recent work in Diego supports powerful platform features such as isolation segments, zero-downtime application updates, and application-identity TLS certificates, how to use tooling such as the CF Diego Operator Toolkit (\"cfdot\") to inspect the app instances and CF components in a deployment, and other features that the core Cloud Foundry teams are working on or considering for development today.\n\nAfter attending this talk, you'll be ready to operate your Diego-supported CF deployment with confidence and to take advantage of the powerful features it provides for your users and their applications.\n\nAbout Eric Malm\nEric works at Pivotal Software as the Product Manager for the CF Diego team, and prior to that was a software engineer on the Diego and CF Runtime teams. He has presented at several previous Cloud Foundry Summit events as well as at many national and international academic conferences in mathematics, and is an award-winning teacher and lecturer. He holds a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Stanford University."
