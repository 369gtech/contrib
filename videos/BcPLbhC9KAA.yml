description: "Java web application ready to serve requests in 10 milliseconds after start and occupying 40 MB on disk?\_With Hibernate ORM connected to PostgreSQL, Undertow web server, RESTEasy, CDI and Transaction Manager?\_\nCome and see how Quarkus makes all the above possible on top of\_\_Graal/SubstrateVM using new techniques such as Build Time Metadata Processing, Compile Time Boot; how runtime reflection can be eliminated at build time, etc.\nMay sound geeky, but Quarkus still offers the first class developer experience: it shields you perfectly from the complexity of GraalVM, there is a dev mode with instant reload, it is easy for the 80% most common use case and flexible for the remaining 20%.\_You do not need to learn a new technologies, because Quarkus supports existing best of breed libs and standards, such as Hibernate/JPA, JTA, CDI, JAX-RS, Eclipse MicroProfile and much more!\_\n\nA 5 ms demo will be included ;)"
