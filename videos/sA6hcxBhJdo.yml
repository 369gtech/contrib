The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nAdventures in Conformance - Aaron Crickenberger, Google \n\nWhat is Kubernetes, really? Documents may say one thing, but running code will always win. Our community thus defines what Kubernetes is via conformance tests that exercise functionality expected of any given Kubernetes cluster.   Last year the CNCF introduced the Certified Kubernetes Conformance Program that uses these tests to certify whether a given Kubernetes distribution or platform is behaving as expected. What have learned as over 60 vendors have certified their Kubernetes?   This talk will walk you through the progress weâ€™ve made over the past year in improving the fidelity of conformance tests, and how they are integrated into both upstream and downstream development. The audience should leave this talk knowing what guarantees conformance tests provide, how they can use them, and how they can contribute. \n\nTo learn more click here:  https://sched.co/FuKh"
