description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary, 22 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nDigital identity management (DIM) has emerged as a critical foundation\nfor supporting successful interaction in today's globally\ninterconnected society. It is crucial not only for the conduct of\nbusiness and government but also for a large and growing body of\nelectronic or online social interactions. Digital identity management\nis usually coupled with the notion of federation. The goal of\nfederations is to provide users with protected environments to\nfederate identities by the proper management of identity attributes.\nFederations provide a controlled method by which federation members\ncan provide more integrated and complete services to a qualified group\nof individuals within certain sets of business transactions. By\ncontrolling the scope of access to participating sites, and by\nenabling secure, cross-domain transmission of user's personal\ninformation, federations can make the perpetration of identity frauds\nmore difficult, as well as reduce their frequency, and their potential\nimpact. In this talk we first discuss basic digital identity concepts\nand requirements towards DIM solutions. We then focus on the VeryIDX\nsystem and present an approach for the privacy-preserving verification\nof identity attributes.\n\nSpeaker: Professor Elisa Bertino\nCS Department, CERIAS, Purdue University"
