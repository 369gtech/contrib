title: 'Protocol XIII: Clojure Protocols Explained - Sean Devlin'
recordingDate: 1355703262
description: 'Everyone seems to be interested in protocols, but not too many tutorials exist on the topic. I''m assuming that we''ll have a fair amount of video game fans in the audience. The goal of this talk is to explain how protocols & datatypes work by analogy, using the Final Fantasy XIII character & job system.'
