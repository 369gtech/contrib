description: "Baruch Sadogursky, Developer Advocate, JFrog\n\nThere are three hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors. This session tackles naming, especially Docker version naming. Labels, tags, checksums...how should you use them to keep track of Docker versions? What about dev versus prod images—how best to distinguish those? What about the “latest” tag? What about cleanup? Could we do more? Versioning often seems like a simple problem, but when you have a tool that gives you as much power and flexibility as Docker does, it often helps to develop guidelines. The presentation examines the tools available for managing Docker images and some simple patterns you can employ in various use cases for CI/CD to keep track of your containers."
