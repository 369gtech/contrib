description: "In this talk I will present ROVINA (rovina-project.eu), a cooperative three-year research project, co-funded by the European Commission that includes 4 top European universities, the International Council of Monuments and Sites, and an Italian high-tech company. By using beyond-state-of-the-art AI and computer vision techniques, ROVINA develops robots for exploration, mapping and digitizing sites to improve the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage. ROVINA will include two case studies where our robots will explore and build 3D models of the catacombs of Rome and Naples.\nLanguage: English\n\nUrl slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Codemotion/rovina-algorithmica-33638847"
