description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nScalable and Multitenant Networking in XDP and Kubernetes Operators - Sherif Abdelwahab & Ying Xiong, Futurewei \n\nEnabling multi-tenant and extensible networking in Kubernetes is of paramount importance for cloud providers requires traffic isolation across tenants. By introducing a new data-plane built using XDP and inter-working custom resource operators, we will discuss how to enable multi-tenant networking at scale without compromising packet processing performance. Sherif and Ying will discuss the use of cases of networking isolation and fast provisioning within the Kubernetes environment for large scale cloud. They will share their experience and design techniques building a networking solution for multi-tenant networks from the ground-up using XDP, CRDs, and Kubernetes Operators. They will conclude with a demo. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekCi"
