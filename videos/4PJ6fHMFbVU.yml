description: "Day 2 with Stateful Applications - Implementing a Data Protection Strategy - Deepika Dixit & Vaibhav Kamra, Kasten \n\nAs teams start to onboard mission-critical applications into production, thereâ€™s a need to address day-2 concerns. Dealing with regulatory requirements, user error, ransomware and cluster upgrades - requires safeguarding of data and state. For this reason, Volume snapshots have been one of the most requested features from the storage team and now show up in the CSI spec. Snapshots alone, however, are often not enough. Application consistency, local storage, archival, retirement and compliance are just some of the other concerns. In this session, the speakers describe the challenges associated with implementing a robust data protection strategy in a containerized environment, open source tools available to help build this and a framework to evaluate what your environment needs. This talk targets DevOps teams looking to improve the reliability of their production environments. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GrYk"
