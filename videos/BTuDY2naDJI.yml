Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nService Mesh in Kubernetes: It’s Not That Easy - Lita Cho & Tom Wanielista, Lyft \n\nAs Lyft migrated its applications to Kubernetes, assumptions baked into the networking layer were tested. This talk will provide a deep dive of how Lyft used Envoy’s xDS protocol to design their own flexible service mesh and handle new challenges from a multi-cluster architecture such as:\n- Routing across multiple Kubernetes clusters\n- Handling Deployments\n- Rapid scale-in and scale-out\n- Service Discovery\n- Active/Passive Health Checking\n- Readiness in the service mesh\n\nThis talk will also go over changes that were made in the Envoy codebase to make this work."
