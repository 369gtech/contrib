description: "Talk recording from JSNation Live 2020, the biggest JavaScript conference in the cloud: https://live.jsnation.com\n\n# Transforming GraphQL – Infrastructure as Code for Front End Developers\nAs front-end tooling and frameworks continue to evolve and improve at a pace that is often hard to keep up with, serverless abstractions continue to move closer and closer to the client, abstracting away back end services and making them more and more consumable by traditionally front end developers.\n\nIn this talk I’ll show how we can use a combination of GraphQL SDL along with a new DSL (GraphQL Transform) created by the Amplify team to build out a full stack cloud application directly from your GraphQL schema. Using this GraphQL DSL, we’ll walk through how to model a Database, authorization rules, relationships, and custom access patterns. We’ll look at how to rapidly prototype an example application, and view some demos including a voting app capable of handling over 100,000 operations per second."
