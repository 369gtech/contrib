title: 'Building Successful Applications on the Autonomous Database'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592579066
description: "Well done! You've come up with the killer idea for 2020. You've got the best UI design anyone has ever seen! Your modern application ticks all the boxes â€” serverless, functional, Kubernetes, microservices, API-based, the list goes on. It runs on every OS and every type of device. Unfortunately, all of this counts for absolutely NOTHING if your data access is slow or buggy. But an Autonomous database will fix all that right? Only if you understand the fundamentals of how SQL is processed by the database. For novice developers, SQL can be hard to understand and sometimes totally hidden from view under an ORM. \n\nJoin us for this 60-minute webcast where we will peel back the covers to show you how SQL is processed, how to avoid getting hacked, and how to get data back to your application in a snappy fashion.\n\nConnor McDonald\nOracle Developer Advocate"
