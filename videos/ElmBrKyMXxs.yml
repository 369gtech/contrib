description: "Let's build a Sequence to Sequence model in Tensorflow to learn exactly how they work. You can use this model to make chatbots, language translators, text generators, and much more . We'll go over memory, attention, and some variants (like bidirectional layers) both programmatically and mathematically.\n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/seq2seq_model_live/blob/master/2-seq2seq-advanced.ipynb\n\nPlease Subscribe!
