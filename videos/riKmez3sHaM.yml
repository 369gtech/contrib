description: "The Web is rapidly adding near native functionality including access to device features such as filesystem storage, contacts, SMS, camera, microphone, location, USB and more. Historically, permissions are how we've safely exposed this functionality to the user. However, the increased attack surface area offered by new capabilities and the growing sophistication of malicious sites means we need to rethink how the permissions user experience works. \n\nIn this talk we'll: \n* Summarize important changes to permissions over the past year, including expanded support for the Permissions API\n* Review recent changes to push permissions notifications that will impact users of web push notifications\n* Provide an overview of our efforts to modernize permissions UX including planned support for temporary permissions, group permissions, permission user priming and simplifying permission revocations \n\nPresented by: PJ McLachlan\n\n#ChromeDevSummit All Sessions → https://goo.gle/CDS19\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nEvent photos → \_https://goo.gle/CDS19Photos"
