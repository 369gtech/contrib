title: 'DEF CON 29 Car Hacking Village - Eric Gershman - Safety 3rd Defeating Chevy StabiliTrak'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631234866
description: 'Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system saves thousands of lives every year by preventing accidents before a driver starts to lose control but it can be a real drag when trying to race a modern electric vehicle. Both the Chevy Spark EV and Bolt electric car communities have been unable to defeat the ESC to get full control of their cars on the track. Join me on my journey as I attempt to defeat Chevyâ€™s Stabilitrak to turn an EV econobox into an autocross speed racer.'
