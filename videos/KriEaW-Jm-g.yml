Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nKubeflow: Multi-Tenant, Self-Serve, Accelerated Platform for Practitioners - Kam Kasravi, Intel & Kunming Qu, Google \n\nThe kubeflow platform provides a self-serve multi-tenant platform on k8s for ML developers. Users can train their models using accelerated hardware in an isolated environment. Jobs can be configured and triggered from a notebook with no devops involvement. We leverage optimized libraries such as Intel® DAAL, Intel® MKL-DNN now included in tensorflow 1.14.+. Models can be monitored using Application CR deployed with kubeflow. All attendees can join the demo, create their own workspace and try out features. Attendees will walk away understanding how to run multi-tenancy on Kubernetes with kubeflow.    Highlights:  Self-serve multi-tenant workplace  Workspace owners can share / revoke access  System admin can reset access policy & resource quota per workspace  Multi-tenancy service is transparent to other apps.   A UI is available to simplify user experience.  \n\nhttps://sched.co/UaaI"
