description: "Slides: http://f.cl.ly/items/1M403y1o3t1q2B2i3A22/mobilism_jscrossplatform_heikobehrens.pdf\n\nModern web technologies and responsive design aim at platform independent code while promising first-class experience on any mobile device. Even though purely web-based approaches can achieve stunning results, they (still) cannot compete with their native counterpart regarding platform features and integration.\n\nIn this talk, I will show you how we can use JavaScript to produce mobile apps that include features such as native UI, push notifications, sensors, and paid distribution. You can expect lots of live demos when I will compare the strengths and weaknesses of various frameworks.\n\nAbout Heiko: https://twitter.com/HBehrens\nAbout Mobilism: https://mobilism.nl"
