description: "Building a large-scale, multidevice product in the cloud that changes the way students learn in high schools turns out to be not entirely trivial. This sessionâ€™s speakers have been building PulseOn for the last two years. They have faced many technical challenges and have tried many different technologies. Some ideas turned out to be extremely helpful, and some others that looked promising turned out to be bad practices. In this session, they discuss what they have learned about building modular, scalable web applications and go into different areas of the technology stack, from storage and (NoSQL) databases to a modular RESTful back end and a multidevice HTML5-based front end. They also discuss the cloud and topics such as autoscaling and failover.\n\n\nAuthors:\nPaul Bakker\nPaul is a software architect for Luminis Technologies. His current focus is on building modular enterprise applications and the cloud. He believes that modularity and the cloud are the two main challenges we have to deal with to bring technology to the next level, and is working on making this possible for mainstream software development. Today he is working on educational software focussed on personalised learning for high school students in the Netherlands. He is also responsible for pushing technology forward. Luminis strongly believes in open source and all the technology development they are doing happens in the open source community. Paul is an active contributor on projects such as Amdatu, Apache ACE, JBoss Forge and BndTools. \n\nHe has a background as trainer on Java related technology and is a regular speaker on conferences such as JavaOne, Devoxx and JFokus.\nView more trainings by Paul Bakker at https://www.parleys.com/author/paul-bakker-4\n\nJago de Vreede\nNo bio available\nView more trainings by Jago de Vreede at https://www.parleys.com/author/jago-de-vreede\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
