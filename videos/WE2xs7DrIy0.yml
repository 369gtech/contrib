description: "Register for GOTO Accelerate by visiting: http://gotocon.com/accelerate-london-2016\n\n\"At our company we have been, and continue to be, involved in a number of large programmes. These are often to do with product development and always to do with influencing large groups of people internally and externally. They always involve distributed systems. \n\nThey are always in a realm where there are competitors, external pressures and internal fears.\n\nThis talk is for those who don't just want to survive their programmes but to thrive in them. Drawing from over 15 years of experience, Jamie will share some stories, some do's and don'ts, and try to convince the audience that not only is strategy emergent but that if you don't let it emerge you will not succeed\"\n\nSign up here:  http://gotocon.com/accelerate-london-2016\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotoldn\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
