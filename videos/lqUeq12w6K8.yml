recordingDate: 1552514677
description: "The promises of the microservices model include reduced complexity, a module-specific data model,greater scaling at service level, faster development (API-First, Events-First, Domain Driven Design) and deployment (blue/green, ...), fault isolation, and so. In this session, we walk you through the essentials of microservices including: containers, orchestration, security, monitoring, tracing, servless/functions; data and transaction patterns such as event source, CQRS, Sagas; the various standards and services of it's container-native platform's eco-system including the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes, OCI Registry, other OCI services, the Open Service Broker, Event Broker, CloudEvents, Istio service mesh as well as Kiali, Prometheus, Zipkin, and Grafana; and the Java MicroProfile. A demo will put all these in action and perspective.\n\nhttps://developer.oracle.com/\nhttps://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
