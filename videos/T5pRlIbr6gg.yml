description: "Welcome to the 1st Episode of Learn Python for Data Science! This series will teach you Python and Data Science at the same time! In this video we install Python and our text editor (Sublime Text), then build a gender classifier using the sci-kit learn library in just about 10 lines of code.\n\nPlease subscribe & share this video if you liked it!\n\nThe code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/gender_classification_challenge\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nDownload Python here:\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/\n\nDownload Sublime Text here:\nhttps://www.sublimetext.com/3\n\nSome Great simple sci-kit learn examples here:\nhttps://github.com/chribsen/simple-machine-learning-examples\n\nand the official scikit website:\nhttp://scikit-learn.org/\n\nHighly recommend this online book as supplementary reading material:\nhttps://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/\n\nWondering when to use which model? This chart helps, but keep in mind deep neural nets outperform pretty much any model given enough data and computing power. so use these when you don't have access to loads of data and compute:\nhttp://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/\n\nThank you guys for watching! Subscribe, like, and comment! That's what keeps me going.
