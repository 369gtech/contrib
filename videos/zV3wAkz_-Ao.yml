description: "You are already using logs and metrics to monitor your applications. Why should you be adding tracing or Application Performance Management (APM)? This talk gives a hands-on overview of:\n\n* What you can (not) do with tracing.\n* How you can easily add tracing to your Java applications.\n* What OpenTracing (or soon OpenTelemetry) adds to the landscape.\n\nThe demo is using the open source Elastic APM agent with its OpenTracing bridge, so the general concepts widely apply."
