description: "by Gloria Dwomoh\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/UA2.114/what_makes_people_come_and_what_makes_them_stay.webm\n\nOver the years the tech industry has been trying to change its diversity and inclusion statistics but that seems to have been a hard nut to crack. This is a talk about what makes people come, but then also what makes people stay. Because diversity is inviting people to the dance, but inclusion is enabling them to join it. Let's figure out how you can make people come and want to stay in your organizations, and teams, and let's see one use-case where Mozilla did the same.\n\nRoom: UA2.114 (Baudoux)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 15:00:00"
