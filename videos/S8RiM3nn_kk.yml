recordingDate: 1397145803
description: "Apple has the iPhone, Google has Android, Microsoft has Windows Phone and now Mozilla has Firefox OS. Firefox OS is Mozilla's operating system for mobile\nphones. What is different with Firefox OS is that it is based on web technology. To develop applications all you need is the standard web trio: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Mozilla is developing a collection of Open Web APIs to enable access to the phone hardware.\n\nIn this presentation you will get an overview of Firefox OS and the Open Web APIs. This will allow you to publish your existing\nwebsite on the Firefox app market, or to create new simple web apps for the Mozilla phones."
