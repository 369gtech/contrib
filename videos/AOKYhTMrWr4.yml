description: "Banks and financial services providers love to make some big claims when it comes to the security of their products and networks. The truth is, the phrase \"bank grade security\" has become an oxymoron. Many institutions have failed to implement basic security controls, least to keep ahead of security curve. Yet we continue to place considerable trust in them, and put up with security controls that are counter-productive, all to maintain the theatre of security.\n\nThis session will look at some of Australia's largest institutions. With simple tools we will make some of our own assessments on how well they secure their networks.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
