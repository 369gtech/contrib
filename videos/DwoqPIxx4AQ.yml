description: "In the premiere episode of The Mobile Experience, Paul Saxman explores techniques for building a single-handed, smartphone interface for browsing a collection of places on a map.\n\nThis app shown in this episode was built for Android using a ViewPager; however, the same techniques can be used for building iOS apps using a UIScrollView. The code for the app is available at http://goo.gl/88YRq6.\n\nThe Mobile Experience series explores UI design guidelines and UX principles for building location-aware, mobile map applications. Tune in to future episodes for more advanced mobile map design tips and techniques!"
