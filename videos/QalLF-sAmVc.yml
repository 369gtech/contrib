recordingDate: 1520368728
description: "Animation is incredibly powerful to convey meaning and drive user behavior but only when done well. Animating the virtual DOM comes with some intricacies that affect our implementations. In this talk, we’ll go over animating in React with a variety of methods, comparing and contrasting each. We’ll cover add-ons like ReactCSSTransitionGroup, using external libraries like GSAP, React-Motion, motion using RxJS, and transitioning state with D3. We’ll look inside some real systems, breaking down how we can create reusable components of animation principles for interchangeable yet cohesive patterns.\n\nEVENT:\n\nReact Vienna 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nSarah Drasner \n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WylIER68iS0"
