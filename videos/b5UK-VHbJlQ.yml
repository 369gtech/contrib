title: 'Tables Considered Helpful - Daniel Gregoire'
language: English
recordingDate: 1543610296
description: "Tables are an essential cognitive tool. They help us see patterns and think comprehensively, organizing our data and designs into intersections of choice. Letâ€™s start with clojure.pprint/print-table and explore the table as visualization, explanation, and specification, learning to recognize and use these powerful tools wherever hard problems are sold.\n\nN.B. The Clojure code examples for `count` in this video return incorrect results. A correct implementation is available at the Rankle repository (https://github.com/semperos/rankle)."
