Further, you will see how to identify patterns in your application that have specific synchronisation requirements und learn how to employ them with AntidoteDB.\n---\nTHEMES\nConsistency CRDTs AntidoteDB\n---\nCode BEAM Lite LDN was brought to you by Code Sync. \n\nCODE SYNC Website: www.codesync.global \nTwitter: www.twitter.com/CodeMeshIO Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeSyncGlobal \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-sync/ Mail: info at codesync.global"
