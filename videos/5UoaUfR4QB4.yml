description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nManaging Developer Workflows with the Kubernetes API - Colin Murphy, Adobe \n\nWrite your own Kubernetes client to keep application teams from breaking their products. Kubernetes is incredibly powerful. It's extensibility allows for limitless varieties of architecture. But how do you get hundreds of engineers to follow the same conventions when creating their applications? For us at Adobe Document Cloud, the answer was to write our own Kubernetes client. It's easy to get started and well worth the investment for larger organizations. Writing your own client allows you to have much greater control over the deployment process, including secrets and change management. It also allows you to integrate with your existing deployment systems and reduces the cognitive load on your engineering teams. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekAX"
