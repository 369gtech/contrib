description: "From the 2014 Strata Conference + Hadoop World in New York City, M. C. Srivas's keynote, \"What Would Google Do? Understanding the Future of Big Data.\"\n\nGoogle knows what it takes to build data-driven businesses. Over the years, Google has faced many technology scaling challenges and answered the call with innovations for big data, as well as big data center compute, big networking and big storage. Google inspired Hadoop and many other innovation in the market. Luckily, we can understand “what’s next” easily because Google sends us postcards from the future. If you want to know what’s coming next in big data, just ask yourself, “what would Google do?”\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by MapR Technologies.\n\nAbout M. C. Srivas:\nSrivas is CTO and Founder of MapR Technologies. Srivas ran one of the major search infrastructure teams at Google where GFS, BigTable and MapReduce were used extensively. He wanted to provide that powerful capability to everyone, and started MapR on his vision to build the next-generation platform for semi-structured big data. His strategy was to evolve Hadoop and bring simplicity of use, extreme speed and complete reliability to Hadoop users everywhere, and make it seamlessly easy for enterprises to use this powerful new way to get deep insights. That vision is shared by all at MapR. Srivas brings to MapR his experiences at Google, Spinnaker Networks, Transarc in building game-changing products that advance the state of the art.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop World 2014: http://goo.gl/UUfrR7\nFind out more about the conference: http://strataconf.com/stratany2014\n\nDon't miss an upload!
