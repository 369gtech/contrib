description: 'Software architects often focus too much on the technical side to building software, including key platform or design decisions or finding reasons to use the latest and greatest technologies. We often forget that software is built by people, and without considering how the people work together, architectural visions are wasted. Patrick Kua explores why and how architects should care about high-performance teams and looks at ways architects can influence them.'
