description: 'Docker provides PODA (Package Once Deploy Anywhere) and complements WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) provided by Java. It also helps you reduce the impedance mismatch between dev, test, and production environment and simplifies Java application deployment. In this talk, Arun Gupta, Java Champion and Docker Captain and Fabiane Nardon, Java Champion, will explain how to run and package your Java application with Docker including sharing your Java application using Docker Hub. In addition, they will cover: * Deploying your Java application using Maven * Deploying your application using Docker for AWS * Scaling Java services with Docker Engine swarm mode * Packaging your multi-container application and use service discovery * Monitoring your Docker + Java applications * Building a deployment pipeline using common tools.'
