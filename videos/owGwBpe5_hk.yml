Have you longed for a simple yet powerful way to automate workloads on Kubernetes? Ansible, the familiar IT automation tool, makes it easier than ever to automate your cluster. This talk introduces two practical ways to define and provision complex applications using Ansible Automation with Kubernetes. \n\nThe Automation Broker allows users to leverage Ansible Automation to define and orchestrate applications, making them available for self-service provisioning in the Service Catalog. \n\nThe Ansible Operator allows users to actively manage the full lifecycle of an application by defining management behaviors with Ansible; the Operator handles everything else. \n\nIn this session you will learn:\nHow to define and deploy your application on Kubernetes using Ansible.\nHow to publish your own applications in the Kubernetes Service Catalog.\nHow to create a Kubernetes Operator using Ansible. \n\nRoom: UB2.252A (Lameere)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 17:30:00+01"
