description: "With the yearly ECMAScript releases (ES2015..ES2021) a lot of things have changed in JavaScript-land, and there's even more to come.\n\nThis talk takes a look at a few of the newest (ES2021) ECMAScript features, and also at some of the upcoming features which (hopefully) will become part of the ECMAScript Language Specification in the near future."
