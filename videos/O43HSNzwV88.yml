description: "Slides: http://bit.ly/render2017slides\n\nAs creators of the web, our teams aim to understand challenges, opportunities and requirements, and translate these into technical solutions to build. But what happens when we start looking beyond this, using the website itself as a starting point rather than as the end of our journey?\n\nWebsites are often a great barometer for wider underlying issues, and by exploring common problems and root causes we can seek to spark fundamental change that can ultimately feed back into our longer-term success. Using a set of practical examples and case studies we’ll pull at some potential threads of failure, looking at how to create more sustainably for the future.\n\nABOUT SALLY JENKINSON\n\nSally is a consultant and digital solutions architect based in the wilds of East Anglia. Through her company Records Sound the Same she helps organisations from big to small with their digital transformation, discovery, planning, and strategic decisions, with clients including the RNLI, Manor Racing F1 team, and Hotelplan. The merging of user thinking and technical principles is what drives her work - helping people to understand what they need, they choices they have, and how to practically make these happen.\n\nSally is also an Associate at the Open Data Institute, author, gamer, tea snob, lover of hotel carpets, and tweets as @sjenkinson.
