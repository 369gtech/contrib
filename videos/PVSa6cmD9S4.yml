description: "This talk will show how to relatively painlessly build an autonomous robotic vehicle using Java, 3D printing and off-the-shelf components. The talk is based on the speaker's experience from a small hobby project. After the talk, you should have a good sense of how to go about building a vehicle of your own.\n\nThe following will be discussed:\n\n* How to choose hardware for a Java-controlled vehicle.\n* How to design for consumer 3D-printers.\n* How to get started with the software development.\n* How to use Java Flight Recorder to record large quantities of data where overhead can cause significant problems.\n* How using Java Flight Recorder saved the speaker ridiculous amounts of time when designing the algorithms.\n\nIf there is enough interest, the speaker would be happy to open source the project.\n\nMarcus is one of the founders of Appeal Virtual Machines, the company that created the JRockit JVM. He is currently working in the Java Product Group at Oracle. In his spare time he used to enjoy coding on his many pet projects, composing music, and scuba diving. Now he has baby twins. Marcus has contributed articles, whitepapers, tutorials, and webinars to the Java community, and has been an appreciated speaker at various conferences. He is also one of the two authors behind a book about JVM technology (https://tinyurl.com/jrockitbook). He holds an M.Sc. in Comp. Sci. & Engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm."
