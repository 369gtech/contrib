language: English
recordingDate: 1500463220
description: "Organisations often worry about their mobile teams. Sometimes they are a bit separate. There's often this inexplicable hostility to mentions of \"React Native\". Why do bug fixes take so long to get to production, and what are all these certificates for, anyway?\n\nIn this talk we'll cover the realities of shipping compiled code, the woes of the app stores, and the infrastructure challenges we haven't figured out yet. You'll leave with a better understanding of the realities your mobile teams may be struggling with, and some strategies for how to help them - and your organisation - build an effective mobile team that ships regularly. And yes, you'll finally understand the React Native argument, too.\n\nAbout Cate Huston\n\nCate has spent her career working on mobile and documenting everything she learns using WordPress. Now she combines the two as Automattic’s mobile lead. She co-curates Technically Speaking, and admins the New-(ish) Manager Slack."
