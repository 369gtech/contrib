description: "HTML5 has a lot of shiny new features that we'd love to start implementing immediately. Unfortunately, as Pamela Fox points out, shiny things often break pretty easily. A lot of the incredible features that come with HTML5 don't work seamlessly across devices and browsers. How do we detect these mishaps and what do we fallback on when they don't work?\n\nPamela, Front End Engineer at Coursera, draws on a series of issues, she's faced and troubleshot, as a developer for the distinguished company at the forefront of online education. This talk for SF HTML5 does two great things: it will make you laugh and it will teach you a lot about developing for the web. \n\nDive deeper into HTML5 with free developer resources: http://marakana.com/s/tags/html5"
