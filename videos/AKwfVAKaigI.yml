description: "This video will get you up and running with your first AI Reader using Google's newly released pre-trained text parser, Parsey McParseface.\n\nThe code for this video is here:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/AI_Reader\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nHere's the original blog post about Parsey:\nhttps://research.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html\n\nThis is Google's repo for Parsey:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/syntaxnet\n\nIf you're interested in NLP, check out Michael Collins course. This guy is such a G (he co-authored Parsey), I took this class at Columbia and it was one of the few where I actually attended every session. (it's free and open source!):\nhttps://www.coursera.org/course/nlangp\n\nLink to API.AI in case you want to go that route:\nhttps://api.ai/\n\nThe political debate fact checker was an idea I had but never got around to building. It takes the transcript from a political debate, extracts the intent of a claim, queries it against google, perhaps scrapes some search result data and then assigns it a truthfulness rating out of 100. If it falls below a certain threshold, that person must be lying! How cool would that be? \n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page. If you like my videos, feel free to help support my effort here!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&u=3191693\n\nMuch more to come so please subscribe, like, and comment.\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
