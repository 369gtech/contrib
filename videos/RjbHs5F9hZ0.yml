description: "2018/10/09 - Soir√©e Container Tools\nGoogle Container Tools: Life of a developer in a container world\nKubernetes has become the orchestrator of choice to deploy applications. But what about developer's day to day job of developing those applications. The more they leverage the platform, the more difficult it is to develop outside of the platform. And developing inside containers is not always easy nor enjoyable.Google has launched multiple Open-Source projects that focus on Developer User Experience in a Container World:\n\nKaniko lets you securely build Docker images from Dockerfiles on a Kubernetes cluster.\nSkaffold facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes applications.\nJib builds Java Docker images with Maven or Gradle without you even installing Docker.\nDistroless images offer small, secure, high quality base images.\nBazel makes it even possible to build images without Docker installed.\nCome learn how those tools and more, combined together, make a great CI/CD story for those developing for Kubernetes.\npar David Gageot"
