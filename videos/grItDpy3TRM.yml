description: "Oracle’s JVM support on low-cost ARM devices opens a world of new possibilities for powerful Java applications running on this new class of embedded platforms. This affords Java programmers the opportunity to play a significant role in the Internet of Things revolution. However, one gap remains: I/O communication with hardware devices and sensors. The Pi4J project bridges this gap. Pi4J is an open source project that provides a rich set of Java libraries enabling Java programmers to participate in these hardware communication layers (GPIO, I2C, SPI, RS232) on the Raspberry Pi. Attend this session for an hour of fast-paced fun and informative demonstrations that will leave you inspired and motivated to  get physical  with Java and the Raspberry Pi.\n\n\nAuthor:\nRobert Savage\nRobert Savage is a Member of Technical Staff at AMX, LLC.
