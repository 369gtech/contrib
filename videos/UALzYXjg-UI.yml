description: "#AskTHAT Live with Jorge Coca - BMW, The Clouds and Mobile Apps.\n\nJorge is a Spanish engineer lost in Chicago. I work for the BMW Group, where me and my team deliver the Android apps for BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce. When I am not coding, I really enjoy reading, spending time with my friends, watch soccer and play all kinds of instruments!\n\nLinks:\nTwitter - @jcocaramos\nMedium - https://medium.com/@jcocaramos"
