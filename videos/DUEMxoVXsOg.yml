title: 'Productive JavaFX at JavaOne 2014'
recordingDate: 1413716545
description: 'JavaFX is included with JDK 1.8, supports CSS 3 skinning and data binding, and comes with a WYSIWYG editor: the Scene Builder. In this session, a Model-View-Presenter/Model-View-ViewModel architecture heavily influenced by convention over configuration, inversion of control (Scene Builder), CSS, and data binding are presented in a working code example with a focus on productivity and maintainability. The presentation also discusses integration with REST services, WebSocket, Java EE 7, and combination with Java 8 features such as lambdas.'
