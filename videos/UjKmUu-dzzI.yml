title: 'Teaching Elephants to Dance (Burr Sutter, USA)'
recordingDate: 1515769234
description: 'Feeling bludgeoned by bullhorn messaging suggesting your monolithic behemoth should be put down (or sliced up) to make way for microservices? Without question, ‘unicorn-style’ microservices are the super-nova-hot flavor of the day, but what if teaching your tried and true monolith to be a nimble, fast-dancing elephant meant you could deploy every week versus every 6 to 9 months? For most enterprises, weekly deployments (or something close) would fundamentally transform not only operations and business results, but also the inherent value of developers willing to step up to lead the dance lessons. See beyond the hype to understand the deployment model your business case actually demands, and if weekly deployments courtesy of a dancing (or flying!) elephant fit the bill, love the one you’re with as you lead the organization’s journey to digital transformation!'
