title: 'JDK IO 2016 - Lasse Jenssen - Performance is a feature/ Instrument your code using JDBC features'
recordingDate: 1474443309
description: 'Performance is not an attribute of a system, but rather an attribute of an individual user experience. Performance is all about response time, which then again is given by its code path. But how can we possibly follow the code path into the RDBMS database. The JDBC 4.1 specification together with the Oracle end-to-end metrics gives you a method to follow the code path, and to work with performance, down to a single push on a button.'
