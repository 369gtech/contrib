title: 'YOW! 2014 Scott Shaw - Avoiding Speedbumps on the Road to Microservices'
recordingDate: 1514387960
description: "Microservices seem to have taken the tech world by storm in recent months. The promise of flexible architectures that evolve and adapt to changing business models is irresistibly attractive. But in the rush to implement these systems, we’ve seen technologists leave some of the stickiest problems to last. Whether you’re decomposing an unwieldily monolith or starting with greenfield delivery, there are certain universal challenges you will eventually encounter. We’ve been building these systems globally for several years now and witnessed the transition from exuberance through despair to sustainable, steady productivity. In this talk, I’ll dive into three of the biggest issues that microservice teams encounter:\n\nHow to secure your microservices\nHow to manage aggregated data\nHow to refactor your services as you learn about the domain\n\nTo illustrate these points, I’ll draw on my own microservice experiences as well as those of friends and colleagues around the world. You’ll walk away with some practical advice for avoiding these common calamities.\n\nAs the Head of Technology for ThoughtWorks in Australia, Scott divides his time between professional services leadership and consulting. As a consultant, he helps enterprise customers to shape their technology to align with 21st century practices like cloud, continuous delivery, microservices and lean governance. As a lifelong programmer and technology professional, Scott has designed and worked on distributed systems of every imaginable size and shape. When he’s not in meetings, Scott enjoys writing Clojure code.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
