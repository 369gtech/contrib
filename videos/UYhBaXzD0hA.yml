description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nSupercharge Kubeflow Performance on GPU Clusters - Meenakshi Kaushik & Neelima Mukiri, Cisco  \n\nAI/ML applications on Kubernetes can be optimized for performance at many levels.  This presentation provides an overview of the optimizations such as: - Distributed training on multiple GPUs with optimal selection of interconnects between the GPUs and CPUs. - Utilizing different types of GPUs/Servers for different workloads like training and inference. - OS level optimizations to get optimal performance on the hardware. - Usage of GPU Passthrough for optimal utilization and performance.  This presentation will also cover how the selection of machine learning framework, like Kubeflow, can impact performance and hardware utilization. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uada"
