description: "Filmed at http://ng-poland.pl 2018 on NOVEMBER 15 in Warsaw. \n\nMartin Sonnenholzer - Principal Product Engineer\n\nMartin is a principal product engineer, who worked with angularjs since version 1.0.7. While he studied math and computer science he had the opportunity to get in contact with machine learning, where his need to make the world easier for users originated. After some time with Java he moved to JavaScript and the browser where he is closer to the user. In his spare time he is organizing the Angular meetup in Berlin. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/chaos_monster\nhttps://chaosmonster.github.io/"
