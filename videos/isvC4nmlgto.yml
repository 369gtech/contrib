recordingDate: 1578011882
description: "This presentation will start on the very basics of what docker is and why organizations are willing to invest time and resources on it. The basics will explain how docker works, and its brief architecture. It would then dive into where the concept of containers originated from which would contain a brief history of containers. There will also be a brief comparison of dockers vs virtual machines. It would then go into terminologies commonly used in docker and a live demo on creating a docker image and deploying that image as a container.\n\nOnce the basics are covered, the presentation will deep dive into docker internals and security features. It will briefly cover what are Namespaces, CGROUPS, Capabilities and Seccomp along with examples on how to configure/implement them.\n\nThe presentation will then explain how the docker features are usually misconfigured in organizations and how can they be used to gain root access to the host system. The presentation will essentially cover 3 misconfigurations with the help of live demos.\n\n=== \n\nCurrently working as a Threat Assessor/Red Teamer.
