description: "Your application is living now in a container, yet is its private life a happy one? Find out that before your users do! If your application is not feeling so well, perhaps dealing with issues should be an inner container/Kubernetes affair while trying not to affect the availability of your software.\nIn this session will detail some implementation techniques for troubleshooting and debugging containerized applications in order to address some common problems like: permission issues, invalid parameters, volume mount errors, obsolete images, accessing running containers inside pods etc."
