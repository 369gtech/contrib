description: "Abstract \n\nJupyter is a prevalent tool among data scientists due to its flexibility, allowing users to interleave code, text, and images. However, writing notebooks that follow software engineering best practices is notoriously difficult: reproducibility, version control, modularization, and collaboration are all challenging to achieve when working with notebooks. Ploomber is an open-source library that allows users to adhere to software best practices while keeping the power of Jupyter.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber\n\nBio\n\nEduardo is interested in developing tools to deliver reliable data products. Towards that end, he created Ploomber, an open-source Python library to compose production-ready data workflows. Eduardo holds an M.S in Data Science from Columbia University, where he took part in Computational Neuroscience research. Eduardo started his Data Science career in 2015 at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy at The University of Chicago.\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
