description: "I’m SRE and You Can Too!—A Fine Manual for Migrating Your Organization to the New Hotness\n\nBlake Bisset, Dropbox, and Jonah Horowitz\n\nTales of brown-field SRE transitions from Netflix, Stripe, YouTube, Chrome, and the Google acquisitions process that you can use to overcome your own obstacles to continuous operational improvement.\n\nHow do you build a sustainable SRE program? How do you migrate an existing infrastructure, teams, and workflow to an architecture that can realize the benefits of SRE? What choices have companies made with their SRE programs, and what should you consider when adopting the SRE model?\n\nWe've been through this process a half dozen times in differing circumstances and organizations, and will share with you what has worked—and occasionally failed—for us as well as attempt to answer some of the most common questions we've had from previous attendees undergoing their own SRE/DevOps \n\nView the full SREcon18 Europe Program at: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon18europe/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
