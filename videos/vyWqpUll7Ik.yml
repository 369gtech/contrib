We use number of browser extensions to make most of our browser. How about being on other side of table; lets create one. From Javascript developer to a browser extension developer in 50 mins. Browsers are built on very simple principle - “one fit that suits all”. Browser extensions are the thing that help us to personalize the browser as per our need. We use number of browser extensions to make most of our browser. How about being on other side of table; lets create one. Webextension APIs are here to convert us(Javascript developers) to extension developers. Javascript mixed with Webextension APIs empower us to modify our browsers to suit as per our need. Adding to awesomeness, not only for one browser but same code that can be deployed on Firefox, Chrome, Opera with minimal or no changes. \n\nIn this session, we will be learning how to develop portable cross browser extensions using Javascript. One can learn how to use features of browser such as Notifications, Tab capture, HTTP request handling, Toolbar buttons in an addon. Also there will be a hands-on demo of creating a browser extension right in the session and deploying it in the browser. \n\nBy the end of session, audience will be empowered enough to command their browser to perform tasks as per their wish, may be throwing notification to drink water after every hour. \n\nBy this session, I look forward to increase the circle of browser extension developers so as to make browsers great! \n\nRoom: H.1308 (Rolin)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-03 09:30:00+01"
