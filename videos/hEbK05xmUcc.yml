title: 'Building PostgreSQL apps at any scale with Hyperscale (Citus) - BRK3094'
recordingDate: 1557255116
description: 'Postgres is a powerful open source database with different features and tooling. If you are new to Postgres, how do you ensure it’s performant and scale? We’ll start with the basics you need to know as an app developer, then dig into how to optimize apps and database to achieve optimal performance. We’ll look at things like cache hit ratio, index hit ratio and sharding with Citus as you scale your apps. This session will also include learnings from an architect of a leading banking institute who were able to successfully build a highly performing and scalable app. If you''re coming from a SQL server we''ll cover how things differ and the equivalent options of Postgres, including the rich set of Postgres extensions for deployment experience.'
