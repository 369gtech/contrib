title: 'DEF CON 27 Conference - Jack Baker - Hacking WebAssembly Games with Binary Instrumentation'
language: English
recordingDate: 1573862460
description: "WebAssembly is the newest way to play video games in your web browser. Both Unity3d and Unreal Engine now support WebAssembly, meaning the amount of WebAssembly games available is growing rapidly. Unfortunately the WebAssembly specification is missing some features game hackers might otherwise rely on. In this talk I will demonstrate adapting a number of game hacking techniques to WebAssembly while dealing with the limitations of the specification.\n\nFor reverse engineers, I will show how to build and inject your own \"watchpoints\" for debugging WebAssembly binaries and how to insert symbols into a stripped binary.\n\nFor game hackers, I will show how to use binary instrumentation to implement some old-school game hacking tricks and show off some new ones.\n\nI will be releasing two tools: a binary instrumentation library built for modifying WebAssembly binaries in the browser, and a browser extension that implements common game hacking methods a la Cheat Engine.\n\nJack Baker\nJack Baker is a professional vulnerability researcher and amateur video game hacker. His primary areas of expertise include web application security, embedded reverse engineering, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/Qwokka"
