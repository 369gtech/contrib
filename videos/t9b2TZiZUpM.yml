description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph\nhttp://gotocph.com\n\nDenis Rosa - Speaker, Developer Advocate at Couchbase\n\nABSTRACT\nDevelopers love to try new programming languages, use different frameworks or experiment with new architectures. But when it comes to databases, we pretty much have been using the same approach for the past 30 years.\nIn this session, I will quantify and expose some of the most common anti-patterns in database access, propose additional data models and compare major databases architectures. With the findings of this talk, you will be able to optimize your current projects and break the cycle of automatic decisions in the next ones [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:34 Performance vs productivity\n03:06 Databases are the bottleneck of most apps\n07:31 SELECT *\n08:52 Prepared statements\n11:37 Blocking vs non-blocking calls\n15:14 Joins\n17:55 I want to be productive!\n21:12 Wait, why do we have to choose?\n23:12 Hierarchical data\n27:40 But how do I query that?\n32:41 SQL++ is backwards compatible\n34:52 But SQL:2016 introduced JSON support\n37:38 Key takeaways\n39:22 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2019/sessions/1151/the-hidden-costs-of-poor-database-access\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nVlad Mihalcea • High-Performance Java Persistence • https://amzn.to/3EMYgBR\nDon Chamberlin • SQL++ For SQL Users • https://amzn.to/3EEfvFq\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Database #DatabaseCosts #Data #SoftwareArchitecture #NoSQL #NoSQLDatabase #JSON #XML #YAML #SQLplusplus #Couchbase #AsterixDB #PartiQL #ApacheDrill #ORM\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
