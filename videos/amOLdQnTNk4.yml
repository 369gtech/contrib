description: "Creating, deploying and operating applications in 2017 is both easier and more complicated with the proliferation of configuration management, containers, microservices and continuous delivery tools. We'll learn how to ignore the complexity of the tools by asking ourselves a dozen time-agnostic questions about software development.\n\nMatt Makai is a software developer with an affinity for Python and Swift. He is currently a Developer Evangelist at Twilio and the author of Full Stack Python, which helps over 90,000 developers a month learn to build, deploy and operate their Python web applications."
