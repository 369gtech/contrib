title: 'Florian Rival - Building native modules for React Native'
recordingDate: 1536920835
description: "A great strength of React Native is how easily we can interface our app with native code. While working with React Native, I created a module (react-native-image-resizer) to resize local images using native APIs, integrated a native SDK to a React Native app and we added React Native to an existing native app. Let's see how to do this and how it's working internally!\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
