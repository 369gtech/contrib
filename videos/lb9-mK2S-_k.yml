recordingDate: 1546423885
description: "It’s almost midnight. My daughter and I are looking for jumpers, matrices and resistors. There is a bug in the game we’re building, and it doesn’t seem as if we are going to bed anytime soon.\nTeaching kids recursion and data structures didn’t create the thrill I thought it would. But building games does! \n\nIn this talk, Uri (father) and Roni (daughter) talk about introducing kids to the world of programing, Scratch, Arduino, Ali Express orders and hot glue. They talk about the different approaches to teaching programming to kids, and what they believe is the right one.\nAnd why girls at school are anxious about coding? Is it a boy’s club before high-school already?\n\nUri Nativ is the Co-founder of Torii (www.toriihq.com), which brings order into the chaotic SaaS world. He’s a Maker. Engineer by mind, People manager by heart. With over 19 years of software engineering experience both as an engineer as well as a hands-on manager. Uri founded Klarna Engineering centre in Tel-Aviv and held the position of VP Engineering & Site Manager. He’s currently on his new quest building his new startup Torii.\n\nRoni Nativ is a 12 years old kid. She loves writing, baking, acting, playing the flute, dancing and watching cool TV shows. She has found that playing with Arduino is really fun :)"
