description: "Microservices architecture redefined the concept of a modern application as a set of independent, distributed and loosely-coupled services running in the cloud. Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building such services and connecting them with shared messaging systems. In this hands on session we’ll look at some of the new features and enhancements that are already part of the 2.0 line. We will also discuss what we are working on and what to expect.\n\nSpeaker:\nOleg Zhurakousky\nSoftware Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
