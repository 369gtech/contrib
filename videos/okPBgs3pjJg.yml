language: English
recordingDate: 1634675172
description: "Join us on this weekly Office Hours for Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database, where Bhoopendra Singh, Implementation Specialist - DWH, Lake, Analytics, Data Science and AI will present the concepts about the Time Series algorithms available in Oracle Database, and will do a Live Demo on OML Notebooks.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning product family supports data scientists, analysts, developers, and IT to achieve data science project goals faster while taking full advantage of the Oracle platform.\n\nThe Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks offers an easy-to-use, interactive, multi-user, collaborative interface based on Apache Zeppelin notebook technology, and support SQL, PL/SQL, Python and Markdown interpreters. It is available on all Autonomous Database versions and Tiers, including the always-free editions.\n\nOML includes AutoML, which provides automated machine learning algorithm features for algorithm selection, feature selection and model tuning, in addition to a specialized AutoML UI exclusive to the Autonomous Database.\n\nOML Services is also included in Autonomous Database, where you can deploy and manage native in-database OML models as well as ONNX ML models (for classification and regression) built using third-party engines, and can also invoke cognitive text analytics.\n\n00:50 Topics for today\n01:08 Upcoming Sessions\n02:06 Time Series Forecasting\n02:48 Time Series in OML\n05:28 Time Series Patterns\n08:52 Exponential Smoothing\n10:40 Simple Exponential Smoothing\n11:31 Models with Trend but no Seasonality\n12:46 Models with Seasonality but no Trend\n13:52 Models with Trend and Seasonality\n14:45 Demo: Forecasting Sales using Exponential Smoothing for Time Series\n30:21 Q&A"
