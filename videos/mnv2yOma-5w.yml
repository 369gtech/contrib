description: "Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. \n\nThe RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. \n\nPost-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.\n\nInterested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.\n\n-----\n\nCode to Inspire empowers young women in developing countries to drive economic and social progress by teaching them how to code, find programming jobs and launch technology ventures. Code to Inspire (CTI) was established in 2015 starting in Afghanistan as the first coding school for young women by Computer Science Professor and former refugee Fereshteh Forough. The nonprofit training program has taught 150 young women how to code, build mobile apps and games. Over 70% of graduates have found work, earning above-average wages in their country.\n\nhttps://abstractions.io/schedule/#Building%20Afghanistan%202.0%20with%20#AfghanGirlsCode-Fereshteh%20Forough"
