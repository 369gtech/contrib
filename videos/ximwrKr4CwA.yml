description: "About the topic:\nWix transitioned from monolith to microservices around 8 years ago. Or did it? We have hundreds of microservices in production with teams working on separate independent services or groups of services with decoupled deployments and SLAs. Sounds like a microservice architecture, but there is a dark truth to it – single platform (jvm), shared libraries (framework), fat clients (binary dependencies). In industry it is called a distributed monolith. There is no easy way or incentive to get rid of it. But there is a way!\nLet me tell you a story on how much fun it was, what path we took and where we are now with getting to a proper polyglot microservice architecture.\n\nJohn About Vilius:\nGuild Master @ Wix with experience in different roles and companies (enterprise, start-up, you name it). No matter how much life/circumstances are pushing me to lead/management roles, I always find ways to come back and keep on hacking.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/viliusl\nGitHub: https://github.com/viliusl"
