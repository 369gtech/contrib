description: "Keynote presented by Angel Diaz, Vice President, IBM Standards and Cloud Labs, IBM.\n\nToday's business leaders face a significant challenge: to engage their customers in new, innovative ways, and to deliver continuously enhanced products, with more function, faster than their competition. Savvy business leaders recognize these challenges present an opportunity. However, to fully realize that opportunity, they need to break beyond the barriers of yesterday's closed systems. IBM's Dr. Angel Diaz will talk about how an open cloud architecture, based on Cloud Foundry, can help enterprises take full advantage of this opportunity."
