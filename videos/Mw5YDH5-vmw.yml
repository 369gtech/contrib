description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nPanel: Bringing The Cloud To Kubernetes - Matthew Christopher, Microsoft, Dan Mangum, Upbound, Joyce Ma, Google and Jay Pipes, AWS, Moderated by: Nic Cope, Upbound\n\nOrganisations are increasingly realising that the Kubernetes approach to infrastructure orchestration can be applied to much more than just containers. Each of the major cloud providers are working on projects that use the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) to model their APIs. Similarly, Crossplane aims to model all cloud APIs (and more!) using a superset of the KRM that we think of as the Crossplane Resource Model (or XRM). In this session engineers from the Amazon Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK), Azure Service Operator (ASO), Google Config Connector, and Crossplane projects will discuss the common challenges of building a consistent experience atop a myriad of heterogeneous cloud APIs."
