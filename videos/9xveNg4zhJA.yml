title: 'Modernizing an existing system to take a more domain-driven approach - William Penberthy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1606899476
description: "Domain-driven design seems “straight-forward” when looking at green field development. Implementing that in an existing enterprise system, however, is daunting.\n\nIn this session we will go over some of the refactoring patterns that support this change and we will demonstrate the steps necessary to refactor a non-DDD SOA-based system using DDD approaches. We will talk about the kinds of decisions that have to be made, when they need to be made, and what those decisions look like in the grand scheme of your refactor.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
