description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Janne Valkealahti\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-one2gx-2014springyarn\nBig Data Track\nSpring's goal, like any good framework, has always been to handle the infrastructure so you can focus on your application code. Join this session to see how Spring provides a simple programming model to develop applications than can easily be tested and deployed as either a YARN application or a traditional application. No longer will you need to struggle with 3rd party library build and packaging issues, XML, and how the YARN Appmasters, Clients and Resource Managers all work together. The magic of Spring Boot, Spring XD, and Spring for Apache Hadoop just make it all work so you can get coding!"
