description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary 11, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nToday's large-scale IR systems are not implemented using general-purpose database systems, as the latter tend to be significantly less efficient than custom-built IR engines. This talk demonstrates how recent developments in hardware-conscious database architecture may however satisfy IR needs. The advantage is flexibility of experimentation, as implementing a retrieval system on top of a DBMS boils down to relational query formulation, rather than system programming. We demonstrate in the context of the TeraByte TREC efficiency task that our experimental MonetDB/X100 database system provides highly competitive results both regarding precision and..."
