description: "Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality: A Match Made in Heaven\n\nWe begin with a story, the story of how I went from a painter to an artist working in the latest technologies. I will discuss how I fell into this line of research in my masters and how I am hooked on it now. I will provide practical knowledge about developing AR applications, using Machine learning and marrying the two together. I will explore web GL and new mobile versions of machine learning frameworks and how they relate to modes of mixed reality.\n\nI am an artist working with 3D modelling, Augmented Reality and Machine Learning. My work explores posthuman and postgender concepts using classical art combined with new media techniques and programming.\n\nI have recently undertaken a masters degree and changed focus to more technologically based digital art using physics based rendering, Deep Neural Networks and Unity to develop an Augmented Reality mobile application.\n\nFor more on YOW!
