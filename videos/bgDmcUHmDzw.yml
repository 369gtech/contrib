title: 'Natale Vinto & Rafael Cardona - Building Supercomputers Using Kubernetes and OpenHPC'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620219715
description: "Supercomputers mean different things for different people, here it refers to computational systems that perform at the highest operational rate by enabling parallel computing. Parallel tasks execution requires a cluster system architecture, groups of processors which are organized into hundreds or thousands of nodes, and where those nodesâ€™ CPUs communicate via shared memory. Nodes are interconnected with a communication fabric that is organized as a network. In the center of all these resources operate highly efficient and configurable schedulers that dispatch and monitor the tasks execution.\n\nThe nodes have been traditionally worker units that run their own Operating Systems. However modern IT architectures have brought a great number of opportunities and new ways of thinking in software technology and IT operations. Kubernetes has disrupted the IT world, and it is steadily becoming a standard.\n\nIts capabilities now allow building, deploying, running and managing modern enterprise applications at scale. The question is, can kubernetes enable infrastructure for HPC workloads, bringing the best of both worlds to build supercomputers?"
