It its often used in IoT applications, so it fits well in many Nerves projects. Tortoise is a MQTT client for Elixir. It started its life as a MQTT 3.1.1 client, but is in the progress of getting an upgrade to the latest version of MQTT; version 5. Martin will introduce MQTT; give an overview of the new features in MQTT 5; how Tortoise is designed to make MQTT easy to work with in Elixir, and how MQTT 5 will influence that design.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/martin-gausby/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MARTIN GAUSBY\nCreator of the Tortoise MQTT client\n\nMartin is a long time Elixir developer with a keen interest in implementing network protocols. For the last couple of years he has been working with Erlang and Elixir systems for a living, and during that time spent way too much time tinkering with his Emacs configuration. Besides that he has a horrible taste in music, enjoys coffee, mechanical keyboards, and is a friend of the podcast.\n\nMore on Martin Gausby: https://codesync.global/speaker/martin-gausby/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
