recordingDate: 1523543797
description: "With the advent of distributed systems with such as Docker and Kubernetes, it was truly only a matter of time before our data solutions obtained the same structural needs. This talk will take a look at the history of databases, from relational databases like PostGres, to NoSQL solutions, to sharding, and truly distributed databases like Crate.io.\n\nWith each step, this talk will highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each system with an eye toward security, sanity, and the future."
