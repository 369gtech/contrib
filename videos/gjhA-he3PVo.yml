description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2012.\nSpeakers: Wes Williams, Vaughn Vernon\nSponsored by EMC Consulting, this presentation highlights the use of Domain-Driven Design in a cloud-based, distributed architecture. There are several working examples of highly scalable DDD models featuring the NYSE Nanotrader system.\n\nNanoTrader is a VMWare working reference implementation featuring SpringSource best-practices throughout the application stack. The functioning high-performance trading application includes Spring MVC with both web and mobile UI's, Spring Integration, RabbitMQ, GemFire, Hibernate using SQLFire and/or Postgres. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a set of software development tools and best practices for crafting a business strategic initiative in a core domain model. How does NanoTrader apply DDD? This powerful approach to modeling a trading system will be showcased from the DDD strategic and tactical modeling perspectives."
