description: "D3 and React, who should control the DOM? After all, React’s whole purpose is managing updates to the DOM so we don’t have to. D3, on the other hand, is a library for building data visualizations, and it too needs access to the DOM. And stepping back, when should we even use D3 and React together? In this talk, I will give guidelines on when React should have ownership of the DOM, and when D3 should instead. More importantly, I will cover the interactions and applications that will benefit the most from using D3 and React, together.\n\nEVENT:\n\nReactiveConf 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nShirley Xueyang Wu\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nReactiveConf Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nReactiveConf web-site: https://reactiveconf.com/"
