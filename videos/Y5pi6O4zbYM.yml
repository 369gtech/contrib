description: "This session presents a case study of a complete transition of citizen services to an open source platform, combining NoSQL, Camel, SOA techniques, and proven Java EE technologies. It shows how a scalable, distributed, secure system was built with modular rapid development techniques. The system integrates disparate proprietary and legacy systems into a fast, modern open source solution and puts the information necessary from each government entity into the hands of the citizens.\n\n\nAuthors:\nJeff Genender\nundefined\nView more trainings by Jeff Genender at https://www.parleys.com/author/jeff-genender\n\nJohan Edstrom\nJohan Edstrom is an open source software evangelist, Apache developer and seasoned architect; he has created Java architectures for large scalable, high transaction monitoring, financial and open source systems.\n\nJohan has worked as development lead, infrastructure manager, IT lead, programmer and guided several large companies to success in the use of open source software components.\n\nLately he has been helping some of the worlds largest networking companies and medical startups achieve high availability, scalability and dynamically adapting SOA systems.
