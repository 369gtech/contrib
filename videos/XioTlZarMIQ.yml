description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nCREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE WITH EXABCI AND TENDERMINT\nby Tian Chen\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nBlockchain\nDapp\nABCI\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nTendermint is a consensus engine that helps engineers to build various blockchain. It proposed an interface called ABCI (Application BlockChain Interface). ExAbci implemented the interface for elixir. This talk will focus on how to use ExAbci to build a decentralized database on top of it, making the database can survive all kinds of failure of 1/3 of nodes.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/tian-chen/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - TIAN CHEN\noverseer, ex_abci\n\nTian Chen has over fifteen years of experience working in the software industry.
