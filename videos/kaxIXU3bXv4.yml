title: 'Rob Richardson – Databases in the Microservices World'
recordingDate: 1626686981
description: "Web technologies have come leaps and bounds. But are you still using the tired old database from last generation? Let's look at the methodology of microservices, compare it to bounded contexts, and look at ops tasks for micro-databases. Let's tour all the flavors of databases, understand their pros and cons, and when you would choose it. You'll leave with a roadmap for moving from data-monolith to micro-databases.\n\nSpeaker:\nRob Richardson – https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/member/rob-richardson\n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/databases-microservices-world"
