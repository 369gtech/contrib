description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2015.\nSpeaker: John T Davies\nBig Data track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/microservices-to-fastdata-in-the-enterprise-with-spring\n\nHow do you deal with massive volumes of data, hundreds of thousands per second? Just chuck it into RAM but what about GC? If we scale to terabytes we need to distribute, what about serialisation costs? How do micro services fit in? In this talk weâ€™ll be using Spring Integration and Spring Boot to ingest gigabytes of complex data into an two different in memory data grids (IMDGs). Based on applications running in production this talk will walk through the design and implementation with several demos."
