description: 'The hospitality industry, with its high-volume of consumer-driven transactions, has been under immense pressure to change to accommodate new standards such as EMV into their flow. Because Radtab builds solutions for hospitality businesses to navigate all the change, we get a front row seat to see how EMV, POS integration, tokenization, ApplePay, etc., are all affecting not just hospitality, but all businesses with a physical presence. This talk will give you a map thatâ€™ll help you navigate the dynamic region where card-present and card-not-present transactions collide.'
