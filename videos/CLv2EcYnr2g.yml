title: 'Gunnar Morling & Hans-Peter Grahsl – Change Data Streaming Patterns in Distributed Systems'
recordingDate: 1629714190
description: "Microservices are one of the big trends in software engineering of the last few years; organising business functionality in several self-contained, loosely coupled services helps teams to work efficiently, make the most suitable technical decisions, and react quickly to new business requirements.\n\nIn this session we'll discuss and showcase how open-source change data capture (CDC) with Debezium can help developers with typical challenges they often face when working on microservices. Come and join us to learn how to:\n\n* Employ the outbox pattern for reliable, eventually consistent data exchange between microservices, without incurring unsafe dual writes or tight coupling\n\n* Gradually extract microservices from existing monolithic applications, using CDC and the strangler fig pattern\n\n* Coordinate long-running business transactions across multiple services using CDC-based saga orchestration, ensuring such activity gets consistently applied or aborted by all participating services\n\nSpeaker:\nGunnar Morling – \nHans-Peter Grahsl – \n\nMore: https://2021.berlinbuzzwords.de/session/change-data-streaming-patterns-distributed-systems"
