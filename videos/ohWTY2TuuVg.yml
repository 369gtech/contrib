description: "Building strong, extensible code is the goal for most developers. Lately in the rush to get products shipped, it seems more and more that we are relying on code pieced together so it ìjust worksî. Using programming patterns are key to breaking that cycle and creating better, more manageable code. This talk discusses some of the more common programming patterns that developers can use to increase reliability, extensibility and performance. We’ll cover core patterns like Flyweight, State, Prototype and even the dreaded Singleton. Throughout the presentation, we’ll look at real examples from game development to show you why, when, and how to use these patterns in the real world. If you are a developer looking to build bigger and more complex projects or just looking to increase your skills, this talk is for you.\n\nMickey MacDonald\nTechnical Evangelist, Microsoft\nhttps://twitter.com/ScruffyFurn\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
