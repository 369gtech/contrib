description: "I'll explain PyTorch's key features and compare it to the current most popular deep learning framework in the world (Tensorflow). We'll then write out a short PyTorch script to get a feel for the syntax. This library is becoming popular pretty fast, such is the nature of this incredible field. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/pytorch_in_5_minutes\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like.
