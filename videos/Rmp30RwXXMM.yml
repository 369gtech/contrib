title: 'Building your first malicious chrome extension - Alon Kiriati'
recordingDate: 1575188252
description: "Building chrome extension is so simple & fun. In this talk, Alon explains the basics of building your first chrome extension, in just a couple of minutes! We will then talk about the various ways to turn your awesome extension to a malicious one. The main purpose here is not to turn you into a hacker, but instead to understand the risks of extensions, and to increase awareness to these \"small\" and \"harmless\" plugins.\n\nBio: A full stack developer for the last 10+ years. Alon started from the very low level of RT/Embedded and went all the way \"up\" to react/js. Enthusiastic about culture, tech, product and ping pong. Alon believes everything in the world can be expressed with emojis, and usually checks that every text box he encounter supports them."
