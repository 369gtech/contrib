description: "WebAssembly brings a new capability to the web, delivering a performant run-time to allow compiled languages such as C++ to be used in web applications. In this video, Alex Danilo and Deepti Gandluri introduce the principles for using WebAssembly in a web application, techniques for debugging, and demonstrate a real-world example of a large code-base built to run in the browser for production deployment. They also present future features coming to Web Assembly along with some tips for how to deploy and support older browsers using a graceful degradation approach.\n\nEVENT:\n\nChrome Dev Summit 2017\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAlex Danilo\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nThe original video was published on Google Chrome Developers YouTube channel with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpuAqLCraAQ"
