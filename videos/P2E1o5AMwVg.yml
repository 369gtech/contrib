language: English
recordingDate: 1433235055
description: "When building and maintaining large applications in a world that is rapidly evolving, keeping up with changing requirements and nonfunctionals over time is a huge challenge. Architecting your application in a modular way and loosely coupling modules by using microservices provides you with a nicely decoupled system that still works very efficiently. Designing, evolving, and versioning a microservice architecture is not easy, and over time several design patterns and best practices have evolved that can help you. This session provides an overview of these patterns and practices and gives examples taken from real-world systems the presenter has worked on over the last decade.\n\n\nAuthor:\nMarcel Offermans\nMarcel is a fellow at Luminis and the Director at Luminis Technologies. As a software architect he has a broad experience in different operating systems, languages and applications, ranging from enterprise applications to mobile, embedded and distributed systems. He has been involved in lots of commercial OSGi projects for over ten years and is responsible for the architecture, development and support of an OSGi and cloud based software provisioning product.
