description: "Nat Dudley\nhttp://linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/80/\nHistory's first programmer took inspiration from the complexities of weaving fabric on a loom. Why? Because fiber-craft is binary code, built up into complex patterns following complex logic.\r\n\r\nLike weaving, knitting is code. From wartime ciphers to modern development, knitted code has many secrets technologists can learn from.\r\n\r\nUsing the lens of knitting, we'll explore the lessons 1000+ years of practice taught some of our earliest coders about community, design, documentation, choosing your tools, fixing your mistakes, and programming fallacies."
