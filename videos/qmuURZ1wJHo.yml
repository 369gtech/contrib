Do they have bionic sensing abilities? What is the magical blend of traits and temperaments that makes a great UX-er?\nSamantha Yuen interviewed 20 UX practitioners, researchers and ethnographers worldwide and uncovers some surprises that may cause you to re-evaluate your assumptions about the profession. She will also share her process for this study -- from designing questions to identifying insights.\nExpect an interactive session -- boys welcome too! (Bring a girl along!)\n\n(Video produced by Engineers.sg)\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/WCke/"
