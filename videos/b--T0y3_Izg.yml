recordingDate: 1497042462
description: "Nell Shamrell-Harrington, Sr. Software Development Engineer at Chef - ChefConf 2017\n\nThe challenge of balancing the need for security with the need for usability is nothing new. Managing secrets when using configuration management tools like Chef is no exception to this rule. Add in the fact that there are multiple tools attempting to solve this problem - each with advantages and drawbacks - and the balance becomes even more precarious! This talk will provide a brief overview of secrets management and then take a deep, technical dive into one tool in particular - Chef Vault. You will walk away understanding how it works - what theories and technologies drive it - as well as how to use it and evaluate whether Chef Vault is the right tool for your particular need. You will also walk away knowing the limitations of Chef Vault - it is not the right tool for every secrets management situation - and how to evaluate whether you safely can work around those limits or need to look at another tool."
