language: English
recordingDate: 1541120981
description: "Writing code that is resilient upon errors has always been a pain point in all languages. Exceptions are the politically correct means to signal errors in C++, but many applications still resort to error codes for reasons related to ease of understanding, ease of handling errors locally, and efficiency of generated code. \n\nThis talk shows how a variety of theoretical and practical artifacts can be combined together to address error codes and exceptions in one wholesome, simple package. The generic type expected＜T＞ can be used for both local (error-code-style) and centralized (exception-style) manners, drawing from the strengths of each.\n\nEVENT:\n\nCppCon 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAndrei Alexandrescu\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nCppCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video."
