title: 'YOW! 2012 Justin Sheehy - Concurrency, Consensus, and Consistency in the Real World'
language: English
recordingDate: 1513433789
description: "Most programmers’ experience with distributed consensus is either purely theoretical (“well, I read a bunch of Paxos papers”) or based entirely on specific systems (“we solve all of our consistency problems with Zookeeper”) and this has an unfortunate consequence: many production systems have behavior that is not fully understood by anyone at all. Justin will break down the barrier between theory and practice by discussing exactly what promises various real, deployed systems can make when it comes to consistency in the face of failure.\n\nJustin Sheehy is the CTO of Basho Technologies, the company behind the creation of Webmachine and Riak. As Chief Technology Officer, Justin Sheehy directs Basho’s technical strategy, including integration with other platforms and new research into storage and distributed systems. Most recently before Basho, he was a principal scientist at the MITRE Corporation and a senior architect for systems infrastructure at Akamai. At both of those companies he focused on multiple aspects of robust distributed systems, including scheduling algorithms, language-based formal models, and resilience. Software Passion: I am passionate about solving important problems by bringing ideas and techniques across technical domains in unusual ways.\n\nFor more on YOW!
