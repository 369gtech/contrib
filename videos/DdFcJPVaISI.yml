description: "Philip Lindsay \n\nTroublemaker/Artisan, rancidbacon.com\n\nPhilip Lindsay (also known as follower from rancidbacon.com ) creates tools to encapsulate the knowledge he gains from exploring and understanding technology in order to help others do their jobs more effectively. He translates technology.\n\nIn addition to teaching introductory Arduino workshops Philip has contributed USB and networking code to the Arduino eco-system.\n\nWhen not exploring technology for the fun of it, Philip creates documentation, code libraries and example projects for SparkFun Electronics and other clients.\n\nTim O'Reilly once called Philip a \"troublemaker\" for his early Google Maps reverse engineering efforts.\n\nPhilip has a particular interest in the areas where design, art, craft and technology intersect.\n\nFollow my project logs at Labradoc."
