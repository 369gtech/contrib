description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nServerless Workflow – New Approach to Container Orchestration - Tihomir Surdilovic & Ricardo Zanini Fernandes, Red Hat \n\nWith the rise of Serverless Architectures, Workflows have gained a renewed interest and usefulness. Typically thought of as centralized and monolithic, they now play a key role in service and events orchestration and coordination. With many different architecture approaches already in place, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation has started an initiative to specify Serverless Workflows Specification to ensure portability and vendor neutrality. In this talk, we introduce the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification and provide examples and demos running on Kubernetes and Kogito, Red Hat’s business automation toolkit. You will learn: * The what, why, and how of the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification * Why using the Serverless Workflow specification and orchestration can improve your serverless architecture * Define and deploy Serverless Workflow custom resources on Kubernetes \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekEn"
