description: "Announced in late 2018, Jetpack Navigation is still comparatively new yet powerful collection of tools that is advocated by Google since it was released. It simplifies and regulates how we navigate from one screen to another by providing necessary equipment and rules.\n\nDuring this year we've been experimenting with Jetpack Navigation and have put it to the test under complex navigation scenarios including nested navigation hosts and modal screens that look differently on tablets and phones and we saw how navigation architecture component performs in a multi-module well-tested codebase.\n\nIn this talk we will go over various case studies where we pushed Jetpack Navigation to its limits and we will share our findings regarding its strengths and weaknesses."
