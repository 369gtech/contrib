title: 'YOW! 2015 - Reid Draper - Production Haskell'
recordingDate: 1452075650
description: "Haskell has recently begun seeing more production use, as tooling has improved dramatically (no more Cabal hell), and the language features are particularly well-suited to the problems challenging many organizations (i.e. concurrency and multi-core scalability). In this talk, we’ll see how Helium, a startup using Haskell, builds, deploys, monitors, tests, and writes Haskell in production.\n\nReid Draper is a functional programmer and distributed systems engineer at Helium, where he leads a team making sense of IoT data. Reid is the author of Clojure’s test.check, a property-based testing tool, a contributing author to The Bad Data Handbook, and has previously worked at Basho and The Echo Nest.\n\nFor more on YOW!
