description: "In the second presentation from the 2012 Northeast Scala Symposium, Miles Sabin introduces us to 'shapeless'. Generic (aka polytypic) programming involves parametrizing programs in terms of the \"shape\" of the data types they operate on, going beyond what's possible with simple type parametrization. In the Haskell world it's exemplified by Scrap your Boilerplate and related projects.\n\nShapeless is an exploration of this space in Scala, and this presentation shows some of its capabilities and applications and also explains some of the type class and dependent type based implementation techniques involved.\n\n** videos sponsored by Typesafe (http://typesafe.com) and Marakana.\n** head to http://mrkn.co/0xdu3 for slides from this presentation."
