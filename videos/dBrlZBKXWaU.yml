description: "Jerry Ward, Managing Partner, Viscosity North America\n\nJohn Singleton, Co-Founder, President and Chief Operating Officer, Watchful.io\n\nJeff Powell, Sr Software Engineer, Zenoss\n\nBuilding a self-scaling and self-healing Dockerized microservices or fast data cluster for life sciences or healthcare? Look no further than the blueprint for pattern matching at scale with the granularity, automation, redundancy, and real-time insights that only fast data orchestration can bring. This session looks at a real-life sciences use case searching the human genome for genetic patterns. Youâ€™ll see a comprehensive pattern matching application deployed in a Kubernetes cluster to illustrate the advantage of OCC for MSA and DevOps. Expanding on this use case, the presentation also explores how to leverage pattern matching at scale for many other industries."
