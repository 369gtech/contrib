Let's go over what feature completeness means and the productionizing efforts.\n\nUntil recently, we never had all the kernel and system features needed to implement work-conserving comprehensive resource control. With the recent additions of senpai, io.weight and cpu.headroom and others, we now have all pieces to implement protection, stacking and side-loading.\n\nOur focus at facebook is gradually shifting towards productionizing resource control so that service owners can obtain high resource reliability and utilization without worrying about the details.\n\nLet's go over how resource control features come together to form the basic resource profiles and how we're trying to productionize them.\n\nTejun Heo Dan Schatzberg\n\nhttps://cfp.all-systems-go.io/ASG2019/talk/KEK3MD/"
