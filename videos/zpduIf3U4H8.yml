description: "How A Major Auto Manufacturer Jumpstarted Its Transformation and Lowered Its Carbon Footprint - Thomas Kashofer, CGI B.V. Co. KG \n\nWhat happens when a manufacturing customer tells you that they have a mobility issue due to a lack of parking space and clogged roads? You create a mobile app with a PCF backend.  Listen to the story of a German company that has successfully launched a public mobile app on a brand new PCF environment within 5 months. With a team of 6 people we created a brand new one for Android and iOS smartphones. Incl. features like an integrated map, connecting to other users, sharing a ride and rating each other. We even included virtual coins and a small shop.  How?  We used all the frameworks and the power of the CF platform regarding the buildpacks for creating our containers, the marketplace for provisioning our databases and the app autoscaler for scaling the complete backend.  Within the first 4 weeks we had  5000 users and were providing 400 shared rides. The customer was happy and so were we. \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/"
