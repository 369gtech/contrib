description: "Couchbase Server is a multi-model database that natively manipulates data in key-value form or in JSON documents. Unlike relational databases which require strict predefined schema with tables and columns, Couchbase Server requires no predefined schema. Each JSON document represents its own schema and can specify its own set of attributes per document. This session is about how to Data Model Json Documents for Couchbase.\n\nClarence J M Tauro (Couchbase)\nClarence is a technology enthusiast at heart and educationist by passion with over 12 years of teaching and instructional design experience and works as a Senior Instructor for Couchbase Learning Services.
