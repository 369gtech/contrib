title: 'Micro-Service Orchestration Deep Dive by Ken Sipe'
recordingDate: 1581886527
description: "Leading technical organizations in micro-service based architectures all use an orchestrator in their datacenter; be it Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, Tupperware, the Borg or Omega. The dominate platforms in the open source space are Kubernetes and Mesos. This session will dive deep into the core difference including:\n\nPod container lifecycle differences\nIn production scaling differences\nScheduling and orchestration management difference\nReconciliation management\nResource selection (affinity vs anti-affinity)\nService discovery This is NOT a one is better than the other smack-down. There are pro/con consequences for each orchestrator.\nPresented by an engineer that has worked for over 6 years with Docker and container orchestrators. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the Kubernetes API, scheduler, controllers and operators, and how they are different than the Mesos 2-level scheduler. The session will include how resources are managed in the cluster along with pod life-cycle management. The session will call out topics of concern regarding availability and scalability and how to best manage those concerns.\n\nKen Sipe\nD2iQ\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2020 in Stockholm 5th of february\nhttp://www.jfokus.se"
