recordingDate: 1454701985
description: 'Microservices give us many options. We can pick different technologies, mix synchronous and asynchronous integration techniques or embrace different deployment patterns. But they also give us different options in how we think about securing our systems. Done right, and microservices can increase the security of your vital data and processes. Done wrong, and you can increase the surface area of attack. This talk will discuss the importance of defence in depth, discussing the many different ways in which you can secure your fine-grained, distributed architectures.'
