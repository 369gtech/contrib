description: "In this session, we dive into a couple of .NET core cases that have been reported to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). Mind you; these vulnerabilities are not just framework vulnerabilities. Instead, they are coding patterns that you may have introduced in your applications. Examples are issues with hash tables, compression, encryption, regular expressions and more. In this session, you will learn how to spot these vulnerabilities in your code. On top of that, you will walk away with the skills to fix them.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
