description: "Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build and deploy cloud native apps using common patterns in distributed systems, such as distributed configuration, client-side load-balancers, circuit breakers, API gateway, and service discovery. In this session, we’ll showcase the various Spring Cloud projects and how they overcome various distributed systems challenges like network errors, topology changes, API management, and more. We’ll also show how to start your own projects using the different Spring Cloud modules.\n\nOlga Maciaszek-Sharma: Member of Technical Staff 3, VMware; \nSpencer Gibb, Spring Cloud Core Lead, VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/introduction-to-spring-cloud"
