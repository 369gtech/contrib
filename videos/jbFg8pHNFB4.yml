description: "Robotics and Sensors Using Erlang on Embedded Systems with GRiSP\n\nGRiSP allows you to build Erlang systems running on bare metal embedded hardware. You can build robots, climate control systems and many other things. Peer will showcase and demo a robotics system, show how it's built and how they have used Erlang on the hardware itself. He'll describe all parts, so you can build your own applications. \n\n\nMore details here; http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2017/peer-stritzinger"
