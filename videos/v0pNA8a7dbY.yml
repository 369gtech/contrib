description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2019\nhttps://dddeurope.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nBreaking Illusions with Testing \n\nAs a tester, I don’t break your code, I break your *illusions* about your code. My work centers around finding the model you’re missing out on, to discover what you don’t know you don’t know, or things you know but have forgotten. I focus on identifying theories that don’t hold true in a world that is empirical. I break illusions so that with the information we have available together, we build systems worth using for various stakeholders. \n\nThis talk gives you a perspective into how a tester models an application domain through using software systems as their external imagination. We look through examples of illusions that need to be broken and skills you need to break them. \n\nIllusions come in many forms. Illusions may be about the code doing what it’s supposed to; about the product doing what it would need to; about your process is able to deliver with change in mind; people having the skills to deliver well and about the business growing with uninformed risks on the product and the business model around it. \n\nTesting is not just the technical checks but more relevantly it’s about discovering information about threats to value you’re trying to create. If you have little concern for the domain understanding, you are likely not doing a brilliant job at testing. Assume less, research more. See things others don't. \n\nBiography\nMaaret Pyhäjärvi is feedback fairy with a day job at F-Secure, where she works as Engineering Manager.
