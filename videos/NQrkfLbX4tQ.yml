title: 'Real World Active Learning - Machine Learning'
recordingDate: 1421888401
description: "Originally aired on August 21, 2014.  Machine learning research is often not applied to real world situations. Often the improvements are small and the increased complexity is high, so except in special situations, industry doesn't take advantage of advances in the academic literature.\n\nActive learning is an example where research proposes a simple strategy that makes a huge difference and almost everyone applying machine learning to real world use cases is doing it or should be doing it. Active learning is the practice of taking cases where the model has low confidence, getting them labeled, and then using those labels as input data.\n\nWebcast attendees will learn simple, practical ways to improve their models by cleaning up and tweaking the distribution of their training data. They will also learn about best practices from real world cases where active learning and data selection took models that were completely unusable in production to extremely effective.\n\nAbout Lukas Biewald\n\nLukas Biewald is the founder and CEO of CrowdFlower.
