language: English
recordingDate: 1493218972
description: "Are you starting a new application and wondering whether to go with a monolith or take the microservices path? Do you have an existing application that is getting too big to deliver business value with a predictable velocity? Ever wonder how to regain the agility you had when an application was smaller?\n\nThe current discussions around application architecture with microservices seem like an all or nothing journey without any stops along the way to catch your breath. This talk outlines questions to ask yourself to drive decisions along the way. It also demonstrates one possible path for future growth, complete with intermediate stops along the way where you can pause to evaluate your next step. This path avoids implementing too much complexity early in the process.\n\nAt the end of the journey you will not only have ideas to guide your own path, but tools that you can use to make the journey easier and less costly.\n\nABOUT MIKE GEHARD\n\nMike works at Pivotal in Boulder, Colorado. His day to day job is helping clients build software that helps their businesses succeed. When he’s not in the office, you can find him out riding his mountain bike or climbing in the hills around Boulder."
