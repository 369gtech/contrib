description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nData is often high-dimensional - millions of pixels, frequencies, categories. A lot of this detail is unnecessary for data analysis - but how much exactly? This talk will discuss the basic principles and techniques of dimensionality reduction, provide (just a little!) mathematical intuition about how it's done, and use scikit-learn to show you how Netflix uses it to lead you from binge to binge.\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
