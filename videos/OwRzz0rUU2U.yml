title: 'Message Brokers and Containers - the new ESB is “no ESB” - Michele Bustamante'
recordingDate: 1493667362
description: "A microservices strategy favors “dumb pipes” and “smart endpoints” - unlike the traditional ESB. Services own the business logic and can evolve independently with the demands of the business domain.\nMessages are a mechanism for decoupling, discovery, choreography of system workflow, event sourcing, scale and audit - but they know nothing of the business domain. This session will explore how to design a microservices solution that relies on messages and event sourcing at the core. You’ll learn techniques for approaching the design, all the way through to implementation. While concepts discussed in this session are not platform specific, Michele will illustrate with demos using Kafka, Docker and Azure Container Service based on the Mesosphere DC/OS platform."
