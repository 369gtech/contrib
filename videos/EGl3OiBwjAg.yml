title: 'Static Modularity for Java ME Embedded'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433784746
description: "The Java ME Embedded platform consists of the JVM with core and optional libraries atop it. Besides the public API, there are various proprietary APIs and functional blocks defining the platform behavior. The static modularity enables you to define fine-grained modules of the Java ME Embedded platform with explicit dependencies between them, as this session illustrates. Selecting only the required modules enables you to create a compliant consistent platform with optimized footprint and performance. That’s especially important for small embedded systems, where memory is the most valuable resource.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAndrey Petushkov\nMS in Computer Science domain of Applied Mathematics.
