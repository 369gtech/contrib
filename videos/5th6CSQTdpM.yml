description: "OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are quickly becoming mainstays for application developers. Companies want integrated authentication to reduce security footprints and users expect the convenience of single sign-on. As an application developer, it’s up to you to facilitate this in your applications.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn about OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. The focus will be on concepts and terminology, which is standard across OAuth2 providers and implementations, with the specific goal of presenting them in the simplest way possible. The session will also demonstrate how the concepts covered are used as you interact with OAuth2 providers and develop your Spring Boot and Spring Security applications.\n\nThe goal of this session is that you walk out with practical knowledge about OAuth2 and OpenID connect and the confidence to implement these technologies in applications you develop at your company.\n\nDaniel Mikusa: Senior Staff Technical Support Engineer at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/explain-it-to-me-like-im-5-oauth2-and-openid"
