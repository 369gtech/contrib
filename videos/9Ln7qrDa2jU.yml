description: "What can we learn from 800 games made of jam, 13 kb each \n\nHave you ever participated in a game jam, or tried one of those code golfing competitions? What have you learned? Does it make sense to consider byte sized game development in a world of widely available broadband connections? Do you think it's possible to go through all the entries of a given game jam and find patterns that you could use in any other competition, regardless of the restrictions or the programming language? I'll walk you through all the surprising outcomes from a particular set of size limiting rules. Join me, and together we'll explore the js13kGames competition."
