title: 'Serverless Security: Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) by Niels Tanis'

description: "Serverless is a design pattern for writing scalable applications in which Functions as a Service (FaaS) is one of the key building blocks. Every mayor Cloud Provider has got his own FaaS available. On Microsoft Azure there is Azure Functions, AWS has got Lambda and Cloud Functions can be used on the Google Cloud. All of these have a lot of similarities in the way they allow developers to create small event driven services. From security perspective there are a lot of benefits when moving to a serverless architecture. There is no need to manage any of the machines and the underlying infrastructure. Dealing with updates, patches and infrastructure is the responsibility of the platform provider. FaaS are short lived processes which will be instantiated and destroyed in a matter of milliseconds making it more resilient to denial-of-services (DoS) and also makes it harder to attack and compromise. But will all of this be sufficient to be ’secure’ or should we be worried about more? With serverless there is still a piece of software that will be developed, build, deployed and executed. It will also introduce a more complex architecture with corresponding attack surface which also makes it hard to monitor. What about the software supply chain and delivery pipeline? There still will be a need to patch your software for vulnerabilities in code and used 3rd party libraries. In this talk we will identify the security area’s we do need to focus on when developing serverless and define possible solutions for dealing with those problems.\n\nNiels Tanis has got a background in .NET development, pentesting and security consultancy. He also holds the CSSLP certification and has been involved in breaking, defending and building secure applications. He joined Veracode in 2015 and right now he works as a security researcher on a variant of languages and technologies related to Veracode’s Binary Static Analysis service. He is married, father of 2 and lives in a small village just outside Amersfoort, The Netherlands.\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
