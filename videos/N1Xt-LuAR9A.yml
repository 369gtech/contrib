description: "Recording brought to you by American Express. https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nOver the past year, Multiplatform Fever has swept the world with the promise of code sharing between iOS and Android codebases. But how does it *really* work? What compromises have to be made by both platforms in order to achieve this goal?\n\nThis talk will make a deep comparison of #Swift vs. Kotlin, you'd need a deep understanding of both languages\n\nSome topics that would be covered:\n* How do Swift consumers interact with Kotlin code (for example, generics)\n* What problems does ObjC bring to the table?\n* Fundamental differences between Swift and Kotlin today (value types/structures vs data classes, enums with associated values vs sealed classes)\n* Performance implications (build and runtime)\n* Current problems + best practices to avoid them\n\nAttendees will leave this talk with a better understanding of what problems still exist, yet feel encouraged to start dabbling in their current codebases.\n\nResources:\nKotlinConf website: https://jb.gg/fyaze5\nKotlinConf on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlinconf\n\nKotlin website: https://jb.gg/pxrsn6\nKotlin blog: https://jb.gg/7uc7ow\nKotlin on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kotlin\n\n#KotlinConf19 #Kotlin #JetBrains\n\nAbout the Presenter:\nJohn is an Android engineer at Square, working on Cash App. Contributor to Wire, Picasso and LeakCanary.
