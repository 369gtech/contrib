description: "Code review is a vital tool for any team of a size greater than one. Though it's intuitive that code review breeds better code, there are a couple of other less obvious benefits. Code review is an effective tool to organically share knowledge of your codebase across your team. This lets developers naturally share information about new features, design patterns, APIs, and dependent libraries across the team. In turn, this dissemination of knowledge reduces organizational risk by decreasing your team's \"bus factor\" and breaking down exclusive silos of knowledge held by senior team members. For these reasons, code review is a must for any professional development team.\n\nAttendees will walk away with a solid understanding of popular code review methodologies, and the knowledge to implement an appropriate code review process for their team, incorporating their current development practices and version control systems. If you're already practicing code review, you'll gain some valuable insight into Atlassian's world-class review processes, and some tips and tricks for improving how your developers collaborate on a shared codebase.\n\nMarcus is a Python Engineer working on Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud. He has been with Atlassian since 2011, where he started in the Cloud Support team. He's been a part of the Bitbucket team for nearly 5 years, 3 of which as an engineer."
