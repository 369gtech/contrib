description: "http://fluentconf.com\nMany designers and developers don't realize that, even if they have no interest in doing server side JavaScript development, NodeJS offers a wide array of useful command line tools that they can integrate to improve their development workflow. In this session, we'll cover a handful of examples including UglifyJS, Grunt, GruntIcon, JSHint and HTTPster. We'll walk through what each tool is useful for, how to install them, how to configure them and show them in use. By the end of the session, attendees will leave with both a handful of tools they might use today, but also an awareness of the types of CLI tools being built with Node."
