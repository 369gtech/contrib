title: 'REACT & ES6: A Match Made in Heaven'
recordingDate: 1475143523
description: "Both React and ES6 can provide a significant productivity boost for developing applications in JavaScript. When combined, this productivity boost is increased even more.  In this session I conduct live-coding exercises that highlight how ES6 and React complement each other. We will see that together they reduce development effort, increase development velocity, and make the process more enjoyable. l introduce the concept of DSLs, their pros and cons, and we will see a practical example  and build our very own tax calculation DSL using TypeScript.\n\nDan Shappir is a performance specialist at Wix.com in the Editor group.
