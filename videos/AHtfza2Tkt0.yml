description: "The permanent generation in Oracle’s HotSpot JVM held metadata that HotSpot used to describe Java objects. The permanent generation was garbage collected along with the Java heap during full GC. The permanent generation has been removed in HotSpot for JDK8. This session briefly describes the permanent generation and the motivation for its removal. It also discusses side effects of the removal that may affect the execution of a Java application.\n\n\nAuthor:\nColeen Phillimore\nColeen Phillimore is a long standing member of the Hotspot Java virtual machine runtime group.\nView more trainings by Coleen Phillimore at https://www.parleys.com/author/coleen-phillimore\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
