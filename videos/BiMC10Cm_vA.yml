description: "Kenni Bawden\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/RZCSSP\n\nCreating learning environments for teaching students programming and cyber security skills is hard.\r\nDo we give them professional software engineering  environments? They'll learn something \"real\" but they will likely only understand a fraction of the context.\r\nDo we use a small, safe educational environment?\r\nThey'll understand all of the concepts, but they may be hard to translate into practical, open-ended projects and they'll never learn to thrive.\r\n\r\nHow can we select or craft environments that give us the best of both worlds?\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 13:20:00 2020 at Floperator"
