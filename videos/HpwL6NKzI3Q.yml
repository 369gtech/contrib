description: "❗️ATTENTION ❗️\nRegistration to 🚀DevTernity 2018 is running:\n✅ https://devternity.com\n\nTaxify is the largest taxi booking app in Eastern Europe, handling over 100 000 rides every month and expanding rapidly. Taxify aggregates traditional taxi companies with a sleek user facing mobile app, that connects passengers to licensed taxis at the push of a button. This speech will cover a little bit of everything about Taxify's product engineering - who are our customers, how do we build the products, what's our engineering process and culture. We'll also take a look at what are the different challenges in building mobile apps, backoffice and real-time backend systems."
