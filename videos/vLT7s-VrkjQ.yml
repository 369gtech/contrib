description: "How do dormant cyber pathogens spread? Do hackers really wear hoodies while they hack? And how hard is to become a genuine, bona fide evil cyber hacker anyway?\n\nThese and many more burning cyber security questions will be tackled in a non-stop action packed look at the state of online security.In this talk, you’ll see you’ll see just how bad the state of security is today; how easy it is to find risks, the extent of vulnerable code that’s out there and just how ill-equipped organisations are to handle it when everything goes wrong. It’s a real world look at the industry that will entertain, horrify and compel us all to do more in protecting our valuable online assets. Discover how to improve your own systems by learning from those that have failed to do so in the past."
