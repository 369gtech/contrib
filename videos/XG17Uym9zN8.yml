title: 'Get along with JHipster (Dmytro Panin, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1468312230
description: "JHipster is a trendy Yeoman generator that provides the possibility to create an AngularJS + Spring Boot project from the scratch in no time. I would like to share the idea of JHipster and a set of tools that it comprises. I will superficially cover scaffolding and the explicit tool, that makes scaffolding plain and easy to adopt, named Yeoman.\n\nStarted in October 2013, JHipster has grown and obtained a developing community, furthermore, it is growing rapidly as for the past year about 150 programmers contributed to it. During the presentation, I want to perform a live demonstration of creating a new project based on the aforementioned core and a few subsidiary technologies. Since JHipster includes a great deal of technologies itâ€™s a good source of common practices."
