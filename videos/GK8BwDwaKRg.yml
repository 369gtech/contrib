And horrifyingly, computer science is at the bottom of the class. In this talk, Mary will consider the current sorry state of computer science in academia, why we have ended up here, and what we can do.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/mary-sheeran/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - MARY SHEERAN\n\nMary Sheeran has been a functional programming enthusiast for nearly 40 years, at Oxford University, Glasgow University and now Chalmers University of Technology, where she has been a full professor since 1999. She was designing and using a functional hardware description language before there were hardware description languages, and she contributed to the development of SAT-based methods for verifying hardware. She has been supervisor to a great bunch of doctoral students too. \n\nThis has all entailed working mostly with men. A couple of years ago, her university asked its staff \"How would you like to change Chalmers?\" and the answer was obvious to her: increase gender equality, aiming for excellence. The resulting proposal was funded to the tune of about 30 million euros and work on the Genie initiative began last January, with Mary as co-leader.\n\nMore on Mary Sheeran: https://codesync.global/speaker/mary-sheeran/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 19\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
