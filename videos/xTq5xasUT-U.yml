description: "IMAP, JMAP and the future of open email standards a look at what's new in the IMAP world and the upcoming JMAP standard\nby Bron Gondwana\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.2215/email_standards.webm\n\n\nIn the past couple of years there's been renewed enthusiasm for improving the open source email client standards, with multiple new IMAP standards becoming RFCs, and a revision of the base IMAP standards currently in evaluation. As the working group co-chair of both the JMAP (new email standard) and EXTRA (updating existing standards) working groups at IETF, I've been following email standards closely.  I'll talk about what's happening in both working groups, how to find the specifications, and some cool new things you can do as an email client (or server) author. \n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 15:40:00+01"
