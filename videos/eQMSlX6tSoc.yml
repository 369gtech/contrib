description: "It will destroy us, it will save us, it will get our projects funded. Technology is such a big hammer that everything can look like a nail. But what if technology isn’t a tool at all? Perhaps it’s a distraction, or perhaps it’s just a new place to stand.\n\nIn this talk, Micah shares the story of her relationship with technology, from a childhood obsession to a Silicon Valley career, and now to a creative practice that asks how we can use these skills to reimagine the world around us.\n\nMicah Elizabeth Scott\nArt Engineer, misc.name\nhttps://twitter.com/scanlime\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
