title: 'ClojureScript - It''s not just the language - Christian Johansen'
recordingDate: 1533029028
description: "ClojureScript is a functional programming language (a Lisp, to be specific) that can be used to develop web frontends and node.js apps in lieu of JavaScript. I'd say it's currently the best way to develop web frontends, but the language is only one part of it.\nThe development environment that's grown up around it is what truly makes it shine, whether it's hot reload with Figwheel, instant evaluation of any piece of code in the context of your app state in a REPl, a la carte typing with clojure.spec, or the client-side database Datascript. We'll also take a look at how ClojureScript forces you to write code in a physically completely different way and why that's a good thing along with some of the most useful language features. Buckle up!"
