title: 'General Purpose Big Data Systems are eating the world: Tool consolidation -inevitable?Holden Karau'
recordingDate: 1529499935
description: 'Every-time there is a new piece of big data technology we often see many different specific implementations of the concepts, which often eventually consolidate down to a few viable options, and then frequently end up getting rolled into part of another larger project. This talk will examine this trend in big data ecosystem, look at the exceptions to the "rule", and look at how better interchange formats like Apache Arrow have the potential to change this going forward. In addition to general vague happy feelings (or sad depending on your ideas about how software should be made), this talk will look at some specific examples with deep learning, so if anyone is looking for a little bit of pixie dust to sprinkle on a failing business plan to take to silicon valley to raise a series A, you''ll get something out this as well.'
