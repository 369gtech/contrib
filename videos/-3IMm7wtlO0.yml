title: 'Tyler Akidau: Foundations of streaming SQL or: How I learned to love stream and table theory'
recordingDate: 1542728194
description: "What does it mean to execute robust streaming queries in SQL? What is the relationship of streaming queries to classic relational queries? Are streams and tables the same thing conceptually, or different? And how does all of this relate to the programmatic frameworks like we’re all familiar with? This talk will address all of those questions in two parts, providing a survey of core points from chapters 6 and 8 in the recently published Streaming Systems book. \nFirst, we’ll explore the relationship between the Beam Model for data processing (as described in The Dataflow Model paper and the Streaming 101 and Streaming 102 blog posts) and stream & table theory (as popularized by Martin Kleppmann and Jay Kreps, amongst others, but essentially originating out of the database world). It turns out that stream & table theory does an illuminating job of describing the low-level concepts that underlie the Beam Model. \n - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/crunch"
