description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nIn the 1970s, NASA developed the Technical Readiness Level (TRL) scale to measure research and development of cutting edge technology. While several engineering bodies use this scale, web-focused engineering has left it behind. This talk will explore TRL scales and how we can use them to measure and guide success of data science teams to build a true vision of \"full stack data science.\"\n\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
