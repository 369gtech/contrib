description: 'Now Xamarin has been bought by Microsoft there is even more talk about it. In this session I will walk you through the development process of a real life Xamarin Forms application. The session will include a quick overview about difference between normal Xamarin development and Xamarin Forms. After that we will do a deep dive into the development tools and design patterns used to develop the application. It will show how you can create native apps with 90% code sharing among Android, iOS and Windows.'
