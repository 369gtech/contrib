description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nLUX - AN EXPECT LIKE TEST TOOL\nby Cons T Ahs\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nTest \nFrame\nwork\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nLUX is an open source test tool written in Erlang and mostly used for testing Erlang code.  But as a user of the tool you do not need to bother about that. It provides a highly automated test environment where it is simple to perform concurrent orchestration of text based interfaces such as shells, interpreters, CLI's etc. Some major design goals are that the test programs should be easy to understand, easy to analyse the outcome of the tests, easy to debug and trace.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/cons-t-ahs319/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - CONS T AHS\nCore developer of network device and network configuration\n\nCons has a long history of writing code, with Lisp and functional languages from early days.  Worked with formal methods, language implementation and lecturing at Uppsala University and escaped to a life of speech synthesis, music notation, graphics, networks, imaging, online poker and more language implementation.  Currently working at Cisco using Erlang for writing software for network device configuration (ConfD) and network configuration (NSO).  Uses lux a lot.  Likes typed languages and is targeting the BEAM with a new language.\n\nMore on Cons T Ahs: https://codesync.global/speaker/cons-t-ahs319/\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER - HAKAN MATTSSON\nAttended all EUC's since 1997. Made Mnesia a robust DBMS. Wrote escript, reltool, megaco etc.\n\nHakan started working with Erlang/OTP the previous millennium, before the release of OTP R1. Developed Mnesia, Escript, Reltool, Megaco and more. He was the first employee in the OTP team and worked at Ericsson Computer Science Lab. Hakan has attended all EUC'S since 1997 and is now working at Cisco. He is using Erlang of course.\n\nMore on Hakan Mattsson: https://codesync.global/speaker/hakan-mattsson/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
