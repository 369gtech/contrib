title: 'YOW! 2014 Julian Giuca - How We Went from 1 million to 1 billion Events...'
recordingDate: 1514467954
description: "In startup time, 6 years practically stretches into prehistory. Technologies come in and out of fashion, patterns become anti-patterns, frameworks are born and die (…and then there’s Javascript). But what does it mean at business scale? Let’s take a technical look at the choices and consequences in a long-running codebase, and how it changes to support a business.\n\nWe will take a tour of New Relic’s history – examining database design choices, Ruby patterns, Javascript frameworks, and supporting deprecated libraries – and emerge the other side with insight on how to best survive the past while still innovating for the future.\n\nJulian is on the R&D team at New Relic, but has worn many hats over the years there. He was responsible for the business engineering infrastructure, lead the charge into service oriented architecture, and once “totally intentional” released a new product three weeks early.\n\nWhile Julian lives in a Ruby world, he’s constantly surprised by the large swaths of Javascript that happen to keep appearing in his Ruby applications.\n\nFor more on YOW!
