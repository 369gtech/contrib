title: 'DrupalCon Nashville 2018: Seniors and UX Designing for Baby Boomers and Beyond'
recordingDate: 1523550151
description: "In 2002, the percentage of the population over the age of 50 was over twenty-seven percent. By 2020, it will be over thirty-five percent. The size of the 50 plus population will more than double in the next 35 years. Our nation faces a demographic revolution as 78 million boomers enter their retirement years. A baby boomer turns 60 every 7.5 seconds. This demographic shift will result in tremendous changes in the workplace, civic organization and healthcare. This segment is adopting and using technology faster than any other segment. And, they are the group with the most disposable income. Ignoring them and their needs is not just a bad practice, it’s bad business. More importantly, the things that can be learned from working with this audience can inform efforts with other segments. We’ll look at some of the unique aspects of designing, developing, and testing with this audience.\n\nThis session is for anyone interested in UX or accessibility focused\_on a senior audience.\n\nWe will discuss developing and understanding personas, using analytics to evaluate engagement and content, and the unique usability issues of the senior audience."
