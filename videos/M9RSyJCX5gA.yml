It also gives a sneak peek at what to look out for in the next iteration of the standard. It will also cover a discussion on what happened in the most recent ISO C++ committee meeting in Kona, Hawaii last February. This talk is for those interested in participating in the process and in the evolution of C++ in general.\n\nSPEAKER INFO\n\nDean Michael Berris, Technical Solutions Engineer at Google, alternate member of C++ committee representation of Google."
