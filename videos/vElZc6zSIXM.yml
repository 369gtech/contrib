Whether the cache locality of data access, the size of working set, or avoiding costly memory allocation overhead. Unfortunately, the standard C++ library data structures range from adequate to terrible at controlling these aspects, and they don’t provide any of the core mechanisms needed for extremely efficient data structure design.\n\nThis talk will present the core concepts of designing high performance data structures in C++. It is based on years of experience in the LLVM compiler as well as several other large code bases. From these principles, the talk will propose a suite of data structures that provide performance without loss of generality or functionality. As much as this talk will present specific data structure designs, its primary intent will be to give an understanding of what makes these structures have greater performance than more naive approaches.\n— \nChandler Carruth\nGoogle\nC++ Lead\nSan Francisco Bay Area\nChandler Carruth leads the Clang team at Google, building better diagnostics, tools, and more. Previously, he worked on several pieces of Google’s distributed build system. He makes guest appearances helping to maintain a few core C++ libraries across Google’s codebase, and is active in the LLVM and Clang open source communities. He received his M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from Wake Forest University, but disavows all knowledge of the contents of his Master’s thesis. He is regularly found drinking Cherry Coke Zero in the daytime and pontificating over a single malt scotch in the evening.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
