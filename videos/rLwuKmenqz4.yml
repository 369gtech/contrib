description: "Full title: Everything I always wanted to know about crypto, but never thought I'd understand\n\nFor many years, I had entirely given up on ever understanding the anything about cryptography. However, I’ve since learned it’s not nearly as hard as I thought to understand many of the important concepts. In this talk, I’ll take you through some of the underlying principles of modern applications of cryptography. We’ll talk about our goals, the parts are involved, and how to prevent and understand common vulnerabilities. This’ll help you to make better choices when you implement crypto in your products, and will improve your understanding of how crypto is applied to things you already use."
