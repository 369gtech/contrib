description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nSQL Delight, a type-safe database API, recently completed migration from being a Java-generating, Android-specific tool to a Kotlin-generating, multiplatform one. Migrating an API from Java to Kotlin has obvious benefits, but adding multiplatform support for iOS introduces a dynamic which complicates the API, code generation, and runtime.\n\nThis talk will cover the challenges of platform-agnostic API design, type-safe multiplatform Kotlin code generation, and the integration of platform-specific runtimes such that the library not only runs efficiently on each platform but also integrates well with the other languages each might be using.\n\nAbout the Presenters:\n* Jake Wharton is an Android engineer at Google working on Kotlin things.\n* Alec Strong and Egor Andreevici are Android developers at Square."
