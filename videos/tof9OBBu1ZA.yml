description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nBuilding Linux Distributions for Fun and Profit - Margarita Manterola, Kinvolk \n\nShould we aim to have one Linux distro to rule them all? Or should we have a specialized one for each need? When does it make sense to go for one or the other? When running software on K8s, does the distro running on the nodes make a difference? What about the one in the containers? Marga has been building Linux distributions for over 15 years. She started in the Debian project, then worked as an engineer at Google, building the OS used by other Google engineers. And is currently working on Flatcar Container Linux, Kinvolk's container optimized OS. This talk will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of having general purpose distributions vs narrow focus ones. Going onto the manageability and security implications at scale for cloud native applications. It will touch upon the redefined boundaries between the base OS and the containers and how to keep everything up to date. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekE1"
