title: 'Creating the Azure Functions Updates Twitterbot'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632920419
description: "I created a serverless Twitterbot which tweets when new releases are made available in public GitHub repositories related to Azure Functions.\n \nIn this session, I'll walk you through the serverless application, highlighting which Azure cloud services and Azure Function specific libraries are in use and why they've been chosen. I'll show two architectural patterns which are used: function chaining and fan-out/fan-in, and I'll cover the C# clients for GitHub and Twitter.\n \nFinally, I'll also go into continuous integration & deployment aspects so you'll end up with a complete picture of what is necessary to deliver a serverless solution to the Azure cloud.\n \nDocs Pages/CTAs:\nAzure Functions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nCosmos DB: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nAzure SQL DB: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nLogic Apps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps//?WT.mc_id=azureserverless-34584-jemorg\nLearn Collection: https://aka.ms/azureserverlessconf/resources \n \nCloud Skills Challenge: https://aka.ms/azureserverlessconf/challenge"
