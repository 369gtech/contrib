title: 'Expanding the Soft Skills Toolkit: The Art and Science of Diagramming'
recordingDate: 1548371167
description: "Adam Moszt\n\nhttps://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/267/\n\nYou’ve put in the hard yards to plan your project, and now it’s time to get buy-in from the stakeholders. You’ve set up the meetings, you’re planning your presentation. Oh, no! The process diagram looks like a bowl of spaghetti, and that flowchart has more loops than a chainmail shirt. How are the meeting attendees going to understand this?\r\n\r\nNever fear! Once you understand the principles of good diagramming, you will be a master of supplying the right image, first time, every time! People far (like the back of the meeting room) and wide (like the person all the way in the corner over there) will understand your intent at the merest glance.\r\n\r\nYou’ll learn how to make effective diagram that stick in the mind of your audience. In doing so, you’ll be able to present information quickly and comprehensibly to people, and be able to explain even the most complex of processes with clarity and ease. The principles that you learn here will also translate well into UI design and many other facets of user-facing application development and communication.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
