title: 'A taste of trygve - James Coplien'
recordingDate: 1504869911
description: "Class-oriented programming, as supported by Java, C++ and C#, helps you develop classes for your customer. Object-oriented programming, on the other hand, lets you focus on networks of cooperating objects that work together to create business value. This talk describes the trygve open-source programming language and its support for real object-oriented programming the way it was envisioned by those who shaped it in its early days. Learn about trygve and maybe even join the community to help evolve it. And if you’re a working developer, some of the ideas carry over into C# and C++. \n\nJim Coplien is a Certified Scrum Trainer in Denmark and best-selling author, lecturer, and consultant in the areas of software design, object-oriented programming, lean software development process, and agile development. His earlier work was one of the foundations of Scrum and of XP and he is one of the founders of the software pattern discipline. He helps enterprises solve architectural and organisational problems together and challenges people to question practices they do out of habit or popularity, exhorting people to establish empirical and otherwise provable justifications for their practices. \n\n--------------------------------------\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region.
