description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nScaling Telepresence Across Your Organization - Abhay Saxena, Datawire \n\nAdopting Kubernetes often forces tradeoffs related to your cloud native software development lifecycle, particularly in relation to the inner development and debugging loops. End-to-end verification of a system consisting of 10+ microservices is simply not possible, so many developers use the CNCF-hosted Telepresence two-way proxy to solve this problem. This works very well, individually. But how do you scale these strategies across a whole organization?  Learn from the experiences of the primary Telepresence maintainer:  - Watch a demonstration of how Telepresence swap deployment does a good job for one developer who owns a cluster - Learn how this can be scaled with multiple clusters and namespaces, and understand the tradeoffs of this approach - Explore how the new Telepresence intercept enables a larger team to work together without needing multiple clusters and namespaces\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zetp"
