description: "Problems choosing between Java EE and Spring? Or do you want to use both in combination? Then this session is something for you.\n\nIn this session I will build an application using Spring 4, then build the same application using Java EE 7 and at last build it again using a combination of the two.\n\nStrengths and weaknesses with the three approaches will then be explored and lessons learned summarized."
