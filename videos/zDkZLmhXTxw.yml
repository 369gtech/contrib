title: 'Staying Ahead of the Curve'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327470
description: "\"We all want to stay ahead of the curve—after all, that’s what you go to a conference for. \n \n But have you ever considered how being ahead of the curve might be dangerous? \n \n Using a new language before you understand it, putting new technology into production so you can learn it, abandoning “old practices” before you’ve benefited from it… These things are common practice, under the guise of \"\"progress\"\" and \"\"keeping up-to-date.\"\" \n \n While we shouldn’t be running around like headless chickens chasing the next \"\"shiny new thing,\"\" we do need to see to our continuous learning and, of course, embrace change. How do we balance these two extremes? And how do we see our own growth and learning as developers and architects while meeting the needs of our project or team or organization?\"\n\nTrisha Gee, Lead Java Advocate at JetBrains\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/staying-ahead-of-the-curve-250104462"
