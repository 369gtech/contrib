Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nServerless Messaging Patterns that Make or Break your App at Scale - Jeff Hollan, Microsoft \n\nServerless enables you to quickly write event driven code to trigger on different messages. But where and how those messages are delivered can make all the difference in the world. When using serverless in production, there are major considerations when deciding between queues and streams, events and messages, and order or unordered processing.  Azure Functions has been serving thousands of customers with billions of executions every day. This session will share out some of the common messaging patterns and capabilities, and the dos and donts of event driven at scale. \n\nhttps://sched.co/aYq3"
