description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nUsing Elixir and WhatsApp to launch WHO’s global COVID-19 response\nby Simon de Haan\n\nABSTRACT\nThe inside story of how the World Health Organisation’s WhatsApp COVID-19 hotline service was launched in 5 days time using Elixir.\n\nTurn.io has a long history of using chat to improve lives. We have our roots in the SMS and USSD mobile messaging space and since 2017 have been at the forefront of scaling these services using WhatsApp in emerging markets.\n\nAt the beginning of March 2020 we launched the world’s first WhatsApp based COVID-19 response for the South African Ministry of Health. The service was designed and launched within a week. It scaled, prior to any kind of public launch, to 450K unique users on the first day and has since grown to serve to over 7.5 million people in South Africa and is core to the national government’s ongoing COVID-19 related communication and support strategies.\n\nWhile South Africa was still launching, we were also preparing for the launch of the World Health Organisation’s global WhatsApp service in partnership with Praekelt.org, WhatsApp, Amazon Web Services, and the Be Healthy Be Mobile team at the World Health Organisation.\n\nWithin the space of 5 days, the WHO service was designed, deployed, stress tested, and launched.\n\nWithin the first 48 hours the service went to serve over 10 million people with accurate information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Instantly becoming the biggest deployment of the WhatsApp Business API at launch.\n\nWe’d like to tell the story of the people, the code, the tools, and the processes that made this a once in a life time public health opportunity in a global time of crisis. We’ll cover the lessons learned, the challenges, the successes, and the failures.\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Simon de Haan\n\nSimon is the Co founder and CTO for Turn.io. Simon is excited about technology, especially when it is applied to improve the lives of less privileged people. Growing up in the Middle East ruined him for the ordinary as those years left an unmistakable impression and set him on a direct course to be involved in community development, entrepreneurship and technology. Prior to Turn.io, Simon was the Chief Engineer for Praekelt.org, helping lead the launch of the world's first nationally integrated mobile pregnancy registry for the South African Department of Health and subsequently launching the world's first national health platform on the WhatsApp Business API.\n\n---\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: https://www.elixirconf.eu/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU"
