description: "Tech YouTuber Caleb Curry joins Alexa Morales, Oracle's director of developer content, at the Groundbreakers Live stage at Oracle Code One 2019 in San Francisco. The topic? His journey to 100,000 subscribers for his software development tutorials on YouTube.\n\nThis was Caleb's first visit to Silicon Valley, and he expressed awe at how the technology industry dominates, in contrast to where he lives in Ohio. We talked about his top tutorials, his background as a self-taught software developer, the most popular questions he gets about computer programming, how he got started on YouTube, uploading 140 videos in one day, the topic of his first \"viral\" video, and his plans to surpass Pew Die Pie!\n\nCaleb is a software developer who is well known for teaching programming online (often joined by his wife and family), producing hundreds of videos totaling 8+ million views. He creates content that is entertaining, simple, and shines a light on the confusing parts of coding. His 100k YouTube subscribers and 125k Udemy students agree!\n\nCheck out Caleb's channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/CalebTheVideoMaker2\n\nCaleb's Java tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0D2gRwe_NA&list=PL_c9BZzLwBRJOmvlnRQpnZS7ZpEvtwkXb\n\nCaleb's Apex tutorials:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_c9BZzLwBRJXk2hEP-U_OUMJAf_TYEiZ\n\n#database\n#apex\n#java\n#techyoutuber"
