title: 'Data Flow in Polymer Elements and Apps (Polymer Summit 2016)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1476712228
description: "Polymer’s data system provides a robust, highly performant set of features – including observers, computed properties and bindings – for managing the flow of data within and between elements. These features are easy to use, making it almost trivial to build simple controls. They’re also useful for composing more complex elements (fancier controls, views or entire applications), but data flow gets trickier as complexity increases and the best solution is not always obvious. In this session, we explore patterns for managing data flow in your Polymer elements and apps and discuss relevant changes in Polymer 2.0\n\nMissed the summit?
