description: "Genuine agility is enormously effective in helping us achieve our dreams. The trouble is, Agile has grown into a complex tangle of roles and rituals, frameworks and tools, processes and certifications. We need a return to simplicity. Modern Agile is here to help.\n\nDesigned for people in many domains (not just IT), Modern Agile is defined by four guiding principles:\n\n    Make People Awesome\n    Make Safety a Prerequisite\n    Experiment & Learn Rapidly\n    Deliver Value Continuously\n\nUnderstanding and deeply practicing these four principles will help you get better results faster.\n\nIn this talk I’ll share how these four principles power world-famous companies and how they can help you work with greater speed, simplicity, safety and success.\n\nJoshua is the founder and CEO of Industrial Logic, a pioneering Modern Agile consultancy that improves the software development capabilities of organizations around the globe. In the mid-1990s, Joshua was among a small community of “lightweight methods” practitioners experimenting with better ways of developing software. Since then, he’s helped thousands of people across hundreds of organizations learn better ways of making software, carefully reviewing and revising methods with the greatest impact and return on investment. Today, he leads an effort to modernize Agile by focusing on timeless principles, removing outdated practices and leveraging the best of what the software community and other industries have learned about achieving awesome results. Joshua is an international speaker and author of the best-selling, Jolt Cola-award-winning book, Refactoring to Patterns, numerous Agile eLearning courses, and popular articles like Anzeneering, Sufficient Design and Stop Using Story Points. He’s active on many social media platforms and ModernAgile.org community.\n\nFor more on YOW! conferences, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
