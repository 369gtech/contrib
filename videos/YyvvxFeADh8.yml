description: "Speaker(s):\nFelipe Hoffa, Jordan Tigani\n\nhttps://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ipython-soccer-predictions\n\nDescription:\nCan you predict the future using Big Data? Can you divine if your users will come back to your site or where the next social conflict will arise? And most importantly, can Brazil be defeated at soccer on their own turf? In this talk, we'll go through the process of data extraction, modelling and prediction as well as generating a live dashboard to visualize the results. We'll demonstrate how you can use Google Cloud and Open Source technologies to make predictions about the biggest soccer matches in the world. You'll see how to use Google BigQuery for data analytics and Monte Carlo simulations, as well as how to create machine learning models in R and pandas. We predict that after this talk you'll have the necessary tools to cast your own eye on the future.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos"
