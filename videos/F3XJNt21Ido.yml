title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2015 Charles O''Farrell - Practical Property-Based Testing'
recordingDate: 1514642566
description: "At first it can be tricky working out how exactly you test your code with properties. The good news is that there are some very obvious and useful patterns that can make writing generators and properties easy by mere-mortals.\n\nThis talk aims to cover some of those patterns, and in doing so help both people working or struggling with property-based testing, and through that to also motivate the use of property-based testing for those still unfamiliar with the concept.\n\nFortunate enough to be following his functional dream of doing full-time Haskell/Scala at Ambiata.Fought in the trenches for many years with Enterprise Java at Atlassian and Mincom. Might even know a little COBOL but doesnâ€™t like to talk about it.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
