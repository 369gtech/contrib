description: "This session was given at Paris Android Makers 2020 by Fabien Devos, Wealthfront.\n\nMore info: https://android-makers-2020.firebaseapp.com/schedule/?sessionId=176472\n\nYou've been coding non stop for hours and your manager is nowhere to be seen. Their desk is always empty so clearly not a lot of actual work must be getting done. Can going to that many meetings possibly be a good use of anybody's time?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll go over what managers actually do, and how it can be useful, at least when they are good at their job! Relaying information, hiring, coaching, protecting your team from BS, or helping them grow are all important activities that might not feel like real work. This should also give you a better idea of wether or not this could be a good career move for you, or if it's better to stay a maker."
