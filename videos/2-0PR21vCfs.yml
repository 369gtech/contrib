description: "We are School of AI! Our mission is to offer a world-class AI education to anyone on Earth for free. Our doors are open to all those who wish to learn. We are a learning community that spans almost every country dedicated to teaching our students how to make a positive impact in the world using AI technology. In this video, I make a request for applications to sign-up to be a School of AI Residential Advisor. Residential Advisors provide quality co-living housing for School of AI Wizards in their respective cities. We’re looking for people who either own, lease, rent, or in some way manage a co-living property with at least 5 beds, but the more the better. The type of property can be a big house, an apartment complex, a hostel, or even an existing college dorm. \n\nSignup here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdctYUsnVwrIPZy6NT-zFcwL-nj_kCq2WDPQoA-FdWILExtIQ/viewform\n\nPlease Subscribe!
