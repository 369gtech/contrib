description: "From Strata + Hadoop World 2015 in Singapore, Jana Eggers' keynote \"When AI joins the team: Onboarding the next generation of employees\": Within the next decade, 16 percent of current US jobs will be done by artificial intelligences. It’s time to start thinking about how we onboard these employees. While we’ll look at what it takes to get started with machine learning projects, our focus will be on the top 5 things you need to consider when your next employee is an AI:\n- How should you lay the groundwork for AI as part of the workforce?\n- What questions should you ask as you and your team embark on AI projects?\n- What training is needed for humans and machines? What are the ethics and HR involved?\n- What are reasonable expectations for this new employee? What changes as they get smarter?\n\nAbout Jana Eggers (Nara Logics): Jana Eggers is a tech executive focused on products and the messages surrounding them.
