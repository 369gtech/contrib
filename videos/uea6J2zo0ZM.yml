description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeakers: David Turanski, Mark Johnson\nAlternative data persistence approaches are all the rage these days. Transitioning our skill sets and legacy applications to these new and promising technologies though can be problematic. Spring Data is an exciting solution to persistence proliferation. It brings the flexibility and familiarity of the Spring Framework and adds the concepts of Repositories which allow developers to write their programs to using familiar methods such as save, update, delete, and dynamic finders.\n\nIn this presentation we will introduce Spring Data for GemFire and how it leverages your existing Spring Framework skills to create generic Spring style interfaces which will make it more efficient to transition to distributed data grids such as GemFire."
