language: English
recordingDate: 1632327470
description: "\"Data access and storage methods continue to grow and diversify. As data volumes and complexities grow, it is vital for developers to maximize application efficiency.\n \n Understanding the structure of data behind applications can make a big impact on the complexity of the application and queries.\n \n Maybe the data layer isn't something that keeps developers up at night, but maybe it should.\n \n In this session, we will compare and contrast databases connecting to a typical Java application to understand where each makes life easier or harder for you as the developer.\n \n From relational to NoSQL to graph, we will explore various types of data, the way it is stored, and how best to go about retrieving it.\n \n A live-coding demo will bring all this to life, as the presenter shows exactly how your database choices change how you write applications.\n Come to this session to learn how different data sources and a variety of query languages impact the amount of code required to store and retrieve data.\"\n\nJennifer Reif, Developer Relations Engineer at Neo4j\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/code-wars-database-decisions-for-application-development"
