description: "Like a kid in a theme park, the number of shiny exciting new technologies teams encounter as they move into and re-architect for the cloud can be overwhelming. Thus we welcome you, to CloudLand! Adopting the cloud comes with a lot of questions to explore and tools to learn. Why should I care about “Cloud Native?” What technologies count as “Cloud Native?” What Cloud Native technologies does my team/business need and why? Through colorful illustrations and a memorable theme park analogy, you will learn:\n* How to identify “Cloud Native” technology and why it matters,\n* The key characteristics of categories of technologies from the CNCF Landscape,\n* And get an introduction to many of the individual CNCF projects that fill in the Cloud Native Landscape.\n\nPresenter: Kaslin Fields, Developer Advocate @Google"
