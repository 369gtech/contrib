description: "Speaker: Andres Almiray\r\n\r\nThe Java ecosystem has myriads of libraries and projects that can be used to create the features our customers require, there's no shortage of options everywhere you look when it comes to writing production code. But what about testing code? If you ascribe to the Clean Code ideals then you know that testing code is as important as production code. Luckily there are a good number of libraries that can be used with popular testing frameworks. In this session we'll discover how to write better parameterized tests; take care of concurrency related events; spy/mock/stub out collaborators to ensure cleaner and isolated tests; fake out REST APIs to test out client code; fake out REST clients to test out server code, and more. \r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nAndres Almiray is a Java/Groovy developer and a Java Champion with more than 17 years of experience in software design and development. He has been involved in web and desktop application development since the early days of Java. He is a true believer in open source and has participated on popular projects like Groovy, Griffon, and DbUnit, as well as starting his own projects (Json-lib, EZMorph, GraphicsBuilder, JideBuilder). He is a founding member of the Griffon framework and Hackergarten community event. \r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/241322623/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/8wUB/"
