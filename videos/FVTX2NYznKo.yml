description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nService Mesh In Action With Kuma: Security, Routing, and Observability - Marco Palladino, Kong  \n\nWith the rise of microservices, service mesh is becoming the future of service connectivity. This infrastructure layer makes it easy to add functionality across service-to-service communication when implemented correctly and can even be added from day one.     This talk will walk you through easily setting up service mesh across multiple environments with Kuma, a CNCF Sandbox project, and enabling security and observability – in any network – automatically. We'll dive into service mesh concepts along the way, focusing on helping developers and architects of any skillset become comfortable with service mesh.     This hands-on demo teaches you how to add functionality to your service mesh. We will be using Kuma, an open-source control plane for service mesh built on top of Envoy to deploy: L4 Traffic Routing for blue/green and canary deployments Prometheus metrics Health checks SPIFFE-compliant certificate generation  \n\nhttps://sched.co/abaB"
