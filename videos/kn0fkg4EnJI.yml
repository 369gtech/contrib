title: 'YOW! Connected 2017 Maksim Lin - Android DataBinding: This is the DSL You''re Looking For!'
recordingDate: 1510801201
description: "The Android Data Binding Library is great for reducing the amount of boiler plate you need to build the view layer in your android apps.\nBut going beyond the basics will give you an even bigger payback.\n\nIn this talk I'll cover some of the more advanced users of Data Binding including:\n\n   1.  2-way Data Binding\n    2. custom attributes\n    3. complex widgets\n   4.  integrating 3rd party libraries\n\nAs a bonus, examples will come from an app in development for several year, in Google Play with thousands of users that has been refactored recently to use Data Binding.\nFor those that have seen the Google IO talk \"Advanced Data Binding\" this talk will serve as a good followup, providing more real-world examples of how to use Data Binding in your app and covering areas like 3rd party libraries that were not covered in the IO talk and are not well documented outside of blog posts and SO answers.\n\nMaksim is a freelance developer who over the years has worked on everything from phone exchanges to large corporate websites to mobile webapps and Android app development. Previously senior developer at the National Gallery of Victoria, he now specialises in Android development and heâ€™s spent the last few years working on various parts of the Android OS from user apps all the way down to the Linux kernel.\n\n\nFor more information on YOW!
