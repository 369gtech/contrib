description: "With JavaScript being no toy language anymore our demands on a high quality development environment have risen tremendously. One part of a good development environment are build tools, and Gulp.js -- being the JavaScript streaming build system -- is but one of the many choices a developer has nowadays. For many however, it's considered to be the best! In this three hour workshop, we will take a good look into Gulp and its possibilities. After our in-depth 3 hour course you will be able to do the following:\n\nKnow how Gulp's API and the ecosystem of its plugins work\nCreate parallel and sequential execution chains to be in total control of your build flow\nKnow how 3rd party Node modules evolve around Gulp and how they can be integrated\nUse Gulp to build complex React.js, Angular.js and Browserify applications\nBecome master at file globbing and asynchronous build pipelines\nCreate incremental builds to speed up your build time\nKnow how streams work in Node.js\nAnd use stream arrays and merge streams to plumb together sophisticated pipelines doing all the work for you\nJoin us and become a build plumber!"
