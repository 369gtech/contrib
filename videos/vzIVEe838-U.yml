description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM STO 19 http://bit.ly/2W2vgDC\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nRETURNING TO ERLANG, THE TOOLING I MISS\nby Fredrik Park\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nInspiration \nExploration \nTooling\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate \n\nABSTRACT\nRecently I returned to the Erlang world after several years working with other languages. While I enjoy being back there are some tooling that I did leave behind. In this talk I will present some of this tooling and explain the reasoning as to why I think they should be brought back into the Erlang/Elixir community. Some of the tooling presented would make for an excellent hobby project (or even startup).\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/fredrik-park/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - FREDRIK PARK\nProfessional consultant, father of (soon) two.\n\nEven before graduating, Fredrik was captured by the beauty of Erlang during his studies at Uppsala University. During his final semester he joined Erlang Solutions part time while finishing his thesis project\n\nSince then he has worked at companies like Spotify, Netlight, Campanja, Dooer and Klarna where he has worked with some of the larger industry languages such as Javascript and Python. During his spare time he currently is exploring Rust as a language of choice.\n\nFredrik is very fond of tooling that can help him from making silly mistakes, if a system can find his mistakes it should.\n\nToday he is working as a freelancing full-stack consultant and specializes in dealing with legacy systems no matter what language it is written in. The end goal is to develop a product and not have to rely on the consultancy\n\nMore on Fredrik Park: https://codesync.global/speaker/fredrik-park/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM STO 19\nCode BEAM STO is powered by Code Sync.
