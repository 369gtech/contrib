title: 'Measurement is Not Enough: Rise of Performance Analytics - Buddy Brewer Keynote'
recordingDate: 1433340738
description: "From Velocity Santa Clara 2015: “Performance” is a loaded word that means different things to different people. To the Velocity tribe, it means web and mobile applications that are fast and durable. But to a marketing executive, it means conversion rates, ad impressions, and user retention. And to a product manager, CRO, or CEO, performance means something completely different.\n\nBut in order for for organizations to perform, all of these people have to collaborate. Collaboration begins with creating a shared language around “performance”. In this talk, Buddy will discuss ways the Velocity community can bring different sets of data together to lead these vastly different groups through a shared conversation about performance.\n\nThis keynote is sponsored by Soasta.\n\nAbout Buddy Brewer (SOASTA):\nBuddy leads strategic initiatives for SOASTA mPulse, a real user measurement tool that tells you how long people are waiting on your site and how it is impacting their behavior. Prior to SOASTA Buddy co-founded LogNormal, the first company to put measuring real users first in the crowded space of performance monitoring tools. LogNormal was acquired by SOASTA in 2012.\n\nBuddy has been helping some of the largest sites on the web solve their performance challenges since 2001.\n\nWatch more from the 2015 Velocity Conference: https://goo.gl/jS3T6Z\nFind out more about Velocity: http://velocityconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
