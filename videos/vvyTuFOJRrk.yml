description: "One of the main Python aspects is to have a clear syntax and be an\neasy-to-understand language, which compared to others like C++\n(depending of the kindness of the developer) can make a huge difference.\n\nNot only the readability is in play, having a dynamically typed\nand interpreted language improves the development workflow.\n\nThis improvement comes with a cost, performance. In most of the cases, a raw comparison of simple routines will leave Python behind, but there is a partial solution to this problem, connecting a powerful performant C++ library with the simplicity of Python.\n\nIn this talk, we will go through the process of generating language bindings to allow you to take any amazing C or C++ project and bring it to Python land. We will briefly discuss one of the many success stories, and we will analyze how the Qt project managed to expose its whole framework to Python, with the help of a self-made binding generator called Shiboken.\n\nAfter the talk, you will be able to decide which option is better for the\nprojects you have in mind, and with a bit of luck you will be responsible of exposing the next popular C++ library that makes the life of us all Pythonistas easier.\n\nEVENT:\n\nEuroPython 2019\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nCristi√°n Maureira-Fredes\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\n\nOriginal video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nATTRIBUTION CREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUQYuA9AJT0"
