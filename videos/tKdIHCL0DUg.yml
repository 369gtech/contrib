description: "Scott Prugh, Chief Architect, CSG International\n\nErica Morrison, Senior Manager Software Development, CSG International\n\nIn previous talks we discussed the last several years of a grass roots transformation at CSG. This focus was driven by Agile and Lean adoption and then beginning to tackle DevOps and flow of value optimization all the way to production.\n\nMoving forward, we have adopted a shared principle based approach aligning development and operations leaders. This movement has not been without its struggles. Culture, Process and Technology limitations continue to be serious challenges for large enterprises trying to move closer to “Internet Speed”.\n\nIn this presentation we will discuss our goals to further accelerate our delivery and detail some of the principles we are using to align our vision and execution."
