title: 'The Bloom filter'

description: "Google Tech Talks\nNovember, 15 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Bloom filter, conceived by Burton H. Bloom in 1970, is a\nspace-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test\nwhether an element is a member of a set. False positives are possible,\nbut false negatives are not. Elements can be added to the set, but not\nremoved (though this can be addressed with a counting filter). The\nmore elements that are added to the set, the larger the probability of\nfalse positives.\n\nFor example, one might use a Bloom filter to do spell-checking in a\nspace-efficient way. A Bloom filter to which a dictionary of correct\nwords has been added will accept all words in the dictionary and\nreject almost all words which are not, which is good enough in some\ncases. Depending on the false positive rate, the resulting data\nstructure can require as little as a byte per dictionary word.\n\nIn the last few years Bloom filter become hot topic again and there\nwere several modifications and improvements. In this talk I will\npresent my last few improvements in this topic.\n\n\nSpeaker: Ely Porat\nEly Porat received his Doctorate from Bar-Ilan University in 2000.\nFollowing that, he fulfilled his military service and, in parallel,\nworked as a faculty member at Bar-Ilan University. Having spent the\nspring 2007 semester as a Visiting Scientist in Google, he is now back\nat Bar-Ilan University.\n\nThe main body of Ely Porat's work concerns matching problems: string\nmatching, pattern matching, subset matching. He also worked on the\nnearest pair problem in high-dimensional spaces as well as sketching\nand edit distance."
