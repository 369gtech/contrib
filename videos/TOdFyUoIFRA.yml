description: 'JSR 371: Model-View-Controller (MVC 1.0) Specification is targeted to be a part of the upcoming Java EE 8 release. In this session I will quickly go through the nuts and bolts of this JSR. I will then jump right into a demo showing the key concepts by building an application based on MVC 1.0 from scratch. As we go I will also make a quick comparison with other frameworks, such as Spring MVC. This session will be based on a live coding demo backed by a set of introductory slides.'
