title: 'Making Memories: Clojure For Hardware Engineers (And Others) - Aaron Cummings'
language: English
recordingDate: 1543616520
description: 'We are using Clojure in the design of configurable embedded memories, a key component of custom logic chips. One of our significant uses of Clojure is a new memory generation system, which replaces a legacy system that had been written in C. As a consequence, our hardware design teams (who had no functional programming experience) had to learn Clojure. This talk reflects on our experience introducing Clojure to our design teams, our joys and frustrations, and the lessons learned along the way.'
