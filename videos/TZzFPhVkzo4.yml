description: "Core 2 brought big changes and improvements to the authentication system. This was also the perfect opportunity to do a major version update to IdentityServer to incorporate the feedback from the last year, make some under-the-hood changes and add new features.\n\nThis talk focuses on the new way to do authentication in 2.0 with IdentityServer4, and gives you an overview of the new features and other things happening in the IdentityServer ecosystem."
