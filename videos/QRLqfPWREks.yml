title: '"Kubernetes Developer Workflows in Visual Studio Code" - Ivan Towlson (LCA 2020)'

description: "Ivan Towlson\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/126/\n\nGreat command-line developer tools are widely available for the Kubernetes ecosystem, but fabulous visual developer environments are coming along more slowly, hindering uptake among application developers who are new to container orchestration or who prefer visually rich development environments.\r\n\r\nThis session will introduce the free Kubernetes extension for the open-source Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor, and show you core features that simplify and speed up the Kubernetes developer experience.  Iâ€™ll also show how you add to the behaviors and views in the VS Code k8s extension and show some extensions built on it, each illustrating a different way to make Kubernetes application development easier, faster, and more effective for your community or team.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nTue Jan 14 14:25:00 2020 at Room 7"
