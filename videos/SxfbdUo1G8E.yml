description: "\"Classification Based on Missing Features in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Osaka / Samarkand [PyData track]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Nemanja Milosevic\n\nConvolutional neural networks have been used for some time now for classification of images, among other things. Recently, some new research leads us to believe that neural network can be \"\"tricked\"\" into wrongly classifying images by adding noise or other artifacts to them. If we want to use Deep Convolutional models in critical scenarios (i.e. self driving cars) we have to be certain that these models that we are using will be certain and robust.\n\nIn this presentation I will talk about a novel research approach for increasing neural network accuracy and robustness in difficult or adversarial situations.\n\nWe will go over how convolutional layers work and how can we modify them to classify based on missing features on an image. With a simple modification we will gain some accuracy on a variation of a well-known MNIST dataset.\n\nAll the examples will be in PyTorch 1.1.\n\nSome basic knowledge about neural networks, backpropagation etc. is needed.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
