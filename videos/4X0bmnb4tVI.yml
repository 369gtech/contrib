description: "Rafael Martinez Guerrero\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/82/\n\nBehind every security measure you take, you should have an information management system helping you take decisions.\r\n\r\nIf you work with security, you need a way to collect, process, save and analyze huge amounts of data that should be used to control how your systems are behaving, find anomalies and evaluate the results of your actions.\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered how to manage billions of logs and metrics from thousands of devices in your infrastructure? If you need high-availability and a resilient and stable system to process your data this is the tutorial for you. \r\n\r\nBased on the experience obtained in the past 4 years at the University of Oslo processing billions of logs a day from more than 15000 devices, this tutorial will give some inside information and many tips about how to achieve this with Linux and open source software.\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to put together HAProxy, agents, Logstash, Elasticsearch and RabbitMQ to work at scale. You will also hear about the problems and pitfalls we have experienced during these years and what we learned from them.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial format is a lecture with time for questions and short discussions as we move along. Due to the nature of the subject treated and time available, no hands-on or practical exercises will be done during the lecture.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial should provide background, essential theory and the details needed to enable you to work further on your own afterwards.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
