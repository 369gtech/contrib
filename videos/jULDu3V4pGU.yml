title: 'Rebecca Wirfs-Brock, Joseph W. Yoder "Project Retrospectives (Why, How, When)"'
recordingDate: 1358547982
description: 'Retrospectives is becoming an accepted an important practice as part of the software development process. In fact, most Agile practices promote some form of regular retrospectives. At periodic times throughout any software project, team members will benefit from taking some time to examine what is going well, what is not going well, and what can be done to correct any challenges. But how does a team do this? When and how often should they be done? This tutorial will introduce techniques for conducting project retrospectives. Participants will get the opportunity to try these techniques so they can take them back to their teams.'
