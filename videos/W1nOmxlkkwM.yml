description: "LISA16 - Hard Knocks and Soft Spots: A Docker-Centric CI/CD Pipeline at VMware\n\nFabio Rapposelli, Staff Engineer 2, VMware, and Ivan Porto Carrero, Staff Engineer, VMware\n\nVMware’s R&D team is comprised of thousands of top-notch computer scientists and software engineers always eager to write and test code that ships. The Cloud Native Apps BU recently started working on two new projects and decided to revisit how we ship code. We’ve built a new CI/CD platform based on Docker using Drone, not only for packing our services but also to do reproducible end-to-end testing and creating a perfectly reproducible test experience for developers. Our talk will focus around how Docker makes our lives easier. We’ll go over the platform we’ve built, the pipeline, lessons learned, and next steps.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
