title: 'YOW! Data 2017 Juliet Hougland - Apache Spark for Machine Learning on Large Data Sets'
recordingDate: 1508468400
description: "Apache Spark is a general purpose distributed computing framework for distributed data processing. With MLlib, Spark's machine learning library, fitting a model to a huge data set becomes very easy. Similarly, Spark's general purpose functionality enables application of a model across a large collection of observations. We'll walk through fitting a model to a big data set using MLlib and applying a trained scikit-learn model to a large data set.\n\nJuliet Hougland leads data science for Engineering at Cloudera. Previously she worked with Clouderaâ€™s customers by advising which tools to use, teaching how to use them, recommending the best approach to bring together the right data to answer the business problem at hand and building production machine learning models. Her commercial applications of data science include developing predictive maintenance models for oil & gas pipelines and designing/building a platform for real-time distributed model application, data storage, and model building.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
