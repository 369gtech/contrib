recordingDate: 1543225650
description: "Performance monitoring is an important part of running a successful theme park. Like a distributed system, theme parks have separate components (attractions). Each has a queue in front of it. How can we find out which of them are the least efficient? Which ones are slowing us down? Where should we spend time optimizing?\nJoin Mike for a roller-coaster ride through distributed system performance monitoring. Find out which measurements tell you the most about your system and how to optimize it. As an added bonus, you'll learn how to run a successful theme park! Mike has 18 years of experience developing and monitoring complex systems. In that time, he has visited some of the worlds greatest theme parks.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://ndcsydney.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
