description: "We'll take you along on the journey data makes both before it enters our pipelines and how we then shape it to end up in our visualizations. From large-scale data collection in the field to NGO's crunching surveys to datasets, to harmonizing data syntax and semantics, to defining visualizations using a visualization grammar and finally to serving the result on our tools page: www.gapminder.org/tools. At each step of the way we'll highlight interesting stories, lessons we learned during our work and challenges we still have.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
