description: "Intro + Deep Dive: Kubernetes IoT Edge WG - Steven Wong, VMware, Cindy Xing, Huawei, Dejan Bosanac, Red Hat, & Kilton Hopkins, Edgeworx \n\nIntro and Deep Dive: Edge Computing challenges and solutions with Kubernetes This session will investigate and catalogue challenges encountered when Kubernetes is deployed in Edge and IoT applications. We'll start by describing two basic approaches: deploying nodes to the Edge with a central control plane; and deploying whole clusters to the Edge. This will be followed by a deep dive into Kubernetes architectural features and constraints in the context of both approaches. We'll see which course makes the most sense for some specific use cases. Next we'll discuss some common challenges to successful deployments, such as resource limits and network availability, and provide some guidance on how to deal with them. There are opportunities to contribute to the evolution of Kubernetes to better serve edge use cases. We will close with details on how you can get involved with the community effort to help this happen. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPl4"
