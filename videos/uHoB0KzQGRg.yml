description: "http://g.co/gtac2013\nSlides: http://goo.gl/RltPp\n\nThomas Knych, Stefan Ramsauer, & Valera Zakharov, Google\n\nAre you ready to take the red pill?\nMobile has changed the way humans interact with computers. This is great, but as engineers we're faced with an ever growing matrix of environments our code runs on. The days of considering only a handful of browsers and screen resolutions are not coming back. How can engineers cope with the Matrix? We'll cover how Google is fighting this testing problem on workstations, in the cloud and in your head...\n\"I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.\"\n\nUpdate [October 2013]: Espresso is now open source: https://code.google.com/p/android-test-kit/."
