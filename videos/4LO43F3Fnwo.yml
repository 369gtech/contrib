description: "JavaScript developers are still relatively unaware of just how valuable their skillset is in the world of the Internet of Things. There is a huge amount of potential for developers without a background in hardware to get started creating connected prototypes quickly and easily. This presentation will cover how developers can get started with the Particle development platform (the Particle Core, Photon and Electron), its JavaScript SDK and the Particle cloud service to build an internet enabled prototype!\n\nPatrick is focused on exploring and sharing the possibilities of new technology such as the Internet of Things, virtual/augmented reality and wearables. He is the founder of devdiner.com, a new hub for developers to keep track of emerging tech. He is a SitePoint contributing editor, a SitePoint Premium and Oâ€™Reilly instructor, a Meta Pioneer and freelance web developer who loves every opportunity to tinker with something new in a tech demo.\n\nFor more on YOW!
