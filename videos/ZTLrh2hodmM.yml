description: "Google Tech Talks\nJanuary 31, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPhotographic Technology Day 3: Ray Tracing, Lenses, and Mirrors\n\nIn this lecture, we will study the principles of ray tracing for simple optical components: thin spherical lenses and spherical mirrors. The notion of real/virtual object and real/virtual images will be highlighted as well as the computation of the position and magnification the image. The case of thick lenses will also be mentioned including the notion of nodal and cardinal points.  Credits: Speaker:Rom Clement"
