title: 'A Vision for Relational Programming in miniKanren - William E. Byrd'

recordingDate: 1447856975
description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/william-e-byrd\n\n\nminiKanren is an embedded constraint logic programming language designed for writing programs as *relations*, rather than as functions or procedures. Unlike a function, a miniKanren relation makes no distinction between its inputs and outputs, leading to a variety of fascinating behaviors. For example, an interpreter written as a relation can also perform code synthesis, symbolic execution, and many other tasks.\n\nThis talk will introduce the ideas of relational programming and miniKanren, demonstrate the current state of relational programming through a series of examples, and explore the advancements needed to make relational programming fulfill its promise.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- give an introduction to miniKanren and relational programming\n\n- show interesting relational programs, such as a relational interpreter\n\n- demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of these relational programs\n\n- show the current limitations of this programming style\n\n- present a long-term vision, and a concrete medium-term plan, for making relational programming more useful\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Anyone interested in the long-term promise of very high-level declarative programming.\n\nAbout William\n\nWilliam E. Byrd is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the School of Computing at the University of Utah. He is co-author of 'The Reasoned Schemer', and is co-designer of the miniKanren relational programming language. He is also interested in the intersection of programming languages and synthetic biology."
