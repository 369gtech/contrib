description: "WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a virtual machine that runs in the browser sandbox. It is currently available on four major browser platforms. It promises near-native performance for computationally intensive client-side applications.\nBlazor is Microsoft's project to bring the power of WebAssembly to .NET developers. Originally targeted at C# developers on the ASP.NET stack, recent developments have allowed F# developers to target Blazor as well.\nThis lightning talk will give a overview & introduction to the concepts behind WebAssembly and Blazor for C# and F# developers.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndc-london.com/"
