description: "Sometimes we are not sure if using a specific tool is a good decision or not. How many framework.js are out there right now? Is JS a replacement for Java? What will become standard and what is just a hype?\n\nWe took a time machine and visited the future, and we are going to reveal some secrets. For over two years, our research team at Vaadin has been busy exploring the state of the web. Come and listen to the future of Java, Javascript, Web Components, Progressive Web Apps, and native mobile apps. You will also watch how these come together in live coding on stage.\n\nAMahdy Abdelaziz\nInternational technical speaker, Google developer expert (GDE), trainer and developer advocate. Passionate about Web and Mobile apps development, including PWA, offline-first design, in-browser database, and cross platform tools.
