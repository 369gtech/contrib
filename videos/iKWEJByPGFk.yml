description: "Titel: Do proper monoliths before you do microservices!\n\nHave you jumped the microservices bandwagon yet? If so, do you regret it? If not, be sure to listen to this talk first!\n\nChances are you are in a big pain if the overall architecture isn't designed properly, just like with a traditional monolith. A lot of people focus on creating small services which do one single thing. A great idea of course, unless this means you have to couple multiple services to each other in order to get some work done. If this is the case you haven't created a microservices architecture, but a monolith with additional latency.\nSo how should you design your architecture? Well, think about exposing capabilities of your system, like `check out`, `update profile` and not on `orders` or `customers`.\n\nBy changing your mindset on how to design your services you will be able to create a successful microservice architecture which actually has all the benefits and much less of the downsides you are probably experiencing now. \n\nSpeaker - Jan de Vries - Cloud Solution Architect/Developer\n\nJan has been developing software for well over a decade.\nCurrently, he is working at 4DotNet as a Cloud Solution Architect/Developer and is awarded by Microsoft with the Microsoft MVP award.\n\nHis main focus is on developing highly performant and scalable solutions using the awesome services provided by the Microsoft Azure platform. Because of his expertise, he has been able to help out multiple customers to bring their on-premise solution to the cloud and guide them towards a better software development ecosystem.\n\nWhenever Jan finds something interesting to write about, he shares his findings on his blog (https://jan-v.nl)."
