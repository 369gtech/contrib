recordingDate: 1599524181
description: "Fernando Masanori\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/PWZLAJ\n\nDuring the pandemic lockdown of COVID-19, we found a very different context from the usual: a) students with much more time available for learning b) many students who did not have a personal computer and could only access classes by cell phone c) difficulty to realistically assess learning. In this lecture we will present the real experiences in a traditional programming course given during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nFri Sep  4 09:50:00 2020 at Floperator"
