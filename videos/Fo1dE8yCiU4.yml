description: "Mastercard quickly realized that using a manual Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) foundation installation and configuration process would not be sustainable, especially to bring up public cloud environments in a timely manner. The Digital Native Architecture (DNA) team decided that all foundation installs and upgrades must follow automated processes. After working with the PCF Services team, Mastercard found that Concourse would be the best automated deployment solution for the job and started with the base CF pipelines. These pipelines significantly evolved automating product update detection, roll to sandbox, and gradual deployment to upper environments. Mastercard has additionally automated product team foundation membership, org and space creation, and much more. Join Mastercard in an overview of pipeline progression, current state, and what the future holds for automation.\nSpeakers: Cory Jett, Advisory Resident Platform Architect, Pivotal\nWilliam Marchlewski, Consultant, Digital Native Architecture, Mastercard\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
