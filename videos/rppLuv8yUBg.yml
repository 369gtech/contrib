description: "Google TechTalks\nApril 03, 2006\n\nDaniel Quinlan\n\nROSE is a tool for building source-to-source transformation tools for the optimization of C and C++ object-oriented applications. ROSE represents a mechanism to build translators that read the user's application source code and output highly optimized customized C++ code.\n\nROSE is the compiler-framework which permits library or application developers to build their own domain-specific source-to-source analyzers/translators. The specification of transformations is made as easy as possible with non-compiler people as a target audience. Custom analysis of large scale C++ applications is also simple to specify; ROSE supports a number of standard..."
