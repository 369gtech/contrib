description: "This video was recorded at ElixirConf EU Virtual 2020 - https://www.elixirconf.eu/archives/virtual_2020/index.html\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nHardening Applications with Property Tests\nby\nParker Selbert\n\nABSTRACT\nProperty testing is a tool that every Elixir developer should have in their toolbox. Come learn how property tests can thoroughly test a problem space and make bulletproof software. We’ll look at properties pulled from the Oban background job processor. Some examples we’ll explore:\nProving a CRON parser\nChecking concurrent uniqueness\nTransitioning between migrations\nProving system reliability\n\nYou’ll leave armed with the ability to recognise situations where properties are more effective than example based tests.\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - Parker Selbert\n\nParker is a partner in Søren, a tiny husband and wife consultancy based outside of Chicago. He is an avid open source contributor with particular appreciation for expressiveness and elegance.\n\n---\n\nElixirConf EU\nWebsite: https://www.elixirconf.eu/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ElixirConfEU"
