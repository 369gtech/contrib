And why is it important anyway?” \n\nThis highly interactive talk will present the findings and guide and challenge you through a journey to understanding safety. Including short interactive sessions and role play exercises to cover the following topics: \nWhat is safety?\nWhat are the elements that make a team effective?\nIs psychological safety the foundation to team performance?\nWhat can we all do to help foster psychological safety in our teams?\nWhat is the relationship between safety, stress and engagement?\nWhat is the profound impact of a lack of safety and engagement on society?\nThis talk has grown as John created the new podcast The Agile Path. The first season on this podcast is about safety in teams. John has interviewed world renowned specialists in the field; Christopher Avery, David Marquet, Jerry Weinberg, Esther Derby, Johanna Rothman, Woody Zuill and many more in over 75 hours of audio.
