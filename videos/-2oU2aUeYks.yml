description: "Filmed at http://2016.dotscale.io on April 25th in Paris. More talks on http://thedotpost.com\n\nComputing isn't physics. But as we add scale to computing systems, we can begin to reason from simple principles to detailed understanding of how our systems must work. These constraints, in turn, shape our entire industry in predictable ways. Ted gives two examples: the deep reason big data is big right now and how messaging systems must work."
