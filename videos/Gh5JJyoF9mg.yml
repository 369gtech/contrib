description: "George Miranda, Dir. Product Marketing at Chef - ChefConf 2017\n\nDevOps transformation works in seemingly mysterious ways: some organizations thrive like unicorns while others spin their wheels and make little progress. Why do some companies manage to nail it while others struggle to make it past finding the right hammer? There's plenty of conjecture at any conference, so instead let's drop some science. In this talk, we'll look at a wide set of data sources that tell us objectively what works by the numbers. We'll unpack the numbers in those emergent patterns and examine what they mean and what behaviors they represent. We'll also look at how tools shape outcomes and examine what choices make the difference between driving change and struggling to stay afloat. Along the way, we'll look to Chef Automate for examples and we'll break down practical places to dig in if your teams are losing traction."
