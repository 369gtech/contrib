description: "\"Interactive Mapmaking with Python\nEuroPython 2020 - Talk - 2020-07-24 - Microsoft\nOnline\n\nBy Sangarshanan Veeraraghavan\n\nGeoDataframes are awesome for working with GIS data in Python as it provides the goodness of pandas for geographic data but So let's use them to create some cool interactive maps  \n\nThis talk introduces Geopatra, an open-source mapping library that can be used to quickly map geodataframes with libraries like folium, kepler.gl, plotly, etc. Currently interactive mapping with geodataframes is not very straighforward for beginners and requires you to understand the interfaces exposed by different mapping libraries. \ngeopatra attempts to abstract all the complexities and tries to provide a unified framework for mapping geodataframes \n\nol\nIntroduction (2 mins)\n\n\nWho am I?\nSetting the expectations\n\nWorking with Geodataframes (5 mins) \n\n\nReading Spatial data as a GeoDataframe\nThe awesomeness of GeoDataframes (An overview of some of the amazing things you can do with a single line of code eg: Spatial joins, Manipulations, and transformations)\nNow that we have established our love for geopandas lets map geodataframes \n\nLet the Mapmaking begin (10 mins)\n\n\nBasic Non Interactive maps with Geopandas and Matplotlib \nCreating basic interactive maps with Folium, Plotly &amp; Kepler (GeoJSONPlots, Clustermaps, Heatmaps, H3gridmaps)\nThe number of steps vs the number of necessary steps  \n\nEnter Geopatra (10 mins)\n\n\nThe need for Geopatra (Could it be any Easier and Faster)\nWrapping up popular mapmaking libraries for GeoDataframes\nCreate interactive maps with just a single line \nFuture work and Discussion :)\n\n/ol\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
