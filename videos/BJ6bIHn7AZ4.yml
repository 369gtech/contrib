Itâ€™s not only about the products. We have to keep in mind that everything created is created by people for the people. No matter which technologies are used and how fast the progress ist running we are always influenced by the values and insights we are sharing\_beyond our human diversity.\n\nThis session is about a vision of an inclusive and accessible culture within our industry to gain a greater understanding and a better experience for everybody.
