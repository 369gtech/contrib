description: "Speaker: Britta Jaison (@britta_alex)\n\nWe all know the magic tricks, we all know the cool little functions. Way to make the dates look cool and numbers look awesome. But there are things most people don't think about.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nI am working with Yale-NUS College as Web Developer. I have been twiddling with PHP for more than 7 years. I have worked with both corporates and start-ups prior to joining Yale-NUS. I have played the roles of developer and lead at various level of my career. At Yale-NUS we are a very small agile team and I am part of the team developing the in house application/websites for administering the daily needs of the college and also manages the vendors for the certain vendor driven applications. I love my career and finds joy in everything I do in my career life.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VGXc/"
