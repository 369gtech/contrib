description: "Managing one or two unique machines in an ad-hoc manner is not a story that many people talk about nowadays.  Today, small teams need to manage hundreds or thousands of nodes, serving a myriad of purposes, running any number of critical Dev and Ops workloads. And they have to do it in a way that still leaves time for unplanned and strategic work.\n\nLearn how HP ties DevOps automation, monitoring information and ChatOps collaboration together to eliminate manual, error-prone work and keep critical services running."
