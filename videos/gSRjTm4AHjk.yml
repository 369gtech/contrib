title: 'Building FeatureFlow, Criteoâ€™s feature data generation platform - Piyush Narang'
recordingDate: 1588078681
description: 'Criteo is one of the leading advertising platforms for the open Internet. We serve over a billion users across the world and help them discover relevant products at the right time. Machine learning is central to our success and we tackle problems in a wide range of domains such as click prediction, recommendation systems, auction theory and many others. Generating feature datasets is a challenging and interesting problem at our scale (~300 billion bids and ~4 billion displays / day). In this presentation, we talk about FeatureFlow, a multi-tenant feature data generation platform we are building around Flink SQL. We cover the various operational aspects we tackle on behalf of our users such as monitoring, alerting, testing and tooling as well as some of the challenges we have faced on this journey.'
