Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\n\n“Fashion is play, with the most profound of human questions: Who am I?” -Roland Barthes\n\nIt is an innate human desire to play with and craft our appearance. With the miniaturization of electronic devices, technology has become a new material with which to craft and alter our appearances.\n\nCindy Hsin-Liu Kao’s research practice rethinks the convergence of function and aesthetics on the skin. While most wearable technology looks into the future, Hybrid Body Craft builds upon existing habitual practices of decorating, ornamenting our bodies, and elegantly integrates technology to extend their purpose beyond decoration and into user interaction.\n\nThis talk will present two examples: DuoSkin, a functional, stylish on-skin interface that resembles metallic temporary tattoos; and NailO, a fingernail mounted trackpad that doubles as a nail art sticker.\n\nWhile the newest technology of today will become obsolete tomorrow, craft is passed on and lives on throughout generations. How can we create wearable technology as a form of craft? Can it be customized to evolve with the wearer’s identity, while also celebrating the personalization of individual style?\n\nCindy Hsin-Liu Kao\nHybrid Body Craft Designer, MIT Media Lab\nhttps://twitter.com/cindyhlkao\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
