title: 'VR Distortion Correction Using Vertex Displacement for Cardboard Apps - Google I/O 2016'
language: English
recordingDate: 1464726166
description: "Lenses make VR possible. They allow us to look at a screen a few inches from our eyes, but feel like we're looking out across a vast virtual landscape. Unfortunately, they also warp our view of the virtual world, distortions that require expensive, per-pixel computations to correct. This talk describes a technique for performing these computations per vertex, removing the need for traditional full-screen render textures and massively improving mobile performance, which is particularly well suited to Cardboard VR apps.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nWatch more Android talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/Uv3jls\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JoMLpB\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSubscribe to the Google Developers Channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L \n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016"
