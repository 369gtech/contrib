description: "We’re all developers, but we’re not doing the same job. The line connecting a problem to its solution is relatively straight in some organisations and incredibly convoluted in others. Processes, software architectures and organisations are not separate concerns, neither are they orthogonal. Pretending to fix one thing without touching others is a losing battle.\n\nAlberto's talk explores how developers can be part of the problem and the solution.\n\nThis video was recorded at SCLConf 2019, an annual conference for software professionals that care about their craft.
