description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #30\n6 July 2021\nSponsored and Hosted by Taboola\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nRecommendation systems are usually tested online. While this process is accurate, it is costly and not scalable. In this talk we would cover how similarity based recommendation can be modeled as a regression problem, and we will share a dashboard we designed for offline simiarity experiments.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
