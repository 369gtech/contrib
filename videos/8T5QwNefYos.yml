Modern systems rely on tools like observability, extensive testing, and more recenty, chaos engineering. Understanding the math behind distributed computing, and being able to express systems in terms of algebraic topology and graph theory brings a new possibility of formal verification and a new approach towards solving complex problems and their interconnections.\n\nRead the full abstract: http://codesync.global/speaker/veronica-lopez/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - VERONICA LOPEZ\nSr. Software Engineer\n\nVeronica is a former physicist turned computer scientist, who currently finds joy building distributed systems with Go and Elixir, and trying to make physics and computers converge.\n\nMore on Veronica Lopez: http://codesync.global/speaker/veronica-lopez/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE MESH LDN 18\nCode Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
