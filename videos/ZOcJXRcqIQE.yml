recordingDate: 1563984136
description: 'Coroutines have received quite a bit of attention recently from language designers with async/await in JavaScript 2017, Python 3.5 new syntax, Kotlin 1.1 coroutines support and project Loom for Java. This session explains how coroutines can help writing concurrent code without any threads, how yield/async/await work, how coroutines relate to continuations and how to escape callback hell. This talk explains coroutines using runnable code examples in Lua, JavaScript and Scheme and should help capture the essence beyond syntax. The lessons apply to other languages with coroutines such as C#, Kotlin, Python, etc. Target audience: software developers'
