title: 'Migrating Java UI Client Applications to OpenJDK 11'
language: English
recordingDate: 1540507393
description: "Philip Race, Java Platform UI Client Engineer, Oracle\nSergey Bylokhov, Software Engineer, Oracle\n\nThe OpenJDK project has been in existence since 2007, and although it has shared the Java SE specification with the JDKs delivered by Oracle, they are not functionally identical in all ways. This is particularly the case for Java UI client applications utilizing the Swing/AWT/Java 2D UI toolkit. For JDK 11, Oracle JDK will converge with OpenJDK, and the vast majority of UI applications out there will effectively start to run on OpenJDK for the first time. This session covers what to expect and how to proceed. Additionally we will discuss changes and challenges due to the use of high-resolution display devices, and how to migrate applications so they work best with these on OpenJDK 11."
