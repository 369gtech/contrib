description: "DevOpsDays Baltimore 2019 - Ignite: The Value of Diversity & Inclusion to DevOps by Victoria Guido\n\nResearch shows that diverse, inclusive teams are better at solving problems, more creative, and higher performing. The underlying truth in the value of D&I lies in the evolutionary psychology of the human brain - how we learn, empathize with others, and develop new ideas.\n\nHave you ever faced an issue with a server or application for hours on end, only to have someone else come over and help you figure it out in two seconds? That’s the value of bringing in a different perspective, changing the algorithm you’re using to solve a problem and ultimately getting a better result.\n\nIn this talk we’ll share common steps, lessons learned, and tips & resources that can help you personally OR as an organization work toward creating a diverse and inclusive environment. We’ll highlight the changes in our company - from our hiring practices to the art on the walls - and share the value we’ve found in truly investing in D&I and the impact on our business.\n\n#confreaks #devopsdaysbmore"
