recordingDate: 1463511183
description: "Animation is powerful and is not going anywhere as long as humans have eyeballs. What does change is technology. And as a creative we want to worry less about technology and spend more time creating with as much freedom as possible. Enter a new era for animators. A post-platform specific era where fights between technologies don’t exist. Where new technologies are welcome with open arms. Where content can be built with freedom. With flexibility to change the format or the dimensions on a whim. Whatever the job calls for. This platform agnostic future is powered by the new Adobe Animate CC. Leveraging the skills of a generation of Flash users and bringing new ones into the fold to create content for whatever the future holds. Join Adobe Evangelist Paul Trani as he unveils Animate CC, and it’s new capabilities for all.\n\nPaul Trani\nSr. Creative Cloud Evangelist, Adobe\nhttp://twitter.com/paultrani\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
