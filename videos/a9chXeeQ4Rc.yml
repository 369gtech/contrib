description: "Lessons in auditing crypto currency wallets, systems and infrastructure\n\nIn past two years, Doyensec has been providing security testing services for some of the global brands in the crypto currency world. We have audited desktop and mobile wallets, exchanges web interfaces, custody systems and backbone infrastructure components. We have seen many things done right, but also discovered many design and implementation vulnerabilities. Failure is a great lesson in security and can always be turned into a positive teaching for the future. In fact, learning from past mistakes is the key to creating more secure system. In this talk, we will guide you through some of the application security lessons we have learned while taking this journey.  \n\nThe speech took on 9th May 2019 on Crypto&Security Stage during Infoshare 2019.\n\n#Blockchain #Crypto&Security #Tech"
