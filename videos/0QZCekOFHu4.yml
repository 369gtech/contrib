recordingDate: 1532330770
description: 'It is great to learn new tools and techniques. As I''ve learnt how to use Machine Learning tools I thought I''d found a magic wand. We all see multiple problems that might be solved with little help of magic. We have an input data, we know more less what we want to have on output. Machine Learning is a tempting offer, but usually if you don''t have good knowledge of your problem, it is much easier to build solution with simpler tools. We will discuss how to start with ML and where not to use it.'
