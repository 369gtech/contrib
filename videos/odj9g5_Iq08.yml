recordingDate: 1635395673
description: "Big Data might not be the buzzword it was five years ago, but it's more prevalent than ever. Even if you aren't currently dealing with Big Data, chances are that sooner or later you'll find yourself with a dataset that is just too big for your normal python or R setup to handle. In this Foo café event, the Data Science team at Castle.io will share three strategies that can be used to tackle Big Data in python and R. Three Big Data tools will be briefly introduced: duckDB, Spark, and SnowflakeDB. \n\nThe Data Science Malmö meetup is ramping up again and invites you to join this Foo Café event aimed at everybody working with or interested in data science.\n___________________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend. To make an event at Foo Café, you have to become a partner company with us or you can run a user group with an in-depth technical focus.\nWe welcome companies with sponsor challenges.\nWe are currently present in Stockholm and Malmö and have made over 2048 tech events since the start in 2012. \nAt Foo Café there’s an event going on everyday, year round."
