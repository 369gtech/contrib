description: "This presentation was recorded at Voxxed Days Belgrade 2016 - https://belgrade.voxxeddays.com/\n\nWriting distributed applications is very hard, especially when you start developing them as single-noded ones. Programmers tend to focus on functionalities first, leaving the scalability issues for later. Fortunately, Akka gives us many tools for scaling out and we can use them very early in the development process. I want to show you how to take advantage of these features. You will learn how to transform a single-noded app into a scalable one."
