description: "User Feedback at the Speed of DevOps\n\nJustin Marks, Principal Program Manager, Microsoft \nMiki Konno, Principal Design Researcher, Microsoft \n\nTraditional feedback mechanisms tend to take weeks or months to prepare, gather, and process user feedback for integration into the software life cycle. In this session, we'll show how the Developer Division at Microsoft has changed the way the engineering team partners with usability research to get feedback at the speed of DevOps. We will share our success (and failure) stories as we have worked to get feedback at a weekly cadence.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
