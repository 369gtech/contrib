description: "This video was recorded at virtual Lambda Days conference, which took place on 16-19th February 2021 - \nhttps://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2021\n\nMore great virtual tech conferences - https://codesync.global​ \n\n---\n\nA Bricklayer-Tech Report\nby Victor Winter\n\nABSTRACT\nAUTHORS: Victor Winter, Hubert Hickman, Isabella Winter \n\nBricklayer is an educational ecosystem whose focus is on the development of visuospatial, mathematical, and computational abilities foundational to computer science. This talk gives an updated report on the core (Ed)Tech elements comprising the Bricklayer educational ecosystem.  \n\nOBJECTIVE: To inform interested parties of freely available EdTech  suitable for CS education  \n\nAUDIENCE: Introductory CS Education\n---\n\nSPEAKER - Victor Winter\nCreator of Bricklayer and the general-purpose transformation system TL \nVictor Winter is a full professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Nebraska-Omaha and the creator of Bricklayer. His area of expertise is programming languages. Within this area Dr. Winter has a particular interest in formalisms and frameworks that enable the description of computation in a manner that facilitates understanding as well as various forms of analysis. This interest includes, (1) verification – the informal and formal reasoning about properties of programs, and (2) validation – the manual and automated construction of tests to increase confidence in the behavior of a system.  \n\n---\n\nLambda Days\nWebsite: https://www.lambdadays.org​\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LambdaDays​"
