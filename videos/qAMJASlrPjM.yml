description: "Join us for our next conference: https://goo.gl/B2bqQ6\nCarly has a degree from Northwestern University in film and musical theatre. After working in theatre for a few years, she had a crazy idea that she might be able to teach herself how to code. To get her foot in the door, she had to convince very smart people that she could write software because she can do ballet. It took a few tries.\n\nToday Carly is a software engineer at Slack and the tech lead for their international billing systems. In the year since she started working at Slack, not once has anyone made her feel stupid. Slack is empowering people to thrive. The fact that she still love what she's doing and has the confidence to take on challenging projects is a reflection of what her manager is doing right. Attendees will learn best practices they can apply to empower junior members on their teams.\n\nAbout Carly Robinson\n\nCarly Robinson is a software engineer at Slack working on their international billing system (#TeamMoney).
