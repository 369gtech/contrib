title: 'Sponsor Demo: NetApp - Kubernetes is Ready For Data: The Case For App Data Management'

description: "\"Stateful workloads are a challenge. Kubernetes, containers, and a number of other cloud native technologies are built on the assumption of ephemeral workloads.\n\nThat means a lot of extra work goes into making databases, and other stateful components work on Kubernetes. One source of extra work is that apps are often made of multiple components. Apps have statefulSets, Services, PVs, and a number of other resources that when composed together, define them.\n\nThe second source of extra work is that every app has its own procedure for getting backed up (and restoring). App-data management simplifies these problems. That’s two big ideas. One is that the parts that make up an app should be stored along with snapshots. The next is that with the right snapshot technique, most apps can share the same procedure for backing up and restoring. \n\nThis talk demos Jenkins being cloned. We’ll discuss how programmatic APIs could potentially enable more robust CI and testing for stateful workloads in the cloud.\""
