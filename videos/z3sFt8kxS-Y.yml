description: "James Graham, Mozilla\n\nThe web is the world's most popular application platform, yet poor browser interoperability is an all-too-common cause of dismay and frustration amongst web developers. In order to try improve this situation the W3C has been facilitating a community effort to produce a continually updated, cross-browser, testsuite for the open web; the web-platform-tests. In this talk James will introduce the web-platform-tests and describe the tools we have created for driving automation of the tests across a range of desktop browsers, and on mobile devices running Firefox OS. He will show how this software has been designed to meet the challenges of running an externally-sourced, frequently updated, testsuite on hundreds of commits a day in Mozilla's continuous integration system."
