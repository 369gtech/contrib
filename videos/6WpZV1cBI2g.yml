title: '"If Gaudí Had a Cluster" by Max Grigorev, Jen Carlile'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474122743
description: "Architects are tool builders. A famous example is the 20th century Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí, who built meticulous physical models of his world-famous buildings like Sagrada Familia and Casa Batlló. Armed with only rudimentary tools and manual calculations, Gaudí created buildings that still amaze people today. Imagine though, what if he had a computer cluster at his fingertips?\n\nAt Flux we are designing a visual, flow-based programming environment to give architects access to the latest developments in distributed computing. The goal is to enable modern Gaudís to explore the vast extents of their imaginations. In this talk we'll explore ups and downs of building a web-based visual programming environment aimed at building designers. We'll also talk about the distributed execution system that backs it all."
