title: 'Geir Arne Hjelle - Plugins: Adding Flexibility to Your Apps - PyCon 2019'
recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: Geir Arne Hjelle\n\nPython is a flexible language. Your Python app, on the other hand, is usually more set in stone: buttons, functions, displays are all explicitly defined.\n\nIn this talk you'll learn how to take advantage of features like decorators and functions as first-class objects to set up a simple plugin system that allows your app to be more flexible. In fact, you can allow your users to add or customize functionality they want after you ship.\n\nBy using plugins, your code becomes more modular and maintainable. At the same time your users may be able to use your great app to work with data or challenges you didn't even know existed.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
