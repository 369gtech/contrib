description: "By 2025, more than a quarter of data created in the global datasphere will be real-time in nature. To help make sense of 50+ zettabytes (10^21) of streaming data (in 2025), the Google Cloud offers a comprehensive set of services for real-time ingestion (Cloud Pub/Sub), streaming analytics (Cloud Dataflow), data warehousing (BigQuery), dashboarding and AI. Forrester recently rated Google Cloud Dataflow a Leader in the 2019 Streaming Analytics Wave.\n\nIn this session, Sergei Sokolenko, the Google product manager for Cloud Dataflow, will give an overview of the managed services available in the Google Cloud, and offer a reference architecture for building streaming processing applications, taking advantage of the unique features available in these services."
