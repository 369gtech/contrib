The Air Force and Space Force will be presenting the HAS2 flatsat â€“ the primary platform hosting the hacking challenges for HAS2, comprised of a variety of software and processor architectures commonly used in space vehicles. Visitors can command various settings changes in the flatsat and see the resulting changes in the telemetry from the device as well as visual attitude changes in the NASA 42 simulation.  Visitors will also be introduced to the HAS2 Digital Twin, an emulated version of all the flight software running on the flatsat, and will have a chance to capture and analyze an exploit being thrown against the flight software. Lastly, the Aerospace Corporation will demonstrate cyber defense onboard a satellite by using machine learning and signatures to detect anomalous command sequences and onboard cyber events.'
