description: "From No Delivery to Continuous Delivery: How the Air Force Gave In and Embraced Industry - Adam Furtado, US Air Force\n\nFrom the Internet to the microchip, the Department of Defense had been at the forefront of technology development throughout its history. Over the past few decades, software innovation in the commercial sector has left the DoD in its dust. Simultaneously, as the DoD became more and more reliant on software, their ability to deliver it rapidly worsened.\n\nThe Air Force realized that they needed a radical change and an innovative leap forward in order to give the warfighter the capability they need to win the war. That radical change included partnering with Pivotal Labs, embracing Cloud Foundry and turning the traditional DoD business model on its head.\n\nThis presentation discusses how the Air Force is mimicking Silicon Valley culture, growing its agile competency and continuously delivering better products to the warfighter, faster. \n\nAbout Adam Furtado\nAdam is the Chief of Product for, Kessel Run, a organization that is revolutionizing the Air Force's Air Operations Center (AOC) by partnering with Pivotal Labs and utilizing Pivotal Cloud Foundry to prove that industry best practices can be successful in the government. In this role, Adam oversees the product teams who are delivering capability more rapidly than they have ever before. This includes the Tanker Planner tool, which has saved the Air Force millions of dollars with the efficiencies gained. Adam has been working in Pivotal offices in SF and Boston as a Pivotal Labs client since June 2017. Adam has presented this work to the highest levels of government, including the Secretary of the Air Force and numerous Government events."
