title: 'RubyConfBY 2018: Stefan Wintermeyer "Better WebPerformance with Rails 5.2"'
recordingDate: 1525773499
description: "Speed is paramount for the success of a website (key for a good conversion rate and SEO). Unfortunately Webperformance is not a strong suite of a vanilla Rails application.\n\nLet's optimize an example Ruby on Rails 5.2 web shop application and analyze before/after times. I'll show the audience where it makes sense to spend time to optimize and where not. Use the new 5.2 goodies!\n\nSide effect: By making your Rails app faster you'll save server costs."
