(Using Coroutines TS, of Course)”\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nAre you doing memory lookups in a huge table? \nDoes your embarrassingly random access to your lookup tables lead to memory stalls? \n\nFear no more! \n\nWe will explore techniques that allow us to do useful work while the prefetcher is busily working on bringing the requested cache lines from main memory, by utilizing nano-coroutines. \n\nAnd the best part, nano-coroutines can be easily implemented using Coroutines TS that is already available in MSVC and Clang compilers. With a little bit of library support we can utilize the coroutines to extract intra-thread parallelism and quadruple the speed up your lookups.\n— \nGor Nishanov\nSoftware Engineer, Microsoft\nGor Nishanov is a Principal Software Design Engineer on the Microsoft C++ team. He works on design and standardization of C++ Coroutines, and on asynchronous programming models. Prior to joining C++ team, Gor was working on distributed systems in Windows Clustering team.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
