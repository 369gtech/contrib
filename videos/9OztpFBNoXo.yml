description: 'Automatic report generation is extensively needed in reproducible research and commercial applications. However, operation system-level reproducibility is still a huge concern in the current implementations. I''m going to demonstrate how easy it is to write a dynamic and reproducible report with the help of Docker, Docker API R client package, and the R package liftr we developed. Specifically, you will see how to dockerize your existing R Markdown documents, with applications to the analysis of petabyte-scale cancer genomics data, and the potential to distribute and reuse such reports.'
