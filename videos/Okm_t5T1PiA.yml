description: "RubyConf 2018 - Beating Mastermind: Winning with the help of Donald Knuth by Adam Forsyth\n\nCome solve logic games with Ruby, learn about minimax algorithms, and turn a paper into code. There are lots of \"solved\" problems out there that don't have a good library available -- learn how to write one yourself. We'll take a paper written by Donald Knuth (the \"father of analysis of algorithms\" and author of \"The Art of Computer Science\") and use it to solve a game called Mastermind that many people (including me) played as children. We'll look at the game, walk through the paper, turn the prose and math into code, understand minimax algorithms, and never lose at Mastermind again!"
