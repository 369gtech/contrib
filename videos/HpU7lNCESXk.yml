Maybe the code won't compile for half an hour whilst you bend it to your will... And maybe your code reviewers won't complain about the size of the change, taking them hours to review? And if you're lucky and concentrate very hard, it will be OK. Won't it?\n\nAs Kent Beck says, \"Make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change.\"\n\nThis talk will show you techniques to be kind to yourself - and your team - by making seemingly complex edits in small, safe steps, with your IDE doing much of the heavy lifting.\n\nYou'll be less tired at the end, and confident that the behaviour is unchanged. And users get the feature sooner - win, win!\n\n-------\nClare Macrae\nClare is an independent consultant, helping teams work sustainably and efficiently to test and refactor legacy and hard-to-test code.\n\nShe has worked in software development for over 30 years, and in C++ and Qt for 20 years, and is now branching out to other languages.\n\nSince 2017, Clare has used her spare time to work remotely with Llewellyn Falco on ApprovalTests.cpp, to radically simplify testing of legacy code. She has enjoyed this so much that in 2019 she set up Clare Macrae Consulting Ltd, to focus even more on helping others work with legacy code.\n\nBefore this, Clare was a Principal Scientific Software Engineer at Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. She is the original author of their popular C++ and Qt-based 3D crystal structure visualisation program Mercury.\n\n-------\nC++ on Sea is an annual c++ and coding conference, usually held in Folkestone, Kent in the UK. The 2020 & 2021 conferences were moved to virtual events due to social distancing requirements.\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk"
