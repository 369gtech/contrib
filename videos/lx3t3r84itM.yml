title: 'Denis Tsvettsikh. How to Secure the Architecture'
language: English
recordingDate: 1619617931
description: "There is a saying Setting a record is not enough, you need to hold it. Same for project architecture which must be first built and implemented, and then protected from entropy and newcomers. Our objective is to prevent the developer from doing wrong things as early as possible. We will eliminate invalid links between system components, common errors in class design and so on. Weâ€™ll also discuss how to implement automatic protection using tests, IDE plugins and existing language constructs.\n\nPresentation: https://disk.yandex.ru/i/aol5yozUp258kw\n\nDotFest: https://2020.dotfest.ru/lecture/14"
