description: "The Microsoft stack has changed, and suddenly, it’s not just about Windows any more. Thanks to .NET Core, we can now host .NET applications on Windows, Linux and even the Mac! So how does it work? What does it look like? And why would I want to do it?\nLet’s take a .NET Core app through its lifecycle, and see how to create it, and what tools we need to test and debug. We’ll also see how we host a web app without IIS, and how to deploy in a world of Docker and containers."
