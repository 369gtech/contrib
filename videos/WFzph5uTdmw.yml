description: "This interactive workshop will explore an architecture for building a large Angular app across federated development teams.\n\nWe’ll cover some low-level specifics of the architecture, like an Elements-based approach to angular.js migration, and building a shared component library on top of the Angular CDK. From there, we’ll explore developer experience and delivery ergonomics items like source control in a monorepo, Continuous Integration strategies, and code generation and modification via Schematics.\n\nInteractive examples will be provided, but laptops aren’t required to consume the workshop content.\n\nng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.\n\nFollow us on twitter https://twitter.com/ngconf\nOfficial Website: https://www.ng-conf.org/"
