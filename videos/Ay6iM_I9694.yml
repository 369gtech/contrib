description: "Nick Moore\n\nhttps://2020.pycon.org.au/program/LYRJGY\n\nWe'll explore the history of typewriters and find homoiconicity where you might not\r\nbe expecting it.\r\n\r\nWe'll talk about structured data and explore the early visions of hypertext.\r\n\r\nWe'll look at some specific examples of unusual programming environments \r\nand consider how a fresh look at these ideas can be applied to modern development.\r\n\r\nAnd finally we'll consider what a difference this could make to the work of programming.\n\nProduced by NDV: https://youtube.com/channel/UCQ7dFBzZGlBvtU2hCecsBBg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, PyConline\n\nSat Sep  5 16:00:00 2020 at Curlyboi"
