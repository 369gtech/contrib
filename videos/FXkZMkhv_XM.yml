language: English
recordingDate: 1369944336
description: "http://fluentconf.com\nIn the past year since I spoke at Fluent, HTML5 game development has been growing exponentially. While a lot of the techniques I spoke about before have stayed the same such as using Canvas for high performance 2d rendering, using requestAnimationFrame for building highly responsive game loops and audio which is continuing to improve, the compatible devices that support HTML5 games continues to grow. In this 10 minute demo I will show off Super Jetroid (http://jessefreeman.com/games/super-jetroid/) which is built using ImpactJS to look and feel like a native console quality 2d game. It runs on desktop/mobile browsers and natively on Windows 8 with full keyboard, touch and even Xbox controller support!\n\nhttp://fluentconf.com/fluent2013/public/schedule/speaker/132519"
