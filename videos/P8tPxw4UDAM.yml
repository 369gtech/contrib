description: "Managing the Complexity of Microservices Deployments - Prithpal Bhogill, Google & Kenny Bastini, Pivotal\n\nThe transition to microservices can be an exciting change of pace for many developers. But for organizations, the path to success with microservices is not without embracing a major cultural shift in the process of how companies build and deliver software.\n\nTo rapidly deliver microservices to production, organizations are turning to infrastructure automation provided by a cloud-native platform, like Cloud Foundry. With a platform in place, every microservice team will have what they need to create a CI/CD pipeline that safely delivers applications to a production environment. The final ingredient for success is knowing the right patterns for connecting microservices together over HTTP using REST APIs.\n\nIn this session, Kenny Bastani from Pivotal and Prithpal Bhogill from Apigee will dive into a reference architecture that demonstrates the patterns and practices for securely connecting microservices together.\n\nThis session will cover:\n\n- The basics for building cloud-native applications as microservices on Pivotal Cloud Foundry using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Services\n- The patterns and practices that are enabling small autonomous microservice teams to provision backing services for their applications\n- How to securely expose microservices over HTTP using Apigee Edge for PCF\n- How to ensure that APIs are readily and securely consumable by application developers\n- How to get instant, end-to-end visibility into the performance and adoption of your API program\n- How to thrive in the API economy by leveraging microservices and cloud-native application architectures\n\nAbout Kenny Bastani\nKenny Bastani works at Pivotal as a Spring Developer Advocate. As an open source contributor and blogger, Kenny engages a community of passionate developers on topics ranging from graph databases to microservices. He is also a co-author of O’Reilly’s Cloud Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry.\n\nAbout Prithpal Bhogill\nPrithpal is responsible for Edge API Management platform as a Product Manager in the Google Cloud Platform team. Prior to Google, Prithpal held various roles in Product Management, Pre-Sales, Architecture for companies including Apigee, Salesforce, Oracle and BEA.
