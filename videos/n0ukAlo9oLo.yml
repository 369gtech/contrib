description: "CF Networking: Policy, Service Discovery, & Beyond - Angela Chin & Usha Ramachandran, Pivotal\n\nLast year, the CF Networking team introduced direct communication between microservices and fine-grained, application-based policy through the creation of a new networking stack. With these features, operators are able to deploy microservices securely, removing the need for applications with sensitive information to have public routes.\n\nHowever, the work did not stop there! Learn about new features the Networking team have introduced in the past year such as platform service discovery and integration with 3rd party networking plugins! Through these enhancements, we will demonstrate how easy it has become for operators to enable direct, secure traffic between their applications. \n\nAbout Angela Chin\nAngela is a software engineer at Pivotal and the engineering lead of the Cloud Foundry Networking team, which develops the container networking and policy enforcement systems inside Cloud Foundry Application Runtime. Angela has previously given talks at CF Summit (North America and Europe), Open Source Summit, and Spring One Platform. \n\nAbout Usha Ramachandran\nUsha is a Staff Product Manager at Pivotal and the Product Lead for CF Networking.
