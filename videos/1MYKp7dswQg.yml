Unicage method has been popular on the field of business application software. The method makes it possible to apply shell scripts to business applications by rigid rules for data handling. The conciseness of shell scripts makes a great advantage in rapid development and tolerance of changes. The paralleling of commands by pipes would be also an attractive feature of shell scripts.\n\nUnicage method is influenced not only by Unix philosophy, but also by some kinds of oriental philosophy. The acceptance of changes, for example, would be the typical attitude for Japanese.\n\nBuddhist scriptures also tell \"nothing never changes.\" We illustrate the difference between oriental and western viewpoints on software systems by our several development examples with Unicage method.\n\nSpeaker: Nobuaki Tounaka \n1990 Graduated from University of Tokyo majoring in Engineering\n1992 Joined Daiei?the biggest retailer in Japan,at that time)\n2005 Founded Universal Shell Programming Laboratory Inc."
