description: "Animation is back in the web development tool chest! We know of declarative CSS Animations and Transitions and fully featured JavaScript animation libraries like GreenSock, but there's another option: the Web Animation API! In this talk Rachel Nabors will take you on a magical journey with Alice from Wonderland to show you how this new API is used to run the CSS Animations in your browser and how you can use it to generate and manipulate animations in your project. Colorful, interactive, useful fun for all disciplines.\n\nEVENT:\n\nAmsterdamJS Hot Summer Edition 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nRachel Nabors\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nAmsterdamJS Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nOriginal video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZCgLaOXxFw"
