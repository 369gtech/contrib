Adam’s record of open source contributions and thought leadership in the Erlang, NoSQL and web services communities include numerous publications and presentations at conferences, including Erlang Factory, Strata and SPIN. He recently presented a keynote address at MongoDB World in New York City where he announced Cloudant Query, a MongDB-style declarative query language that creates a better developer experience by reducing the learning curve to Cloudant. Adam received his Ph.D. in Physics from MIT in 2010, where he studied the gluon’s contribution to the spin structure of the proton. He is a proud father to three beautiful girls."
