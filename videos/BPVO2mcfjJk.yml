description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nTutorial: A Kind Workflow for Contributing to Kubernetes - Benjamin Elder, Google; Duffie Cooley, VMware; James Munnelly, Jetstack; & Patrick Lang, Microsoft (Limited Available Seating; First-Come, First-Served Basis)   \n\n Please bring your laptop fully charged as we will have limited charging stations available in the room.    How can you be confident that the change you make is functioning as you expect *before* you submit that PR?  Many contributors to the Kubernetes code base want to increase the confidence they have in their code prior to pushing that code upstream. This workflow will simplify this process for you!  Bring your Mac, Windows or Linux laptop to this session! We will show how to install the tools you need - Docker, golang and Kind.   We will  guide you through a great workflow for contributing and testing your code. We will be leveraging sigs.k8s.io/kind to show you how to build Kubernetes locally and test your code. Then weâ€™ll use Kind to run e2e tests against your local build.   Together, these new skills will enable you to feel more confident in the changes you are introducing to the existing code base and enable you to contribute more frequently! \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaek"
