title: 'Testing Production Streaming Applications - Gyula Fora & Matyas Orhidi'
recordingDate: 1588246326
description: 'One of the biggest challenge in streaming application development is making sure your pipeline does exactly what it is supposed to do. The combination of different data sources, sinks and complex application behavior such as time based functionality or interaction with external systems doesnâ€™t make the problem of proper testing any easier. In this talk we show you some of the excellent testing utilities built into Flink that can be used to unit-test parts of our application and to integration test complex data pipelines. We will also look at some external libraries developed by the community that can be used to further improve the testing experience and reduce time to production. Last but not least we will share some tools and best practices that can help debugging problems that managed to fall through the cracks. By the end of this talk you will be familiar with some of the best tools to test and debug your streaming pipelines to give you extra confidence in your applications.'
