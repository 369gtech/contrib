description: "DevOps Gathering 2017 | \"Intel and ARM, let Kubernetes rule them all!\" by Lucas Käldström \n\nMarch 23 - 25, 2017 in Bochum, Germany\npresented by bee42 solutions (bee42.com)\n\n***\n\nThe talk will explain what the difficulties are when dealing with clusters of various platforms, as well as how to solve them. As a demo, a cross-platform nginx workload backed with persistent, reliable storage will be deployed from the dashboard, monitored with Heapster, InfluxDB and Grafana and autoscaled while traffic is generated against the Ingress controller. There might be a chance for someone from the audience to be a chaos monkey and unplug a power cable from any node at any time during the heavy traffic in order to demonstrate the auto-healing functions of Kubernetes.\n\nCheck out our website:  devops-gathering.io"
