title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Distributions and Install Profiles: The Challenge and the Glory'
recordingDate: 1506529152
description: "In this core conversation we will discuss the difficult challenges (and glorious rewards!) of building or maintaining a Drupal distribution (“distro”) or install profile. These are an incredibly useful and underrated corner of the Drupalverse, and done right, they can save agencies and organizations a huge amount of time. But they can be very complex and they are not as well-supported by core, or by drupal.org, as they perhaps could be.\n\nWe are a panel of distro builders and core maintainers who wrestle with this stuff on a daily basis, and we’re there to answer your distros questions, share our approaches to building, and discuss how support for install profiles and distributions might be expanded and improved.\n\nFirst we’ll share our experiences in distro-building:\n\nThe differences between a distro and an install profile\nWhat kind of configuration should you package in an install profile?\nCommon build/install problems and how to avoid or fix them\nWhy distros make helpful starting points\nPlanning, purposing, and targeting a distro\nThen, we’ll open things up for discussion:\n\nHow could we improve drupal.org’s support for distros?\nUsing Composer to build distro packages\nMaking testbot run distros’ tests\nHow might we make it easier for folks to find the right distribution for them?\nHow might Drupal core better support distro updates?\nExtending/inheriting from existing install profiles\nHow to provide coherent, continuous update paths for distros\nCompositing or shipping several install profiles in a single distro\nAttendees should have intermediate-to-advanced knowledge of site building and module development in Drupal 8."
