description: '012 SVG images have paths and shapes. The paths are basically lines that can have color and thickness. Icomoon is not happy with this and wants shapes instead of lines. Let''s rework that icon, import it in icomoon and export the font again with the new update. Make sure to copy and overwrite the font files as well as the change in CSS'
