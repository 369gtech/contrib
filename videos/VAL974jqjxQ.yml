description: "Cultivating High Performance Teams in High Regulatory Environments\n\nRobin Yeman, LM Fellow, Lockheed Martin\nSuzette Johnson, Northrop Grumman Fellow, Northrop Grumman\n\nDevOps and Agile Practices thrive in High trust environments. To date many of the corporations reporting results from these practices are commercial organizations. Dr. Suzette Johnson, a Northrop Grumman Fellow and Robin Yeman, a Lockheed Martin Fellow will discuss how to obtain similar results in highly regulated government organizations. Technology has increased transparency of knowledge work and automation has shortened feedback loops allowing organizations which are typically low trust environments to reduce the risk of failures and increase the opportunity to empower teams. The approach they will discuss is moving from gates to guardrails. While government organizations may never be as high of a trust environment as Google they have made significant strides in increasing levels of trust in their own environments. Both Fellows from competing companies will explain how to make these changes.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
