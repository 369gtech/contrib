description: "The Sony hack proved that content producers are unprepared for attacks and unaware of the damage that can be caused to their IPs. Hacking Hollywood is a glimpse into the filmmaking process from a security minded and social engineering perspective. Learn the details that go into making a film and how the (dis)structure of the industry leaves them vulnerable to attack and what they can do about it.\n\nAndrew Nicholson: @Awkwardai\nAs a film location scout, Andrew has made a living out of getting into peoples homes and places of business to take pictures. He has worked on Hollywood film and television productions for over 6 years. His most recent credits include the Black Lightning Pilot and the 2018 Dynasty Reboot."
