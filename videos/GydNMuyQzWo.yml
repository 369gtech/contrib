title: 'Calling Functions: A Tutorial - Klaus Iglberger - CppCon 2020'
language: English
recordingDate: 1600898414
description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\n\nHow is a function call resolved? How does the compiler find the right function and how does the compiler choose from a set of available functions? This talk will give an overview of the individual steps taken during the resolution of a function call. It will primarily focus on the different kinds of name lookup, argument deduction, and on overload resolution. Attendees will gain insight into the mechanics of (un-)qualified lookup, argument dependent lookup, two-phase lookup, name hiding, SFINAE, (viable) candiate functions, and ambiguous function calls. They will leave the talk with a much better understanding of the (sometimes surprising) details of function calls.\n\n---\nKlaus Iglberger is a freelancing C++ trainer and consultant. He has finished his PhD in computer science in 2010 and since then is focused on large-scale C++ software design. He shares his experience in popular advanced C++ courses around the world (mainly in Germany, but also the EU and US). Additionally, he is the initiator and lead designer of the Blaze C++ math library (https://bitbucket.org/blaze-lib/blaze/src/master/) and one of the organizers of the Munich C++ user group (https://www.meetup.com/MUCplusplus/).\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
