description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nManaging Apache Flink on Kubernetes - FlinkK8sOperator - Anand Swaminathan, Lyft \n\nWe have designed and built an open-source Kubernetes native operator that manages the complete lifecycle of Apache Flink applications from creation to execution. FlinkK8sOperator (https://github.com/lyft/flinkk8soperator) leverages Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition to enable native management of Flink applications on Kubernetes. In this session, I will be presenting some of the unique challenges of running a complex, stateful application on Kubernetes, and the lessons we have learnt. I will also be providing an overview of how flink operator abstracts out the complexity of hosting, configuring, managing and operating 1000s of Flink clusters from application developers, and concluding with a demo. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UabA"
