language: English
recordingDate: 1573899171
description: "The Hybrid application community has been developing cross-platform mobile applications since 2009. While it's a tried and tested technology with an active community, many developers feel that newer solutions like React Native, Xamarin, etc. provide an all-around better solution. But the reality is quite different, the hybrid mobile community is still growing and a new competitor to PhoneGap called Ionic Capacitor was just released. In this talk, we will discuss the benefits and pitfalls of hybrid mobile applications and see how Ionic Capacitor and PWA fit into the mix. \n\nAbout:\nGuy Nesher, Web Developer, Codevalue\n\nI work as a developer at Codevalue where I divide my time between teaching various web related technologies and helping clients developing web applications. When I’m not busy organizing meetups / hackathons / speaking at events you can find me traveling the world and trying to improve my photography skills. I’ve recently became a Mozilla tech speaker."
