description: "Stephen O'Grady of developer focused analyst firm, RedMonk, will paint a picture of what the future might have in-store for Java in his keynote presentation from JAXConf 2013:\n\nThe Java ecosystem, long a bastion of stability in an otherwise volatile industry, is often overlooked of late, overshadowed by newer, more hyped alternatives. In many respects, the unrest couldn't have come at a worse time, as developer attention and focus is fragmenting under a constant stream of platform, language and framework fragmentation. What does this mean for Java advocates? We'll explore and unpack the recent events, and evaluate likely scenarios moving forward with an eye towards the implications for Java, including the future of Java the language and Java the platform. This will include relevant metrics vis-a-vis developer attention and strategy, as well as an examination of projects important to the ecosystem.\n\n** More free and awesome educational resources on Java development at http://marakana.com/s/"
