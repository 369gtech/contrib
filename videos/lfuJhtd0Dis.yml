description: "In this talk from QCon SF, Doug Bateman will demonstrate Spark's ability to rapidly process Big Data through a live example project. He'll cover:\n+ extracting information with RDDs\n+ querying data using DataFrames\n+ visualizing and plotting data\n+ creating a machine-learning pipeline with Spark-ML and MLLib. \n\nDoug will also discuss the internals which make Spark 10-100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce and Hive.\n\n*https://newcircle.com\n*https://databricks.com"
