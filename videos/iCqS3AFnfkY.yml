description: "Presented by Joe Rozner at JSLA (js.la) Thursday August 29th, 2013 - If you ever thought it might be a good idea to build rich audio applications in the browser and cringe at the thought of using flash to do so, you're in luck. The Web Audio API has landed in current versions of Chrome and Firefox and is ready for hacking on. This presentation will provide an introduction to the current draft spec showing the basics of how to use the API and show examples of what it possible by leveraging it as well as some of the additional HTML 5 APIs.\n\n* twitter.com/jrozner\n* github.com/jrozner"
