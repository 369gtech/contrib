description: "Do you ever feel locked into a solution too quickly?  Ever feel like you’re going with an idea just because all other ideas are getting shot down? This happens in a lot of teams, with everything from technical solutions to process problems. In this talk we will explore the value of having many options and solutions to a problem and show you some concrete ways of getting started with this approach.\n\nWe look at how to get better solutions, team engagement and promote innovation in your team.\nWe will discuss how to help you to explore the whole problem space before you get locked into an approach.\nWe will examine tools to shift your mindset to exploring options and experiments.\n\nAbout the speaker: Jeff is an Agile Coach who considers the discovery of Agile and Lean to be one of the most defining moments of his life, and considers helping others to improve their working life not to simply be a job, but a social responsibility.
