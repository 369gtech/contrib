description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n\nThe Holy Grail of Isomorphism | Evadne Wu - Software Engineer\n\nABSTRACT\nIsomorphic applications reuse code between client and server, but they are usually limited to the confines of a web browser. This often leaves out native (desktop or mobile) clients, and as a result, forces duplicative engineering effort.\nIn this session, Evadne shall demonstrate how this problem can be addressed by deconstructing and then recombining various technologies, so as to achieve true application code and tooling reuse between web, desktop and mobile clients, while reducing the chasm between client and server code and enabling teams to adopt new paradigms, such as LiveView, in a rather pervasive manner.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeBEAMio\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
