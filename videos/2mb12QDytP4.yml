title: 'DEF CON 29 Cloud Village - Mazin Ahmed -  Attack Vectors on Terraform Environments'
language: English
recordingDate: 1631397890
description: "Ever come across an environment in an engagement that uses Terraform for IAC (infrastructure-as-code) management? Almost every modern company does now.\n\nIn this talk, I will be sharing techniques and attack vectors to exploit and compromise Terraform environments in engagements, as well as patterns that I have seen that achieve successful infrastructure takeover against companies. I will be also covering prevention methods for the discussed attack vectors in my talk. This is part of my work-in-progress research in cloud security and attacking modern environments."
