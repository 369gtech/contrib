description: "Crashing Drones and Hijacked Cameras: CyberTrust Meets CyberPhysical\n\nJeannette M. Wing, Microsoft Research\n\nCyber-physical systems are engineered systems that require tight conjoining of and coordination between the computational (discrete) and the physical (continuous). Cyber-physical systems are rapidly penetrating every aspect of our lives, with potential impact on sectors critical to national security and competitiveness, including aerospace, automotive, chemical production, civil infrastructure, energy, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, materials, and transportation. As these systems fulfill the promise of the Internet of Things, smart cities, household robots, and personalized medicine, we need to ensure they are trustworthy: reliable, secure, and privacy-preserving. This talk will look at cyber-physical systems from the lens of trustworthy computing. Throughout my talk, I will raise research challenges for how to make cyber-physical systems trustworthy.\n\nView the full USENIX Security '16 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions"
