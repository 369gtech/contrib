language: English
recordingDate: 1588969716
description: "It has been said that open source software is eating the world and in the observability space, the project behind this movement is OpenTelemetry. The project recently entered beta and is quickly becoming the standard for instrumentation and data collection of observability data. When it comes to observability, there are lots of opinions, but limited answers. Understanding what data to collect and how to collect it properly is fundamental to ensuring users have the ability to address availability and performance issues quickly. This talk will discuss the components of the project, current status, roadmap, how you can get started, and how you can get involved.\n\nPresenter:\n\nSteve Flanders, Director of Engineering @Splunk"
