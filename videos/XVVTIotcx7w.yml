description: "http://www.oscon.com\nKyle Simpson is a JavaScript Systems Architect from Austin, TX. He focuses on JavaScript, HTML5, web performance optimization, and \"middle-end\" application architecture. If something can't be done in JavaScript or web stack technology, he's probably bored by it. Kyle runs several open-source projects, writes books, and speaks at meetups and tech conferences. He also helps drive the local startup/enterpreneurial community through events, coworking activities, etc.\n\nhttp://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/speaker/74368"
