title: 'Angular testing… but faster - Stephen Lau'
recordingDate: 1543580181
description: "For better or worse Angular comes with a very opinionated set of tools. Fortunately just like an opinionated partner you can kick them to the curb them and move on!\n\nWe’ll start by discussing how good tests look for an Angular front end.  What sort of tests we can write, and how those look with the default tooling. After trying out the Karma setup that ships in the Angular box we’ll discuss some drawbacks of this setup.\n\nOnce we’ve explored testing in Angular, we’ll then discuss leaving those tools for Jest.  We’ll discuss what Jest is, as well as our motivation for breaking from the norm.\n\nBy the end of the night you’ll be full of beer, pizza, and know how to write fast useful tests for your Angular frontend!\n\nStephen Lau is a consultant and teacher at Edument. After starting his career in Canada as a computer engineer doing hardware and firmware design, he’s slowly moved up the stack through firmware, drivers, operating systems, rendering engines, app development, as well as working with cloud deployed server and client side web development. An avid traveler he was in 18 countries last year.\n__________________\nFoo Café is a meeting place for people with an interest in software development and IT. \n\nHere, user groups and partner companies find the perfect atmosphere for sharing knowledge and develop competence. \n\nFoo Café is open for everyone and is free to attend.
