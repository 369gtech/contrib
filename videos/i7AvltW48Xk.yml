description: "Public recipes are the original open source, and for hundreds of years cooks have not only shared their source but also built incredible schools in their kitchens. Cooks of all levels face the constant pressure of staying relevant, and just like the best engineers, they do this by doggedly practicing the basics while experimenting on the bleeding edge. In this talk, we’ll learn to stay relevant by looking at the surprising parallels between modern kitchens and effective engineering teams.\n\nJuan Pablo Buritica is the VP of Engineering at ride.com where he leads a distributed team throughout the US and Latin America that is working to reinvent how people commute to work and take 1 million cars of the road. Juan Pablo has built effective software engineering organizations by emphasizing Open Source software values, technical excellence, trust and empathy. He has organized five software engineering conferences, spoken at multiple events, and led the growth of Colombia’s JavaScript community, the largest Spanish-speaking JS community in the world with more than 3,000 members.\n\nAbout Git Merge:\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content, user case studies and training workshops for Git users of all levels.\n\nVisit: http://git-merge.com/"
