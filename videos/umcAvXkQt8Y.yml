description: "Filmed at http://ng-poland.pl 2018 on NOVEMBER 15 in Warsaw. \n\nOnce when the Angular team introduces the CLI everyone was amazed by it's feature set. Now, about two years later, there are a couple of changes and improvements. Now we are able to scaffold a library, add features and update our Angular project automatically. I want to show you how these awesome new features work and which possibilities are available. Curious? I am. Can't wait to meet you. \nDavid Muellerchen - JavaScript developer, freelancer, Google Developer Expert in Angular\n\nDavid is an Angular consultant and trainer.
