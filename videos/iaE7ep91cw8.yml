description: "Your phone rings: the new JS application you deployed came under too much load, and the site has gone down! But you donâ€™t lose your cool, and you tweak the autoscaling setting to handle the load spike increasing the number of servers. The next day, you try to analyze what happened and begin to optimize your application to prepare for future spikes. This talk is a journey into the rabbit hole of Node.js performance, taking a look at the available tools and optimization techniques inspired by insight gained from glimpsing under the hood of Node and V8.\n\nEVENT:\n\nNode Summit 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nMatteo Collina, Principal Architect, nearForm\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nNode Summit Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to publish this video."
