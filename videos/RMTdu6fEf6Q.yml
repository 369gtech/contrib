description: "GIFT: A Coupon Based Throttle-and-Reward Mechanism for Fair and Efficient I/O Bandwidth Management on Parallel Storage Systems\n\nTirthak Patel, Northeastern University; Rohan Garg, Nutanix; Devesh Tiwari, Northeastern University\n\nLarge-scale parallel applications are highly data-intensive and perform terabytes of I/O routinely. Unfortunately, on a large-scale system where multiple applications run concurrently, I/O contention negatively affects system efficiency and causes unfair bandwidth allocation among applications. To address these challenges, this paper introduces GIFT, a principled dynamic approach to achieve fairness among competing applications and improve system efficiency.\n\nView the full FAST '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast20/technical-sessions"
