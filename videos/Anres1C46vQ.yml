description: "This is a recording of Kostis Sagonas at the Erlang User Conference 2012. For more info and slides go to http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2012/speakers/KostisSagonas\n\nWeb Services are an essential part of modern web systems, yet their testing is an extremely slow and painful process. In this talk we will present a testing framework based on PropEr, xmerl, and the SOAP library of Yaws that aims for automatic property-based testing of Web Services.  We will show how one can use this framework to perform fully automatic response testing of Web Services, how given a WSDL specification of a Web Service the tool can generate structurally valid test cases, and, if time permits, how RESTful and stateful Web Services could be tested."
