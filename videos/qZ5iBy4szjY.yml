description: "Government agencies realize they need to improve citizen engagement so that “Government Service” is no longer thought of as an oxymoron. By taking advantage of advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, governments are better able to repurpose their huge, existing data sets to provide the next level of government services. Beyond simple websites, the Digital Government initiative has created a post-website world of smart assistants to simplify maze-like call centers, avoid long lines at the DMV, or just get quick guidance on paying a tax bill. Chat bots built with cloud-native tools will handle citizen inquiries accurately and consistently, allowing government staff to concentrate on harder problems. Justin Herman from the GSA will discuss how DigitalGov has created open, responsive, accessible systems to improve government.\n\nJustin \"Doc\" Herman\nUS Social Media Lead\nUS Government"
