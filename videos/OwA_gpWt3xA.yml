language: English
recordingDate: 1529331719
description: "Further information: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/18/session/event-stream-processing-using-kafka-streams\n\nSession abstract: \nThis workshop will give you hands-on experience using Kafka Streams to solve a variety of event stream processing problems. The examples and exercises are based on real-world usage from our stream processing platform in Schibsted, used to process over 800 million incoming events daily from users across the globe. We will cover topics ranging from the basics like filtering and transforming events, to how you can use Kafka Streams for data routing, aggregating events, and enriching and joining event streams. To solve the exercises we'll be using Java 8 and/or Scala."
