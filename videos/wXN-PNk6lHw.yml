description: "Speaker: Timothy Chandler (@timChandlerZin)\n\nCome with me on a journey to the world of Facebook's Hack language and the HHVM platform. We are going to look at how to get started with an existing PHP codebase or a new project writen with Hack from the start.\n\nWe'll dive into the do's and don't of the language and how to overcome common pitfalls.\n\nHack extends an already amazing language and makes it so much better. I encourage you all to join this session and learn what makes Hack so great.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nI am the CTO and Director of Zinios Sdn. Bhd., a softeware development company focused on the creation of enterprise grade tools and platforms. I have lived and worked in the region (SEA) for the past 4 years and have been involved in several start-up and many projects. Before this I lived and worked in Australia as a Snr Software Engineer. I also helped build the now thriving Sydney PHP community. I have been involved in the setup and execution of several conferences and attended many others.\n\nEvent Page: https://2016.phpconf.asia\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/VGXi/"
