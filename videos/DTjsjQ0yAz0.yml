language: English
recordingDate: 1409705491
description: "Speakers include four well-known Node.js experts: Dan Shaw (dshaw), Trevor Norris, Erik Toth, and Guillermo Rauch. \n\nNode.js over the past few years has gone from an esoteric platform to a platform which powers some of the most important enterprise companies in the world. We’ll explore some of the places this transformation is taking place, how these teams are implementing Node and why this is happening. Node.js is transforming engineering organizations, but it is not necessarily taking over. We’ll see why that’s not a bad thing. Node is driving innovation and accelerating teams. It is a perfect fit for modern user experience driven, software as a service projects where responsiveness and iteration are critical."
