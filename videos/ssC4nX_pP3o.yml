description: "The RxJava hype is still in full swing and almost everything gets Rxified. At least since the stable RxAndroid 1.0 release it’s time to take RxAndroid seriously!\n\nIn this session you will learn what RxJava is about, how to use it on Android and how RxAndroid can be used to build maintainable Android Apps from networking with Retrofit2 to UI with the new RxBinding and RxLifecycle libraries powered by MVP.\n\nIf you haven’t had the time to Get Reactive, we’ll provide a quick introduction why you should use RxAndroid in your current and next projects."
