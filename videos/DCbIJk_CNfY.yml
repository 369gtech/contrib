title: 'Exploring Kotlin - Johan Haleby'
recordingDate: 1513258017
description: "In this talk we will explore the hype around the programming language Kotlin from JetBrains. We will explore the goodies and gotchas of Kotlin and why Kotlin might be a good investment for JVM and Android based applications. Come and see how JetBrains practical approach to language design increases expressiveness and code safety without necessarily sacrificing readability. The talk will give a proper introduction to the language and its syntax and continue to cover a lot of things from functional constructs to extension functions and builders.\n\nJohan Haleby is a developer, speaker and blogger with a strong interest in software development. He has founded and contributed to numerous open source projects such as PowerMock, REST Assured and Awaitility and has spoken at several international conferences and user groups.\n__________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
