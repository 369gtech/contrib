description: "This is a video of Simon Thomson and Huiqing Li 's talk at London Erlang Factory Lite  http://www.erlang-factory.com/\n\nIn this talk, we present the Erlang concurrency profiling tool Percept2, which is an enhanced version of the original Erlang concurrency profiling tool Percept.  Built on top of Percept, Percept2 provides not only process profiling information, but also scheduler and function profiling information. Visualisation and navigation through data is made easy in Percept2, and the performance has also been improved by the parallelisation of tool itself. We demonstrate how Percept2 can be used to find Erlang application level bottlenecks, and also how the tool can be used to provide guidance and feedback on the parallelisation of existing sequential Erlang applications."
