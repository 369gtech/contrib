recordingDate: 1509731589
description: 'Join Laura Frank and Stephen Day as they explain and examine technical concepts behind container orchestration systems, like distributed consensus, object models, and node topology. These concepts build the foundation of every modern orchestration system, and each technical explanation will be illustrated using Docker’s SwarmKit as a real-world example. Gain a deeper understanding of how orchestration systems like SwarmKit work in practice and walk away with more insights into your production applications.'
