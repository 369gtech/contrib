description: "99 Problems but a Container Ain't One: Patterns for Application Development Without Toil - Julz Friedman, IBM\n\nThere's an important secret about distributed systems and it's this: state is bad. State is the original sin that turns cattle into pets. Patterns focusing on stateless code - Serverless, Cloud Foundry, 12 Factor, Map/Reduce etc - allow programmers to focus on their app, and not on orchestration. This talk is a guide to the why and how of Orchestratorless, Containerless and Serverless development: that is development where you get to focus on your application, not containers and orchestration and servers and how Cloud Foundry can should and does fit into that movement."
