description: "Code is Here: http://goo.gl/gDdc4\n\nIn this part of the code refactoring tutorial, I will show you how to replace a constructor with a factory method in 2 code examples.\n\nI also received a challenge from one of you guys that I will solve. The challenge involves how to create a singleton factory method. It sounds more complicated than it is, but by watching this you'll learn a lot."
