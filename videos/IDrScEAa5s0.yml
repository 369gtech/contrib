description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nStateless applications are frequently very agile in K8s while stateful applications are not. OpenEBS is a solution for containerizing data and abstracting the storage layer so that your Kubernetes applications just work. We’re a CNCF Sandbox project with a strong community of around 1750 members that provides persistent and containerized block storage for DevOps and container environments.\n\nIn this webinar, we will cover how to easily get started with OpenEBS, deploy your stateful applications and make them replicated and portable across your clusters, availability zones, and clouds.\n\nWe will also discuss the latest features and how to set OpenEBS up with platforms like AWS, D2iQ Konvoy, Red Hat Openshift Operator Hub, Rancher and other platforms.\n\nAgenda:\nThe problem with persistent applications in K8s and how OpenEBS solves it\nDeploying OpenEBS in 30 seconds\nTop Use Cases\nDemo\nRoadmap\nQ&A\nGet started and Support"
