description: "Service Request Management: CSG's Journey from Chaos to Clarity\n\nJill Musil, Executive Director, Corporate IT Business Systems, Global Desktop Services & Unified Communications, CSG International \nJill Edmundson, Product Manager, CSG International \n\nThis presentation is focused on CSG's 24-month transformation from a chaotic, fragmented landscape to a unified Service Request Management enablement system. Attendees will gain perspective on the challenges CSG faced and the approach that was taken to simplify, streamline and accelerate Service Request Management in an evolving DevOps organization. \nLike many organizations, CSG sought outcomes to common business challenges: \n1. Delivering service value to meet the rapidly evolving needs of our clients\n2. Optimizing workflow processes throughout the organization for our DevOps teams\n3. Creating transparency for the enterprise through a “single pane of glass”\n\nAttendees will hear a first-hand account of the steps that were taken by CSG to revolutionize the way services are processed from intake to fulfillment. Our presentation is designed to share the CSG Service Request Management Evolution Experience with our peers who are currently working through their DevOps transformation. We believe that our SRM story is relevant to any organization that has a desire to examine, transform, and optimize the flow of service-oriented value from Intake through Fulfillment by implementing transformational technologies that support one of the core DevOps tenants: Make Lives Easier.\n\nDOES17 San Francisco\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/us/"
