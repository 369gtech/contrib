description: "Why do we always tend to see our weaknesses and put our focus on how to improve them? Regardless the effort we spend on our weaknesses it would still not take us to the top of our personal potential. However, putting our energy on the strengths and talents would.\n\nAlready as children we get fostered into the same framework of capabilities to master, and it gets reinforced by everyone being measured towards the same scale. At a very young age we already know what our talents are. And yet most people focus on improving their weaknesses.\n\nIn this talk I would like to share some ideas that has helped me finding my own way to develop both me and the team.\n\nI believe that if putting more focus on our strengths, enhancing them, and experimenting with them it would not only help our careers, but it would also make our life easier and much more fun.\n\nPernilla Andersson has a Master of Science and Engineering in Computer Science and is a software test manager at Verisure Innovation.
