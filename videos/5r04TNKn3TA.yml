description: "Meetup #AperiTech della Community di GraphRM\n\nSpeakers: \n- Fischer (Fujitsu Laboratories)\n- Wing Au(Fujitsu Laboratories)\n \"Applying Graph Machine Learning to Enterprise Business Problems\"\nJeff Fujitsu’s research labs have worked on graph-based Machine Learning from both a theoretical and an applications perspective. In this talk, we’ll describe Fujitsu’s Deep Tensor technology for graph ML and highlight our experiences with applying graph-ML to business problems.\n\n- Kevin Naughten (Cambridge Intelligence)\n \"It’s the data, stupid: state-driven application design for graph visualization\"\nAdding additional nodes to a crowded graph visualization is a complicated problem for the application developer. Where should they be placed, which bits are actually new, and what should you do with to the data that was already on the screen? What happens when an analyst asks to filter out all of the terrorists associated with ISIS, or a scientist needs to see all of the compounds that inhibit BRAF but not MEK, and who decides?\nThis talk show how state-driven graph visualization can help software decisions to get out of the way so that both developers and analysts focus on the data.\n\n\nPer restare aggiornato su tutti gli #AperiTech:\nTelegram #AperiTech https://t.me/aperitech\nCalendario del Developer https://bit.ly/devcalendar\nCodemotion Tech Community https://bit.ly/CodemotionTC"
