description: "We've all seen the impact that open source has had on innovation in software; open sharing and collaboration have been at the root of some of our greatest achievements as an industry. The pace of innovation in the hardware space, on the other hand, has been markedly slower. The potential benefits of open hardware are clear enough: More openness and collaboration would likely mean a faster pace of innovation and greater accessibility to the best possible technology for us all. But how do we get there?\n\nIn this talk, Facebook's Frank Frankovsky will examine key moments from the history of open hardware and share learnings from his work on the Open Compute Project — a prominent industry initiative focused on driving greater openness and collaboration in infrastructure technology — to draw out insights on how we can create and sustain open source movements in hardware.\n\nFrank Frankovsky\n\nFacebook\n\nFrank Frankovsky is vice president of hardware design and supply chain at Facebook. In that role, he is responsible for the company's hardware engineering and validation; technical program management; capacity engineering and analysis; and supply chain operations teams. He is also one of the key drivers of the Open Compute Project, an initiative dedicated to reshaping the infrastructure hardware industry to be more open, more innovative, and more efficient. Prior to joining Facebook, Frank spent 14 years with Dell, where he was an integral part of building Dell's PowerEdge server business and co-founded Dell's Data Center Solutions business.
