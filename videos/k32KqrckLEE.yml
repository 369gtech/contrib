description: "Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012 in Washington, DC\nSpeaker: Rob Winch\nSpring Security is a framework that focuses on providing both authentication and authorization to Java applications. Like all Spring projects, the real power of Spring Security is found in how easily it can be extended to meet custom requirements. In this presentation Rob will incrementally apply Spring Security to an existing application to demonstrate how it can meet your authentication and authorization needs. It will also answer many of the common \"how to\" questions that are found on the forums. This will ensure that you can not only secure your application quickly, but ensure you understand Spring Security well enough to extend it to meet your custom requirements.\nGet the code!\nhttps://github.com/rwinch/getting-started-springsecurity-31"
