title: 'Going Native: Bringing FFI to the JVM'
language: English
recordingDate: 1433254939
description: "Write once, run anywhere has served us well over the years, but eventually everyone needs to use code that doesn’t run on the JVM. There are native libraries out there for crypto, graphics, data stores, computation, user interfaces, and much more, but they’ve been hard or impossible to use from JVM-based code. Until now. The Java Native Runtime (JNR) is a high-speed foreign function interface (FFI) for calling native code from Java without ever writing a line of C. Based on the success of JNR, JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP) 191 will bring FFI to OpenJDK as an internal API. And hopefully a JSR for Java 9 will tightly integrate and standardize an FFI API. Learn more in this session.\n\nThis talk will explore current and future FFI options, and show you how to help.\n\n\nAuthor:\nCharles Nutter\nCharles has been programming most of his life, as a Java developer for the past decade and as a JRuby developer for over six years. He co-leads the JRuby project, an effort to bring the beauty of Ruby and the power of the JVM together. Charles believes in open source and open standards and hopes his efforts on JRuby and other languages will ensure the JVM remains the preferred open-source managed runtime for many years to come.\nView more trainings by Charles Nutter at https://www.parleys.com/author/charles-nutter-4\n\nFind more related tutorials at https://www.parleys.com/category/developer-training-tutorials"
