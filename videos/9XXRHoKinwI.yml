description: "PyData DC 2018\n\nDemocratizing NLP content modeling with transfer learning using GPUs. I am going speak about developing in house embeddings using GPUs for transfer learning for a wide range of problems such as building recommendation systems, developing customer insights, measuring coverage of content to mention a few. The uniqueness of this approach is once the embeddings are built large portions of unstructured\n\nSlides - https://www.slideshare.net/SanghamitraDeb1/democratizing-nlp-content-modeling-with-transfer-learning-using-gpus-123553981\n===\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
