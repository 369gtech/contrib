description: "Modern Data Science: A new approach to DataFrames and pipelines\nMaarten Breddels, Jovan Veljanoski\nAudience level:\n\nWe show how to deal with massive datasets using small resources using the Python Vaex DataFrame library. Using computational graphs, efficient algorithms and storage (Apache Arrow / hdf5) Vaex can easily handle up to a billion rows, even on your laptop. As a bonus, Vaex can automatically generate a Machine Learning pipeline using the graph structure build-up internally in the DataFrame.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
