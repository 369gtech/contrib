description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\r\nJuly 15, 2011\r\n\r\nPresented by Rob Hawkes.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIn this talk Rob will take you on a journey through the development of Rawkets, his HTML5 and JavaScript multiplayer space shooter. He will place particular focus on the issues that plagued the early progress, as well as the subsequent solutions that helped make it the ever-so-slightly addictive game that it is today. Expect theory, examples, and plenty of code in this light-hearted look at game development with the latest Web technologies. \r\n\r\nRob Hawkes (@robhawkes) thrives on solving problems through code. He's addicted to visual programming, and can't get enough of HTML5 canvas. Most of his waking life is spent working on crazy projects involving all sorts of new and exciting technologies, both on-line and off. Aside from his practical work, Rob is the author of Foundation HTML5 Canvas, which is all about making games with the new Web technology. He works for Mozilla as a Technical Evangelist, which puts him in the fortunate position of being able to work on his hobbies full time and still feed himself. Learn more at http://rawkes.com/"
