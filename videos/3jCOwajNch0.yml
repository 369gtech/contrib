We'll cover the minor changes to lambdas in C++17, such as the ability to capture `*this` by value, and indicate some of the minor changes coming in C++2a. Finally, we'll detour into the implementations of std::function and std::bind to show how they're different from lambdas.\n\nAttendees will leave this session with a clear understanding of how C++ — a language without dynamic typing or garbage collection — can nevertheless support efficient lambda closures.\n— \nArthur O'Dwyer\nNew York\n\nArthur O'Dwyer is the author of \"Colossal Cave: The Board Game,\" \"Mastering the C++17 STL\" (the book), and \"The STL From Scratch\" (the training course). He runs professional C++ training courses, is occasionally active on the C++ Standards Committee, and has a blog mostly about C++.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
