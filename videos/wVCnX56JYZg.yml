description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune 7, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nComputer systems in large enterprises and in the outsourcing industry are difficult to manage manually. This difficulty has led to a push for autonomic computing, where the goal is to have the system automatically configure its settings, tune its performance and recover from failures.\n\nSuch large systems have innumerable caches to enhance performance. One task in autonomic computing lies in sizing these caches and sharing them out among competing workloads. Cache miss equations can help to automate this task.\n\nFor the cache miss equations to be helpful, they must be universal: they must fit any real memory reference pattern and cache management policy,..."
