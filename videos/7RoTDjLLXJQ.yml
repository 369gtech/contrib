description: "https://cppcon.org/\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2020\n---\nOccasionally, someone will toss out in discussion “That’s an ABI breaking change”. What does that mean? Is that a problem? In this talk, I’ll walk though what an ABI is, show a couple different kinds of ABI, and give examples of innocuous changes that caused an “ABI break”. I’ll talk about history (libstdc++ and string, and others), and talk about some things that the C++ committee is considering.\n\n---\nMarshall has been programming professionally for almost 40 years. He is the author of Boost.Algorithm, and has been a contributor to Boost for more almost 20 years. Until recently, he was the chairman of the Library working group of the C++ standard committee, and the lead developer for libc++, the C++ standard library for LLVM.\n\n---\nStreamed & Edited by Digital Medium Ltd - events.digital-medium.co.uk\nevents@digital-medium.co.uk"
