description: "Code is a not an asset. Technology is not the solution to your company problems. And engineering for engineering's sake is not the answer.\nAs engineers, we tend to focus a lot of our time thinking about \"how?\". How to solve this problem? How to structure code? How to name this method? We forget to ask \"why?\" and ponder the usefulness and greater impact of what we're doing. How should we engineer? Should we use the new and exciting technologies to solve our problems? Should we always strive to use the right for the job? Using his own experience, Mindaugas will try to answer just that."
