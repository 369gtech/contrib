description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nGareth Rushgrove - Web geek, GOV.UK\n\nABSTRACT\nThe Government Digital Service is a new unit of the UK Cabinet Office tasked with all things digital. It's made up of designers, developers,systems administrators, product managers and Government policy specialists - all building, running and helping to design large online government services. Our tools include agile, multidisciplinary teams with the ability to make fast decisions; close collaboration between developers, operations and information security specialists; and modern infrastructure and software as a service products. We look a lot like a startup.\n\nThis will be a technical talk with lots of culture thrown in. We'll discuss how we shipped GOV.UK, including:\n\n- how we built our teams and technology to allow us to make changes to the live service daily\n- how we worked closely with security and auditing colleagues from day one, not just as an afterthought\n- how we moved infrastructure supplier quickly using modern configuration management tools and APIs\n- how we're now trying to spread some of these practices and approaches around a super large organisation\n- details of lots of the mistakes we made along the way \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
