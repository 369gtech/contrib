And what do you do with data, once it is in the Cloud?\nIn this session, you will see many demos -- with code -- and very few slides, that will introduce you to new and exciting free and open source data visualization tools, written in JavaScript, that help you visualize data in the Cloud.\nYou will learn about Oracle JET (oraclejet.org), Oracle's free and open source toolkit for creating JavaScript applications, which Oracle has been using internally over the past 3 years and is now available on GitHub.\n\nRead more: oredev.org/2016/sessions/oracle-jet-enterprise-javascript-for-visualizing-cloud-data \n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
