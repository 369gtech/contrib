description: "In this video, Jane Friedhoff visits the studio to talk about her work and answer your questions!\n\nJane Friedhoff is a game designer and creative technologist who loves making games that encourage silly and absurd behaviors in public spaces. She co-founded the Code Liberation Foundation, which provides free, trans-inclusive, women-only game design and programming classes. She graduated with her MFA in Design and Technology from Parsons in 2013. Her portfolio includes Slam City Oracles, 2nd Amendment, and Scream 'Em Up. Her games and interactive pieces has been shown at a wide variety of events, including Babycastles, NYU's No Quarter, Different Games, Come Out and Play, Indiecade, GDC, and E3, and her academic work has been published in DiGRA. If a project involves screaming, awkwardness, or dance parties, she’s probably into it. \n\nContact:\nWebsite - http://janefriedhoff.com/\nTwitter - https://www.twitter.com/jfriedhoff\nEmail - jane.friedhoff@gmail.com\n\nVideos played in this presentation:\nSlam City Oracles: https://jfriedhoff.itch.io/slam-city-oracles\nSlam City Oracles Mini-Trailer: https://vimeo.com/128555267\nScream ‘Em Up - v. 1.0: https://vimeo.com/41629022\n\nSupport this channel on Patreon: https://patreon.com/codingtrain\n\nFor more Guest Tutorials and Interviews: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bYBG4PsCJpsvMka3boE9pR\n\nFor more Coding Challenges: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/0Rrt/"
