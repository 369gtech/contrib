title: 'Péter Halácsy: I don’t want to change people anymore'

description: "I tried. I tried to change people but they didn’t get my point. They just got angry at me, they resisted, pushed back, and got defensive. And it makes sense. The harder you push a system the harder it will push back. All living organisms (humans, companies, societies) are resistant to change, that’s why they are alive.\n\nSo what if we forget about wanting to change in people. Instead let’s connect to people to help them achieve what they want.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nStretch Leadership and Management Conference\nstretchcon.com"
