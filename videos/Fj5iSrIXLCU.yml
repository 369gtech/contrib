description: "Data Labeling as Religious Experience\nJosh Wills, Slack\nPresented at MLconf San Francisco 2019\n\nAbstract: One of the most common places to deploy a production machine learning systems is as a replacement for a legacy rules-based system that is having a hard time keeping up with new edge cases and requirements. Iâ€™ll be walking through the process and tooling we used to help us design, train, and deploy a model to replace a set of static rules we had for handling invite spam at Slack, talk about what we learned, and discuss some problems to solve in order to make these migrations easier for everyone.\n\nSee Josh's presentation slides on our slideshare page here:\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/SessionsEvents/josh-wills-data-labeling-as-religious-experience/SessionsEvents/josh-wills-data-labeling-as-religious-experience"
