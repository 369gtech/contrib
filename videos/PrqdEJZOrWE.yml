title: 'Perceiver for Cardiac Video Data Classification (AlphaCare: Episode 2)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1633120018
description: "DeepMind recently released a new type of Transformer called the Perceiver IO, which was able to achieve state of the art accuracy across multiple data types (text, images, point clouds, and more). In this episode of the AlphaCare series, I'll explain how Perceiver works, and how we used it to improve accuracy scores for Cardiac video data. The EchoNet dataset was recently made public by Stanford University, and it contains 10K privatized heart videos from patients. We'll also discuss why Transformer networks work so well, and how by using 2 key features (Cross attention & positional embeddings), the Perceiver improved on all variants of Transformers. Get hype! \n\nBig thanks to RapidAPI for sponsoring this video series:\nhttps://rapidapi.com/hub?utm_source=Siraj-Raval&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel\n\nCode & Coding Challenge:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/AlphaCare/tree/main/Perceiver\n\nChallenge Submission Link:\nhttps://forms.gle/2DJkYts4HAfHMKpm8\n\nMore Learning Resources:\n\nPerceiver explainer by Yannic Kilcher:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_xeshTnPZg&t=1365s\n\nAlphaCare Episode 1 link:\nhttps://youtu.be/fGv6VmfGMLc\n\nPerceiver Explainer by AI Epiphany:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJWBq4NZfvY\n\nMIT Video on CNNs:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaSUYvmCekI \n\nHenry AI Labs Video on 3D CNNs:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcnKGMNyVu4\n\nECG Time Series Classification Video in PyTorch:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN3n0TM4Jno\n\nAwesome list of papers + code on ECG Classification:\nhttps://paperswithcode.com/task/ecg-classification\n\nList of awesome materials on Deep Learning in healthcare:\nhttps://github.com/XiaoleiZ/awesome-list-machine-learning-healthcare\n\nFree EdX course on ML in Healthcare:\nhttps://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-for-healthcare\n\nAndrew Ng's Free Deep Learning courses:\nhttps://www.deeplearning.ai/\n\nDr David Sinclair at Harvard Medical's Book that inspired me:\nhttps://lifespanbook.com/ \n\nMy Math of Intelligence Playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRJCOz3AfYY&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7mu0bSksCGMJEmeddU_H4D\n\nFree Book on Intro to Statistical Learning:\nhttps://www.statlearning.com/\n\nFollow me:\n\nINSTAGRAM:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/\n\nTWITTER:\nhttps://twitter.com/sirajraval\n\nFACEBOOK:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sirajologyyy\n\nLINKEDIN:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/sirajraval/\n\nTIKTOK (i'll start posting soon):\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@sirajraval?lang=en\n\nPlease subscribe for more programming videos!
