title: '"An Interactive Web Visualization for Watershed Topology" by Mark Phillips'
language: English
recordingDate: 1474122982
description: "Where does the rain go once it hits the ground? Some of it soaks into the ground, and some of it evaporates. The rest flows into creeks, streams, lakes, and rivers, eventually making its way to an ocean. The route that this water takes is determined by thousands of regions called watersheds.\n\nCreating an interactive visualization showing how these regions connect to each other includes finding and reformatting some public data, some directed acyclic graph algorithm coding, reducing the size of the data set to something that can quickly be served in a web page, and some challenging graphics performance issues associated with the display of nearly 100,000 polygons in your browser.\n\nThis talk will demonstrate and describe the architecture of a fun open source JavaScript web app that combines all these things to let you get an instant view of the areas areas both upstream and downstream from any location by simply pointing with the mouse."
