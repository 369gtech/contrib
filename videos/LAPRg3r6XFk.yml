title: 'YOW! BAC Sydney 2018 - Marcia Ryan - Cultivating collaborative relationships #BAC'
recordingDate: 1539580491
description: "The quality of our daily interactions with work colleagues determines how fast and how well we communicate, collaborate, and learn together to achieve successful outcomes. There is a need for leaders and team members to connect well and be comfortable to seek assistance, confident to question current practices and share lessons learnt from successes and failures. With little time and resources, how can organisations build the capability of leaders and teams to rapidly form strong, supportive work relationships and psychological safety that are the foundations for collaboration?\nIn this session, Marcia Ryan shares a case study of how a team in the insurance industry managed to collaborate and achieve successful outcomes during a period of business change that created an environment of uncertainty. How did the leader shift the mindset of the team from self-protection to sustain collaboration? How did the team create a safe climate to support each other and continue to collaborate and perform well during this challenging time? Learn how this was implemented, the actions the leader and team members took to rapidly cultivate collaborative behaviours into their daily work interactions and the positive outcomes this led to.\n\nI help organizations implement wellbeing initiatives that provide staff with skills to approach work challenges positively to find success and satisfaction in their work. \n\nI advise leaders how to build a positive workplace by using a strength-based approach. I use the science of positive psychology and my experience as a workplace learning consultant to offer practical ways to help organisations build positive teams that are engaged, successful and productive.\n\nFor more on YOW!
