title: 'GeeCON 2019: Thomas Sundberg - Recycling examples'
recordingDate: 1563984048
description: "Have you ever wondered how you can recycle your Gherkin examples and verify different parts of your application using the same example? This is a two two part problem: \n* implement an adapter for each seam you want to connect through \n* use the adapter when running Cucumber Thomas will show an example using Cucumber-JVM where he recycles examples by varying adapters. The result is fast feedback if the business logic is broken. Slower but accurate feedback if the delivery mechanism is broken. At the end of the day, you can be certain that you won't let your users down when they get to use the application. There will be code implemented and executed on stage that will show one way of recycling examples."
