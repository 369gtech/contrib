title: 'Autonomous Microservices, with Denis Wilson Souza Rosa'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526550120
description: "Everybody loves Microservices, but is difficult it is to make it right. Distributed systems are much more complex to develop and maintain, and over time, we even miss the simplicity of old monoliths. In this talk, I propose a combination of Infrastructure, architecture, and design principles to make your microservices bulletproof and easy to maintain with a combination of high scalability, elasticity, fault tolerance, and resilience.\n\nIn this session we also show how to deploy a fast, elastic, highly scalable and cloud-agnostic application with Kubernetes and Couchbase's Operator, which allow both your application and database adaptable to any demand with zero effort."
