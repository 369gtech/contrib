description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nJanuary, 29 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nBy identifying and further developing our unique talents and character strengths, we contribute more effectively and enjoy the process. This talk will draw on findings from positive psychology, brain science, and resilience research to describe practical strategies for articulating passions and reaching goals. \r\n\r\nParticipants will hear about two reputable online strengths surveys and learn how to call on the five key strengths that have been correlated with fulfillment and success. \r\n\r\nI will focus on applying these findings to Googlers' experience and offering suggestions for ongoing development. I look forward to creating a dialogue using questions from the audience.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Carolyn Foster\r\nStrengths-based leadership is at the heart of my coaching philosophy. The latest research confirms that leading from strength rather than focusing on deficits creates lasting personal satisfaction and high performance. By identifying and further developing their unique talents and character strengths, Googlers can contribute more effectively in all areas of their job responsibilities. Offering support and accountability, I guide clients to meet their goals as part of an overall strategic plan for professional success and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nI have created a strengths-based curriculum keyed to two online research instruments that I use with individuals and leadership teams in my business, Creative Choices. I teach at Stanford Continuing Studies and UC Extension. Offering retreats and workshops for professional and personal development allows me to work with a wide range of organizations in California and around the country. Previously, I taught adults for ten years in a graduate psychology program and spent ten years in the counseling field."
