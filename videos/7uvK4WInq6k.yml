description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Berlin 2019. #GOTOcon #GOTOber\nhttp://gotober.com\n\nBernd Rücker - Co-founder and Chief Technologist of Camunda and co-author of “Real-Life BPMN\"\n\nABSTRACT\nIntegrating microservices and taming distributed systems is hard. In this talk I will present three challenges I've observed in real-life projects and discuss how to avoid them.\n1. Communication is complex. With everything being distributed failures are normal so you need sophisticated failure handling strategies (e.g. stateful retry).\n2. Asynchronicity requires you to handle timeouts. This is not only about milliseconds, systems get much more resilient when you can wait for minutes, hours or even longer.\n3. Distributed transactions cannot simply be delegated to protocols like XA. So you need to solve the requirement to retain consistency in case of failures.\nI will not only use slides [...]\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotober.com/2019/sessions/1054/3-common-pitfalls-in-microservice-integration-and-how-to-avoid-them\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOber\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Microservices #Programming\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
