description: "While HTML5 gaming is still in its infancy that doesn't mean you have to wait for it to fully mature on the web. Windows 8 is the only OS that makes HTML and JS a first class citizen. That means you can take your existing web skills and build HTML5 games today! Join this webcast talk by Jesse Freeman, author of Building HTML5 Games with ImpactJS, as he goes over the best HTML5 game frameworks to use, moving from the web to Windows 8, supporting mobile devices, testing/debugging your game and how to publish on the Windows 8 store. If you have your own HTML5 games and are looking for a better place to monetize them or you are interested in building HTML5 games for web, mobile and desktop you will not want to miss this webcast.\n\nAbout Jesse Freeman\n\nMy name is Jesse Freeman and I am a Technology Evangelist at Microsoft focusing on Windows 8 and HTML5 Gaming. My job is to help developers build amazing apps and games for Windows 8. I have been a Web developer for over 13 years as well as a mobile app developer for the better part of the last 4 years. While living in New York have worked with some of the city's top companies such as MLB, the New York Jets, HBO, Tommy Hilfiger, Bloomberg and even internationally for clients such as VW. I have always used my passion for making games to help me learn new programming languages and this passion is one thing I hope to help share with others.\n\nProduced by: Yasmina Greco"
