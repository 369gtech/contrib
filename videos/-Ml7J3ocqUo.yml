title: 'George Mandis — Make More Than Music with Tiny Computers, JavaScript and MIDI'
language: Russian
recordingDate: 1511361174
description: "Tiny computers such as the RaspberryPi, Arduino and C.H.I.P. have finally reached a level of performance and affordability that makes hardware experimentation accessible to everyone. At the same time, JavaScript has emerged as the lingua franca of web programming and can be found in many places beyond just the browser.\n\nWhat if I told you there was a mature protocol that's been around since 1983 and was uniquely poised to take advantage of this development?\n\nWell, wonder no more and meet MIDI!\n\nSitting at convergence of these two things is MIDI — a niche protocol that's been around since 1983 and was originally designed for musical instruments to communicate with one another. Its event-oriented approach to messaging feels right at home in the asynchronous world of JavaScript & Node, and the prevalence of MIDI support in older musical equipment means you can find unique, hackable and affordable hardware at your local pawnshop or Craig's List.\n\nThis unlikely tech stack — Tiny Computers + JavaScript + MIDI — can lend itself to creative programming beyond music. George's Talk will explain how to get started, walk through several examples and elaborate on the future of this stack, not only as a platform for experimentation but for education as well."
