title: 'Applying Agile Thinking: Run Measure Learn - Julia Mitchelmore'
recordingDate: 1493030452
description: "Agile is not just for software development. Long before the Manifesto was written manufacturers have been using iterative cycles to build cars, engines, photocopiers and cameras. The core agile concept of 'build, measure, learn' lends itself well to the development of many different types of product.\nBut what would happen if you tried to apply agile thinking to an individual pursuit, such as marathon running? Can an iterative approach help the training process? How can you take the principles of agile software development and rethink running? In this session we'll leave the sprints behind, move quickly and easily along the course and cross the finish line with a new perspective on how agile thinking can run far beyond tech projects."
