description: 'In this talk we will look at the key Fallacies of Test-Driven Development, such as ''Developers write Unit Tests'', or ''Test After is as effective as Test First'' and explore a set of Principles that let us write good unit tests instead. Attendees should be able to take away a clear set of guidelines as to how they should be approaching TDD to be successful. The session is intended to be pragmatic advice on how to follow the ideas outlined in my 2013 talk "TDD Where Did it All Go Wrong"'
