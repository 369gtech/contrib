title: '[WiSDOM] Conversational AI at Uber'
language: English
recordingDate: 1580220008
description: "On October 24, 2019, the WiSDOM (Women in Statistics, Data, Optimization, and Machine Learning) Employee Resource Group hosted the second annual Moving The World With Data meetup, welcoming hundreds of members of the Bay Area tech community to learn about some of our toughest, most interesting data science problems. \n\nZhaleh Feizollahi, a computational linguist with Uber AI, offers a deep dive look into what it takes to build an intelligent voice assistant at Uber. Hands-free dispatch, one of Uberâ€™s key safety features, is a great example of how this technology is used to improve the user experience on our platform. Zhaleh walks us through the full product life cycle: from idea generation to sourcing and shaping data, all the way through releasing the product and continually monitoring key metrics like accuracy and common errors. She also introduces a smattering of NLP concepts, like n-grams, bag-of-words, and term-frequency inverse document frequency (tf-idf).\n\nLearn more about the meetup: https://eng.uber.com/moving-the-world-with-data"
