description: 'In 2017 Defcon alumnai Gabrial Ryan presented his research on using statistical analysis to detect rogue wifi signals. In this talk, John Dunlap will expand on Gabe’s research by presenting an extension to Ryan’s tool to use machine learning algorithms to better detect and anticipate rogue wifi signals. A practical demonstration and tool will be presented with this work.'
