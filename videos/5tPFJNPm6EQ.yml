description: "by Alexander Condello\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/AW1.121/dwave_sdk.webm\n\n\nD-Wave's Ocean software tools are an open source ecosystem for solving customer-scale problems on the quantum computer. \n\nThe D-Wave System solves a particular problem - the Binary Quadratic Model (also known as the QUBO or Ising problem). We will provide an overview of the open source tools that are used to express your problem as a BQM and to convert that BQM into something that can be solved by the quantum computer. \n\nFinally we will motivate open sourcing these steps, and discuss the areas that interested users can participate in the project. \n\nRoom: AW1.121\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 12:25:00+01"
