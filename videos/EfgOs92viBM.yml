description: "Speaker: Glenn Renfro\nWith the increase in the number of devices that emit information it has become ever more important to be able to retrieve this data and process accordingly. In response to this need, MQTT has become the defacto lightweight transport for connecting an \"Internet of things\". With that being said, how do your applications support for eventing, messaging, and scheduling? Utilizing Spring Boot and Spring Integration you will see how to create an application with a scheduler that will retrieve data from a web service, cleanse and emit the data via MQTT.\n\nThen you'll see how to create an application, also written using Spring Boot and Spring Integration, that will capture the MQTT events and record the results. From this discussion you can see how to use these tools and take advantage of them for your own big data projects as soon as you return to the office.\n\nLearn more about Spring Integration at http://projects.spring.io/spring-integration\n\nLearn more about Spring Boot at http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot"
