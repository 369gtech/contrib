description: 'When the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto published his white paper in 2009 about Bitcoin the world economy was reeling from the 2008 financial meltdown. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to the centralised world of value transfer by enabling peer to peer, highly secure transfer of funds, cutting out the middle person. At the time, the phrase blockchain had not even been invented, although Nakamoto refers to blocks and chain throughout his paper.'
