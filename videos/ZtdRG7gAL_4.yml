description: "Google Tech Talk (more info below)\nAugust 11, 2011\n\nPresented by Eugene Levin\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSpace is vast, but low Earth orbits are getting crowded. Catastrophic hypervelocity collisions between satellites are no longer a remote possibility--they will become increasingly frequent, as more and more satellites are launched but none of the dead satellites are removed. They will produce hundreds of thousands of untracked fragments lethal for operational satellites. What can be done to clean the near-Earth space and prevent debris pollution, how much will it cost, and how do we approach the problem internationally?  A comprehensive solution will be discussed.\n\nLink to slides:\nhttp://www.star-tech-inc.com/papers/Google_Talk.pdf\n\nSpeaker Info:\n\nDr. Eugene Levin is one of the leading experts on space tether dynamics, the author of two books on the subject. He worked on various projects with NASA, Air Force, and Navy."
