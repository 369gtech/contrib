title: 'YOW! 2013 Kevlin Henney - The SOLID Design Principles Deconstructed'
recordingDate: 1514386831
description: "The SOLID principles are often presented as being core to good code design practice. Each of S, O, L, I and D do not, however, necessarily mean what programmers expect they mean or are taught. By understanding this range of beliefs we can learn more about practices for objects, components and interfaces than just S, O, L, I and D.\n\nThis talk reviews the SOLID principles and reveals contradictions and different interpretations. It is through paradoxes and surprises we often gain insights. We will leave SOLID slightly more fluid, but having learnt from them more than expected.\n\nKevlin is an architecture, software design and patterns expert. He is one of Europe’s most popular keynote speakers.\n\nKevlin is an independent consultant and trainer based in the UK. His development interests are in patterns, programming, practice and process. He has been a columnist for various magazines and web sites, including Better Software, The Register, Application Development Advisor, Java Report and the C/C++ Users Journal. Kevlin is co-author of A Pattern Language for Distributed Computing and On Patterns and Pattern Languages, two volumes in the Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture series.
