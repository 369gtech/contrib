description: "When it comes to connecting physical objects from daily life to the internet, you’re faced with several challenges. MQTT is a protocol for the Internet of Things that addresses the aforementioned challenges and makes it possible to build scalable sensor networks. This tutorial aims to give you a hands-on experience with the MQTT protocol and walk you through the creation of an end-to-end M2M/Internet of Things application, using open source Java components such as Eclipse Paho, Mosquitto, and Kura. You will leave the session knowing all the cool features of MQTT and how you can integrate it into your Java solutions.\n\n\nAuthors:\nBenjamin Cabe?\nBenjamin Cabé is IoT evangelist at the Eclipse Foundation.
