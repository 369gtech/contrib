description: 'It''s a situation many of us are familiar with: a large legacy application, limited or no tests, slow & manual release process, low velocity, no confidence.... Oh, and management wants new features, fast. Using examples and lessons learned from a real-world case, I''ll show you how to strangle a legacy application with a modern service architecture and build a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to deliver value from the first sprint. On the way, weâ€™ll take a look at the process, automated testing, monitoring, master/trunk based development and various tips and best practices.'
