description: "There's no blueprint for how to be successful at a small startup. Startups are quirky, ambiguous, and full of challenges and broken processes. Startups also have a high risk tolerance and rarely introduce security from the beginning. This talk will discuss different approaches to introducing security at a company, how to be successful as a security professional at a startup, and how to integrate your security team with the rest of the company.\n\nEvan Johnson\nSenior Security Engineer, Cloudflare\nEvan Johnson is a member of the Product Security team at Cloudflare. He loves diet pepsi, chicken nuggets, and golang. No relation to the prolific Linkedin content producer, Mike Johnson.\n\n-\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
