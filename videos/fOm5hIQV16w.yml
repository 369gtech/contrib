language: English
recordingDate: 1478851764
description: "Once upon a time, there was backend and frontend development and that was basically it. On the frontend side today, there are a lot of different platforms beyond just web and desktop. Native mobile development for smartphones created a whole new market for developers to reach. Last year, we talked about the Internet of Things and more specifically smartwatches. Now we are back with another world: Smart TVs. Both Apple and Android are now offering very rich development platforms for building and distributing apps that users can consume in a completely different context. This presentation will compare Apple TV and Android TV development environments, what is common to what you may already know, what is completely new, the constraints and opportunities created by this brand new channel. We will use the development of TVoxx as a source of code samples.\n\nSebastien Arbogast started his career as a Java software consultant, with a strong focus on productivity. He was a strong advocate of Model-Driven Architecture before discovering Groovy and Grails. Then he also started developing iOS applications, and in 2011, he created his first startup, Kodesk. After learning a lot as an entrepreneur, he co-created the NEST'up startup accelerator program and coached several startups on the Lean Startup tools and techniques. He is now a Lean Startup coach for NEST'up and also coaches big companies and other organizations to help them innovate like startups.\n\nSaid Eloudrhiri\nI'm a Team Leader and agile coach. I have some side projects to stay in touch with technologies such as the Android Wear part of \"My Devoxx\". With the Devoxx4Kids, I'm also involved as a trainer for the following labs: Sphero, Mindstorms, CodeCombat.\n\n[QJO-3473]"
