recordingDate: 1523426121
description: "With all of the advances in DevOps, it is easy to focus on delivering more, faster, as our important measures of success. However, DevOps is as much about listening as it is about delivering. How do we know we are delivering the right things? How are we informing our customers of this work and getting their feedback effectively?\n\nIf our project is using Drupal, it usually ends up being operated by the end users being delivered to. With Drupal being so close to the customer in production, we can use all of its powers to leverage new feedback loops and truly measure our success by customer satisfaction.\_\n\nIn this talk we'll look at using Drupal:\n\nto communicate \"What's New/Fixed\" to our Drupal end users with each delivery\nprovide\_our end users contextual guides and resources on site features\nto gather\_feedback on the usefulness of our guidance\nto collect\_feature requests and bug reports\nUltimately we'll look at how Drupal, as a CMS,\_fits into a DevOps mindset, fully closing the loop between what's developed and what's in operation.\n\nAttendees of any level of experience will walk away with ideas for using Drupal to get closer to their customers and\_continuously improve their product."
