title: 'How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Website - Jackie Balzer'
recordingDate: 1532436561
description: "Behance's codebase has existed in various states for over 7 continuous years - which includes multiple major redesigns, brand overhauls, backend framework changes, JavaScript frameworks, CSS preprocessors, templating languages, feature births and deaths, product integrations, and more.\nAnd now, we are working on our latest project: moving our JavaScript and Sass to Vue.js and CSS Modules.\n\nThis talk explores our journey over the years, from how we choose which technologies to implement, how we piecemeal large rewrites while maintaining developer sanity and website integrity (and how to cut corners gracefully), how we manage technical debt, and finally, how to be at peace with the reality of a fragmented codebase."
