title: 'Webinar: Building a Cloud-Native Technology Stack That Supports Full Cycle Development'
language: English
recordingDate: 1599673091
description: "Kubernetes can unlock rapid development cycles and increased feature velocity. Kubernetes also disrupts your software development lifecycle. Organizations that have successfully embraced cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes have invested heavily in creating a self-service application platform to enable Full Cycle Development.\nHow can you make sure your developers are empowered and your organization is getting all the benefits a technology like Kubernetes has to offer?\nIn this webinar, we will discuss the four capabilities that are essential to Full Cycle Development: container management, progressive delivery, edge management, and observability:\n\n– Container Management with Kubernetes. Manage and run container-based applications at scale and on a variety of infrastructures.\n– Progressive Delivery with Continuous Delivery Pipelines. Support the creation of pipelines that enable the automated build, verification, deployment, release, and observability of applications by developers.\n– Edge Management with a Self-Service API Gateway. Enable developers to release new functionality in a self-service manner.\n– Observability with an Observability Stack. Allow developers and platform teams to collect and analyze end-user and application feedback.\n\nJoin this webinar will talk through the requirements for these technologies as well as discuss common antipatterns and how to avoid them\n\nPresenter:\n\nDaniel Bryant, Product Architect @Ambassador Labs (Previously Datawire)"
