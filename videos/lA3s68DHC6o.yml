description: 'Happy days, Java 11 is upon us! Was it Java 10, just moments ago? Let’s put truth to Java’s release cadence. What do you need to access the new versions (hint: still FREE!), where can you get support, and where did JavaFX go. Finishing the picture with suggested path of migration. These changes are here for a reason: new features, in the platform, more often. We will cover some of the best (subjectively), as well as talk about exciting projects are coming: lambdas, inference, changes to G1, and who is Shenandoah.'
