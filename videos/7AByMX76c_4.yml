description: "This session looks at using Groovy for writing multithreaded, concurrent, and parallel programs. It briefly discusses leveraging legacy Java techniques such as multiple processes, multiple threads, the java.util.concurrent APIs, and shared-state atomicity. Then it considers some useful AST transforms in core Groovy (Lazy, Synchronized, Immutable, WithReadLock, and WithWriteLock) before diving headlong into GPars, a comprehensive library for parallel execution that provides a menu of options to the developer.\n\n\nAuthor:\nPaul King\nPaul King leads ASERT, an organization based in Brisbane, Australia which provides software development, training and mentoring services to customers wanting to embrace new technologies, harness best practices and innovate.
