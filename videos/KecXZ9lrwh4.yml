recordingDate: 1497902935
description: "Shaping the Future of Travel with DevOps and Cloud\n\nAlice Albano, Software Engineer, Amadeus\nDamien Profeta, Expert Software Development, Amadeus\n\nIn one of the largest data centers in the world, with more than 37 petabytes of storage and over 16,500 devices, Amadeus processes more than 49,000 end user transactions per second and more than 47 billion SQL executions daily during peak times. This is all while performing more than 5,500 IT changes and more than 540 application software loads monthly and maintaining an average availability of 99.99%.\n\nAs Amadeus is a world-class technology company dedicated to the global travel industry, it needs to go even faster and do even more. The Ops teams and the 5,000+ developers are re-organizing into DevOps teams while the technology stack is morphing into the Amadeus Cloud Service. Part of the challenge is to seamlessly move 300K daily jobs that manage some of the mission-critical functions of the business.\n\nThis session discusses the management and cultural changes that are central to making this transition a success along with some of the technology, such as Openshift, Kubernetes and Docker, and organizational changes such as Agile methodology, full CI/CD automation, infrastructure as code or jobs as code, that are crucial to success.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
