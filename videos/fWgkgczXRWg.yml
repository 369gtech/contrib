title: 'Combining Java and JavaFX and on the Raspberry Pi - Frank Delporte (Jfokus Brown Bag series)'
recordingDate: 1632990264
description: "Java, JavaFX and a Raspberry Pi are an ideal combination for any project where you want to connect software and hardware (LEDs, buttons, sensors...) with a beautiful, easy-to-use user interface. Let's go through the process of building a JavaFX touchscreen user interface to control some electronic components using the Pi4J library.\n\nYou will learn that Java works just as well on a small personal computer of only 50â‚¬ and allows you to use your existing programming skills to build applications which can interact with the physical world thanks to cheap components. Maybe your next project will be a game with an Arcade-controller, or a dashboard to see the state of multiple sensors on a machine. The possibilities are endless!\n\nRecorded Tuesday 25 May 2021 12:00"
