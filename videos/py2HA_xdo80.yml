description: "Talk \nIn this talk, I will discuss the relationship between game theory, algorithm design, and machine learning, and how researchers have combined these fields, as part of the Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG), to develop new algorithms and mathematical frameworks for improving resource allocation and information access to promote social and economic equality within marginalized communities.\n\nSpeaker\nI am a senior data scientist whose work focuses on algorithmic fairness, model explainability, and Responsible AI. I am particularly interested in the “Data 4 Good” movement and the roles technology plays in driving social change.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
