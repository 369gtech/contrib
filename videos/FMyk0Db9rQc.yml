description: "I am not a language designer, nor a framework developer, I’m only an occasional open source contributor, and truth be told I’m not even a very good functional programmer. I’m still shaking some perfectly reasonable past-life object-oriented habits, and I’m a recidivist Java developer.\n\nI am however, a stone cold delivery machine for my clients.\n\nEarlier this year I built a high availability, real-time system that processes billions of events a day. Plenty about that is hard; distributed systems; operational requirements; learning curves; late nights.\n\nCome and learn how Clojure made the rest easy, and why I would have failed if I had attempted it in Java, my language of habit. This is a talk for Java developers who want to understand how data-first can be superior to object-oriented and to give you the oomph to stop caring and give it a go."
