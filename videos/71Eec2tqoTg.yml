description: "What is this Agile? – and why should I care? (I’m only the boss around here) \nby Allan Kelly\n@allankellynet\n\nAre you sick of your technical people telling you Agile, Agile, Agile?\n\nSick of them answering your every question with “Agile”?\n\nThis presentation could be your antidote.\n\nWe’ll explain why every question seems to be answered with “Agile” but pinning “Agile” seems to be impossible. We’ll take a look at what Agile can do for a business and why its important. And we’ll explain why the only flavour of Agile which is right for your business is the one you create yourself.\n\nThis talk isn’t for techies, its for people who employ and manage techies, who need to get the best from techies, who deliver a product or service which wouldn’t exist without software technology.\n\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/nordevcon2015/\n\nhttp://www.nordevcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AllanKelly-WhatIsAgile.pdf"
