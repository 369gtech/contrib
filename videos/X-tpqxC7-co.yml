description: "A typical interaction with a device or interface involves touching it. Either you're pressing buttons on a controller, swiping on a touchscreen or clicking on your laptop's trackpad. But what if you could control things without the use of your hands? What if you could use... your thoughts? I have been tinkering with a brain sensor and developed an open source JavaScript framework for it to allow me (or anyone else) to control interfaces or robots using facial expressions and mental commands.\n\n\nCharlie Gerard\nCharlie is a software developer at ThoughtWorks in Sydney. She is passionate about creative coding and hardware and spends her free time experimenting with technology to create interactive prototypes. She also spends time giving back to the community by mentoring new developers and contributing to open-source software.\n\n\nNordic.js is a single track conference with talks by internationally renowned speakers and rising stars in the JavaScript community.
