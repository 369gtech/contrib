description: "The whirlwind tour of Authentication and Authorization with ASP.NET Core \n\nAuthentication and authorization is not a fun topic for most people. It is generally that thing that has to be there, but nobody really cares about. And on top of that, every time the requirements are a little different. And every time we have to figure out how to write all the plumbing to get it done properly. It is security after all… In ASP.NET Core, Microsoft has made it fairly easy to get it all done. In most cases, it is only a few lines of code and some minor configuration, and you are up going. However, if you don’t know the lines of code and the config, it can be hard. In this presentation, you will see a whole heap of different types of authN and authZ being configured and used. There will be social logins, local logins, AD-based logins, and even token based authentication for SPAs. Basically, everything you need to get up and running when it comes to authenticating your users in ASP.NET Core."
