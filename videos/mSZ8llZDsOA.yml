What's it like being on call for a service mesh? Until recently, the creators of Linkerd have never needed to run Linkerd in production, simply because they had no production services to maintain. With the introduction of a SaaS app for Linkerd users that is itself built on Linkerd, Linkerd maintainers were suddenly on call for Linkerd. In this talk, we describe several complex bugs we discovered, diagnosed, and debugged as a result of running Linkerd ourselves, and how this change in our relationship with our own service mesh changed the nature of product development. \n\nhttps://sched.co/aba8"
