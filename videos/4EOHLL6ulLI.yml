description: "Being on a distributed team, working from your home or coffee shop isn't easy, but it can be incredibly rewarding. Making it work requires constant attention, as well as support from your team and organization. It's more than just setting up Slack and buying a webcam.\n\nWe'll learn what you can do to be your best self as a remote team member, as well as what you need from your environment, team, and company. It's not about technical stuff—it's the human stuff. We'll learn how can you be present and effective when you aren't physically there.\n\nEVENT: RailsConf 2017\n\nSPEAKER: David Copeland\n\nPERMISSIONS: The original video was published on Confreaks YouTube channel with Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW7_AteiM4o&t=108s"
