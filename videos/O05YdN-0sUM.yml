title: 'Infoshare 2019: Krzysztof KudrynÃÅski - Traditional and Deep-Learning-based Vehicle Autonomy'
language: English
recordingDate: 1565963214
description: "Cars drive by themselves, drones deliver goods on their own, robots move around homes and offices. This is the reality we are entering with unprecedented pace. In this talk I will go through the core algorithmic concepts behind vehicle autonomy as well as the most important Deep Learning architectures, gradually replacing traditional approaches. We will see how the components of autonomous vehicles are implemented and we will see how it works in practice. Join me if you want to:\n- understand how it works, \n- learn how its implemented, \n- check what engineering skills are now most demanded in this field, \n- just have some fun enjoying the demo footages.\n\nThe speech took place on 8th May 2019 on DevTrends Stage during Infoshare 2019."
