description: "Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013\nMore info and slides on the website: http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/talks\n\nDeciding to write your own database management system while implementing a commercial online service must surely be a grand example of hubris! Yet, this is what we did at Feuerlabs. We wanted a database framework that could work equally well on an embedded device as on the server side, with easy interoperability; we wanted to handle tree-structured data and a huge amount of persistent queues; and we needed transaction support. We are now releasing the result as part of our Open Source Exosense device programming framework. In this talk, we will give an overview of what KVDB can do, and where we are planning to take it. We will also describe some implementation details, some of which we think are particularly novel and Erlang-esque."
