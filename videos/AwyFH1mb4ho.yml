language: English
recordingDate: 1620028625
description: "\"Nowadays, researchers are looking for an adaptation of Machine Learning algorithms to testing processes to reduce the manual effort and improve quality. In this talk, we will discuss in detail\nMachine Learning practices with a case study.\n\nWe start with a quick view of the machine learning types. Then, we list AI applications in testing these perspectives: test definition, implementation, execution, maintenance and grouping, and bug handling. What’s more, we do not only present existing AI applications but also what can be done in\nthe future. Finally, we summarize the application areas with algorithms and discuss the advantages and potential risks of AI applications in software testing.\n\nStages in which AI is applied are:\n• Test definition,\n•  Implementation,\n• Automatic code generation,\n• Code completion,\n•  Execution: exploratory testing,\n•  Maintenance and grouping,\n• Review test code,\n• Heal broken test code,\n• Prioritize test cases,\n• Constructing suites,\n• Bug Management,\n• Triage,\n• Classification,\n• Assignment,\n\nAfter the talk, attendees will be able to imagine how Machine Learning can be used to\n• generate automatically test cases.\n• review test code.\n• heal broken test code.\n• prioritize test cases.\n• exploratory testing.\n• manage bugs.\""
