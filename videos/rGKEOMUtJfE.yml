title: 'Probabilistic Record Linkage of Hospital Patients - Chris Oakman'
language: English
recordingDate: 1574444249
description: "How can you tell if a patient is the same person across all the different electronic systems used in a hospital?\n\nCan you be confident with messy data when lives are on the line?\n\nMedical startup Luminare faced this challenge in a hospital setting and used Clojure to save the day and make the nurses happy again.\n\nThis talk will explore the challenge of record linking: dealing with dirty data sets, the pros and cons of different solution approaches, and using the Felligi-Sunter method to create a probabilistic algorithm to match records."
