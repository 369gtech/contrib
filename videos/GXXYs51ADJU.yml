language: English
recordingDate: 1478672149
description: "The session will dive deep into how neural networks work with focus on inner workings of Watson as an AI platform . We will apply machine learning algorithms to real life situations. By the end of 3 hour session, you will understand exactly what Cognitive platform like Watson learns and evolves. We will walk through algorithms that Watson uses to allow human like conversations and deep searches, how it learns and evolves.\n\nSandhya Kapoor specializes in the intersection of Cloud Computing and middleware software at IBM. She has 20+ years of experience in Java and has worked in WebSphere Application Server, Business Process Manager(BPM) development. Sandhya is currently working on Cloud Security and Cognitive Computing. She has published articles, presented at conferences, and plays an active role in \"Women in Tech\" organizations. Sandhya graduated in 1989 with Master's Degree in Computer Science from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n\nDr. Bowen Zhou is the Chief Scientist of IBM Watson Group. In this executive role, Dr. Zhou is responsible for Watson Group’s innovation and science agenda including integrating them into IBM’s overall technical strategy; he also personally leads Watson’s research and development efforts around the creation and application of new, state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as deep learning to continuously enhance Watson and Artificial Intelligence in general. As an IBM Distinguished Engineer and a technical leader, Dr. Zhou has widely published in the broad areas of speech recognition, machine translation, speech-to-speech translation, machine learning, deep learning, natural language understanding, question answering, natural language generation and summarization. He has authored and co-authored more than 90 papers on top conferences and journals in these areas.\n\nArthur Kantor has been a speech technologies researcher at IBM, in Prague for 5 years. He is the lead developer of the service exposing the speech recognition and synthesis engines on IBM Watson. He got his PhD from University of Illinois, Urbana-Chamaign on the topic of automatic speech recognition.\n\n[XOR-6380]"
