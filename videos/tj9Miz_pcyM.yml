description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2013\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nMads Troels Hansen - Agile Coach and Scrum Trainer\n\nABSTRACT\nMore and more organizations develop software with distributed teams and the most effective setups are using Scrum and Agile. Unfortunately, the majority of organizations introduce a lot of traditional governance and wasteful structures on top of the distributed Scrum to feel more in control. It creates a structure that works against the principles behind Scrum and suppresses the potential of the distributed teams.\n\nHear about common patterns from successful distributed Scrum setups and get examples on how to apply those patterns in your own context. Maintaining and improving a high productive global organization require regular global gardening and Lean thinking. Most organizations do not prioritize this activity and you will hear about typical failure scenarios to avoid. The patterns are derived during the last 10 years from practical work with Agile/ Scrum in different Danish organizations with teams in Eastern Europe or Asia \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
