description: "It's been a few years now that the Spring team has invested time in various Reactive components. To meet our community halfway, we've worked hard at making this disruptive programming model a more progressive and nuanced story.\n\nSo, if creating reactive applications is easier than ever, how do they fit in a complex operational environment: from one service to a full-blown microservices architecture, from one cloud to many, and from one colocated availability zone to distant ones. What is the payback for running WebFlux and Reactor apps connected together? How does such an architecture scale for developers, for ops, and for users? Is there more than one way to design such a system?\n\nThis session is an invitation to take a bird's-eye view of the reactive portfolio, and evaluate the revolutionary systems we can now build and that we will build tomorrow.\n\nSpeakers: Ryland Degnan, CTO, Netifi Inc.; Stephane Maldini, Reactive Engineering, Pivotal; Andy Shi, Developer Advocate, Alibaba Cloud\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/designing-a-reactive-system"
