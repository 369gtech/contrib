language: English
recordingDate: 1634741102
description: "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract: \nEveryone talks about JSI - it will be powering the upcoming React Native re-architecture, it is already used by some libraries (such as Reanimated), and a lot of people already explained how it works and what problem it solves. But what does this have to do with a Camera library?\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nIn this talk I will explain how JSI and Reanimated Worklets power VisionCamera's flexible and powerful plugin API for general purpose Camera frame processing (e.g. Object-detection, Image-labeling, Facial-recognition, Text-recognition, WebRTC, ...), why this is such a game-changer, and what this means for real world applications.\n\nVienna Legend | 30% of my time in VSCode, 70% sipping in irish pubs Twitter: https://twitter.com/mrousavy\nGithub: https://github.com/mrousavy\n\nAdditional links: \nVisionCamera: https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera\nreact-native-mmkv: https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv\nColorwaver: https://github.com/mrousavy/Colorwaver (example for a Frame Processor Plugin)\""
