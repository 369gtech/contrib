title: 'Introducing Spring Cloud Gateway and API Hub for VMware Tanzu'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027923
description: "\"Spring Cloud Gateway for VMware Tanzu was made generally available in January of this year. In this talk, we’ll introduce this new product, which gives developers the ability to create easily configurable, on-demand API Gateway instances with enhanced security, networking, and SSO integration all set up out of the box. \n\nWe’ll also introduce another brand new product: API Hub. API Hub allows developers to easily aggregate, visualise, explore, and secure access to all the APIs exposed via any or all Spring Cloud Gateway instances—even across multiple VMware Tanzu Application Service Foundations.\"\n\nAlexey Nesterov, Software Engineer at VMware; Gareth Clay, Senior Member Technical Staff at VMware\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/introducing-spring-cloud-gateway-and-api-hub-for-vmware-tanzu"
