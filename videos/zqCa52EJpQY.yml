description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2012\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nJesper Mosegaard - Head of the Computer Graphics Lab at the Alexandra Institute\n\nABSTRACT\nThere is a hidden beast of raw computing power in the midst of your pc; the graphics card. For obvious reasons, the graphics card used to be all about real-time graphics -- but is today a potential source of massive hardware acceleration of many different algorithms. In this talk Jesper Mosegaard will shortly give a historical review of the programmable graphics processing units, give details of production code for a number of clients, and give a best-guess at the future of hardware accelerated computing. The take away for the audience will be a general idea of whether using the graphics processing units is something to do now -- and when it will become inevitable in the future of the (heterogeneous) processing unit.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
