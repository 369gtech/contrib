description: "Following the Data: A Deeper Look into Distributed Applications - Jayson Go & Henri van den Bulk, Charles Schwab\n\nBuilding cloud-enabled applications have become trivial with many platform-as-a-service offerings, but building such applications to be highly-available requires intent and a deeper understanding of architectures and patterns.\nData is a key element of focus, and in this talk, we will follow it through multiple architectures such as event-driven and microservices and patterns such as CQRS and event sourcing. We will expand on these ideas with discussions, and explore them with demos.\nAt the end of the journey, we will be able to reflect on the path that the data took us, and gain a deeper insight into the world of distributed applications.\n\nAbout Henri van den Bulk\nHenri is the principal architect leading one of the largest technical organizations within Charles Schwab. He is a proven technology leader within the solutions, platform and enterprise space. Henri has a broad range of vertical experience in various industries and domains such as Financial Trading, System Engineering, and Government.
