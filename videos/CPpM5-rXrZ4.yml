title: 'Ian Sinnott - Building Static Sites with React'

description: "Building static sites can provide serious benefits to us as developers such as performance, security and simplicity. However, building static sites usually means either having to learn a specific static site generator or writing plain HTML/CSS/JS. Neither of those options are great because as JavaScript and React developers we already know how to build rich web apps, they just aren’t static. Let’s learn how to fix that.\n\nThis talk will focus on how we can use our existing knowledge of JavaScript and React to build rich static sites without the overhead of learning new technology. We can continue to leverage all the existing dev tools we know and love to build full React applications and then simply generate static files from our components. We’ll also discuss some options to add common server-side functionality to static sites without running a server.\n\nEvent sponsored by Rangle http://rangle.io/ and Microsoft Canada \n\nIan Sinnott\nhttps://twitter.com/ian_989\nhttps://github.com/iansinnott\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/iansinnott\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
