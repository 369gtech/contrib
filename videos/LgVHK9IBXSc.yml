language: English
recordingDate: 1595347207
description: "Lifting and shifting your application to the cloud is extremely easy, on paper. The hard truth is that the only way to know for sure how it is going to perform is to test it. Benchmarking on-premises is hard enough, but benchmarking in the cloud can get really tricky due to changes in what's exposed in PaaS environments. WorkloadTools is a set of open-source tools that can help you capture, analyze, and replay your workload, on-premises, and in the cloud. In this episode of Data Exposed: MVP Edition, Gianluca Sartori introduces the tool and its capabilities.\n\n[01:13] What is a benchmark?\n[03:26] Benchmarking process\n[05:20] Open source tools for benchmarking\n[06:05] Analyzing a workload\n[07:17] Reporting tool example showing an analysis database \n[08:08] Saving workload\n[08:46] Replaying a workload\n[10:45] Configure a SQL workload\n[12:40] Sizing a workload\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Additional Resources:\nWorkloadTools on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/spaghettidba/WorkloadTools?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner\nhttps://github.com/spaghettidba/WorkloadTools/releases?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner\nhttps://github.com/spaghettidba/WorkloadTools/wiki?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner\nhttps://github.com/spaghettidba/WorkloadTools/issues?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner\nWorkloadTools blog: https://spaghettidba.com/tag/workloadtools?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner\nCapturing extended events to Azure blob storage: https://blobeater.blog/2018/05/08/extended-events-using-azure-storage?WT.mc_id=dataexposed-c9-niner\n\nAbout Gianluca Sartori:\nGianluca Sartori is a Data Platform MVP, independent consultant and performance tuning specialist.
