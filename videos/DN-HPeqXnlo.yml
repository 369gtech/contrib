description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nHow H-E-B Curbside Adopted Linkerd During a Pandemic - Justin Turner & Garrett Griffin, H-E-B \n\nIn early 2020 HEB was rated as the #1 grocery retailer in the country in a consumer survey run by Dunnnhumby. As shelter in place orders were implemented as COVID-19 spread across the world, H-E-B Curbside & Delivery became a critical resource for Texans. The HEB Digital Fulfillment team had already been hard at work building features for their legacy monolithic application and, at the same time, migrating workloads to Kubernetes. The team needed to accelerate the completion of their new services to ensure healthy and reliable H-E-B fulfillment capabilities, as well as build confidence for rolling these services out to Curbside locations by using Linkerd metrics. In this presentation, members of the HEB team will describe how they use Linkerd to secure, scale, and monitor their microservices applications to deliver high quality service as traffic increases across their site \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekEw"
