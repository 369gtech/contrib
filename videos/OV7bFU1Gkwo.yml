description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v\n\nGet involved in the next Code Sync conference - https://codesync.global \n\n---\n\nPROBLEM LED SOFTWARE DESIGN\nby Robert Virding, Boyd Multerer\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThere are many software development philosophies, but one of our favorite is Problem Led Design. Robert Virding and Boyd Multerer discuss how they use focus on problems to find solutions that really matter. Robert will share how this drove to the design of Erlang and the BEAM. Boyd will discuss how this has been his driving mode for almost 20 years across Xbox, Scenic, and his new project which he is finally willing to talk about.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/robert-virding/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ROBERT VIRDING\nCo-creator of Erlang, trainer\n\nRobert Virding is Principal Language Expert at Erlang Solutions Ltd. While at Ericsson AB, Robert was one of the original members of the Ericsson Computer Science Lab, and co-inventor of the Erlang language. He took part in the original system design and contributed much of the original libraries, as well as to the current compiler. While at the lab he also did a lot of work on the implementation of logic and functional languages and on garbage collection. He has also worked as an entrepreneur and was one of the co-founders of one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail). Robert also worked a number of years at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) Modelling and Simulations Group. He co-authored the first book (Prentice-Hall) on Erlang, and is regularly invited to teach and present throughout the world.\n\nMore on Robert Virding: https://codesync.global/speaker/robert-virding/\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER - BOYD MULTERER\nCreator of Scenic and lead engineering for Xbox Live, XNA\n\nBoyd's near 30-year career spans the range of software projects, from desktop publishing, to web servers, to game consoles, to low-level operating systems. For the past four years, he has been independently exploring and building a full stack for Connected Devices that heavily leverages the BEAM.\n\nPreviously, Boyd spent 18 years at Microsoft running engineering for things such as Xbox Live, XNA (game developer program), and everything OS for Xbox One. This work includes large scaled-out datacenter services, VMs, and the layout of the hypervisor/kernel.\n\nHis most recent release is the open-source Scenic libraries, which is a functional UI stack built on the BEAM. Its primary goal is for use in connected devices, but it is already being used for desktop apps and more. His current work takes the foundation laid with Scenic and is attempting to answer deeper questions about the future of client-side operating systems.\n\nMore on Boyd Multerer: https://codesync.global/speaker/boyd-multerer/\n\n---\n\nCODE SYNC & CODE BEAM V 2020\nCode BEAM V is powered by Code Sync.
