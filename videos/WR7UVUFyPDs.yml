description: "The process of building an AI looks like is so glamorous but is a long process, and at the end of the day, the tasks related to the AI model are just a 5% or less of the project.\r\nWe will see how to start an AI project from zero: defining the objectives, creating the architecture, building the game interfaces, massive data pipelines, defining model strategies, how to parallelize everything, etc.\nThe “the abbey of crime” is an adamant 8-bit game. This game is more complicated than Montezuma Revenge and is a perfect challenge for an AI. Its complexity is about 10^1000 legal moves to solve it.\r\n\nAs AI technology, we will use Reinforcement Learning using Deep Neural Networks and Monte Carlo Tree Search.\r\n\nThe takeaways of this talk will be: understanding all the process involved to create an AI and learning the basics of Reinforcement Learning."
