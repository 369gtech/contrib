description: "How does one take thousands of data domains, and tens of thousands of models and algorithms, and make it so that anyone can get answers to their natural language questions?\n\nStephen Wolfram, the creator of Wolfram|Alpha and Mathematica, will describe how this works in Wolfram|Alpha and what the paradigm of computational knowledge is now making possible.\n\nStephen Wolfram\n\nWolfram Research\n\nStephen Wolfram has been responsible for three revolutionary developments: the Mathematica computation system, A New Kind of Science, and the Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine.\n\nWolfram was educated at Eton, Oxford and Caltech, receiving his PhD in theoretical physics at the age of 20. Wolfram's work on basic science led him to a series of fundamental discoveries about the computational universe of possible programs. Summarized in his best-selling 2002 book A New Kind of Science, these discoveries have not only launched major new directions in basic research, but have also led to breakthroughs in scientific modeling in physical, biological and social domains—-as well as defining a broad new basis for technology discovery.\n\nLaunched in 1988, Mathematica has revolutionized the way technical computation is done, and has been responsible for countless advances over the past two decades. Starting from a set of fundamental principles devised by Wolfram, Mathematica has continually grown, integrating more and more algorithmic domains, and spawning such technologies as the Computable Document Format (CDF).\n\nBuilding on Mathematica and A New Kind of Science, Wolfram in 2009 launched Wolfram|Alpha—-an ambitious, long-term project to make as much of the world's knowledge as possible computable, and accessible to everyone. Used every day on the web and through apps by millions of people around the world, Wolfram|Alpha defines a fundamentally new kind of computing platform that is turning science-fiction computer intelligence into reality.\n\nIn addition to his scientific and technical achievements, Wolfram has been the CEO of Wolfram Research since its founding in 1987. Under Wolfram's leadership, Wolfram Research has become one of the world's most respected software companies, as well as a powerhouse of technical and intellectual innovation, and a major contributor to education and research around the world."
