description: "PyData Berlin 2018\n\nThe game of Bridge is one of the most challenging and popular card games similarly to Chess and Go, it is often regarded as a mind sport. The AI community has taken interest in developing algorithms that can play bridge. We present a deep neural network to the double dummy problem at Bridge, and go through the design and implementation using TensorFlow.\n---\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
