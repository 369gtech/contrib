description: "The web is beginning to spatialize. With the rapid development of hybrid reality tools –computer vision, webGL, 360 filming, animation as well as the hardware such as headsets and sensors– users are already beginning to expect richer content and more immersive ways to connect. How will the web look within virtual / augmented / alternate / mixed realities?\nInformation architecture starts to embody physical architecture, sitemaps start looking like blueprints; this calls for a new framework for UX design. Do we take skeuomorphic design rules and reapply them in physical form or invent new metaphors? Through a few case study prototypes, Adelle examines devices that are used across the spectrum of digital to material, and explains assessment techniques for designing a hybrid-connected future.\n\nAdelle Lin\nhttps://twitter.com/adellelin\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
