recordingDate: 1573504106
description: 'When working as a software developer, as well as in any other job, it’s important to be productive and to get things done. You want to focus on what adds value, increase your development speed, and cut out as many of the cumbersome, boring and repetitive tasks as possible. This session shows seven principles how to accomplish the goal of being more effective and efficient as a Java developer. These principles include technical as well as self-organizational aspects. We’ll see how to implement them, especially how we can get the most out of our tools, why the invention of the mouse was a setback in productivity, and which mindsets to follow. This talk is not limited to specific tools or technologies yet it’ll provide examples and experiences, and it is brought to you by a German — from the country of efficiency.'
