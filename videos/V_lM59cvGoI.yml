description: "Bring Your Own Code vs. Bring Your Own Container - Comparison of the Cloud Foundry Application Runtime and Kubernetes Approach - Matthias Haeussler, NovaTec Consulting GmbH\n\nThis talk shows best practices how to deploy and operate on a Cloud platform fast.\n\nPlatform and Container as a Service layers (PaaS/CaaS) enable developers to deliver the functionality of their code to end users in a fast way.\nThe technologies with the highest adoption rate for each approach are currently Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes.\n\nFundamental difference between both approaches is the abstraction layer. While the focus is on the application in Cloud Foundry, it is on the container in Kubernetes.\nThis talk gives an analysis what kind of a difference this makes for a developer that has to deploy the software using both technologies.\n\nIt will show on the basis of a Spring Boot microservice application which steps you need to take to get it configured and running on either platform approach.\nThe analysis will also cover connection to backing services, scaling, recovery from failure, zero-downtime deployment, logging and monitoring.\n\nAbout Matthias Haeussler\nMatthias Haeussler is a Managing Consultant at NovaTec Consulting and the organizer of the Stuttgart Cloud Foundry Meetup.
