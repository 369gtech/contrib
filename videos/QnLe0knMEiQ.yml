description: "Today's AI algorithms closely parallel the function of the brain, such that they are able to do many tasks as well as, or better than, humans. This talk will examine not only the functional parallels between the brain and AI but also the structural parallels, drawing comparisons between AI and the brain to discuss AI design in a creative way.\n\nBased on the similarities between the two, there are a few good questions to ask:\n\nHow do the building blocks of the brain, such as neurones and synapses, create thought?\nWhat are the building blocks of AI, how are they similar to the brain, and how do they create intelligence?\nIn the future, how can we use concepts from neuroscience to develop better algorithms?\nCan we use neuroscience to develop super - intelligent AI?\nIn this talk, we'll examine the construction and foundation of various algorithms. We'll also dive into how these foundations impact function in both the brain and AI. Information processing, prediction, representation, and entropy, from the standpoint of both the brain and AI, will be introduced. We'll also discuss how neuroscience will continue to inspire AI. By the end of this talk you will have a unique understanding of the way AI algorithms are built.\n\nThis talk will serve as a great introduction to AI algorithms, as well as a fresh perspective for those more familiar with AI. No knowledge of AI nor neuroscience is required.\n\nAI algorithms, which are capable of intelligent data processing and decision making, mirror the function of the human brain. How does neuroscience inform the design of modern AI algorithms? How does looking at the structure of the brain play a role in designing intelligent machines? In addition to examining these questions, we'll discuss how this will help innovate future AI design.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
