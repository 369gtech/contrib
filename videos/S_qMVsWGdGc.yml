description: "Distributed computing systems have long been the study of academia, but with the new era of networked-first devices, combined with real-time sensor data and machine learning, we have an opportunity to create computer sessions that exist across multiple devices. This type of system is essential for XR, but has implications across all modern computing devices.\n\nIn this talk, Timoni will go over use cases, examples of currently existing and emerging tech, and talk through challenges to build these systems from 2020 through to the end of our lives.\n\nTimoni West\nunity.com\nhttps://twitter.com/timoni\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttps://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at https://fitc.ca/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=video-description"
