title: 'Realtime Analytics for Big Data: A Facebook Case Study'
recordingDate: 1323143824
description: "Knowing what your users are doing on your site in real time and matching what they do with more targeted information transforms into better conversion rate and better user satisfaction, which means more money in the end. That's been one of the primary drivers for the transition of many of the batch oriented analytics system into real time. FaceBook real time analytics system is a good reference on that regard.\n\nIn the first part of the session we will understand and learn from Facebook's experience and the reason they chose Hbase over Cassandra. In the second part of the session we learn how we can build our own Real Time analytics system, achieve better performance, and make the deployment and scaling significantly simpler using commonly used Java API and frameworks such as JPA and Spring ontop of a scale-out architecture based on Cassandra and GigaSpaces.\n\n** Hadoop & Apache Spark training for your team: https://newcircle.com/category/big-data"
