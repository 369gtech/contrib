description: 'Have you wondered whether developers can play any significant role in the security world? Come hear from a diehard programmer and hacker who loves to break and loves to build, and learn how a regular programmer can make major contributions to security from the trenches. This presentation will dive into the intersection between development and security. You will learn about the SDL -- Secure Development Lifecycle, and why in the world a hacker would care about processes and procedures. You will learn how "processes" and "lifecycles" can be useful -- and how they can be a complete waste of time. Included are real world success stories of organizational hacking -- getting other engineers to change their practices -- and real world fail stories. Attendees will come away with knowledge of how development and security intersect, and how they can use their programming day job to save the world. If you are a developer who cares deeply about security, enjoys exploits, and wants to make the world a better place, this is for you.'
