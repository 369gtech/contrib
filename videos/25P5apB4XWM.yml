description: "\"From Python script to Open Source Project\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Boston]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Michał Karzyński\n\nDid you write a cool and useful Python script? Would you like to share it with the community, but you're not sure how to go about that? If so, then this talks is for you. We'll go over a list of simple steps which can turn your script into a fully fledged open-source project.\n\nThe Python community has a rich set of tools which can help verify the quality of your code through automated code-review and linting. You can benefit by taking advantage of this ecosystem. Complete the steps in this checklist, and your project will be easier to maintain, you'll be ready to take contributions from the community and those contributions will be up to high standards. Your project will also keep up with other projects on PyPI and you will be alerted if any new release causes an incompatibility with your code.\n\nThe same checklist can be used for non open-source projects as well. \n\nThe project maturity checklist includes:\n\n\nProperly structure your code\nUse a setup.py file\nAdd entry_points for your script command\nCreate a requirements.txt file\nUse Black to format your code\nCreate a tox.ini config and include code linters\nSet up a Git repo\nRefactor your code to be unit-testable and add tests\nAdd missing docstrings\nAdd type annotations and a MyPy verification step\nUpload to GitHub\nAdd a continuous integration service (e.g. Travis)\nAdd a requirements updater (e.g. pyup.bot)\nAdd test coverage checker (e.g. coveralls)\nAdd a Readme file and documentation\nPublish your project on PyPI\nAdvertise your project\n\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/\n\n    \""
