Selenium is one such open source automated testing tool for websites. Performance, execution speed, and browser interaction of Selenium is too fast than any other automation tool. The test packages, the Modes of Selenium available for unattended execution, and the fact that the text script can be developed in any of the language that Selenium supports; makes Selenium the most desired automation testing tool. In addition, Selenium supports different operating systems along with support for different programming languages such as Python, Pearl, Ruby, PHP, .NET, C#, and Java; and various browsers, thereby making Selenium ahead of any other Automation tool.\n\n-----------\n\nPlease write back to us at sales@edureka.co or call us at +91 88808 62004 for more information. \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka\n\n-----------\n\nCustomer Review: \nTom Tully says, â€œI wanted to learn Selenium Webdriver in a live, real course, not self paced, so there would be pressure on me to finish. Edureka accomplished this at a price far lower than an in-person class, and as far as I know they are the only internet class that has live lectures on this subject. Teacher was very knowledgeable. I learned basic use of Selenium. No problem with me being in US and teacher in India. They have US 800 number.â€?"
