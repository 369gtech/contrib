description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nType punning is often used in C++ for fast floating-point math, deserialising C++ objects from a sequence of bytes, and other purposes. Popular techniques involve unions, reinterpret_cast, and memcpy. C++20 provides new useful tools, such as bit_cast. And there are proposals to provide even better control over C++ object creation in the future.\n\nThis talk is a comprehensive overview of all of these techniques. We will discuss when and how they can be used safely without causing undefined behaviour, what C++ does and does not allow you to do (and why), existing holes in the C++ language, and how to fix them. In the process, we will cover important C++ concepts such as object lifetime, value representations, and aliasing rules.\n— \nTimur Doumler\nTimur Doumler is a C++ developer specialising in audio and music technology, active member of the ISO C++ committee, and part of the includecpp.org team. He is passionate about building communities, clean code, good tools, and the evolution of C++.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
