description: "In particular we take a look at:\nWhat is artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning mean in general?\nWhen is a rule-based approach the right solution and when do you need machine learning?\nWhat does machine learning mean for time-series data?\nWhat is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in this area?\nWhat could an example with an actual dataset look like?"
