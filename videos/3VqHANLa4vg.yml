description: "Everyone has ideas! But even the best ideas and plans can be difficult to execute if “powerless leaders” do not understand how to guide people through the process of change. Mary Lynn Manns, co-author of Fearless Change (2005) and More Fearless Change (2015), will help you understand the reaction of others during times of change and will summarize some specific strategies that will help you address resistance and encourage people to become so interested and involved that they want to change.\n- Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nStretch Leadership and Management Conference\nstretchcon.com"
