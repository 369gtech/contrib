description: "Learning to Rank (LTR) is concerned with optimising the global ordering of a list of items, according to their utility to the users. In this talk, we present the results of ongoing research at Allegro.pl into applying the Transformer architecture known from Neural Machine Translation literature to the LTR setting and introduce allRank, an open-source, Pytorch based framework for LTR.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
