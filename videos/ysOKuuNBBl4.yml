title: 'HotStorage ''14 - The Multi-streamed Solid-State Drive'

description: "The Multi-streamed Solid-State Drive\n\nJeong-Uk Kang, Jeeseok Hyun, Hyunjoo Maeng, and Sangyeun Cho, Samsung Electronics Co.\n\nThis paper makes a case for the multi-streamed solidstate drive (SSD). It offers an intuitive storage interface for the host system to inform the SSD about the expected lifetime of data being written. We show through experimentation with a real multi-streamed SSD prototype that the worst-case update throughput of a Cassandra NoSQL DB system can be improved by nearly 56%. We discuss powerful use cases of the proposed SSD interface.\n\nView the full HotStorage '14 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotstorage14/workshop-program"
