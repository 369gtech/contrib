description: "How to Set a World Record by Killing Zombies with JavaScript Lightning, and change the world while you do it.\n\n\nThere have been moments in time that represent a discontinuity with history: the first sub-four minute mile; the breaking of the sound barrier; the first man on the Moon.\n\nOn Monday February 13, 2017 the world changed again. That's the day that Magikcraft and Microsoft set the historic world record for \"The Most Minecraft Zombies Killed with JavaScript Lightning in 10 minutes\".\n\nTo achieve the historic milestone of 13,854 Zombies killed in 10 minutes by 40 kids wielding JavaScript lightning, Magikcraft build the most performant Minecraft server and logging system on the planet.\n\nThis is a tale of development, DevOps, of epic system optimizations, near tragedy, and the triumph of the human spirit.\n\nJust as NASA's space program technology rolled back into human society to change the quality of human life - the technology developed to set that world record has been used to make a difference in the quality of life of children and families living with Type 1 Diabetes.\n\nThe MCT1 project, conceived through a chance meeting at NDC Sydney in 2016, uses this technology to fundamentally alter the quality of life for people around the world. As software developers, we hold a tremendous power and with it a great responsibility.\n\nIn this talk you'll get a real sense of the power and the possibility of the connections around you and the abilities that you have."
