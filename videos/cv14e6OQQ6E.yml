language: English
recordingDate: 1600177246
description: "Performance has never been more important than in a cloud-native world. Cloud-hosted resources cost money and a slow-loading application can cause a suboptimal ROI. Have you taken the time to tune your Kubernetes ingress controller and proxy? Many organizations don't until it's absolutely necessary, and most users will typically run a default, out-of-the-box configuration. \n\nIn this demo, we benchmark five popular ingress controllers and put them head-to-head against each other with their default configurations:\n\nEnvoy\n\nHAProxy\n\nNGINX\n\nNGINX Inc.\n\nTraefik\n\nWe measure their average requests per second, latency percentiles, and user-level CPU usage; We monitor for any errors that are produced in order to go beyond performance and test reliability. You can verify the results yourself by downloading the GitHub repository and reproducing our tests. Who will come out on top? Watch the demo to find out."
