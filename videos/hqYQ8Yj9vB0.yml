description: "Machine learning models prefer numbers to words, but categorical fields are everywhere in real-world datasets. It's both a blessing and a curse that there are countless ways of handling them. This talk will be super-practical: I'll provide a broad view of the different approaches at your disposal, and give you some ideas about which to try in different situations.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
