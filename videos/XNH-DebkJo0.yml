description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSBOM: The Rest Of the Story- Moderated by Emily Fox, Apple; Nisha Kumar, VMware; Allan Friedman, CISA\n\nIn a world of compliance requirements, security compromises, and ridiculously long dependency chains, three unlikely travelers cross paths to clear the smoke and mirrors around SBOM: the rest of the story. Our champions of security, compliance, and open source embark on an epic quest to seek truth, actionable software content, and considerations for implementation. They cross the sea of noise in search of the signal by which all of industry can overcome the mighty blight of supply chain insecurity. They wrangle the SBOM misconceptions, they drudge forward through the swamp of Sharing Uncertainties, and confront the beast of Secure Builds. Will they succeed? Will you walk away enlightened, empowered, and ready to tackle the dragons of consumption, risk, and friendship in the face of SBOM publication?"
