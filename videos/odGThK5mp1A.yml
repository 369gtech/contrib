description: "This video was recorded at Code Mesh V 2020 - https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n\nWhat Counts as a Programming Language | Chelsie Troy - Lecturer of Mobile Software Development and Python Programming at the Master’s Program in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.\n\nABSTRACT\nWhen we think of programming languages, we think of Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, or Python. We don't think of CSS, SQL, or HTML. And we don't think of Alloy, Modelica, or SNOBOL—in fact, maybe we haven't even heard of all those. But what's the distinction? And maybe most importantly, what can we learn as programmers from \"not programming languages\"?\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe talk aims to show folks what we can learn from questioning how we categorize things rather than ignoring things outside our arbitrary categories. It also aims to help folks understand that most \"universal truths\" aren't as universal as we might be led to believe—and why it matters.\n\n• Follow us on social: \n  Website: https://codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeMeshIO\n\n• Looking for a unique learning experience?\n  Attend the next Code Sync conference near you! \n  See what's coming up at: https://codesync.global \n\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL\n  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC47eUBNO8KBH_V8AfowOWOw"
