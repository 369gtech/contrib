description: "You want to test your code, but your problems tend to crop up in the production environment more often than in test -- of course. You have a problem. We have a solution. There might be a match.\nIn this talk, we present Frida, a dynamic binary instrumentation toolkit. Frida enables you to write testing logic that can reach those really pesky cases which are difficult to tease out in your regular test suites. We will explore these opportunities by demonstrating a highly granular, programmable C++ memory sanity checker; a technique for retrofitting testable interfaces onto code that is already running in production; and the wonderful Heiseninjektor™.\n\n\n\nNDC Conferences \nhttps://ndctechtown.com\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
