description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nLightning Talk: Grain: WebAssembly Development Made - Oscar Spencer, Grain\n\nAs WebAssembly takes the cloud computing world by storm, having good tools to work with is more important than ever. While a variety of languages treat WebAssembly as just another compiler target, Grain is one of the first languages built from the ground up to work with WebAssembly exclusively—without sacrificing features you know and love from other web languages, such as closures, pattern matching, garbage collection, and custom types. WebAssembly is a perfect choice for applications that need to be small and performant—Grain is suitable for edge computing, smart contracts, and so much more."
