description: "Take a Free introductory instructor-led Live class at : http://www.edureka.co/android-development-certification-course\n\nThis android tutorial talks about Primitive data types in detail:\n\n*What are Primitive data types?\n*Is String a Primitive data type?\n*Can we use new keyword with Primitive data types?\n\nWatch this android tutorial to know the answers.\n\nPrimitive Data types :\n-------------------------------\n\nIn Java programming language all variables must first be declared before they can be used as Java is statically-typed. This involves stating the variable's type and name.\n\nA variable's data type determines the values it may contain, plus the operations that may be performed on it. A primitive type is predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword. Primitive values do not share state with other primitive values. \n\nString : \n----------\n\nString isn't a primitive data-type - it's a class. Although the compiler has special support for Strings, such as converting string literals into String instances, and performing String concatenation, String is not a primitive type, but a Class. By convention, class names begin in uppercase.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPlease write back to us at support@edureka.in or call us at +91-8880862004 for more information. \nhttp://www.edureka.co\n\nUse the link to watch all videos of this session :\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOHYERMLX7oJHhdXUTPAo3NF"
