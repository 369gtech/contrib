description: "Get the Code: http://goo.gl/z37o1\n\nWelcome to part 9 of my Object Oriented Design tutorial! This all started back in part 3 in my UML Use Case Tutorial.\n\nHere I'll finish turning sequence diagrams into code. If you get good at this process you'll be able to make any program no matter how complicated it may be.\n\nAll of the code from this and the last tutorial can be found in the link above to help you learn. In the tutorials that follow I'll answer all of the design pattern tutorials I've been receiving."
