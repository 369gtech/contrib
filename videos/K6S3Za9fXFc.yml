title: 'Oracle Machine Learning for R: An Introduction'
language: English
recordingDate: 1604330894
description: "Join us for a look at Oracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R) – the R interface to in-database machine learning and R script deployment from Oracle. R is the top statistical programming language for data science and computational statistics. \n\nOML4R enables you to work with database tables and views using familiar R syntax and functions. For scalable and performant data exploration, data preparation, and machine learning, leverage Oracle Database as a high performance compute engine. Build machine learning models using parallelized in-database algorithms using R Formula-based specification. \n\nInvoke user-defined R functions from SQL for deployment in applications and dashboards, where R engines are dynamically spawned and controlled by Oracle Database. Even take advantage of running your R functions in a data-parallel and task-parallel manner. \n\nWe’ll include a demonstration of OML4R that takes us through the transparency layer, in-database machine learning, and embedded R execution functionality.\n\nHighlights\n\n01:08 Oracle Machine Learning Office Hours - next Session\n02:24 Oracle Machine Learning for R: an Introduction \n03:40 Machine Learning Pain Points\n04:06 Oracle Machine Learning\n05:16 Oracle Machine Learning for SQL\n06:11 Traditional Analytics and data source interaction\n07:35 Oracle Machine Learning for R\n09:45 Proxy objects\n10:25 Data types\n10:56 OML4R Algorithms\n11:35 Scalable Data Analysis - Model Building\n14:06 Demo - OML4R Tour in RStudio\n18:15 Demo - OML4R overloaded dplyr\n18:49 Demo - OML4R Join Data tables\n19:50 Demo - OML4R overloaded graphic functions\n20:17 Demo - OML4R Machine Learning classification\n23:20 Demo - OML4R Embedded R execution\n25:13 Demo - OML4R Embedded R execution from SQL Developer\n29:34 Demo - OML4R groupApply\n31:20 R Consortium\n32:07 Why Oracle for Machine Learning with R?\n33:35 Q&A"
