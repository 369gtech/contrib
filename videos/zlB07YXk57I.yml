recordingDate: 1520752244
description: "GraphQL has been out in the wild for nearly 2.5 years now. For such a relatively young API technology, GraphQL has won hearts and minds and it's being used in some rather unexpected places. The Community has grown rapidly and created a rich ecosystem of extremely useful tooling.\nJosh will present a quick introduction to the basics of GraphQL as well as a high-level overview of the GraphQL ecosystem. He'll also describe some of the benefits of using GraphQL in your API layer, bust some myths around what it is and what it isn't, as well as some of the ways you can get started with GraphQL easily in your projects.\n\nJosh Price is a polyglot software developer and technology consultant based in Sydney, Australia. \nHe's passionate about modern approaches to Software Development and helping teams build amazing software faster with better tooling.\n \nHe usually describes himself as an applied problem solver, occasionally by writing software.He organises community events such as the Elixir Sydney and GraphQL Sydney meetups.\n \nHe also co-founded Alembic, which is building a team to bring functional programming and strongly typed APIs and their benefits to everyone's day to day work.Currently most of his work involves working with GraphQL and Elixir at the intersection of the realtime web.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
