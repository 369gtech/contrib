description: "AR, VR, and MR are great in their own right but what if we merged them together to make new kinds of fun, engaging, interactive experiences? In this talk, Dave will run through the Globacore design process that began with asymmetric multiplayer games using VR and touchscreens, and culminated in Acura Grand Prix VR – a VR racing game complete with AR vehicle configurator companion experience, showcased at the Canadian Auto show as well as TIFF.\n\nIn addition to the design and creation of the experience, we’ll go over topics such as the future of blending AR, VR and MR, when to use one technology over the other, and, most importantly, how to make a VR racing game that isn’t an interactive motion sickness simulator.\n\nDave Boyle\nDesigner / Developer, Globacore\nhttps://fitc.ca/speaker/dave-boyle/?event=29567\n\nDave is a designer / developer / artist who spends his days designing, developing, and art-ing at Globacore, a company dedicated to creating fun, interactive installations all over the world.\n\nWith a passion for pushing the boundaries of VR forward into uncharted territory, Dave works on projects that give a glimpse into the future of this new medium, including wireless roomscale, prop tracking, and cooperative multiplayer experiences designed to bring people together.\n\nHis work has been exhibited all over North America and Europe, for clients including Samsung, Intel, and IEEE, among others.\n\nHe’s a traveller, a liberal high-five giver, an excessive coffee drinker, a dad, husband, gamer, human, and person who doesn’t know when to stop describing himself.\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc\n\nSave 10% off any FITC event with discount code 'youtube'.\nSee our upcoming events at www.fitc.ca"
