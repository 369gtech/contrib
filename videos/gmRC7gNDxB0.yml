description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nYAML Your Cloud! Managing Your Hosted Resources With Kubernetes - Megan O'Keefe & Shabir Mohamed Abdul Samadh, Google\n\nOne of Kubernetes’ most powerful features is its declarative API, where the cluster is defined by its intended state. This transfers the responsibility to reconcile the intended and actual state from the user to the cluster. But it’s likely that users are also running workloads outside of Kubernetes, from databases to virtual machines— and they might be using multiple cloud providers at once. How to manage it all? In this talk, the speakers explore how Kubernetes’ declarative model can be used to manage cloud-hosted resources alongside their Kubernetes workloads. They will demonstrate this, first using Crossplane, a Kubernetes add-on with native multi-cloud support, and second, using custom controllers built by different cloud providers. Finally, they will show how to integrate OpenPolicyAgent with cloud-hosted resource definitions, to enforce custom policies across environments. Attendees will leave this talk ready to simplify their cloud configuration with Kubernetes."
