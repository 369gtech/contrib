description: "Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes - Side-by-Side Comparison of the Developer and Deployer Experience - Matthias Haeussler, NovaTec Consulting GmbH\n\nThe decision \"Bring your own code vs. Bring your own container\" is one a lot of developers will face when deciding to deploy their code to the cloud.\nKubernetes and Cloud Foundry are very popular options to deploy and run Spring Boot Microservices successfully by providing the 2 approaches.\n\nBut what does it really take to get your application and required backend services up and running successfully on either platform?\nHow many configuration steps are required and where are the hidden pitfalls? How easy do you scale, recover from failure or update the application without downtime?\nWhat kind of a difference does the abstraction layer application vs. container really mean?\n\nIn my role as Cloud consultant and university lecturer for distributed systems I come across these topics a lot and want to share my experience with this talk.\nI will analyse the differences between the two platforms as seen from a developer's perspective from getting started to running successfully. The talk includes a live demo of those steps.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyJ/cloud-foundry-and-kubernetes-side-by-side-comparison-of-the-developer-and-deployer-experience-matthias-haeussler-novatec-consulting-gmbh"
