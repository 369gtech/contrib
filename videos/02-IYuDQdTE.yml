description: "\"Unleash the power of C++ in Python\n[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - Shanghai]\n[Basel, CH]\n\nBy Cristián Maureira-Fredes\n\nOne of the main Python aspects is to have a clear syntax and be an\neasy-to-understand language, which compared to others like C++\n(depending of the kindness of the developer) can make a huge difference.\nNot only the readability is in play, having a dynamically typed\nand interpreted language improves the development workflow.\n\nThis improvement comes with a cost, performance.\nIn most of the cases, a raw comparison of simple routines will leave\nPython behind, but there is a partial solution to this problem, connecting\na powerful performant C++ library with the simplicity of Python.\n\nIn this talk, we will go through the process of generating language bindings\nto allow you to take any amazing C or C++ project and bring it to Python\nland. We will briefly discuss one of the many success stories, and we will\nanalyze how the Qt project managed to expose its whole framework to Python,\nwith the help of a self-made binding generator called Shiboken.\n\nAfter the talk, you will be able to decide which option is better for the\nprojects you have in mind, and with a bit of luck you will be responsible\nof exposing the next popular C++ library that makes the life of us all Pythonistas easier.\n\n\n\nLicense: This video is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nPlease see our speaker release agreement for details: https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/speaker-release-agreement/"
