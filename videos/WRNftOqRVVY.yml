Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nVitess Intro: How to Migrate a MySQL Database to Vitess - Sugu Sougoumarane. & Morgan Tocker, PlanetScale \n\nVitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling MySQL. This session will cover a high level overview of all the Vitess features, the architecture, and what database workloads are a good fit. We will then walk through a demo of live-migrating an existing MySQL installation into Vitess. Because Vitess also speaks the MySQL protocol, it is easy to retrofit scaling into your existing database systems.\n\nhttps://sched.co/ZexD"
