description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Carlos Queiroz\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-one2gx-2014carlosqueiroz\nBig Data Track\nThe lambda architecture has been proposed as a general purpose data system that aims to solve the problem of computing arbitrary functions on an arbitrary dataset in (near) real-time. In this talk we introduce the lambda architecture and show how it can be implemented with SpringXD, GemFireXD and Hadoop (HDFS and MapReduce) as the foundation of the architecture implementation. To validate the architecture we introduce a CDR (Call Detail Record) mining application as use case of the lambda architecture. We finalise by showing a demo of the CDR (Call Detail Record) mining application."
