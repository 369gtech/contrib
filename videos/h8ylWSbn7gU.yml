description: "Originally recorded March 20, 2014.  The massive growth of mobile computing presents software developers with amazing opportunities, but also significant challenges. The explosion of platforms and devices has created an unprecedented level of fragmentation, and it's going to get worse before it gets better. For developers who need to reach the broadest possible market, jQuery Mobile and PhoneGap Build offer a powerful combination of cross platform UI widgets, device API access, and distribution options (web and/or app stores). Follow along as Jonathan builds a web app that runs on a huge range of browsers using jQuery Mobile, and then packages it for distribution on app store distribution with PhoneGap Build.\n\nAbout Jonathan Stark\n\nJonathan Stark is a mobile strategy consultant who helps CEOs transition their business to mobile.\n\nJonathan is the author of three books on mobile and web development, most notably O'Reilly's Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which is available in seven languages.\n\nHis Jonathan's Card experiment made international headlines by combining mobile payments with social giving to create a \"pay it forward\" coffee movement at Starbucks locations all over the U.S. Twitter - @jonathanstark\n\nDon't miss an upload!
