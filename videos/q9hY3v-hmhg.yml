title: 'React Native EU 2020: Yann Leflour - XState   NoNav - Taking Back Control Of Navigation'
recordingDate: 1603293424
description: "Abstract:\nOur understanding of navigation in mobile stems from years of web usage. Our navigation is a tree and a page transition is an action. But this pattern couldn't be further from what is required by modern app UX standards. In this talk we will go through the required changes in our navigation architecture in order for it to reach its full potential."
