description: "Bio:\n\nAndrzej Grzesik, system maker at ebay\n\nI like programming. I do it a lot, mostly on the JVM, usually writing fancy backends for big, distributed systems.\n\nI also display a particular affection to continuous delivery.. UI, unless quickly hacked, is not my play ;-) I believe that most problems we deal with are people problems, so I mix and match tools with technologies to achieve my goals, make people happy and achieve world peace :-) I believe in software quality, and organize GeeCON, Polish JUG, Krakow Software Craftsmanship, Cracow Hadoop User Group. In my free time, I read paper books and cycle, a lot!"
