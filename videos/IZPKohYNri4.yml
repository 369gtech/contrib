description: "A recent paper called 'world models' has gotten really popular in the machine learning community. They trained an AI to play a racing game by having it learn inside of its own simulated dream environment. Meaning, the AI learned a model of what the game world was like, then was able to generate a game world that was roughly similar to what it learned and train inside of that. A simulation inside of a simulation. I'll explain how their model was structured both theoretically and programmatically in this video. \n\nCode for this video: \nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/world_models\n\nPlease Subscribe! And like.
