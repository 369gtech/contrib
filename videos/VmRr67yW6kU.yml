description: "For many people the answer to the question \"Why Elixir?\" is simply \"Because of the message exchange between nodes\". This great property is unfortunately often misused or omitted altogether. When our applications become stateful and we need to coordinate that state between multiple nodes, the go to solution is using the databases - it's intuitive, battle tested and we trust them to do this well.\n\nThis is not the only way to go.\n\nIn this talk we'll look into various data structures which allow us to manage our systems' state in a distributed fashion, including CRDTs and vector clocks. Is using them always superior to databases? No. Still, learning about them will open your mind to new possibilities.\n\nMore details on website here: http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconfeu2018/arkadiusz-gil"
