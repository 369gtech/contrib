description: "Fraud is a big deal -- it costs the economy several billion dollars a year. For many years, machine learning has been the tool of choice for solving fraud. Unfortunately, machine learning is only useful when you have lots of high-quality labeled data. In the real world it's difficult, expensive, or impossible to get this high-quality labeled data.\n\nIn my talk I'm going to look at the problem of fraud at a high level, how it can be solved using unsupervised techniques that don't require labels, and the infrastructure required to implement it.\n\nKey takeaways\nMachine learning is not a silver bullet.\nUnsupervised anomaly detection techniques work well.\nHow the world has changed with the advent of real-time streaming data.\nHow to leverage new deep learning techniques without a lot of data.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
