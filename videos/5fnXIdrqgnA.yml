description: "Ktor is an asynchronous web framework built from the the ground up using Kotlin and coroutines. It provides developers the ability to create both server and client applications targeting a variety of platforms including JVM, JavaScript and macOS, Windows and Linux via Kotlin/Native. In this talk we’re going to focus primarily on Ktor as a server application, see how simple it is to create asynchronous and robust server side applications, deployment models, features it provides out of the box, its extensibility model, and how it’s different to some of the other existing solutions on the market\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
