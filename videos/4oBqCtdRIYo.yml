title: 'A Deep Dive into Spring Application Events'
language: English
recordingDate: 1601027442
description: "Events have become a key element of modern application design, especially when it comes to distributed applications. But in monolithic applications, they can also be used to improve modularity, as Spring’s Application Event abstraction and the associated infrastructure components make it easy to design, publish and consume events.\n\nThe talk starts by giving an overview about the building blocks of Spring’s core event infrastructure. It continues with an example of how to decouple Spring components using events, discusses different ways of implementing a variety of interaction scenarios, and how Spring Data allows you to take a more domain-driven approach to event publication. We end up by discussing advanced event handling scenarios and failure handling.\n\nOliver Drotbohm: Senior Principal Software Engineer, VMware\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/a-deep-dive-into-spring-application-events"
