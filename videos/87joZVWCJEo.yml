recordingDate: 1576713941
description: 'In 2017, Vik launched Cake Wallet which is a popular open-source Monero wallet that allows users to hold Monero, make payments, and convert between cryptocurrencies. Although initially launched as a closed-source project but after receiving feedback from the community, Vik quickly had to learn about open-source projects and re-introduce the wallet. He will speak about the difficulties and opportunities creating a business with open-source projects and the importance of a strong relationship with the core community.'
