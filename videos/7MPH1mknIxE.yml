The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nRe-architecting Data Platform with Spark on Kubernetes - SeungYong Oh, Devsisters \n\nSince last year, many data platform projects including Apache Spark began to support the Kubernetes environment. What differentiates the Kubernetes environment and motivates engineers to use it over the existing environments? Should we move to Kubernetes environment while everything works well even now?\n\nThe talk will discuss Devsisters' journey of migrating its internal data platform including Spark to Kubernetes. During the process, we found out that migrating to the Kubernetes environment actually involved re-architecting our data platform, which lead to huge benefits including enhancing user experiences and collaboration workflows. The process and outcome of our journey will be shared in detail, along with an overview of the current technology status and its details."
