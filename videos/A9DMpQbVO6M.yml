description: "This session profiles an automatic tank gauge solution created for an oil and gas industry company that needed to see actual readings for tank farm oil levels and other important information, with proactive alerts. The solution, based on Java Embedded and Oracle technology, provides a GSM/GPRS-based wireless system for remote monitoring via SMS/web, including prompt alerts on mobile devices in case a product level goes high or low for any product transfers; automatic reports; and trend generation and an alarm system for individual/collective tanks. The system is integrated with Oracle E-Business Suite 12 to keep the inventory up to date, with an accuracy level of ±1 millimeter and sensitivity of ± 0.1 millimeter.\n\n\nAuthors:\n Rabindra Chakraborty\nDr. Rabindra Chakraborty manages the execution of all on-premise and offshore Oracle projects, worldwide.
