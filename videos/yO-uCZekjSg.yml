description: "Service Fabrik – Manage Enterprise-Grade Backing Services for an Enterprise-Grade Cloud Foundry [I] - Shashank Mohan Jain & Krishanu Biswas, SAP    \n\nCloud Foundry is a great abstraction layer for developing Cloud-native applications. In order to develop applications, you will also need backing services for caching, messaging, persistence and so on, besides an application runtime. Redis, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, and Postgres are some examples of such backing services. So far, there has been no open source offering that will allow you to provision, and operate backing service instances for Cloud Foundry in an automated/managed way including backup & restore, updates/upgrades and more. SAP’s open source offering called “Service Fabrik” (https://github.com/SAP/service-fabrik-boshrelease), provides a well defined contract and framework to provision and operate services to close this gap. While it is the basis for SAP’s own service offerings, Service Fabrik allows to deploy services described by either BOSH releases or as Docker containers. In this session, we’ll show the basics of Service Fabrik, the features and functions the framework provides and how easy it is to integrate your own services into it.\n\nKrishanu Biswas\nEngineering Manager, SAP\n\nShashank Mohan Jain\nSAP Labs India Pvt.
