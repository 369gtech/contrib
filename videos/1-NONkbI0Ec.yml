description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nThe Cloud Native Journey at Adobe - Carlos Sanchez, Adobe \n\nWe will share our journey migrating one of Adobe's enterprise products to Kubernetes, running multiple clusters across regions, as well as the processes and technologies that made this possible, including Envoy, Helm or Prometheus. Adopting DevOps has improved the communication between teams, which are now organized by functional areas, no more Dev, QA, Ops teams. Continuous Delivery allows us to highly automate software delivery with multiple deploys a day, and using GitOps we have improved visibility of the services running in the different environments. Using Prometheus and Grafana allows us to provide visibility into the state of the system to everyone in the team, as the whole engineering organization participates on on-call rotation to foster a shared responsibility across services. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ekAj"
