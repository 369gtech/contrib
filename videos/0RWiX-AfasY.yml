description: "Filmed at https://2019.dotcss.io on December 4, 2019 in Paris. More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks\n\nModern developments in CSS make it easier than ever to create robust, scalable, elegant typographic systems on the web. Add variable fonts and the design, technical, and performance benefits are really exciting. Jason looks at how to combine them with other CSS capabilities like custom properties, calculations, and grid to create a whole new way to think about design and development. He also shows how they work together by using some variable fonts in layouts that work across screen dimensions, accessibility needs, design requirements, and even network speedsâ€”better than you thought possible."
