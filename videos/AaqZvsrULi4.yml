description: "Writing REST Services for the gRPC-curious - Johan Brandhorst, Buf \n\nIntroducing the gRPC-Gateway, which makes it possible to expose a JSON/REST interface while maintaining many of the benefits of using gRPC.\n\nThe first 10 or so minutes will be spent laying the technical ground for the talk by talking about JSON/REST, giving a quick intro into gRPC and [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), then introducing the gRPC-Gateway as a way to integrate gRPC into existing architectures with strict JSON/REST interface requirements.\n\nThere will then be a live demo showing the power of this workflow by iterating on a simple design. The audience will be able to follow along on their own by cloning the [boilerplate repository](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate).\n\nGradually more complicated topics like PATCH requests, middleware, authentication, working with browser clients, cookies, WebSockets and more will be introduced."
