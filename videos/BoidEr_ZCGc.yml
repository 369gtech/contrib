description: "Spring Coroutines official support allows to go Reactive with Kotlin, WebFlux, RSocket and R2DBC (Reactive SQL) with a great balance between imperative and declarative programming, and can even be used outside of the JVM.\nIn this deep dive session, we are going to take a journey across building step by step a distributed chat application with Spring Boot 2.2 for the backend and Kotlin/JS for the frontend to experiment concretely with these topics:\n\nMain reasons for switching from Java to Kotlin\nState of Kotlin support in Spring Boot 2.2\nThe 3 pillars of Coroutines 1.3: suspending functions, structured concurrency and the brand new Flow type\nCoroutines support in Spring WebFlux with @Controller and the router DSL\nUsing Coroutines in the browser with Kotlin/JS\nBuilding a Reactive messaging infrastructure with RSocket\nReactive SQL with R2DBC\nConfiguring Spring Boot explicitly with Kofu experimental DSL from Spring Fu incubator\n\nSébastien is a Spring Framework committer at Pivotal, with a focus on Web, Reactive and GraalVM native image topics. He is also in charge of the Kotlin support across Spring portfolio and created the Spring Fu project. In his spare time, he is a member of the MiXiT conference staff."
