description: "“Digital transformation is a fancy term for customer innovation and operational excellence that drive financial results,” as Forrester’s Jeffery Hammond says. Put like that, you can see why digital transformation should be front and center on your CEO’s mind.\n\nCEOs are measured on driving innovation and operational efficiency. This requires a software delivery process that's nimble, consistent, and measurable. While technology underpins these requirements, the CEO must establish a culture that allows for a better software delivery process.\n\nMeanwhile app dev and delivery leaders cite funding, culture, organization, and metrics as common barriers to progress. Software leaders and CEOs must partner to remove these barriers and establish a culture of shared values that makes digital transformation possible.\n\nCome hear Jeffery talk about the shared values that CEOs and software leaders must foster for success, and learn how you can jump-start this important partnership!\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2OZbK74\n\nSpeaker: Jeff Hammond, Vice President, Principal Analyst Serving CIO Professionals, Forrester\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/getting-fancy-creating-a-partnership-with-your-ceo-for-the-digital-era"
