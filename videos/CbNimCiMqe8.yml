recordingDate: 1554736055
description: "After many years of relying on our own Spotify-proprietary message protocol, we have decided to adopt gRPC as our new default way of communication between the thousands of services that make up Spotify's backend.\n\nThis presentation will cover a real-world case study of migrating to gRPC, including various challenges and opportunities encountered along the way. In the pursuit of architecting reliable service communication, Matthias will cover the details in how his team go about changing such a fundamental piece of infrastructure and will walk through some of gRPC's most powerful features such as authentication, interceptors, and streaming."
