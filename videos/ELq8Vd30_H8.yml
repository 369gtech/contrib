description: "Erlang User Group Meeting, London, 30 April 2013\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/erlangusergroup/\n\n\"Making money with Erlang - having your Pi and selling it with a margin\" is about why Erlang can make you profitable and how you can sell others on the idea of using Erlang. After the dry lecture on techonolgy management we will clear our throats with a dash of Erlang/ALE (Actor Library for Embedded), i.e., embedded Erlang on the Raspberry Pi. \n\nTorben Hoffmann is Product & Research Manager for Erlang Solutions. He has been active in the Erlang community for several years and has spoken at conferences world-wide. His first big Erlang related project was the introduction of Erlang as a technology to write a gateway in for Motorola Solutions in Denmark. Torben holds a M.Sc in Engineering from the Technical University of Denmark."
