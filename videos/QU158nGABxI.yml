description: "\"Speaker: Liran Haimovitch\n\nKnowing your enemies is as important as knowing your friends. Understanding your debugger is a little of both. Have you ever wondered how Python debugging looks on the inside?\nOn our journey to building a Python debugger, we learned a lot about its internals, quirks and more.\n\nDuring this session, we’ll share how debugging actually works in Python.\nWe’ll discuss the differences between CPython and PyPy interpreters, explain the underlying debugging mechanism and show you how to utilize this knowledge at work and up your watercooler talk game.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
