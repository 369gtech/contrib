description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary,  7 2008\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA few years ago, development of the X Window System was\n revitalized by a change in management and the rise of a\n new generation of machines and operating systems. This\n talk is a tour of X, with emphasis on the things that are\n new and the things that are to come: advances in 2D\n rendering, use of 3D hardware, high-quality typography,\n revamped input support, client-side migration of\n responsibilities, and new support for the critical layers\n of software between the server and the toolkit. It's the\n seventh Year of the Linux Desktop, and the future has\n never looked shinier.\n\nSpeaker: Keith Packard, Intel\n Keith Packard was employee number three at the MIT X\n Consortium, and has written a substantial portion of the\n open-source X Window System server.  He currently works\n for Intel, and is a founding Board Member of the X.Org\n Foundation.\n\nSpeaker: Barton C Massey, Portland State University\n  Bart Massey is an Associate Professor of Computer Science\n at Portland State University, and Secretary of the X.Org\n Foundation.
