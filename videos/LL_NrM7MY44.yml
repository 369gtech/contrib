description: "https://cpponsea.uk/2020/sessions/cpp20-all-the-small-things.html\n\nIn addition to the headline features of C++20, the standard library is getting a huge number of useful upgrades. But, because the big features are so big, you might not have heard so much about all the small things. This talk will give you a flavour of the new additions as well as why we need them, some details on their implementation, and how they can make your code easier to read and less prone to errors.\n\nAmong other features, there will be new headers (version, source_location and numbers), new semantics for more intuitively interacting with containers, various utilities such as lerp and midpoint, and much much more.\n\nAs well as simply highlighting these features, it is often instructive to understand why they exist and why they are implemented the way they are. Why, for instance, is midpoint not just (a+b)/2? Why might it be important to have a signed container size? What is the ‘best’ way to portably implement mathematical constants? For answers to these, and a whistle-stop tour of the little extras in C++20, come along to this talk.\n\n--------\n\nFergus Cooper is a Research software engineer at the University of Oxford.\n\nRecent projects include simulating the UK's national infrastructure, building apps for medical applications, working on genome-matching algorithms, and simulating quantum computers."
