description: 'Infant research is an instrument-heavy, highly specialised branch of developmental psychology. People in the field have been pushing the envelope on what methods we can use, what data we can collect, and which questions we can answer about babies and young children, and how they perceive and think about the world. The result has been a profound shift in our understanding of human development; a realisation that six-month-old and one-year-old humans are capable of a great deal more than we previously thought. In this talk, we look at one specific question, language development, to illustrate how infant research uses data to find answers.'
