description: "Koping with Change: What kops Learned Adopting etcd3, cluster-api and CRDs - Justin Santa Barbara, Google & Mike Splain, Sonos \n\nKubernetes continues to adds features rapidly, but this makes it hard to install and operating a reliable kubernetes cluster. kops is an official OSS installation tool that makes kubernetes installation and operation turn-key.    But doing that requires that kops manage that complexity. We’ve had a busy year, migrating to etcd3, moving from an aggregated-apiserver to CRDs, starting to adopt the cluster-api. At the same time we’re taking the best pieces of kops and contributing them \"upstream\" into reusable modules - contributing to etcd-management and addon-management tools, as well as to the cluster-api.    We’ll give an overview of these changes and some of the challenges we faced, and share our strategies for dealing with the relentless pace of kubernetes change. We’ll also talk about how the upcoming roadmap for kubernetes, kops and for the components we’re spinning out of kops. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPcD"
