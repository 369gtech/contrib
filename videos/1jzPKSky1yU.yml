description: "Robyn Willison\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/112/\n\nWe would like to showcase Makerspace Adelaide with a walk through of the space and a talk about how we got to where we are now. https://makerspaceadelaide.org/ where the funding came from and what became our ethos.\r\n\r\nThe 4 main areas of the Makerspace are, Electronics, Digital Fabrication, Workshop and Textiles.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/\n\nProduced by Next Day Video Australia: https://nextdayvideo.com.au\n\n#linux.conf.au #linux #foss #opensource\n\nSat Jan 23 16:40:00 2021 at Rusty R.
