description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSuper Charge Your Service Mesh With eBPF - Yuval Kohavi & Idit Levine, Solo.io\n\nThe Linux kernel is an ideal place to implement observation, networking, and security, and improvements in the eBPF space are making it more practical to leverage the Linux kernel for these use-cases. Given that both eBPF and service mesh essentially allows users to program policies to connect, secure, and observe; you may be wondering how service mesh and eBPF intersect? This talk will explore different approaches to supercharge your service mesh with eBPF to make service mesh more secure and efficient."
