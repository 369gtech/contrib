title: '#HITB2021SIN D1T1 What Modern RF Combat Looks Like In The Next Decade - Harshit Agrawal'
language: English
recordingDate: 1630490226
description: "Imagine robotic tanks that maneuver themselves across desert terrain, avoiding landmines; drones with enough artificial intelligence to carry out strikes without human operators, and next-generation uniforms to monitor soldiers’ heart rates and hydration levels… or provide early warning alarms for chemical attacks. If you Google the Internet of Things, you only find the attacks on it. Imagine how much more challenging it would be in an actual battlefield, where adversaries want to attack the battlefield as opposed to a hacker in a home who just wants to have fun. The 21st-century technology boom can give armies a strategic advantage for high-tech warfare but Can technology make war safer?\n\nThe vision of a connected battlefield, where Soldiers interface with a myriad of sensors (IoT), weapons systems, and support services, and adapt the information to gain situational awareness and force superiority introduces a new series of threats at a scale greater than any other time in history. Each connected device now becomes a target for the adversary, and a chance to exploit weaknesses in not only the devices themselves but also the networks interconnecting the devices. This concept of “IoT in Defense” is still relatively new and therefore it’s only scratching the surface of the many potential applications.\n\nThis session aims to introduce attendees to the concepts of IoBT, the convergence of Cyber-EW, Jamming, RF-based counter-drone solutions, emerging tools of cyber-reconnaissance, and ISR&T RF focused case studies.\n\n=== \n\nHarshit Agrawal (@harshitnic) is currently working as a Radio Security Researcher. He is enthusiastic about SIGINT, Drone Pentesting, Telecom Security, and IoT Security. He presented his research at International Security conferences like Defcon USA, RSAC USA, Cyberweek UAE, HITB Amsterdam, Hack Summit Poland, Nanosec Malaysia, etc. Previously, he was President at CSI Chapter and Vice President for Entrepreneurship cell at MIT, where he also headed the team of security enthusiasts, giving him a good insight into cybersecurity and increased his thirst to explore more in this field. He is a student, developer, programmer, and researcher, he believes in providing something out of the box!"
