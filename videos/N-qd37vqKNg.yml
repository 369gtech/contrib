description: "M. de Blanc\n\nhttps://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/65/\n\nHave you ever asked yourself: What is my responsibility to the people using the technology I make? How do I make decisions about what is right and wrong when choosing to work on something? What even is right and wrong? \r\n\r\nWell, let's find some answers (or, really, more questions). This whirlwind tour of philosophical inquiry is designed for the FOSS community by the FOSS community. Our focus will be on moral responsibility. I'll even throw in a few Trolley Problems for good measure.\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
