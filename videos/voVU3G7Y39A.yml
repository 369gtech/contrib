description: "React is amazing at quickly rendering your apps and structuring your app into components in a logical way leveraging the best features of JavaScript.\n\nRxJS is built specifically to manage the most difficult asynchronous tasks. Anything from too many button clicks, to network errors, or even cancelling outgoing requests.\n\nCombining the features of RxJS with React gives you the best of both worlds. RxJS can stream values into you React components and provide event handlers to give you complete control over how values and state flow through your app.\n\nJohn Lindquist will show how to connect React and RxJS together and provide demos on how to solve complex asynchronous situations."
