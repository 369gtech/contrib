description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Los Angeles, CA from October 12-15. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nApache Teaclave (incubating): An Open Source Universal Secure Computing Platform in Rust - Mingshen Sun, Baidu\n\nApache Teaclave (incubating) is a universal secure computing platform written in Rust, making computation on privacy-sensitive data on cloud safe and secure. Teaclave adopts multiple security technologies to enable secure computing, in particular, Teaclave is written in Rust to prevent memory-safety issues. It uses Intel SGX to serve the most security-sensitive tasks with hardware-based isolation, memory encryption and attestation. Teaclave is a function-as-a-service platform. With many built-in functions, it also supports a wide variety of tasks on sensitive data like privacy preserving machine learning, private set intersection, etc. Unlike traditional FaaS, Teaclave supports both general secure computing tasks and flexible single- and multi-party secure computation. In this talk, Mingshen will talk about the background, design and how Rust empowers Teaclave's implementation."
