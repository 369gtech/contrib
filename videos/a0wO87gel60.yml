title: 'Git Workflow Strategies for Technical Debt Management by Raquel Pau Fernández'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495023463
description: "The technical debt metaphor is gaining significant traction in the agile development community as a way to understand and communicate those issues related to accepting bad programming practices in order to achieve fast results (e.g a deadline). However, the idea of getting fast results becomes an illusion, since the cost of building software increases over the time.\n\nIn order to achieve a good technical debt management, agile methodologies suggest to measure it and add an specific entry in the sprint backlog to fix it incrementally and to apply continuous inspection to block new code quality issues. In this session, we will explore the different categories of technical debt and how can we benefit from Git workflow to reduce part of it incrementally and safely.\n\nRaquel Pau Fernández\nI have almost 10 years of experience programming in Java. I have also a long experience in big data and recommendation systems. Currently, I am the project leader of Walkmod, an open source tool to apply Java code conventions and also the organizer of Legacy Code Rocks Barcelona meetup."
