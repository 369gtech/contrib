description: "Let's focus on practical case analysis and avoid general statements you can hear on any agile conference.\nI will become a storyteller and will share a set of stories, representing lessons learned from runnung an agile project in a waterfall-based telecom culture.\n\nI will also give a clear understanding what was a project setup. What was done differently from the enterprise waterfall-based project management standard? What agile principles and specific practices were applied? What were tangible benefits to the business from the situation where one project team became \"outlaws\" of the corporate culture.\n\nMoreover, I will share the challenges and lessons learned related to both phases - the transfer project and further operations and development of the Service Desk function."
