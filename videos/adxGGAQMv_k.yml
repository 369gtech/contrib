title: 'Joshua Koo: Cascading Perspectives with THREE CSS3DRenderer - CSSConf.Asia 2014'
language: English
recordingDate: 1422694100
description: "One of the interesting ways to create 3-dimensional content in browsers is by CSS 3D transforms. While three.js has been popularly known as the javascript library for webgl, its modular design supports rendering with 3D transforms using CSS and that has been nothing short of disappointing. This talk takes you through the history, the workings, the possibilities and the creativity (and possibly the future) of three.js and the CSS3DRenderer.\n\nJoshua is random. Codes. Cycles. Climbs. Cold jokes. Organizes creative coding meetups. He uses .random() frequently in code and experiments on random ideas in his free time. At random moments, he gains inspiration to share and open source his works. He’s from Singapore and is employee #12 of Zopim (now Zendesk) where he leads the integration team.\n\nCSSConf.Asia - Bridging Design and Implementation. Amara Sanctuary, Singapore - 19 November 2014.\n\nSource: http://2014.cssconf.asia/#speakers\nSlides: http://slides.com/zz85/cssconf-2014/\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
