description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nLearn what makes parallel algorithms tick by stepping through them with one of Visual C++'s parallel algorithms' authors. Abstract design and structure of parallelizing STL algorithms will be discussed, and made concrete by stepping through Visual C++' specific implementations. Digging into a real implementation should provide better understanding of parallel algorithms' performance characteristics, or make it easier to implement your own parallel algorithms, regardless of platform.\n— \nBilly O'Neal, Microsoft\nSr. SDE\n\nBilly a maintainer of the standard C++ libraries at Microsoft. He improves performance in the library for existing features, and is the author of several C++17 library features in Visual C++, including string_view, boyer_moore searchers, parallel algorithms, and parts of filesystem.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
