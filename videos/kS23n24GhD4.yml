description: "Visual Studio 2016 + Talk DevOps please: A .NET Developers Guide to 3rd Party tools for DevOps\n\nFind out what Microsoft has planned for developers in 2016 with the new Visual Studio 15 IDE then talk DevOps.\n\nDevOps is all about bringing the developers and operations together so that they are working as a team in the best interests of the product rather than themselves. Let's talk about the main goals you want to achieve by implementing good DevOps.\nThings are looking better with the open sourcing of .NET and ASP.NET along with the release of the free Visual Studio Community Edition but you still need 3rd party tools for great devops. Come see Adam give you a tour and expand your development horizons that will include 15 tools starting with Azure Deployment Slots, Octopus, Testing in Production and more."
