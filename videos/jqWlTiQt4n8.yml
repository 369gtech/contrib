recordingDate: 1590484517
description: "Community Connections experience - Polar Bears can be data scientists. Or, rather, they are data points that data scientists might use to predict climate change. Come be an aspiring data scientist in this fun introduction to Computer Vision and Machine Learning.\n We'll classify images in the Canadian Arctic, evaluate & visualize our model, and then deploy it to a simple web app for climate scientists to use."
