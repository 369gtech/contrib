title: 'JavaScript Tutorial For Beginners #26 - Arrays'
language: English
recordingDate: 1440240016
description: "Hey guys, in this JavaScript tutorial I wanted to show you how to make arrays and how we store pockets of informations in them. Arrays can be (virtually) endless in the amount of pockets they can hold, certainly enough for any client side script.\n\nThe biggest indicator someone is using an array is the square bracket notation - [ ].\n\nYou can also create arrays using the 'new' keyword, but I prefer to use the square bracket method, just because it's quicker and easier to assign values straight away.\n\nAs always, ask away with any questions :).\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO CHANNEL - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n========== JavaScript for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i9Ae2D9Ee1RvylH38dKuET\n\n========== CSS for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT\n\n========== HTML for Beginners Playlist ==========\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ibZ2TSBaGGNrgh4ZgYE6Cc\n\n========== The Net Ninja ============\n\nFor more front-end development tutorials & to black-belt your coding skills, head over to - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg or http://thenetninja.co.uk\n\n========== Social Links ==========\n\nTwitter - @TheNetNinja - https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk"
