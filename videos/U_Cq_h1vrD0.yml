description: "Google Tech Talks\nJuly 25, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe largest changes in computing with machines continues to be in speed and ease of access. Google is the leader in providing new and better tools to access computing in ways that increase user's productivity. However, in most practical applications, the set of safe numerical computations with floating-point arithmetic remains empty. Macsyma, Reduce, Mathematica, and Maple have expanded the use of computers to do symbolic mathematics. However, numerical computing and symbolic mathematics have diverged into their own domains because numerical computing with floating-point numbers is not safe.\n\nThis talk answers the following questions:\n* How computing..."
