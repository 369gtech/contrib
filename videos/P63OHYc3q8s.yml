description: "Groovy is already 10 years old, but continues to evolve and innovate.\n\nWhat's new under the hood? - implicit closure coercion - new AST transforms - finer grained script configuration - type checker extensions\n\nIn the upcoming versions of Groovy, you'll be able to create \"traits\", do tail recursions, and much more.\n\nWe'll also talk about what's cooking for Groovy 3.0, with its new Meta-Object Protocol, its new grammar, its JDK 8 support."
