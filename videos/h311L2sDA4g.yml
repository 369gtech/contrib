description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Copenhagen 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nJVM is a blessing. JVM is a curse. \n\nStartup time and predictable performance are extremely hard to achieve on the JVM due to the complexity of the underlying VM. This makes Scala unsuitable for writing applications that are sensitive to these requirements.\n\nIn this talk, we're going to show how Scala Native enables lightweight system programming without breaking a sweat."
