title: 'Richard Lewington: Augmenting the Reality of Education for the 21st Century'
recordingDate: 1544401912
description: "In fewer than 50 years we have seen massive changes in the classroom. \n\nFrom chalkboards to videotapes, the introduction of computers to interactive whiteboards, and now the implementation of Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence. \n\nBut how much learning value can AR & AI actually offer students beyond the “WOW factor”? \n\nAre we just rehashing old teaching methodologies and redressing them up with the latest technology? Or should we be exploiting AR & AI’s potential as a tool rather than just another medium? \n\nAdditionally, by integrating 21st-century skills and gamification into our design thinking, we can push the potential of educational applications to the limits! \n\nRichard Lewington explores these topics and discusses what we should be doing about them. - Captured Live on Ustream at http://www.ustream.tv/stretch\n\nhttp://www.stretchcon.com/"
