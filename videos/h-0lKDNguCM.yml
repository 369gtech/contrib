description: "PyData Tel Aviv Meetup #30\n6 July 2021\nSponsored and Hosted by Taboola\nhttps://www.meetup.com/PyData-Tel-Aviv/\n\nHomogenous labeled datasets and relatively easy to model with a single simple neural network. However, scarcity of labeled data sometimes forces us to combine different populations in order to have enough data for training, and thus creating a heterogeneous dataset. For example people from different countries might show very different behavior although they may share common characteristics. How do we make sure our model is both accurate and fair for all populations? In this talk we will shortly describe a nice architecture trick we use to allow the model to enjoy both generalization from multiple populations and specialization for each of them.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \n\nFind a PyData chapter near you: meetup.com/pro/pydata"
