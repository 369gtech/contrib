description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nService Mesh Failure Stories at Scale - Krzysztof Słonka, Allegro.pl \n\nWhat can go wrong when deploying Envoy and an in-house Control-Plane to a heterogeneous environment (Mesos, VMs and more) consisting of approximately 1000 microservices? Well... a lot.  Come and hear a story of migrating to Service Mesh at allegro.pl, the 5th largest e-commerce site in Europe. This talk is not a glorious fairytale, it's about countless surprising problems we've faced and solutions we've found. In spite of many difficulties and temporary failures we managed to keep the system operational without any major outage.  During the last two years we've learned a lot and I'm here to share all of our mistakes so you don't have to repeat them. \n\nhttps://sched.co/abZw"
