title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Breaking Drupal out of the box with AR and beacons'
recordingDate: 1506524722
description: "Drupal’s flexibility in content modeling creates almost limitless possibilities for bringing together the world of data and the real world.\n\nAugmented reality (AR) allows digital content to be overlaid on top of the environment with which the user is interacting. It visually keys off of objects the user is interacting with, allowing the user experience to be enriched with this information. Museums and brick-and-mortar stores are increasingly employing augmented reality to superimpose content over users' perspectives rather than boxing that content into the isolated environment of a web page.\n\nMeanwhile, beacons provide the ability to granularly locate a user within an environment, so that content that is most relevant to them can be presented. Beacon manufacturers are capitalizing on the increased interest from the standpoint of commerce by offering compelling APIs and easy-to-use hardware with features like near-field communication.\n\nWe’ll discuss ways in which these technologies can be combined, on top of Drupal, to create an immersive and interactive user experience.\n\nHere are the topics that we'll dive into:\n\nMoving from a page-driven mentality to a geospatial mentality\n\nWhy combine augmented reality (AR) and beacons?\n\nHow can I provide AR-driven content using Drupal?\n\nWhat are the implications of AR on content management (cf. Layar)?\n\nHow can I connect beacons to Drupal in a compelling way?\n\nWhat does an AR- and beacon-driven experience, tied together with Drupal, look like?\n\nEpilogue: Contextualizing content in a decontextualized world"
