description: 'Back in the day, large-scale monolithic mainframe systems ruled the world. While some of those monolithic mainframe systems still roam the earth, today we have new architecture techniques, patterns, and styles that provide us with fresh and exciting ways to think about how we approach building software systems. Event-driven architecture, service-oriented architecture, microservices architecture, and a plethora of other architecture styles have emerged to help us build better and more effective software solutions. But what factors led software architecture to move from where we were 30 years ago to where we are now? And how will those factors influence software architectures in the future? Mark Richards discusses the social, economic, and technology factors that have enabled the evolution of software architecture over the past three decades and explores what the future of software architecture might look like.'
