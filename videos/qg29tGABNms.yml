description: "LISA16 - Code Review for Operations\n\nSpencer Krum, IBM and OpenStack\n\nCode review has been shown to help developers produce better code. It can also help SREs run more reliable systems. Our ops team is fanatic about using code review and representing our infrastructure as code so that code review can be leveraged. In this presentation I will show how we use code review to manage our infrastructure, modify and create systems, administer services, etc. I'll discuss why we use code review for our operations work, and where we get value from it. I'll show the path we took to get here, what actions couldn't be piped through code review, and what we're going to do next.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
