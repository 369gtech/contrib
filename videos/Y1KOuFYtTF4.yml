description: "http://www.Cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/cppcon/cppcon2015\n—\nWhy do we use const? It helps the compiler enforce program invariants, find trivial bugs, and generally makes code better. But with C++11 has an extended meaning, specifically in regards to multi-threaded code.\n\nThis talk will be an intro to the const keyword and what it means to declare objects, pointers and member functions as const. We will also explore some subtle issues encountered with const, mutable, and multithreaded code.\n— \nRichard Powell:  I started using C++ 10 years ago to write a psychoacoustic audio encoder/decoder and have continued to explore how to make software that unlocks the potential of hardware to bring amazing applications to life. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and worked throughout the Bay Area for the past 15 years. I enjoy teaching and learning about C++ and programming.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
