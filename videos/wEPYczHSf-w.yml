description: "Have you ever felt like a fraud? Like you did not deserve the opportunities in front of you? Have you ever thought “why me, I should not be here”? Have you feared others might discover you are a fake?\n\nAlternatively, have you seen a talented colleague not recognising their achievements? A colleague who is hesitant to take on a new role?\n\nThoughts and feelings are impostor syndrome; I encounter it regularly and fight against it in myself and others. Unite with me in this battle; for yourself, your colleagues and friends.\n\nJoin me as I share my experiences with impostor syndrome, how I have fought against it, and how you can join the fight.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks at: \nhttps://ndctechtown.com/\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/"
