Tom can't speak for himself, but Steven is sure others will chime in. \n\n00:00 Setting the stage\n03:15 Tom Says\n04:00 Steven Says\n05:00 Chris Says\n08:15 LiveSQL exploration\n11:40 Avoiding redundant entries in error log\n13:30 Using conditional compilation to direct output to screen\n15:00 Chris says: handle expected exceptions, avoid WHEN OTHERS\n17:30 Lots of discussion\n29:30 Donâ€™t forget to log the call stack\n33:23 Picking a -20NNN error code for raise_application_error\n35:29 Utility package by Sven Weller on top of utl_call_stack\n38:02 Thoughts on tracing parameter values\n\nAskTOM Office Hours offers free, monthly training and tips on how to make the most of Oracle Database, from Oracle product managers, developers and evangelists.\n\nhttps://asktom.oracle.com/\n\nOracle Developers portal: https://developer.oracle.com/\nSign up for an Oracle Cloud trial: https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit"
