description: "As programmers we need to effectively reason about the code, maintain it and develop new features.\n\nEach year, systems’ codebases are growing and piling new solutions on top of old ones, slowly turning sophisticated codebase into a bowl of spaghetti. Reducing the amount of time needed to understand the system to get the job done is crucial.\n\nPlease meet Context Buddy – your new friend at work and a software intelligence platform. Context Buddy is here to make programmers’ life easier by providing context about the system making your days more productive."
