description: "During this talk, I will discuss Gousto's journey (both the highs and the lows!) to implementing our recipe recommendation system. Being able to recommend the right recipes is a crucial part of offering a convenient service and we have therefore implemented several approaches. I will go through the different recommendation methods and the learnings we have taken from each of them.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
