description: "Running Windows Containers on Kubernetes is now fully supported! But running Windows applications in production on Kubernetes is more than just containerizing the app â€“ especially in enterprise environments. Join us for a presentation and demo to learn about critical design elements for making sure your Windows app is production-ready, including:\n\n*How to implement Active Directory with container-based applications requiring Integrated Windows Authentication\n*Options for workloads requiring persistent storage\n*Techniques for retrieving logging data from Windows apps, which do not default to using standard out\n*When to utilize each available container base image from Microsoft\n\n \n\nPresenter:\nSteven Follis\nManager, Solutions Engineering @Mirantis"
