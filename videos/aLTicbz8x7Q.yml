description: "Keynote: Chip Childers, CTO, Cloud Foundry Foundation; Ben Hale, Lead of Java on Cloud Foundry, Co-lead of Cloud Native Buildpacks, Pivotal & Dr. Julz Friedman, Open Sourceror, Cloud Foundry Project Lead, IBM\n\nAbout Julz Friedman\nJulian Friedman (julz) is an IBMer and the project lead for Cloud Foundy's low-level container engine (\"Garden\") and Eirini (the project to allow Kubernetes to be used as the container scheduler in CF). He has previously worked on various Cloud Foundry projects, performance optimization of Jeopardy-playing AIs, large scale and small scale Cloud projects, emerging technologies consulting and various other things. He has a doctorate in Large Scale Complex IT Systems (with a focus on data-parallel systems and Map/Reduce) which he is pretty sure is a long way of saying “Clouds”. If you have several free hours and enjoy the sound of a rant delivered in a British accent, ask whether he thinks pushing a database to a cloud platform is a good idea.\n\nAbout Ben Hale\nBen Hale leads Pivotal’s Java Cloud Foundry efforts including being a founding member of the Cloud Native Buildpacks CNCF Sandbox project and leading the Cloud Foundry Java Buildpack. In addition to this work, he’s very involved in the Reactive Programming scene founding the Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) project, being a spec lead and committer on the RSocket Reactive networking protocol, and being a long-time contributor to Project Reactor. In what little spare time he has left, Ben loves riding his bike, especially in the high mountains of the Italian Dolomites.\n\nAbout Chip Childers\nChip has spent more than 18 years in large-scale computing and open source software. In 2015, he became the co-founder of the Cloud Foundry Foundation as Technology Chief of Staff. He was the first VP of Apache Cloudstack, a platform he helped drive while leading Enterprise Cloud Services at SunGard and then as VP Product Strategy at Cumulogic. Prior to SunGard, he led the rebuild of mission-critical applications for organizations including IRS.gov, USMint.gov, Merrill Lynch and SEI Investments. Chip is an experienced speaker at events like OSCON, LinuxCon North America, LC Japan, LC EU, ApacheCon, O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference, and many more. In his free time, Chip loves trail hiking with his black lab, sailing catamarans and sunfish, and trying to keep up with his young daughter."
