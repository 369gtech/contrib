description: "Google Tech Talks\nFebruary 12, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nDensity modelling in high dimensions is a very difficult problem. Traditional approaches, such as mixtures of Gaussians, typically fail to capture the structure of data sets in high dimensional spaces. In this talk we will argue that for many data sets of interest, the data can be represented as a lower dimensional manifold immersed in the higher dimensional space. We will then present the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM), a non-linear probabilistic variant of principal component analysis (PCA) which implicitly assumes that the data lies on a lower dimensional space.\nHaving introduced the GP-LVM we will review extensions to the..."
