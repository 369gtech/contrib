title: 'YOW! West 2014 - Push better software with Pull Requests - Rob Moore'
recordingDate: 1422351667
description: "Developers who are familiar with open source will likely be aware of pull requests, which were created and popularised by GitHub as a way of providing some automation, visibility and social interaction around merging software changes. What is less talked about is the use of pull requests for commercial/private/proprietary software development, which not only yields the same advantages as with open source development, but also a lot more.\n\nIn my experiences so far I've found that the single most effective change I have introduced to a software team that has improved the quality of software output is to introduce pull requests. It also has a positive effect on other things like improved collaboration and collective code ownership.\n\nThis talk will take a deep-dive into pull requests and explore advantages, gotchas, integrating with a continuous delivery workflow, a range of tips based on my experience so far using them on open source and commercial projects and some tips on how to get started.\n\nFor more on YOW!
