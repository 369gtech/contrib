description: 'The Open Cannabis Project is a community-led, research-driven non-profit with a simple mission: to defend the richness and diversity of cannabis from illegitimate and overreaching patents. To fulfill this mission, we are building a transparent and open source repository of data about cannabis genetics, chemistry, and traits. In addition to documenting plants that already exist in the public domain, such a robust data set can also provide a unique lens into cannabis en masse, allowing us to gain an understanding of this variable little plant in a way weve never before been able to see.'
