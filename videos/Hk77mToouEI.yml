description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nInside Kubernetes Services - Dominik Tornow, Cisco & Andrew Chen, Google  \n\nKubernetes Services are a core abstraction of Kubernetes. In combination with Kubernetes Pods, Kubernetes Services provide the very foundation for scalable and reliable applications hosted on Kubernetes. However, even experienced Kubernetes users struggle to reason about Services end-to-end.   Using a systems modeling approach, this talk will explore the mechanics of Kubernetes Services, connect the dots between K8s Services, K8s Endpoints, and the KubeProxy, all the way to IP Tables and Network Filters. You will leave with a concise and accurate understanding how K8s Services enable scalable and reliable communication in the Kubernetes cluster. In addition, you will leave with a detailed understanding under what circumstances K8s Services DONâ€™T work and how to mitigate the situation. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uabq"
