description: "Ever wanted to truly explore what it would be like to be a James Gosling, or a Bjarne Stroustrup, or Anders Hjalsberg? Want to see what it's really like, building a language from soup to nuts? This presentation will take you through that process exactly, from deciding whether your language will be compiled or interpreted, or static- or dynamically-typed, through defining a simple grammar, building the parser, constructing the AST, and generating code out the back end. We'll look at tools that can simplify this process, and discover that building a custom language for a particular task isn't quite as hard as it might seem at first. It's domain-specific languages, without the MDA.\n\nTed Neward is an industry professional of twenty years' experience. He speaks at conferences all over the world and writes regularly for a variety of publications across the Java, .NET, and other ecosystems. He currently resides in the Pacific Northwest with his wife, two sons, dog, four cats, eight laptops, seven tablets, nine phones, and a rather large utility bill."
