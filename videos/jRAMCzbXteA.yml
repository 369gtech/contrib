description: 'State-of-the-art 3D rendering involves bouncing light rays through a scene to capture color and texture with an amazingly simple algorithm called path tracing. In this tutorial session, Hunter will render beautiful images by tracing the paths of billions of photons with Go on cheap cloud hardware. Discover how your brain can visually tell the difference between glass, plastic, and water - all by the subtle differences in how they interact with light. Explore the tradeoffs of several different concurrency schemes for simulating the behavior of light in Go, as well as several pitfalls of writing graphics software in the language. Finally, we''ll look to the future of computer graphics and see where Go might fit. Afterwards, you may view the world in a new way - because you''ll understand how a handful of simple rules bring rich visual information to your eyes - and hopefully you''ll be inspired to push Go into new domains.'
