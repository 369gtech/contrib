description: "MobileOptimized 2019\niOS track\n\nBuilding a Realtime Video Processor with Swift and Metal - Ben Sandofsky @Halide\nThis talk covers the low-level details of processing video in realtime.\nWe draw from the experience building the in-house video renderer that powers Halide and Spectre. We'll cover GPU programming, data-oriented design, and affordances of Swift that make it a competitive alternative to C++. Even if you use a higher-level framework, you'll walk away from the talk understanding what the frameworks do under the hood.\n\nGeneral Partner –Apalon (https://www.apalon.com/)\nVideo Partner – Flo (https://flo.health/)"
