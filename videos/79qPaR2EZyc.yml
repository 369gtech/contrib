title: 'Sensitive data in the cloud? You canâ€™t do that! - Rune Grimstad'
recordingDate: 1470647473
description: "In my job I work with very sensitive medical information. The traditional view here is that this sensitivity excludes the cloud as a possible platform. I believe that this is not only wrong but also a very unfortunate limitation.\nIn this talk I want to look at this situation to discuss the background and then to look at what you can do to fix it. In my opinion there is nothing stopping you from handling sensitive data in the cloud, but you have to know what you are doing. The same requirements for data security applies for the cloud as for on premise systems, the main difference is how we perceive the cloud.\n\nThe focus of my talk will be on Microsoft Azure, but the principles are reusable across all platforms."
