description: "Speaker: Becky Winant, Partner, Facilitator @ Transformational Imaging\n\nAgile meetings do not always go smoothly. Especially when you work in a geographically distributed team or get moved from one team to another. How can you discover what might be going on when things go awry? This session will have a brief simulation of a meeting. Three volunteers will play agile roles with typical challenges we experience. As a group we will share observations about the interactions, and what we thought we understood, but may not have. This session introduces the Satir Interaction Model and a broader understanding of how we might correct mis-interpreted behavior and commenting. \n\nAbout the speaker\n\nI have been a software programmer, marketing representative, business owner, consultant, seminar designer and leader, architect and facilitator. Over the years I have been drawn to places and people with an interesting edge - where the ideas are compelling and invigorating. I came by way of being an art student who discovered the principles of design alive in computing and software. A path through software development also led me through a decade of studying Satir models and Weinberg principles that sum up my work to date: Technology is easy to understand compared to the people who build it, want it, fund it and use it. Having been through many years of introducing models, eliciting requirements, and crafting new processes, I continue to learn how people and organizations resist, accept, reject or even become comfortable with change. My focus is finding opportunities and options to achieve stated goals.\n\nEvent Page: http://2016.agilesingapore.org\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/XvTM/"
