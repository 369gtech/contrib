description: "Testing your K8s apps with KIND - Benjamin Elder, Google & James Munnelly, Jetstack.io \n\nPart of the promise of Docker is being able to run tests in the same environment as production. For applications running on Kubernetes, though, development and testing is still a challenge. Developers of these applications have to choose between three poor options: an external, stateful cluster, spinning up a cluster for each test, or running tests outside of Kubernetes. All of these have significant drawbacks that hinder the acceptance of Kubernetes in new environments. kind presents a fourth option: a small, compliant Kubernetes that comes up in one minute, not twenty. Using kind, CI signal can be more reliable, integration tests faster, and local development streamlined. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPYy"
