description: "http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/rbea-scalable-real-time-analytics-at-king/\n\nThis talk introduces RBEA (Rule-Based Event Aggregator), the scalable real-time analytics platform developed by King’s Streaming Platform team. We have built RBEA to make real-time analytics easily accessible to game teams across King without having to worry about operational details. RBEA is built on top of Apache Flink and uses the framework's capabilities to it's full potential in order to provide highly scalable stateful and windowed processing logic for the analytics applications. We will talk about how we have built a high-level DSL on the abstractions provided by Flink and how we tackled different technical challenges that have come up while developing the system."
