title: 'GopherCon 2021: Robert Griesemer & Ian Lance Taylor - Generics!'
language: English
recordingDate: 1639778867
description: 'With the upcoming 1.18 Go release, Go will officially support generic functions and types, and will come with a set of new packages providing common generic functionality. Generics add significant expressive power to Go, and with these generic powers come some very concrete responsibilities to keep Go code readable, maintainable, and performing well. After a brief summary of the new features, Go Team members, Ian and Robert, will provide some guidance on where and where not to use generic features, and how to use them for the best possible outcome.'
