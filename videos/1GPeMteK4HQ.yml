description: "Google Maps and Google Earth have put much of the functionality of Geographic Information Systems in the hands of the end users. Maritime users are just beginning to understand the power of map mashups that bring together diverse datasets to help mariners and those who manage the waterways to better understand the uses, risks, and impacts of vessel traffic on our nation's waterways. I will present a number of data types ranging from raster images of ocean\r\nflow modeling, to vessel traffic over time captured by the marine Automatic Identification System, to real time right whale notices for vessels approaching Boston Harbor.\r\n\r\nPresenter: Kurt Schwehr\r\n\r\nResearch Assistant Professor of Ocean Engineering in the Center for Coastal (CCOM) and the Joint Hydrographic Center at the University of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nKurt's main research focus is on the Chart of the Future and is a collaboration with NOAA, USCG, and Cornell University. Kurt received\r\nhis PhD from Scripps Institution of oceanography studying marine geology and geophysics and received a B.S. Geology from Stanford University. He has worked at JPL, NASA Ames, the Field Robotics Center at Carnegie Mellon, and the USGS Menlo Park. In addition to his marine work, he has participated in a number of space craft missions including the recent Phoenix Mars Lander."
