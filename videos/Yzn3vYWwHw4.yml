title: 'YOW! West 2015 Andy Marks - Macromonitoring for Microservices'
recordingDate: 1514638505
description: "Monitoring monolithic applications integrating with single databases is a well-understood problem. But who writes monolithic applications these days? Who would even dare in the face of the all-conquering wave of microservices popularity?\n\nYet effective monitoring of a large fleet of decoupled microservices is a different kettle of fish entirely. And whilst an organisation may have the development savvy needed to build these fine-grained services, this competence does not always provide the necessary operational nous to monitor them in production.\n\nCorrelation ids, synthetic transactions and circuit breakers are all concepts those struck with microservice-fever are going to have to master to ensure the benefits of this architecture are not outweighed by the complexity of the associated support infrastructure.\n\nThis presentation will use the event stream processing tool Riemann (riemann.io) to demonstrate how typical microservice monitoring patterns can be implemented to provide simple and effective monitoring.\n\nAndy Marks is the Office Principal for ThoughtWorks Melbourne and Perth. Originally an itinerant teacher of programming at university, Andy has been writing code professionally since 1996 in Melbourne, Brisbane, San Francisco, Leeds and Singapore. Joining ThoughtWorks as a technical lead in 2002, Andy has deep experience in agile development and has, since 2013, become one of those dreary functional programming evangelists you dread speaking to at parties.\n\nAndy is a frequent speaker at conferences in Australia as well as user groups in Melbourne, even though he does not understand monadsâ€¦ not even a little bit.\n\nFor more on YOW!
