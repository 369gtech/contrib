This talk is for developers that already know Swift a little, and for the ones who want to learn more about Swift features. Marcin is an author of CryptoSwift, and during his research, the speaker has found patterns that make code written in Swift less or more performant. Marcin will discuss the current status of Swift compiler and syntax regarding how the compiler can optimize source code, and how that affects milliseconds in runtime."
