description: "What is the first thing we do when a major issue occurs in a live system? Sort it out of course. Then we start the hunt for the person to blame so that they can suffer the appropriate punishment. What do we do if a person is being awkward in the team and won’t agree to our ways of doing things? Ostracise them of course, and see how long it is until they leave – problem solved.\nThis highly interactive talk delves into why humans have this tendency to blame and punish. It looks at real examples of punishment within the software world and the results which were achieved. These stories not only cover managers punishing team members but also punishment within teams and self-punishment. We are all guilty of some of the behaviours discussed.\n\nThis is aimed at everyone involved in software development. After the talk attendees will understand:\n\nWhy we tend to blame and punish others.\nThe impact of self-blame.\nThe unintended (but predictable) results from punishment.\nThe alternatives to punishment, which get real results."
