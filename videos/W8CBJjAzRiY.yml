The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nTowards Serverless As Commodity: A Case of Knative - Nima Kaviani, IBM & Dmitriy Kalinin, PivotalSDCC\n\nServerless computing promises to evolve cloud computing architecture, reducing complexities of managing and scaling underlying infrastructure. However, one of the primary drawbacks customers face when deciding to use serverless is the potential for getting locked-in with a particular provider. This used to be a concern with Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings too. However with Kubernetes emerging as the industry standard, PaaS is closer to becoming commodity with the Kubernetes API as its common interface. The question is if a similar unification for the API interface and runtime contracts can be achieved for serverless. As contributor to Knative with in-depth understanding of its internal design, we use Knative as the baseline and compare its API interface and runtime contracts against other prominent serverless platforms. We identify commonalities and differences, discuss challenges, and review evolution we expect to see as serverless platforms reach commodity status."
