language: English
recordingDate: 1563562530
description: "Andrea Barberio and David Hendricks, Facebook\n\nIn 2018 we set out to improve our boot and provisioning flow by turning our Linux engineers into firmware engineers and leveraging open source in our firmware stack. In this talk, we'll share some of the progress we've made to develop, deploy, and test open source firmware, as well as some of the difficulties and successes. In particular, we will cover provisioning, advances in measured boot, platform bring-up, and a new open-source system testing framework.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Asia/Pacific program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19asia/program\n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
