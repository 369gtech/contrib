description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2020\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\n\nCommonality Variability Analysis is at the core of domain analysis. When we analyze the domain, we are always analyzing the way domain elements are the same and the ways in which they are different.\nA major source of accidental complexity is when we get our CVA wrong. This happens when we treat things the same when they are really different, and vise versa, when we treat things as different when they are essentially the same.\nIn this talk, I will first review the basics of CVA starting from the ancient Greek philosophers that discuss what it means to say that two things are the “same”.\nI then provide some theoretical background explaining the difference between inherent and accidental complexity.\nI will go on to show how when we get our CVA wrong, we move from complicated to complex adding accidental complexity that can otherwise be avoided.\nThat will be followed by some real world examples both positive and negative that show how accidental complexity can be reduced by applying proper CVA techniques.\n\nAvraham is a lead architect in Synamedia in Jerusalem Israel. He learns and teaches about how people join to create software."
