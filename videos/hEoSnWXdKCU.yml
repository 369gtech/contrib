This talk will go through how virtual-kubelet’s provider framework was designed with built-in flexibility for supporting various compute types for your pods. This talk will also go through why Elotl chose virtual-kubelet for delivering Nodeless Kubernetes and how Elotl’s KIP provider was designed to work with virtual-kubelet. We will walk through uses cases of virtual-kubelet + KIP including a demo of cloud bursting using virtual-kubelet + KIP! \n\nhttps://sched.co/cpAh"
