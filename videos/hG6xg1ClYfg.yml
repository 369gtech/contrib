description: "Introduction to the BASIC Engine A low-cost single-board home computer programmable in BASIC that can be built at home for under 10 Euros\nby Ulrich Hecht\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/K.4.601/basic_engine.webm\n\n\nThis talk introduces the BASIC Engine, a very low-cost single-board home computer with advanced 2D color graphics and sound capabilities, roughly comparable to late-1980s or early-1990s computers and video game consoles. It can be built at home without special skills or tools and using readily available components for under 10 Euros in parts, or mass-produced for even less. \n\nRoom: K.4.601\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 13:00:00+01"
