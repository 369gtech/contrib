description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nFrom Infrastructure Bro to Hacker Chick: A Cloud Native Journey - Kris Nóva, Independent \n\nHer first commit to Kubernetes was made under a name she no longer uses, by a person who no longer exists. Until now she has done her best to keep this information a secret, and lives full time as a well known transgender engineer.  In this talk she publicly reveals the commit log for the first time, and tells her unique story about her personal journey with cloud native technologies. The fact that she has experienced cloud native from both sides of the gender spectrum gives her unique insight into the tooling, and more importantly the processes in place for contributing.  She draws striking parallels with her personal epiphanies in her career, with the maturity of the cloud native ecosystem by using three simple words: shame, adoption, victory.  The talk explores the three lessons in detail from the perspective of a veteran cloud native engineer. She hopes to inspire all.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zen9"
