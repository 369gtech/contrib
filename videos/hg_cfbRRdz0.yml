description: "Please note that this presentation is in Swedish.\n\nThe fact that Clojure is a dialect of Lisp makes it feel completely alien to Java developers, and they miss the opportunity to learn this dynamic and functional programming language for the JVM. Clojure?s focus on immutability makes it very useful for concurrency. This presentation introduces Clojure in a way that feels natural to Java developers. By\nseeing how well Clojure interoperates with Java, you will learn how to take advantage of this wonderful language and still use all the frameworks and features of the JVM."
