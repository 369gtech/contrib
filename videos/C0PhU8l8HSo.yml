description: "Data / Integration Track\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/spring-developers-guide-to-social-integration\nThere's an internet full of services ready to be plugged into your Spring applications. These services offer a wealth of information about the users of your application, including information about their interests, places they travel to and visit, their friends, family, and colleagues, and even what temperature they like to keep in their home. All you need to do is tap into it.\n\nIn this session, you'll see how to use Spring Social, Spring Boot, and Spring Integration to expand the reach of your application to those services, effectively injecting your app into their social graph."
