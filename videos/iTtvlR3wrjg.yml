description: "This session examines approaches to multitenancy, isolation, and elasticity for Java applications and looks at how various strategies have been used to deliver these capabilities. It also examines the pros and cons of these different strategies. The current approaches raise important issues for hosting Java at scale, and the presentation considers the implications of these issues. Then it examines the future of Java and the JVM and reviews various solutions. This session is a must for those hosting Java in any large-scale environment.\n\n\nAuthor:\nNigel Daniels\nNigel Daniels is a software design, development and delivery expert, with many years in the software development industry behind him.
