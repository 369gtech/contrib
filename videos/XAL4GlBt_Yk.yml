language: English
recordingDate: 1635890382
description: 'Daniela has a degree in electrical engineering and has been working for more than 30 years in small innovative companies in the field of software and hardware development. She has spent her youth with exploring the very first microprocessors since the late 70''s, and has been creating software professionally for 40 years now. After a long time using many different programming languages, C++ has now been the exclusive workhorse throughout the last two decades. With great pleasure Daniela is now also a member of the ISO C++ committee. For the better part of her career, the domain was applied digital signal processing (medicine, metrology, reconnaissance), but during the last decade the focus shifted onto special engineering in the field of industrial non-destructive testing of semi-finished and finished steel products using ultrasound. Besides that, she loves to relax with hard metal and soft cheese, hot curries and cool jazz.'
