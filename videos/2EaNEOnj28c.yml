description: "Mohit Suley talks about availability, but from the customer perspective. How does one see the impact of an ISP going down in a different area?\n\nNo User Left Behind: Making Sure Customers Reach Your Service\n\nMohit Suley, Software Engineer, Live Site Engineering team, Bing\n\nCan you detect users behind a single ISP, in a single city, losing access to your service because of a network configuration error? If a low-tier ISP in Brazil blocked you accidentally, affecting a few thousand customers, how will you find out before customers switch? This talk will define the concept of reachability, show ways to detect globally minuscule but customer-affecting outages across geographies and ISPs, and provide practical examples of how you can extend the definition of availability to include your users, not just the systems you built.\n\nView the full LISA16 Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa16/conference-program"
