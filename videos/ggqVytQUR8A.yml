title: 'Andrea Mocci: Beautiful Design, Beautiful Coding @ I T.A.K.E. Unconference 2015'
recordingDate: 1436364055
description: "Andrea Mocci is a postdoctoral researcher of the REVEAL Group, headed by Prof. Michele Lanza, at University of Lugano. He is Alma Mater is Politecnico di Milano in Italy, where he got a B.Eng. and M.Eng. in Computer Science, and a PhD on Software Engineering advised by Prof. Carlo Ghezzi. Before coming to Lugano, he has been a Postdoctoral Fellow and Associate at the MIT CSAIL, and a visiting researcher at National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo.\n\nSoftware quality is a multi-faceted concept, encompassing multiple dimensions, from coding style to correctness and design.\n\nThe talk focuses on two specific aspects that are part of active research. First, he presents methods to assess the design of a software system, and identify the parts that are messy, complicated and ugly. Second, he discusses the process of constructing and evolving software through the IDE, in terms of how developers read, write and understand code, and how such activities can be improved. He presents both the state of the art and the ongoing research in these areas, with particular emphasis on the efforts and the vision of our group.\n\nCheck out more about I T.A.K.E.
