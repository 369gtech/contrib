description: "Panel: Cloud Foundry – A Kubernetes Serving Kitchen - Bernd Krannich, SAP SE; Dieu Cao, VMWare; Jeff Hobbs, SUSE; Simon Moser, IBM; and Moderated by Daniel Jones, EngineerBetter \n\nFor more info: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/ \n\nThe re-platforming of Cloud Foundry onto Kubernetes is in full swing. Eirini, Quarks, kubecf, cf-for-k8s are all projects in that space, addressing different aspects of a Cloud Foundry to Kubernetes integration. In the latest sequel to earlier panel discussions during Cloud Foundry summits (e.g. “Cloud Foundry Test Kitchen” – https://youtu.be/v9aUSiZn6-Y), representatives of major companies in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem will talk about their view on the status quo, what’s ahead in terms of development in Cloud Foundry components, how the above-mentioned projects relate and what the move to Kubernetes as a basis means for consumers of the Cloud Foundry platform."
