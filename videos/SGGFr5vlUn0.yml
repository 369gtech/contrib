description: "Hi! My name is Vadim and my presentation will cover a rather young but very promising Continuous Delivery platform named Drone. I will also share some experience of using the platform in our company. The project has already outranked Jenkins on GitHub and is currently under active development. The main features of the platform, that are available out-of-the-box include the following:\n\n* Each build step is completely isolated and is executed in a separate Docker container;\n* Pipeline as a code approach (no need to install dependencies and configure CI-server manually);\n* Language-agnostic plugins to extend the platform functionality."
