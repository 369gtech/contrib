recordingDate: 1534940018
description: "There are a couple of definitions out there for what serverless is or isn't. One of them being as stateless compute containers that only last for one invocation. This is more known as Functions as a service, or FaaS. In this session, I will give a gentle introduction to Serverless and FaaS, what it means for developers and why it is important to understand this paradigm. I will then tune in to solutions available for developing serverless applications, or functions, using Java. \nThe session will be a mix of slides and live code demoes.\n\nIvar Grimstad is a Java Champion, Oracle Developer Champion and JUG Leader working as Principal Consultant for Cybercom Group in Sweden.\nHe is the PMC Lead for Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J) and involved in the forming of Jakarta EE.
