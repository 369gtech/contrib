recordingDate: 1523471118
description: "Open Source Software in government has grown since the\_rollout of the 2003 Department of Defense memo on Open Source use.\n\nGovernment employees have pushed for the ability to evaluate and choose open source software, especially Drupal. But what you probably didn't know, is that a group of women have been at that bleeding edge of adoption while staying mostly under the radar. Who are these women? They're some of the women behind Drupal4Gov.\n\nThis session will provide attendees a glimpse of the work each speaker has contributed to moving government sites and applications to Drupal. Information presented will discuss:\n\nhow we were successful\_\nwhere we failed\nlessons we learned along the way and\nwhat we're doing now to improve Gov't employee and contractor access to Drupal and other open source software projects"
