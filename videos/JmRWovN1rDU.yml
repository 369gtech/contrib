description: 'CSS Custom Properties are added to all the major browsers and provide the ability to use the CSS native variables power which is a huge step to the future of CSS. Now is time to do the next one- to have an ability to register the new CSS Custom properties from JavaScript, which should be performant as the native CSS properties, animatable and aligned CSSOM. CSS Houdini spec allows to do it, set the valid property values and many other things. This brings CSS to the next level and is one of the important steps to the bright CSS future.'
