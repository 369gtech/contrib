title: 'Improving Reliability w/ Error Budgets & SRE - Liz Fong-Jones | #LeadDevNewYork'
language: English
recordingDate: 1526914385
description: "Reliability is a critical feature of most software, and maintenance rather than initial development predominates the cost of software. Yet, a large number of development teams treat operations as an afterthought instead of integrating operations into their development processes.\n\nError budgets and Site Reliability Engineering practices can improve the reliability, maintainability, and, yes, feature velocity, of products. This talk is an introduction to the basics of bringing SRE practices into your organization -- who to hire, how to organize, what projects to work on, how to measure reliability, and how to assess reliability risks."
