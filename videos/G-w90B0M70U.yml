description: "Most applications use third party services. Access to those services are possible thought some secrets and keys. Lets store those secrets in a Vault instead of hardcoding them in our software. Vault is a free product made by HashiCorp that makes it easy to store, read and share your secrets with other members of your team and machines. It stores already encrypted data, it has many different ways to authenticate, including github, and on top of it all, it logs everything.\n\nStjepan Hadjić (Infinum)\nHe was born and raised in Zagreb, Croatia. He is writing ruby code for the last 5 years. He runs Rails team as a Team Lead in Infinum. He mentors a bunch of ruby juniors, contributes and maintains opensource projects, talks at a local ruby meetup, and was a lecturer of Infinum Student Academy. Currently dipping his toes in elixir waters."
