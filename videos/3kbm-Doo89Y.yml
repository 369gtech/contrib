recordingDate: 1495485181
description: 'Every textbook that has a time series chapter mentions ARIMA so it became a goto model for forecasting. But in real world it struggles with missing data, public holidays, non-stationarity, several steps ahead predictions. Anton will show better alternatives to ARIMA for long term forecasting.'
