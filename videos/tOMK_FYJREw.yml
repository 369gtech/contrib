title: 'RxJava: Reactive Extensions in Scala'
recordingDate: 1383242715
description: "RxJava is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for the Java VM that supports Java 6+, Clojure, Scala, Groovy, JRuby, and Java 8 lambdas.\n\nThe Netflix API uses RxJava. So Ben Christensen and Matt Jacobs, of their Edge Surfaces Team, stopped by SF Scala to tell you all about it. They explain what they've done to bring it to the JVM, with Scala, and how they've used RxJava to implement highly concurrent web services against asynchronous data sources without blocking, synchronizations or thread-safety concerns by using declarative functional reactive composition.\n\nFind out what RxJava is all about with these real-world examples from Netflix's innovative API.\n\nFollow along with Ben and Matt's slides: http://crcl.to/iecz1\n\nMore free Scala resources: http://crcl.to/gsv09\nProfessional Scala training: http://crcl.to/am89d\n\nInformation on SF Scala: http://www.meetup.com/SF-Scala/"
