description: "While it's accepted to use ZooKeeper to manage databases clusters, it's a bit less common to use it for applications cluster. And quite frankly we think it's extremely sad as ZooKeeper saved us on certain business use cases. We will explain how we used it to spread out data processing in realtime on an application cluster with automatic scalability.\n\nIn other words, how do you assign a fraction of the data to each instance of your application in realtime when the number of instances can vary at any time. We will show you how we managed this for the monitoring and alerting of all the applications running on Clever Cloud, our public Platform as a Service."
