description: "Welcome to something new, ON THAT. It's the virtual side of THAT Conference. Over the past year, we've worked pretty hard on THAT.us to do this virtual thing differently. Why? Simply put, cause it is different, and we should respect that. \n\nJoin me as we talk about that.us and how to get the most out of it. How to get involved, augment the schedule, and get involved after the fact."
