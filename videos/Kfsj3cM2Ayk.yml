description: "Building Scalable Orchestration: Lessons Learnt\n\nJasnoor Gill, Principal Product Manager, Nutanix\n\nThis session will share the challenges faced and lessons learnt in solving large-scale IT orchestration problems. It will hopefully provide best patterns and lessons so people solving similar problems donâ€™t make the same mistakes.\n\nWe will cover the evolution from a monolithic model to asynchronous microservices over 4 generations of an orchestration engine, what real-life problems were solved and the challenges that we encountered.\n\nThis orchestration engine has been in production for over 6 years across multiple BFSI, SIs and other enterprises in Asia-Pac, including one of the world's largest stock exchanges. The company and team behind this technology were acquired by Nutanix in 2016.\n\nDOES17 London\nDevOps Enterprise Summit\nhttps://events.itrevolution.com/eur/"
