description: "Panellists: \nYenny Cheung (Engineering Manager, Yelp)\nDaiany Palacios (DevOps Analyst/Engineer, Kuehne + Nagel)\nDominika Rogala (Engineering Manager, Vector Technologies)\nAmir Safavi (Software Engineer, Google)\n\nEstimating projects is hard. Whether it's negotiating technical debt, understanding new requirements, or grappling with a lack of useful documents; the number of moving variables make it difficult to judge just how long a project will really take. \n\nSo how do we reckon with estimations? Do we try to get a deeper understanding of the task, account for overpromising, and try to story map a project? Or are estimations too much hassle for the value they provide?\n\nIn this session weâ€™ll hear from both sides of the estimates/no estimates debate, dive into the problems that are currently apparent, and try to begin a journey to more accurate estimations."
