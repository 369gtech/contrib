description: 'Presented by Andrew Sheppard. GPU supercomputing in finance is about doing things faster than ever before. Trading is already mostly real-time, because it pays to be there first, ahead of the other guy. And even those aspects of finance that are not yet real-time (currently risk and compliance often lag behind trading), they are moving to real-time as well. In fact, the whole world seems to be moving to real-time; finance will simply get there first because the incentives are so great.'
