description: "When Things Go Wrong\n\nLea Kissner\n\nDespite all we do to prevent them, mistakes happen. Weâ€™re fallible humans working with exceedingly complicated systems in a world of users with a dizzying array of different needs. Unsurprisingly but sadly, our systems sometimes end up with vulnerabilities and those vulnerabilities can turn into incidents, hurting people affected by our systems. In this talk we go through the stages of incident handling: finding the cut, stopping the bleeding, and cleaning up the blood. After the incident is over, our work is done: we need to find the root cause and ensure that neither this particular incident nor related ones happen again. We will go through real-world examples of things going wrong and how to make them go right.\n\nView the full PEPR '20 program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr20/conference-program"
