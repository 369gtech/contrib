description: "In this talk we will see the assembly and use of a modified BadUSB keyboard with an integrated DIY physical keylogger.\nUsing a built-in WiFi module, this keyboard is capable of sending user keystrokes to a remote server and storing it in a database.\nBoth the piece by piece assembly, its diagram, and its programming will be demonstrated. Also there will also be a live demo to demonstrate its operation.\n\nThis talk is recommended for both novice and experienced users alike."
