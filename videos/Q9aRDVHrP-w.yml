description: "by Ali Spivak\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2019\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2019/UD2.208/inclusion_includes_you.webm\n\n\nEven the kindest people with the best intentions have blind spots and implicit biases, and these ingrained biases affect the way we work and what we end up working on. Becoming more inclusive will benefit everyone, including you. It’s fairly easy to talk about the things we share - code, open source projects, development tools. It’s much harder to talk about, and overcome, our differences, especially when we’re talking about about our identities and how we relate to, work with, and build things for others. All societies and cultures have some ingrained biases related to age, gender, religion, orientation, ethnicity, and disability. These affect everyone, not just the non-dominant groups, and can negatively impact innovation, productivity, and the users of the things we create and build. In this talk, I’ll walk through some examples of how more inclusion benefits all of us, and give examples of inclusive practices everyone can use. \n\nRoom: UD2.208 (Decroly)\nScheduled start: 2019-02-02 14:40:00+01"
