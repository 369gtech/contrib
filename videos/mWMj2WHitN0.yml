description: 'Workshare have been running on a microservice architecture since three years ago, moving from a monolithic Rails application and constantly adding new feature trough new microservices.. In this speech we will clarify what is such architecture. why you should consider it (or not!), some common antipatterns, some fun facts, and a lot of live demos. We will also be coding our own microservices using NodeJS, starting from a very simple example and moving in three iterations to a more complex one, including a simple self discovery mechanism. Be prepared, there will be code :)'
