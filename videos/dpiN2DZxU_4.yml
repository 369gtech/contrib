title: '"Generating Music From Emotion (and other experiments)" by Hannah Davis'
language: English
recordingDate: 1539227602
description: "The field of generative music is founded on invisible structures - procedural rules, biological behaviors, linguistic systems. Hannah's work explores music generation based on another invisible pattern - emotion. In this talk, she will explain her experiments with translating books into music based on their emotional content, and more recent work on generating music based on the content of video and film. How can we think about emotion as a chronological structure? How can sentiment analysis be used to parse stories? What additional information in non-musical media can be used as a foundation on which to generate a musical story?\n\nSpeaker: Hannah Davis"
