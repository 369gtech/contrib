description: "Speaker: Nir Arad\n\nTesting mobile applications is hard. Testing manually is nearly impossible.\nThatâ€™s where automated testing shines. Just sit back and watch the machine go!\nPython is a very powerful language for writing automated tests, but since Python is not installed on mobile platforms, we need to find a way to remotely control and monitor the device.\nBut how do we automate a device remotely? The answer is Appium.\n\nIn this talk I will go over the process of deploying and testing iOS (or Android) applications, and how to work with Appium to easily generate Python 3 code for testing your application.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2018 and https://github.com/PyCon/2018-slides"
