The exponentially increased online users bring great performance and capacity challenges. In this Session, Chaomeng and Fei will share their technical experience of Kubernetes&Istio in Welink supporting large traffic from large amount of users’ meeting, mailing and other online collaborations.   The talk focus on practice in large scale productive environment with heavy traffic. Includes:  1. Implement a predictive scaling algorithm to improve the scaling efficiency.  2. Propose a more flexible route chain to decouple configuration complexity (ready to contribute to community)  3. Adopt microservice level canary release, non-intrusive monitoring, interface level rate limiting and transparent service security. \n\nhttps://sched.co/cp9m"
