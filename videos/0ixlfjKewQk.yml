title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2021 - Yann Hamdaoui – A tale of Nix and Nickel'
language: English
recordingDate: 1628208840
description: "What do package management and functional programming have in common? More than it seems!\nIn this talk, I will introduce the Nix package manager, which applies principles from functional programming to overcome fundamental challenges of package management. It crucially relies on a functional programming language, also called Nix, of which I will discuss the current state and shortcomings. I will finish presenting our new configuration language Nickel which attempts to solve some of them.\n\nAfter of a Master of Engineering from CentraleSupelec and a Ph.D from IRIF (Université Paris Diderot and CNRS, France) on the translation of effects into Linear Logic, I work at Tweag I/O on the design and implementation of Nickel, a configuration programming language.\n\n\nFor more information on YOW!
