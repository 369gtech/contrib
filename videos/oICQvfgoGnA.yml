description: "Rapid API Prototyping with LoopBack - Erin McKean, IBM   \n\nIn this session, Erin will demonstrate how the open source LoopBack framework can be used to rapidly prototype, and deploy, REST APIs. LoopBack is easy to use and extremely configurable, making it useful in nearly any environment. Erin will demonstrate how to install, start up, and use LoopBack as well as how APIs are defined and customized. Multiple examples will be shown to help the audience see how LoopBack can be used in production.\n\nErin McKean\nIBM\nDeveloper Evangelist\nCal-i-forn-i-a\nTwitter Tweet  Websiteerinmckean.com\nErin McKean loves talking about APIs to anyone who will stand still long enough. Before Node.js, she dabbled in Ruby, HyperCard, Perl, and Omnimark, and still finds herself writing bash scripts on a regular basis. Erin is also the founder of Wordnik.com, which has a lot of fun APIs! In her spare time she sews clothes and makes Twitterbots."
