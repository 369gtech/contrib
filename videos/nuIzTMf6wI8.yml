description: "Users will need to purchase own equiptment before the workshop/challenge is run. (users will attempt to see simulated altitude, battery level, telemetry data from the mock satellite. It will be awesome because, we will expose participants new to the convergence of space and cybersecurity a crawl/beginner experience to gain their interest. It's designed as a workshop. The Convergence of Space & Cybersecurity Innovation.\n\nThe goal of this workshop would be to construct a “CubeSat Simulator Lite https://github.com/alanbjohnston/CubeSatSim/wiki” specifically https://github.com/alanbjohnston/Cub...Simulator-Lite.\n\nWe would run through the installation of the software via a screensharing method. We’d show participants how to setup a Raspberry Pi, set up the device, install the necessary packages, attach a necessary antenna, and view the transmitted data using a software defined radio."
