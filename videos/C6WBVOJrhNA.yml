title: 'YOW! West 2016 Erwin van der Koogh - Look Ma! No Servers!'
recordingDate: 1470815757
description: "Setting up the server infrastructure for an application is tough enough, but the real challenge lies in keeping those servers running. What if we could do away with that headache?!\n\nAmazon Webservices has been building out their platform at a breakneck speed over the past few years. But with the recent introduction and now maturing of AWS Lambda we have the missing piece of the puzzle to get rid of our servers entirely.\n\nIn this talk, I will show how to use API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cloudfront, Simple Queueing Service and Simple Email Service into a coherent whole in a serverless architecture. A pretty awesome whole that is almost infinitely scalable and requires no server maintenance.\n\nErwin is Principal Consultant and Head of Academy at Elabor8 in Melbourne. It is unclear whether Erwin is a technologist who is interested in organisational change or a change agent with a deep love for technology. He is a regular speaker at (inter)national conferences on the intersection of Technology, Business & Complexity.\n\nFor more on YOW! West, visit http://west.yowconference.com.au"
