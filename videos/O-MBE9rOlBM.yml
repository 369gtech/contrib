recordingDate: 1506524328
description: "The Drupal Community Working Group (CWG) is a volunteer group responsible for promoting and upholding the Drupal Code of Conduct and maintaining a friendly and welcoming community for the Drupal project. The group works to help defuse tense situations, mediate and/or arbitrate intractable disputes, and develop tools and resources to promote community health. It also recognizes community leadership through the annual Aaron Winborn Award.\n\nMembers of the CWG will talk about what the group has been up to this past year, how it has been working to improve transparency and better engage with the Drupal community, as well as lessons learned and initiatives the group believes will help improve the health of the community. Following the initial presentation, there will also be a question and answer session.\n\nIf you are someone interested in learning more about the Drupal community and the role that the CWG plays in helping to keep it a friendly and welcoming place for everyone, you should consider attending this session."
