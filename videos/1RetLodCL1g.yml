description: "Docker has transformed the eco-system and highlighted the importance of containers, but containers are just Linux processes, so why do we need Docker?\n\nThis talk will go into the details of what are containers, and more importantly, how do they work. The topics will include:\n\nWhy Containers are not native Linux Kernel feature\nHow to containerised applications without Docker\nHow to build Container Images to match the Open Containers Initiative (OCI) spec\nDeploying Containers without Docker onto Kubernetes using the Container Runtime Interface (CRI)\nAlternative container runtimes including LMCTFY, Clear Containers, CRI-O and Podman\n\nIn the end, attendees will understand the foundations of what goes into making a process be contained and why Docker isn’t the only runtime available for securing processes."
