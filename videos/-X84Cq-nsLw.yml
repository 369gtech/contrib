description: "Talk recording from JSNation Live 2020, the biggest JavaScript conference in the cloud: https://live.jsnation.com\n\n# 1, 2, 3... Fastify!\n\nIn my journey through nodeland, I always wonder about the cost of my abstractions.\n\nI started a journey to write an HTTP framework with extremely low overhead, and Fastify was born. With its ability to reach an astonishing 90k requests/sec, Fastify can halve your cloud server bill.\nIn this talk, I will walk you through the basics of the framework: how to route requests, write tests, and use the plugin system."
