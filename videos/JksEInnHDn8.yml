description: "Sander Hoogendoorn\nditisagile.nl\n\nFaster, smaller, shorter, flatter. The future of software development\n\nThe world is changing fast. \n\nMore precisely, the world is changing at increasing speed. This means things that were not possibly five years ago come into reach. Incumbent organizations need to adopt fast to keep up with new competitors that use new technologies easier, faster and better than they do. \n\nAs a result, every aspect of software changes towards smaller. Even smaller teams or even micro-teams, less management, flatter organizations, even shorter cycles and smaller components. \n\nDuring this energizing and high-paced talk Sander discusses the Cynefin model, shows why software development goes so terribly wrong, how to move beyond Scrum and enterprise agile, why self-organization is not as easy as it looks like, why continuous delivery leads to not doing projects or estimates anymore and why microservices are hard, but essential as underlying foundation. \n\nhttps://codefest.ru/"
