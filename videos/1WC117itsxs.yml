title: 'Exploring Data-Driven, Cognitive Capabilities in Pivotal Cloud Foundry - Kyle Dunn'
language: English
recordingDate: 1519190459
description: "Data is the new gold and PaaS solutions like PCF are an abundant source of this increasingly-important resource. This talk will demonstrate the immense value available from a reference architecture designed for surfacing proactive, cognitive-like capabilities from data in the PCF logging firehose. The tech stack consists of a transactional, in-memory layer coupled to an analytical data warehouse. The result: shorter developer debugging cycles, insights like \"What are the most common Java classes in my stack traces?\", and a dynamic, visual microservice dependency graph. Each of these examples serves to introduce powerful feedback into application and platform lifecycles, improving an organization's productivity and infrastructure resiliency and even security.\n\nKyle Dunn, Data Engineer, Pivotal\nRecorded at SpringOne Platform 2017."
