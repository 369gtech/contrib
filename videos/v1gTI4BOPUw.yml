description: "Rapid Development with Python, Django, and Google App Engine\r\nGuido van Rossum (Google)\r\n\r\nLearn how to create great web applications quickly on Google App Engine using the Django web framework and the Python language. Google App Engine lets you host complete, scalable web applications written in Python with minimal fuss. This tutorial assumes basic familiarity with Python but definitely no advanced Python knowlege; Django experience is optional. You will learn how to use the Django web framework with the datastore API provided by Google App Engine, and how to get the most mileage out of the combination. You will also see how to use Django best practices like unit testing when developing for Google App Engine."
