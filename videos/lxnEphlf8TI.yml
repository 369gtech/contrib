description: "Łukasz Drzewiecki, Witold Bołt (JIT Solutions): Back to the future - legacy software stories\n\nDo you like working on the development of legacy software projects? Tech stack from the 90s, lack of tooling, super slow development cycle, all manual deployment, endless bug fixing… seems familiar? We won’t convince you that you can magically convert \"brown to gold”, but we will tell you how to survive in such environments and do really good stuff for the not-so-fresh, yet very important systems. We will cover refactoring, rearchitecting, DevOps, agile, testing, smart fixing… lots of fun stories and real-world cases.\n\nThe speech was given on 2018-05-23 at infoShare 2018 (Tech Stage) in Gdańsk.\n\nMore info: http://infoshare.pl \nFollow us: https://facebook.com/infosharepl\nhttps://twitter.com/infosharepl\nhttps://instagram.com/infoshare/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/1272775/\nhttps://plus.google.com/+infoshare/"
