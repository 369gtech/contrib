title: 'Cloud Native Engineering Re-imagined by CNAP'
language: English
recordingDate: 1632327216
description: "Today’s technology and business environment are changing so fast that evolution has overtaken adoption. Application development is one such area where we have evolved from silo application codes running on independent servers to adopting PaaS products across organization groups for deploying workloads on the cloud using lightweight containers. \n \n Wipro introduces CNAP (Cloud Native Acceleration Platform) to overcome obstacles like budget, time, and talent availability, as well as shifting workplace dynamics and deliver outcomes at high velocity. \n \n CNAP offers a fully orchestrated cloud native platform that’s cloud-agnostic, is built on native and managed Kubernetes, leverages open-source technologies and Wipro accelerators to provide developers both autonomy and speed. CNAP inherits its core capabilities/values from VMware Tanzu Advanced, along with Wipro’s rich experience as an end-service provider focused on solving customer problems in Kubernetes adoption.\n\nAjay Balasankula, Sr Cloud Architect at Wipro Limited"
