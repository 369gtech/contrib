title: 'Nader Dabit - Cross Platform & Beyond'
recordingDate: 1536920864
description: "React Native was originally built to target only iOS and Android operating systems, but as popularity of react as well as the reactive paradigm grew in popularity and opened other doors to other platforms, projects such as React Primitives and React Native Web began to take shape. We are now also seeing other paradigms in the same space such as ReactXP, Weex, and Flutter begin to take shape. We will dive into each of these platforms and discuss how they work, what their APIs look like, how they differ from the traditional React Native platform, and how the future of cross platform development is evolving.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland."
