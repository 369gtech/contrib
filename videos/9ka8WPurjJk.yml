description: "Google Tech Talk\r\nJune 18, 2010\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPresented by Kit Hodge, Director of the Great Streets Project.\r\n\r\nGreat Streets Vision\r\n\r\nSan Francisco's streets should attract people of all kinds to its network of great places connected by excellent sidewalks, bikeways and public transportation. Streets should be compelling public spaces that build community, the foundation of thriving shopping and welcoming to even the most vulnerable users. They should be balanced, providing multi-modal mobility, with priority given to people on foot, bicycles and public transportation. A successful network of places will return SF's streets to their rightful place as the center of civic life, making SF a great place to live, do business and visit."
