description: "Scala and functional programming can be scary at first for those of us coming from the OOP world. With a bunch of new concepts such as immutability, first-class functions, implicits, and a ton of language features, it is easy to get overwhelmed when jumping into Scala. This session provides a gentle introduction to Scala. You will learn the basics and walk away with a solid foundation to build on and be able to apply what you’ve learned to Java 8’s lambdas.\n\nSpeaker:\nJames Ward, Principal Platform Evangelist, Salesforce.com\nJames Ward (www.jamesward.com) is a Principal Platform Evangelist at Salesforce.com.
