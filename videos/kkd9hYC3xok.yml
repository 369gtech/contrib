title: 'Lee Johnson - OAuth2 is DOne'

description: "A couple of years ago I started down the rabbit hole that is OAuth2 and managed to implement a plugin for Mojolicious. Since then I have abstracted out a lot of the internals and now have a module to support all four OAuth2 flows, which is de-coupled from any specific web framework.\n\nThis talk will cover those four OAuth2 flows, with examples of using the module and plugins to implement an OAuth2 authorization server in your framework of choice.\n\nStrong coffee is advised as a prerequisite to attending this talk.\n\n\nI would call myself a software developer as this has been my primary role for over a decade. I am the maintainer / author of several modules on CPAN and a sporadic attendee / speaker at various conferences.\n\nI have been a contributing photographer to several print and online magazines in the past and am now working on a few long term photographic projects, including one about perl conferences.\n\nOriginally from the United Kingdom, i am currently living in Switzerland."
