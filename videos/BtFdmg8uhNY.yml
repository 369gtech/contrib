description: "For functional programming beginners: How to read type signatures. Also known as: What do all those silly characters mean?\n\nBeing able to read type signatures is an intricate part of functional programming and makes writing, and reading functional programs much easier.\n\nIn this video I make a quick and unstructured but very pragmatic attempt at explaining how to read and think about type signatures.\n\nDo let me know in the comments if you find something confusing and I will try to make a follow up video on those pieces."
