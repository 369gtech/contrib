The background:\n\nChina is in the age of The Great Gatsby, you can find the most ancient browsers and cutting edge silicon valley style startups/cooperation co-exist. \n\nWe can see the overall browser market share, screen resolution, general user behavior and the trend.\n\n2. Zoom in the technology & methodology used:\n\nWe see how big Internet companies like Baidu, Sina, Alibaba use HTML5, JavaScript to fight big wars.\n\nWe see how small startups work to fight the jungle war.\n\n3.
