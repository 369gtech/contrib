description: "We're going to build a music generating neural network trained on jazz songs in Keras. I'll go over the history of algorithmic generation, then we'll walk step by step through the process of how LSTM networks help us generate music.\n\nCoding Challenge for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/How-to-Generate-Music-Demo\n\nVishal's Winning Code:\nhttps://github.com/erilyth/DeepLearning-SirajologyChallenges/tree/master/Art_Generation\n\nMichael's Runner up code:\nhttps://github.com/michalpelka/How-to-Generate-Art-Demo/blob/master/demo.ipynb\n\nMore Learning Resources:\nhttps://medium.com/@shiyan/understanding-lstm-and-its-diagrams-37e2f46f1714#.swstv6z61\nhttp://mourafiq.com/2016/05/15/predicting-sequences-using-rnn-in-tensorflow.html\nhttps://magenta.tensorflow.org/2016/06/10/recurrent-neural-network-generation-tutorial/\nhttp://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rnnrbm.html\nhttps://maraoz.com/2016/02/02/abc-rnn/\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music//cmsip/slides/05-algo-comp.pdf\nhttp://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/algorithmicmusic/\n\nPlease Subscribe!
