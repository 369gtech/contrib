description: "Brian O'Connell, IBM - ChefConf 2017\n\nSports move fast; infrastructure testing has to keep pace. The team responsible for the cloud that powers Wimbledon, The US Open and some of the world's largest sporting events uses Chef to manage their infrastructure. Developing a testing framework presented many challenges, including: Scaling infrastructure testing to handle a distributed enterprise. Testing in remote locations without the fastest internet speeds. Contending with the Great Firewall in China. The team has spent 100s of hours optimizing test environments to support fast testing by distributed teams. Learn how the team approached test optimization, what worked and what failed."
