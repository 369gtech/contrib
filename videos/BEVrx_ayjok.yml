title: 'DrupalCon Baltimore 2017: JavaScript ES6: The best vanilla you’ve ever tasted'
recordingDate: 1493244014
description: "Today’s JavaScript can be a clutter of confusing context and workarounds for a lack of language features, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Imagine if we could demystify the this keyword, squash asynchronous callbacks with ease and include features like modules and classes — all without the dependency of a third party library.\n\nWith ECMAScript 2015 you can do all of the above and a whole lot more!\n\nECMAScript 2015, what we’ll refer to as ES6, solves many of today’s JavaScript issues, and the best part is that you can start using it today! We'll utilize the power of Babel, an ES6 compiler that transforms your code into legacy browser compliant JavaScript.\n\nThis session will serve as an introduction to ES6: how to get started with a compiler and how to solve everyday problems while making your code easier to read and maintain — for others and yourself. If you’re curious about taking the next step in JavaScript development or find yourself wondering what’s behind the walls of jQuery, then this session is for you.\n\nStart enjoying JavaScript — start writing ES6 today!"
