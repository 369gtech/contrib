description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeakers: Stuart Willliams, Daniel Mikusa\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/williams-fastest-servlets-in-the-west\n\n\nApplied Spring Track\n\nThe venerable Servlet Container still has some performance tricks up its sleeve - this talk will demonstrate Apache Tomcat's stability under high load, describe some do's (and some don'ts!), explain how to performance test a Servlet-based application, troubleshoot and tune the container and your application and compare the performance characteristics of the different Tomcat connectors. The presenters will share their combined experience supporting real Tomcat applications for over 20 years and show how a few small changes can make a big, big difference."
