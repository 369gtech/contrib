description: "This episode of Fresh Machine Learning is all about a relatively new concept called a Generative Adversarial Network. A model continuously tries to fool another model, until it can do so with ease. At that point, it can generate novel, authentic looking data! Very exciting stuff.\n\nThe demo code for this video is a set of adversarial Gaussian Distribution Curves in Python using Theano and PyPlot:\n\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/Generative-Adversarial-Network-Demo\n\nI created a Slack channel for us, sign up here:\nhttps://wizards.herokuapp.com/\n\nI introduce two papers in this video\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661v1.pdf\n\nand the associated code:\n\nhttps://github.com/goodfeli/adversarial\n\nGenerative Adversarial Text-to-Image Synthesis:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05396v2.pdf\n\nand it's associated code is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/reedscot/icml2016\n\nAnother really cool repo using GANs:\n\nhttps://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code\n\nGreat explanation of GANs:\n\nhttp://soumith.ch/eyescream/\n\nLive demo of a GAN:\n\nhttp://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/gan/\n\nOne more really great description of generative models:\n\nhttps://openai.com/blog/generative-models/\n\nI love you guys! Thanks for watching my videos, I do it for you. I left my awesome job at Twilio and I'm doing this full time now. \n\nI recently created a Patreon page. If you like my videos, feel free to help support my effort here!:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&u=3191693\n\nMuch more to come so please subscribe, like, and comment.\nFollow me:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sirajraval\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sirajology Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sirajraval/"
