description: "In this talk, Marcus will walk you through some common and uncommon ways you can test your application. Among the things we'll look at are table tests, mocking dependencies, testing HTTP handlers and more. Chances are you'll learn something new, regardless of your previous experience in Go.\n\nMarcus is a software engineer at Bonnier Broadcasting, where he's currently building and operating a streaming platform for video tracking. He's been using Go for the last 4 years (3 years professionally). Nowadays, he also organizes the Go Stockholm meetups and trains aspiring Go developers. On late nights, he draws gophers and impulse buys mechanical keyboards.\n_________________________\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry.
