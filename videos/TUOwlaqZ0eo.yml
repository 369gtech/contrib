description: "speaker: Josh Long\nhttp://twitter.com/starbuxman\n\nHi Spring fans! In this installment of Spring Tips we look at the Spring support for the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API. Spring's support for JDBC is one of many reasons a lot of people first started using Spring 15+ years ago! If you aren't committed to a full-blown ORM and/or want to leverage the full power of JDBC, then this video is for you!"
