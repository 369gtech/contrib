description: "From Strata + Hadoop 2015 NYC: With self-driving cars and delivery drones becoming a reality, it’s clear that data is on a relentless march to conquer industries one-by-one. But some industries have been largely successful in fending off the attack: despite shiny case studies of data use that act as decoy flares, in creative businesses like music, books, and television the most fundamental decisions are still made using gut instinct (or ‘skills and judgment’). Are creative businesses the last battleground for data-driven decision making? Drawing lessons from successes and failures in the music industry, book publishing, and TV, David Boyle will argue for a negotiated settlement in the war between data and creative, and show how long-term and mutually beneficial peace can work.\n\nAbout David Boyle (BBC Worldwide):\nDavid Boyle leads the work of the Insight team at BBC Worldwide, the commercial and global wing of the BBC. His task is to help to transform the relationship that BBC Worldwide has with its audience, by building premium, industry-leading insight capabilities that are understood, valued, and used by the organisation. This includes insight into consumers, BBC brands, and the market; or insight into what connects with audiences emotionally and inspires them. This understanding will help teams to grow by identifying opportunities that will resonate with audiences and drive returns through understanding what consumers want in-market.\n\nDavid has spent the last seven years constructing global insight capabilities for the publishing and music industries, that were widely acknowledged as having helped them make quicker, smarter, and bolder decisions for their brands. He joined BBC from his most recent role as SVP consumer insight at HarperCollins Publishers, where his work allowed the company to better understand consumer behaviour and attitudes towards books, authors, book discovery, and purchase. Prior to that David was at EMI Music, where he delivered insight to all parts of the business in more than 25 countries. He helped to shift the organisation’s decision-making at all levels, from artist signing, to product development and brand development plans for EMI’s biggest artists including The Beatles and Pink Floyd.\n\nWatch more from Strata + Hadoop NYC 2015: https://goo.gl/UunGPH\nVisit our curated data topic page: http://oreilly.com/go/data\nVisit the Strata + Hadoop World website: http://strataconf.com/\nDon't miss an upload!
