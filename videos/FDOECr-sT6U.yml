title: 'KotlinConf 2017 - How to Build a React App in Kotlin by Dave Ford'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510747766
description: "React is a great tool for building web apps. Kotlin is a modern, type-safe language with world-class IDE support. In this talk, I show you how to get the best of both worlds. Having recently ported a React app to Kotlin, I am eager to share my experience with others.\n\nI show you how to use Kotlin's powerful JavaScript interop features (needed to work with React), how to build type-safe React components using Kotlin and how to use Kotlin's DSL capabilities to make React programming more productive.\n\nI also share some of the obstacles I had to overcome and lessons learned along the way.\n\nDave Ford is an independent software developer and trainer working with JVM-based languages and JavaScript since their conception."
