title: 'New! Update on Data Safe target registration'
language: English
recordingDate: 1626894130
description: "One of our biggest projects over the next few months is the migration of Oracle Data Safe to an Oracle Cloud-Native application. This will move the Data Safe console from a stand-alone entity into the wider OCI framework, open dozens of new APIs for customization and integration, and significantly improve the ability of Data Safe to work with other OCI-native services, including the notification service. The first step along that journey began a few weeks ago with the move of database target registration from the legacy Data Safe console into the new OCI framework, and over the next five months you will continue to see functionality migrating to the new framework until, later this year, the legacy console is retired. Join Data Safe Product Manager Bettina Schaeumer for this session covering the new target registration process. Bettina will also discuss the significant advances in automation that the new registration process offers.\n\n\nWe hold two sessions on the second Wednesday of each month, one at 9:00 am US Central time, the other at 18:00 pm US Central time. Content for both sessions is identical, so just pick whichever works best with your schedule."
