description: "I've built an app called NeuralFund that uses Tensorflow 2.0 to make automated investment decisions. I used Tensorflow 2.0 to train a transformer network on time series data that i downloaded using the Yahoo Finance API. Then, I used Tensorflow Serving + Flask to create a simple web app around it. I'll explain what the important parts you should know in Tensorflow 2.0 are, then I'll guide you through my code & thought process of building an AI startup using it.
