description: "Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2014.\nSpeaker: Kenneth Kousen\nG&G Special Topics\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/groovy-vampires\nIf a book as horrible as Twilight can sell millions of copies and be made into an even worse movie, how many copies can a book with Groovy vampires sell? (Spoiler: Not as many.) Yes, this topic may be silly, but the technologies used (Groovy, Ratpack, MongoDB, Grails, REST) are (un)deadly serious."
