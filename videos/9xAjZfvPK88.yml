description: 'The Internet of Things is upon us, and being able to efficiently interconnect things will become increasingly difficult as more of them become available. How can we handle the stampede of connecting devices efficiently? When Ruby failed to live up to the task, we turned to Elixir and Erlang and were astonished by the results. This session will showcase the use of Elixir for a real-world production system. We will walk though the actual code and discuss some of the struggles we faced while learning (enough) Erlang and Elixir to get things up and running. At the end of the presentation, you will have at least a basic understanding of Erlang’s OTP behaviors, realize the importance of restart strategies, and will know what an “Acceptor Pool” is and how we accidentally built one.'
