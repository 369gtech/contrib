title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Tour of the 35 Symfony Components'
recordingDate: 1506507000
description: 'What is Symfony *really*? It''s a collection of *35* independent libraries, and Drupal uses less than *half* of them! That means that there''s a *ton* of other good stuff that you can bring into your project to solve common problems... as long as you know how, and what those components do! In this talk, we''ll have some fun: taking a tour of the Symfony components, how to install them (into Drupal, or anywhere) and how to use some of my *favorite*, lesser-known components. By the end, you''ll have a better appreciation of what Symfony *really* is, and some new tools to use immediately.'
