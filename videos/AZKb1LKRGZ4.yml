title: 'Challenges Designing for Touchless Interaction - Elinor Samuelsson'
recordingDate: 1434640119
description: "What if we could add a layer of social intelligence to interactions that change depending on context of who is present? How might we make digital experiences more human by employing methods of empathetic design? \n\nElinor will shed insight on how to use technology to create meaningful connections that improve the quality of life through a deeper sense of interconnectedness, open innovation and systems thinking. She is currently tackling problems of how to influence the mass market to adopt a technology that is challenging current mental models of individual expression and what it means to deepen the dependency on people and things around you.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
