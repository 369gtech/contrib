description: "Using CF Route Services to Publish, Secure and Monitor APIs - Carlos Eberhart and Ed Anuff, Apigee, Lothar Schubert and Kevin Yang, GE, & Richard Seroter, Pivotal\n\nThe new Route Services in Cloud Foundry 1.7 make it possible to for developers to do any sort of transformation or processing to requests before they reach an application. This new capability was designed with APIs in mind, and makes it easy to add security, authentication, and caching to requests. The Apigee team will walk through their experiences in building one of the first Service Brokers to leverage route services and will discuss how to build and deploy a full-featured API management platform as a route service and illustrate the use of Swagger/Open API to create a range of features such as quota enforcement, spike arrests and content caching. We'll also discuss the performance issues and provide some thoughts on how to best work around them. As part of the session, a case study of GE Predix using Cloud Foundry with Apigee will be presented.\n\nEd Anuff, Apigee\n\nCarlos fell in love with the internet in the early 90s and spent the next 20 years following it around like a puppy. You may remember him from such roles as Robot Code Wrangler for a manufacturing services company, Front-End Web Developer for a pre-bubble dot-com, Mobile App Gunslinger for an engineering consulting firm, or Enterprise Architect for a Fortune 50 retailer. His love finally requited, he now spends his days helping companies large and small learn how to use Apigee's products to build APIs and digital ecosystems.\n\nLothar Schubert\nDeveloper Relations, GE Digital\nIndustrial Internet, IoT, Predix, Developer Evangelism\n\nKevin Yang, GE\n\nRichard Seroter is a Senior Director of Product for Pivotal, a 9-time Microsoft MVP for cloud/integration, an instructor for developer-centric training company Pluralsight, the lead InfoQ.com editor for cloud computing, and author of multiple books on application integration strategies. As a Senior Director of Product at Pivotal, Richard works with customers and partners to realize the full value of the Pivotal platform and transform the way they build software. Richard maintains a regularly updated blog on topics of architecture and solution design and can be found on Twitter as @rseroter."
