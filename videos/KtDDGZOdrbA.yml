This combination allows to control applications at stack level on development machines, while able to use the same stack in integration tests. In this talk we will discuss:\n\n* Use of Docker in CI integration tests\n* Control of stack instead of single docker or app.\n* Version control of development and test environments, easily ddistributed with git and docker tools.\n* Seamless support for running Dockers on Mac and windows."
