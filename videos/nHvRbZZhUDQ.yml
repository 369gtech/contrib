title: 'otplike â€“ Erlang/OTP processes and behaviours for Clojure - Alexey Aristov'
language: English
recordingDate: 1502906482
description: 'core.async is a great library to create asynchronous programs in Clojure. otplike is a library on top of core.async, which implements Erlang/OTP concepts, such as process linking, monitoring, standard behaviours and supervision. We will explain our motivation to create the otplike, and share practical experience of using it in real-life projects. This talk assumes basic understanding of concurrency and core.async.'
