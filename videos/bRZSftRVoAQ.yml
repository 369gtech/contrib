description: "Slides and more info: http://www.codemesh.io/codemesh2015/nicki-watt\n\nBeing able to \"take advantage of cloud computing\" is often cited as a key enabler in helping organisations to innovate fast and providing a platform for rapid expansion. Doing so effectively, in a manner which is secure, and prevents vendor lock-in (being able to move cloud providers as and when required), does however pose some interesting challenges.\nIn this talk I will explore and provide insight into the approaches and considerations required to spin up new isolated, secure environments capable of running in variety of different cloud providers; in a fully automated manner. In true CodeMesh style (promoting \"the right tool for the job\"), I will also dig into the details of some of the newer tools and technologies currently being trialled within a department of the UK government looking to do just this. \nTalk objectives:\n- Understand the challenges posed in bootstrapping new environments across different cloud providers\n- Explore the characteristics of tools which make automating this process easier\n- Dig into some of the new tools actively being used to address these challenges including Terraform (IaaS automation) and Vault (Security)\nTarget audience:\nAnyone interested in exploring some of the latest tools and innovations in the cloud automation space\n\nAbout Nicki\n\nNicki Watt works as a hands on lead consultant at OpenCredo helping organisations embrace, build and discover innovative solutions to their problems.
