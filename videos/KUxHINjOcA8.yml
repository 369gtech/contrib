description: "Filmed at https://2018.dotscale.io on June 1st in Paris. More talks on https://www.dotconferences.com/talks\n\nOur infrastructures generate a lot of metadata. However, true insight comes from the derivative data -- the data that we derive from the metadata. Jeremy gives you tips and strategies for collecting good metadata and how to use that to generate unique and actionable insights about your infrastructure."
