description: "Annie Hsieh, Software Engineer at Square Root - ChefConf 2017\n\nAs a developer, you don't really think you'll ever get deep into Chef code. As an ops person, you're not sure you want developers messing with your infrastructure anyway. Those were mindsets present at our company until about a year ago. With more software being written and deployed as the company grew and our ops team getting closer to burnout dealing with it all, something about our process had to change. The developers and ops team came to a mutual agreement that the developers should join in to learn how to work with our Chef deployment infrastructure. This talk will cover the process taken to get buy in from developers and how we spread the Chef knowledge around. In addition to less pressure on our ops people, this talk will cover additional benefits gained. Then it will conclude with a few pitfalls that you need to be aware of if you want to go through a similar process with your development team."
