title: 'DEMO - Citus 10 brings columnar to Postgres'
language: English
recordingDate: 1615051630
description: "In this Citus open source demo, you‚Äôll learn how to use the Citus 10 Columnar feature for Postgres to achieve 3x-10x compression ratios, reduce IOPs, and deliver faster query responses‚Äîparticularly for data where your Postgres queries can skip unneeded columns.   \n\nCitus is an open source extension to Postgres that transforms Postgres into a distributed database. New as of Citus 10, you can now use columnar storage in Citus, both for single-node Citus as well as for distributed Citus database clusters. With Citus 10, you can also mix and match both columnar and row tables. Using Citus columnar in combination with native Postgres range partitioning features is especially powerful, as you can compress older data that won‚Äôt be changing while still able to update and delete your ‚Äúhot‚Äù tables. \n\nThe Citus 10 Columnar demo covers how to create a columnar table, the type of significant performance and compression improvements you might gain, and how to use Citus columnar in combination with native Postgres range partitioning features. \n\nDemo given by Jeff Davis, a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft and Postgres committer. \n\n \nVideo bookmarks: \n‚ñ∫ 0:32 What is Columnar?  \n‚ñ∫ 2:01 Demo begins \n‚ñ∫ 5:41 What is Postgres range partitioning \n‚ñ∫ 7:05 Columnar with range partitioning demo  \n\nüìå Let‚Äôs connect:  \nTwitter ‚Äì Citus Data, https://twitter.com/citusdata  \nTwitter ‚Äì AzureDBPostgres, https://twitter.com/AzureDBPostgres  \n\nüîî  Subscribe to the Citus monthly technical newsletter: \nhttps://aka.ms/citus-newsletter  \n\n \n‚úÖ  Learn more: \nBlog post about Citus 10 Columnar: https://aka.ms/citus-columnar \nCitus open source GitHub repo: https://github.com/citusdata/citus \nAzure Database for PostgreSQL Blog: https://aka.ms/azure-postgres-blog  \nHyperscale (Citus) on Azure Database for PostgreSQL docs: https://aka.ms/docs-hyperscale-citus-azure  \n\n\n#PostgreSQL #Databases #AzureDBPostgres"
