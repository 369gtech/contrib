description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our next event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in Valencia, Spain from May 17-20. Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nCorrelating Signals in Opentelemetry: Benefits, Stories, and the Road Ahead - Morgan McLean, Splunk & Jaana Dogan, Amazon\n\nOpenTelemetry is used across the industry to capture distributed traces, however this is just a sliver of the value that the project provides. OpenTelemetry also gathers metrics (launched earlier this year) and logs (beta) from your applications and infrastructure, allowing you to capture all telemetry through a single pipeline and powerful analysis in whatever tools you choose! In this session we will discuss: - How OpenTelemetry correlates these signals, which allows your investigations to jump flow seamlessly between all of your services and underlying infrastructure - The deep functionality that OpenTelemetry provides for metrics and logs, including metric formats and aggregations, tailing logs from flat files, and the a high-performance strongly-typed logging pipeline for new applications - Real stories about how large well-known organizations use OpenTelemetry and the improvements that they’ve gained - What’s next for OpenTelemetry: new data sources, signals, and more"
