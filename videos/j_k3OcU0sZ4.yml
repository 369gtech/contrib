description: "You have the goal to migrate your project from AngularJS 1.x to Angular 4. This should be straightforward, except you are realizing that your 3 year old technology stack is totally outdated (Grunt, RequireJS, Bower et al). Furthermore, you are using an older AngularJS 1.x version and your architecture does not conform with the latest 1.x architectural recommendations. At this point things start to look daunting. In this talk we discuss the challenges, experiences and reasons for migrating the Spring Cloud Data Flow Dashboard from using AngularJS 1.x to Angular 4. We also show how we effectively integrate our Angular front-end with Spring Boot.\nYou have the goal to migrate your project from AngularJS 1.x to Angular 4.
