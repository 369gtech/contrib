description: 'Our journey in making the AWS Public Cloud our own playground was a combination of tough days full of disappointments and cool, exciting days unwrapping the box full of AWS services. We worked long and hard to create an Infrastructure as a Code. I will share the most challenging and spectacular moments of this journey from the perspective of DevOps: What really does not work in AWS? What non-standard decisions we had to make to achieve our goals? Why we are proud of making AWS Public Cloud our playground.'
