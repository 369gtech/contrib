description: 'The Belgian startup community has emerged fast. Based on metrics from 1400+ startups across the country, we will cover the strengths and weaknesses of our region and the availability of supporting programs and instruments. With the Startup Manifesto, this startup community has cried out in a most constructive way, shaking up policy makers and influencers across the country. Based on the short-term impact through this "single voice", Belgium is now a pioneering region in Europe when it comes to startup communities and bottom-up policy making.'
