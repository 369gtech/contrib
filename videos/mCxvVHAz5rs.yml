description: "This interactive session is a crash course in team development for the messy modern world. Too many leaders and organizations rely on outdated approaches to leadership which are as ancient as the factory shop floors they were designed for. Instead of clinging onto to these archaic ways of working we need a new playbook for the complex, uncertain and fast-changing digital landscape of today. This session will give an introduction to principles and methods you can use to build happier and more effective teams. Get inspiration for new ways of thinking and working, reflect on how your team is functioning and identify specific areas where you and your team can improve. Alex Neuman and Max Larcombe work with 21st-century learning and organizational development at Hyper Island. They have worked extensively with process design, leadership and team development. Alex was product lead on the Hyper Island Toolbox. Max previously led Master’s education and is currently Head of Online Courses.\n\nConnect with us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/oredev\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/oredev\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/oredev\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/oredev"
