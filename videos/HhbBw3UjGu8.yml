His commitment to helping us to reclaim our inborn personal wisdom, integrated with the scientific knowledge and techniques of modern medicine, has allowed him to unite seemingly disparate fields of knowledge and experience. Dr. Miller brings us a deeper understanding of how the mind and body can work in harmony to produce healing, balance and wellness.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Dr. Emmett Miller\r\nwww.drmiller.com"
