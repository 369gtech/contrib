title: 'SREcon20 Americas - Off the Beaten Path: Moving Observability Focus from Your Service'

description: "Off the Beaten Path: Moving Observability Focus from Your Service, to Your Customer\n\nMohit Suley, Microsoft\n\nObservability systems are usually designed to answer two broad questions - 'Is my service doing OK?', and - 'Is my business doing OK?'. There is a third perspective that often doesn't get enough attention (unless it's clearly linked to the first two) - 'Is my Customer Experience OK?'. It is fair to say that there's never a clear metric for this question.\n\nThis talk explains our motivation for stepping out of our metrics-centered 'comfort zone' and the journey that ensued: developing a habit of engaging face-to-face with some of our customers; figuring out ways to experience what they did; open-sourcing a high-scale tool to capture this data; setting up broader direct-to-team channels of communication from customers; and, re-thinking performance metrics.\n\nIf you are curious about why being a Customer Advocate makes you a better SRE, this talk is for you.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
