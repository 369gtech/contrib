description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nTutorial: From Notebook to Kubeflow Pipelines: An End-to-End Data Science Workflow - Michelle Casbon, Google, Stefano Fioravanzo, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, & Ilias Katsakioris, Arrikto (Limited Available Seating; First-Come, First-Served Basis)  \n\n Please bring your laptop fully charged as we will have limited charging stations available in the room.   This session targets data scientists and ML engineers who want to leverage Kubernetes to scale up their Machine Learning experiments. Attendees will learn a) the basics of Kubeflow, the ML toolkit for K8s, and b) how to build and deploy complex data science pipelines on-prem and on the Cloud with Kubeflow Pipelines.  The tutorial will focus on two essential aspects: 1. Low barrier to entry: deploy a Jupyter Notebook to Kubeflow Pipelines on the cloud using a fully GUI-based approach. This workflow enables data scientists to exploit the scaling potential of K8s - no CLI commands, SDKs, or K8s knowledge required. 2. Reproducibility: automatic data versioning and volume snapshots will enable full reproducibility and collaborative development, as well as fine grained analysis and visualizations after pipeline executions.  Setup: must bring own laptop. Qwiklab/GCP credits will be provided \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uaeq"
