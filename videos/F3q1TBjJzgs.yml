description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2020. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nVenky Ganti - Founder and CEO of Mesh Dynamics\nRahul Lahiri - Founder and Head of Product at Mesh Dynamics\n\nABSTRACT\nEngineering teams spend significant effort on creating automated regression tests, and still cannot often go beyond “happy path” testing. Consumer technology companies therefore invested in testing in production. Unfortunately, these approaches do not apply for enterprise applications because a) their users cannot tolerate errors and b) they usually do not have as much user traffic.\nIn this talk, we show how “Testing in Production” can be shifted left for enterprise applications and thus enable engineering teams to achieve high velocity without having to worry about regressions [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:39 Current trends\n01:11 Typical testing goals\n02:00 Current testing approaches\n03:14 Newer approaches\n06:17 Reconciling state mismatch: options\n09:57 Testing in near-production\n11:53 Demo\n19:43 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2020/sessions/1439/high-velocity-development-of-microservices\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Microservices #APIs #Backend #CI #TestingInProduction #Programming #DevOps\_#MeshDynamics\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
