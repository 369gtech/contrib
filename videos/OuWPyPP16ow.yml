description: "9 Years of Failure: How Racing Crappy Cars Made Me a Better SRE\n\nRyan Doherty, LinkedIn\n\nRacing crapcans ($500 cars) is a lot like being a SRE. Build a reliable system, monitor it, go oncall, and complain about how everything is broken all the time. Learn what racing crapcans is like and the lessons I've learned over 9 years of mechanical, personal and team failures that apply to being a SRE. Lots of anecdotes of racing incidents, pictures of cars in various states of rapid unscheduled disassembly and occasionally photos of cars racing.\n\nView the full SREcon20 Americas program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americas/program"
