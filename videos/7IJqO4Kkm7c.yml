description: "Talk recording from Amsterdam JSNation 2019 Conference: https://jsnation.com\n\n# Stop the Software Apocalypse with Functional Programming\n\nWith the rise of software-based innovation, the business rules and flow controls are getting more complex. Software engineers do not only have to handle increasingly complicated problems, but they also carry greater responsibility for ensuring the quality of their code. \n\nIt’s clear that our tools and methods should evolve to build robust software. In this talk, we’ll explore how to leverage functional programming techniques to reduce the complexity and write safer JavaScript in a real-world scenario. Come to see what’s exciting about static analysis, pure functions, composition and immutability; and how these principles are a powerful tool to optimize your code for correctness."
