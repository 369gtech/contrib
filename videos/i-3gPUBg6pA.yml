title: 'microXchg 2018 - Start Your Engines: White Box Monitoring for Your Load Tests - Alexander Schwartz'
language: English
recordingDate: 1523086603
description: "You think monitoring is only for production? Wrong: Add a metrics endpoint to your application to get insights during your load tests - and use them for free to monitor production!\n\nThis talk shows how to setup up the load testing tools JMeter and Gatling to push their metrics to Prometheus. It also makes the case to expose metrics as part of core application development instead of treating them as a small add-on before go-live.\n\nBy providing end-to-end examples, this talk enables developers of Vert.x and Spring based Java applications to make their application ready for production with Prometheus and Grafana.\n\nThis talk also contains a lessons learned for this approach what worked well and what to watch out for."
