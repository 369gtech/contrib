description: "DevConf - The Software Craftsmen Festival for Sharing Knowledge and Inspiration (https://devconf.pl/)\n\nMost of developers work on web, mobile or desktop applications, but in today's world software is everywhere - also in aeroplanes, space shuttles, medical equipment or nuclear power plants. How software development in these fields differs from everyday applications? How developer's work looks like when he must comply with restrictive regulations? During my talk I will answer these questions using my experience in the field and references to normative documents. I will also analyse some software errors causing loss of human life and destroying equipment worth millions of dollars. I hope that this presentation will be useful to every developer and will help you to create safer and more reliable software."
