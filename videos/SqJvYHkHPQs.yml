description: "The talk from .NET Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://bit.ly/2D8W3VH\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/dotNETFest/\nWebsite: http://dotnetfest.com/\n\nThe .NET Garbage Collector (GC) is really cool. It helps providing our applications with virtually unlimited memory, so we can focus on writing code instead of manually freeing up memory. But how does .NET manage that memory? What are hidden allocations? Are strings evil? It still matters to understand when and where memory is allocated. In this talk, we’ll go over the base concepts of .NET memory management and explore how .NET helps us and how we can help .NET – making our apps better. Expect profiling, Intermediate Language (IL), ClrMD and more!"
