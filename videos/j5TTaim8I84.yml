title: 'Integrating microservices by accepting the data dichotomy (Damien Gasparina)'

description: "When building a microservices-based systems, we don’t generally think too much about data. If we need data from another service, we ask for it. This pattern works well for whole swathes of use cases, particularly ones where datasets are small and requirements are simple. But real business services have to join and operate on datasets from many different sources and this can be slow and cumbersome in practice.\n\nThese problems stem from an underlying dichotomy. Data systems are built to make data as accessible as possible - a mindset that focuses on getting the job done. Services, instead, focus on encapsulation - a mindset that allows independence and autonomy as we evolve and grow. But these two forces inevitably compete in most serious service-based architectures.\n\nUnderstanding and accepting this dichotomy is an important part of designing service-based systems at any significant scale. In this talk, we will explain how to make use of a shared, immutable sequence of records to balance data that sits inside their services with data that is shared, an approach that allows the likes of Uber, Netflix, and LinkedIn to scale to millions of events per second.\n\nVoxxed Days Microservices 2018: 2 days conference (+1 optional workshops day) only on Microservices. \n\nFollow us on :\nWebsite : https://voxxeddays.com/microservices (bit.ly/vxdmicro)\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/vxdmicroservice\nLinkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/voxxed-days-microservices-906115164\nKeep in touch : https://t.co/pxf7cHZOpl\n\n#developers #conference #microservices"
