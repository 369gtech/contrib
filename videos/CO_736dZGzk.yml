title: 'They Do It With Mirrors â€“ Java Process Memory in Microservices environment by Gayathri Thiyagarajan'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495025846
description: "Microservices have been a buzz word for pretty much the past few years. With Microservices, it goes without saying that the supporting infrastructure is as important if not more than the actual application itself. Effective memory management has traditionally been a major challenge in any application. More so in the case of Microservices since there are many moving parts having different levels of appetite for memory. It is important to have an overall view of how memory is consumed by these individual units and how we can effectively distribute and manage them. This talk explores the potential pitfalls and solutions to distributing memory across distributed systems.\n\nGayathri Thiyagarajan\nA software engineer with 10 years experience in Java development. I have been working on designing and developing microservices for the past 2 years. I am passionate about domain driven design and architecture."
