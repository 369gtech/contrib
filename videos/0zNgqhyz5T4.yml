Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects\n\nFrom Microbenchmarks to HTTP2 Load-testing: 5 Performance Tools and Techniques to Improve Envoy Scalability - Joshua Marantz, Google & Otto van der Schaaf, We-Amp B.V. \n\nAs Envoy scales with traffic growth, service complexity, and processor-count, to achieve our performance goals we need an increasing array of tools. We need tools to help visualize latency, throughput, memory, CPU-load, and thread contention.\n\nSome of these tools already exist, such as kcachegrind and Google’s performance benchmarking library. Others needed to be built, such as a new OSS L7 load-tester based on the Envoy networking stack, that is capable of driving HTTP2 traffic through proxies.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss these tools and how we’ve applied them to find and fix bottlenecks in Envoy, and help us make decisions about how to improve the system and its usage."
