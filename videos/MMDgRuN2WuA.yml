description: "Towards decentralized alternatives for code collaboration Building Radicle, a peer-to-peer network for code collaboration\nby Alexis Sellier (cloudhead)\n\nAt: FOSDEM 2020\nhttps://video.fosdem.org/2020/H.2215/radicle_code_collaboration.webm\n\nThis talk will walk the audience through radicle, a peer-to-peer protocol for code collaboration. It will touch on the design approach of the radicle stack and outline the project's challenges.\nRadicle is being built to provide a convenient collaboration workflow without intermedaries or central servers. Issues, patches and code review items can be shared seamlessly between peers and interacted with on the user's machine, just like one interacts with a git repository.\n\n\nDesigned around peer-to-peer networking, it offers a new design space for bazaar-style development. Login systems are replaced by public key cryptography, hosted issue trackers are replaced by local peer replication, and the idea of a single canonical upstream is replaced by a peer-to-peer model familiar to the open source hackers of the 90s and early 2000s—updated with a new protocol for open &amp; trusted peer collaboration.\n\nRoom: H.2215 (Ferrer)\nScheduled start: 2020-02-02 13:20:00"
