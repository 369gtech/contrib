title: 'Rapid Development of Big Data applications using Spring for Hadoop (Zenyk Matchyshyn, Ukraine)'
recordingDate: 1406702022
description: "Spring for Apache Hadoop provides a collection of extensions and wrappers which make real-life project development using Hadoop technologies much easier, just like it has done for J2EE. Moreover, it doesn’t force you to dramatically change the way you develop applications – you still work with Java stack. In my presentation I’ll describe how we used Spring for Apache Hadoop to speed up and simplify development of business features using Big Data technologies. Main focus:\n - High level APIs for different aspects\n - Modularity & Testability\n - Integration with Spring Batch and other Spring projects\n - Scripting\n - Extensibility & Caveats"
