description: "Check out https://g.co/aiexperiments to learn more.\n\nThis experiment lets you make music through machine learning. A neural network was trained on many examples and it learns about musical concepts, building a map of notes and timings. You just play a few notes, and see how the neural net responds. http://g.co/aiexperiments\n\nBuilt by Yotam Mann with friends on the Magenta and Creative Lab teams at Google. It uses Tone.js and open-source tools from the Magenta project.\n\nMore resources:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/magenta\nhttps://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js"
