description: "Despite all of the “Spring versus Java EE” arguments, the two technologies are actually very cohesive. This session takes a look at the Java EE libraries that are used by Spring Boot and shows you how you can deploy a Spring Boot application into a Java EE server. It shows you how you can use Java EE technologies (such as JPA and JMS) in ways you might not have seen before and discusses how standard annotations can work with Spring. The session doesn’t rehash any of the old debates. It just includes a lot of live coding and cool technologies.\n\nSpeaker:\nPhillip Webb, Software Engineer, Pivotal\nPhil Webb is a Spring Framework committer and co-lead of the Spring Boot project. Originally from the UK, Phil currently lives in San Francisco where he’s employed by Pivotal to work 100% on Open Source."
