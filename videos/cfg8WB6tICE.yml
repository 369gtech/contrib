description: "Never been to an FITC event? We'd like to change that. Just email us at neverbeen@fitc.ca for a VERY special offer!\n\nDrawing from her work at the intersection of food, experience design and technology, Emilie will explore how the senses can inspire new creativity in interaction design, human behavior and user experience. This talk will take you through a collection of her projects over the past 8 years, including Wonka-esque inventions like the Cotton Candy Theremin and the Lickestra (the worldâ€™s first lickable ice cream orchestra!). Emilie will show you why a combination of technology, the senses and choreography is more important than ever, as well as reveal why our inner child is the secret to creativity.\n\nEmilie Baltz\nFood Technologist, Artist, Experience Designer\nhttps://twitter.com/emiliebaltz\nhttps://www.instagram.com/emiliebaltz/\n\nCheck out all our events\nhttp://fitc.ca\nhttps://twitter.com/fitc"
