title: 'Introduction to C++ Template Metaprogramming - Sasha Goldshtein'
recordingDate: 1470647307
description: "technique in modern C++. First, TMP can be used as a precursor to C++17 Concepts, in order to check constraints and produce clear error messages when a template parameter doesn't adhere to its specified constraints. Second, TMP can be used to pick an algorithm implementation based on the template type provided -- thus enabling optimizations for specific types.\nFinally, TMP can be used to introspect C++ types at compile-time and generate compile-time constructs that save time or enable fully-compile-time computation. In this talk, we will review a collection of techniques and examples for using TMP in your libraries and application code. You are expected to understand basic template syntax and template specialisation, and we will build the rest as we go along."
