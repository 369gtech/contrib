recordingDate: 1557111000
description: "\"Speaker: Lynn Root\n\nEveryone’s talking about it. Everyone’s using it. But most likely, they’re doing it wrong, just like we did.\n\nBy building a simplified chaos monkey service, we will walk through how to create a good foundation for an asyncio-based service, including graceful shutdowns, proper exception handling, and testing asynchronous code. We’ll get into the hairier topics as well, covering topics like working with synchronous code, debugging and profiling, and working with threaded code. We’ll learn how to approach asynchronous and concurrent programming with Python’s `asyncio` library, take away some best practices, and learn what pitfalls to avoid.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2019 and https://github.com/PyCon/2019-slides\""
