description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nDiscussion & Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2019\n—\nThis talk will present how a so-called C++ zero-cost abstraction can prevent an optimizing modern compiler to vectorize a trivial loop.\nIt will be used as a pretext to present some of Clang and LLVM internals, so that the root cause of this missing optimisation can be found, fixed and/or reported back to the\ncompiler developers.\n\nThe overall goal is to give more insight to C++ developers about what's going on with their compilers!\n— \nAdrien Guinet\nQuarkslab\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
