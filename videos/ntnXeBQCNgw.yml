description: "The talk from JS Fest conference 2019 Autumn\nin Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: will be added soon\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/JSFestua/\nWebsite: https://jsfest.com.ua\n\n\nEver wondered how to implement an editor in the browser? Like a rich text editor, or an IDE, a something like dropbox paper or google docs? What about an interface that doesnâ€™t exist yet, something completely, ground-breakingly new?\nJulian has been obsessively working on Zettel, a library to enable users to build the editor of their dreams.\nExpect live coding, demo applications, as well as a deep dive into the challenges of building editors with JavaScript.\nTo get the most out of this talk, some basic knowledge of React and JavaScript is required."
