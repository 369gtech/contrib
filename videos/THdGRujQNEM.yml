description: "In this day and age, where companies disclose security breaches almost daily, protecting users data can become a daunting task. Users tend to use the same credentials across different applications and platforms. A third party data breach can end up affecting some of your own users. In this session, we will explore the different techniques we use to make data from these breaches yet another tool in our account security toolset. As prevention is never 100%, we take a defense in depth approach when it comes to securing users accounts.\n\nWe will go over:\n(i) how we use this data to prevent users using weak passwords\n(ii) how we correlate this data with other signals to improve efficiency and quality of our detection and protection rules\n(iii) how we leverage users engagement, and upsell them to migrate to a better more secure state\n\nAmine Kamel\nHead of Security, Pinterest\nAmine Kamel is a leading security technologist.
