title: 'Plan a Rocket Launch with Python and Visual Studio Code | Learn with Dr G'
language: English
recordingDate: 1610733615
description: "A lot of factors go into ensuring a successful rocket launch and the entire process has been engineered to be predictable and routine to minimize errors. NASA has developed checklists, countdowns, proceedures and more to ensure consistancy and accuracy. However, the biggest factor in an upcoming rocket launch is something that we, not matter how we try, can't control: the weather. Weather conditions play a huge factor in any rocket launch. In this video, we'll deep dive into the role weather plays in rocket launches and why NASA employs top data scientists to help predict upcoming weather patterns.\n\nThen, join Learn With Dr. G next week where we'll show you how to predict weather patterns yourself, just like a NASA Scientist! \n\nhttps://aka.ms/LaunchDelayswithML-11"
