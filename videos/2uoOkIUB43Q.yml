description: 'Financial institutions, home automation products, and offices near universal cryptographic decoders have increasingly used voice fingerprinting as a method for authentication. Recent advances in machine learning and text-to-speech have shown that synthetic, high-quality audio of subjects can be generated using transcripted speech from the target. Are current techniques for audio generation enough to spoof voice authentication algorithms? We demonstrate, using freely available machine learning models and limited budget, that standard speaker recognition and voice authentication systems are indeed fooled by targeted text-to-speech attacks. We further show a method which reduces data required to perform such an attack, demonstrating that more people are at risk for voice impersonation than previously thought.'
