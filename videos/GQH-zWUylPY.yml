description: "AlphaFold is DeepMind's newly released State of the Art AI system for Protein Folding prediction. I tried it out myself and was able to predict and visualize several protein shapes, so in this episode I'm going to show you step by step how to install and run it on your computer too! And of course explain how it all works along the way. AlphaFold has applications in Health, Sustainability, and Materials Design, and IMHO is the most promising application of AI yet. Protein Folding is a nontrivial problem that has been worked on for decades by billion dollar pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. For DeepMind (an incumbent) to enter into a protein folding competition out of nowhere and win 1st place by out-predicting all of them is a HUGE deal. I really hope that I can convey how amazing AlphaFold is to you and that you're able to test it out yourself. Enjoy! \n\nHit subscribe for more educational videos!
