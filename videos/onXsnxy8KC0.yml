description: 'Natalia Chechina is a Lecturer in Computing in the Department of Computing & Informatics at Bournemouth University. Her research investigates approaches and techniques to enable scaling and efficient performance on commodity hardware where components are loosely coupled, communication is significant, and any of the components may fail or disconnect at any time. Nataliaâ€™s topics of interest include scaling distributed computation, distributed robotics, Erlang, concurrent and parallel programming, stochastic modelling, and autonomous systems.'
