description: "Have you ever confused with Monads? Or you ever faced the complexity of Monads and Compositions? This talk is your pilot in the journey for simplifying monads, create custom monads, monads composition, and transformation of monads using Scala.\n\nKeeping the functional paradigm intact while using complicated monad structure in your code could be quite a tedious task. Especially, when your business logic needs to be structured in a flow, suddenly you realize that your code is moving away from the functional paradigm. Well, definitely Monads composition is the savior in this kind of situations, however, composing them practically is again a cumbersome task.\n\nWe will be jumping into some coding examples in this talk, which would hopefully make you sit back and relax when you face this kind of situation again. We will create custom monads, right usage of monadic operator and resolution of monad composition problems and monads transformation with some real-life scenarios and examples."
