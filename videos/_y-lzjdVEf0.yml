description: "Authentication and Security in gRPC Microservices - Jan Tattermusch, Google \n\nAuthenticating RPCs and securing them properly is crucial for building modern microservices. The talk will walk you through what gRPC has to offer in terms of authenticating and securing RPCs. It will explain the principles behind gRPC secure communication and show various approaches to authenticate your calls. It will also discuss the challenges of each approach. The principles will then be applied to demonstrate authentication in several scenarios in different kinds of deployment (including service-mesh). The examples will be focused on gRPC-based microservices in Kubernetes. \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPbC"
