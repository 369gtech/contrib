description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. \n\nClean Up Your Room! What Does It Mean to Delete Something in K8s - Aaron Alpar, Kasten \n\nWhile issuing a `kubectl delete` and hoping for the best might work for day-to-day operations, having the knowledge of how Kubernetes effects deletes allows you to understand why some objects linger after deletion. This talk will cover how to delete objects, and what kubernetes does to coordinate the delete process. Some specifics of deleting pods, persistent volume claims, deployments and stateful sets will be covered. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ek9i"
