description: "http://flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/beaming-flink-to-the-cloud-netflix/\n\nNetflix is a data driven company and we process over 700 billion streaming events per day with at-least once processing semantics in the cloud. To enable extracting intelligence from this unbounded stream easily we are building Stream Processing as a Service (SPaaS) infrastructure so that the user can focus on extracting value and not have to worry about boilerplate infrastructure and scale. We will share our experience in building a scalable SPaaS using Flink, Apache Beam and Kafka as the foundation layer to process over 1.3 PB of event data without service disruption."
