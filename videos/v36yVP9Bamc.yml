description: "This video was recorded at Code BEAM SF 19 http://bit.ly/2T3Do0U\n\nGet involved in Code Sync's next conference http://bit.ly/2Mcm4aS\n\n---\n\nFIPS 140-2 IN BEAM APPS\nby Drew Varner\n\nTHIS TALK IN THREE WORDS:\nFIPS 140-2\nCrypto\nSecurity\n\nTALK LEVEL: Intermediate\n\nABSTRACT\nErlang's crypto module has supported a \"FIPS mode\" since release 20.0. Drew will discuss why you may care about FIPS 140-2 encryption, ways to integrate it into your tests suites and gotchas to compliance. He will discuss how simply putting crypto in FIPS mode is not enough. Learn how dependencies and built-in libraries can sneak non-FIPS crypto into your application. Drew will also cover some general techniques to detect security issues in your code.\n\nRead the full abstract: https://codesync.global/speaker/drew-varner/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - DREW VARNER\nAn Erlang and Elixir enthusiast trying to bring functional to Federal.
