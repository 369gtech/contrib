description: "With the web slowly maturing as a platform the demand for cryptography in the browser has risen, especially in a post-Snowden era. Many of us have heard about the upcoming Web Cryptography API but at the time of writing there seem to be no good introductions available. We will take a look at the proposed W3C spec and its current state of implementation, talk about the good parts and the pitfalls to avoid. I will share my vision of a simpler and safer NaCl-inspired API, and hopefully leave you excited about experimenting further with cryptography in the browser.\n\nTranscript & slides: http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/tim-taubert-keeping-secrets-with-javascript-an-introduction-to-the-webcrypto-api.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
