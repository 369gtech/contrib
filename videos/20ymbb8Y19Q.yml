description: 'As an energetic member of the Node.js Foundation''s Security Working Group, Liran will provide a 360 perspective of some black clouds of security horror stories in the JavaScript & Node.js ecosystem and educate on mitigating and building secure applications for the ecosystem. We will deep-dive into practical Node.js security measures which you can easily implement in your current projects, covering some of OWASP Top 10 issues such as injection attacks and secure dependencies management. Finally, we will reach the silver lining in security by reviewing the initiatives that the Node.js Security Working Group have been taking to ensure a more secure future for Node.js and recent security related updates to the npm ecosystem.'
