description: "Talk\nMembers of the United States Green Party, working for the Howie Hawkins presidential campaign, and numerous state parties, are crowdsourcing a map of the United States Green Party politicians, organizations and events. It is not just a map, it is an object model of the organization, running on a hierarchical object-graph database.\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R. \r\n\r\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases."
