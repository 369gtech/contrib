description: "Wide & Deep Learning (https://research.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html) combines the power of memorization and generalization by jointly training wide linear models and deep neural networks. We've open-sourced the implementation with an easy-to-use API in TensorFlow. It's effective for generic large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs, such as recommender systems, search, ranking problems and more. We hope you find it useful in your machine learning projects.\n\nCheck out our blog post with links to tutorials, code samples, and our research paper:\n- Google Research Blog post: https://research.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html \n- TensorFlow Linear Model Tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide/\n- TensorFlow Wide & Deep Learning Tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide_and_deep/ \n- Research paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792 \n\nWatch all Machine Learning videos: https://goo.gl/gnXPPw\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers YouTube channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\nSubscribe to the brand new Firebase Channel: https://goo.gl/9giPHG"
