description: "Watch this talk to learn about all of the improvements in the Python dictionary, up to and including the re-architecture that has landed with Python 3.6. The talk will discuss iterable views, the dictionary’s dedicated comprehension syntax, random key ordering, the special key-sharing dictionary designed to underlie object collections, and, most famously of all, the new “compact dictionary” that cuts dictionary storage substantially — and carries a fascinating side-effect.\n\nEach new feature that the talk discusses will be motivated by considering the trade-offs inherent in hash table data structure design, and followed up with hints about how you can now use the dictionary even more effectively in your own code!\n\nEVENT: \n\nPyCon 2017\n\nSPEAKER: \n\nBrandon Rhodes\n\nPERMISSIONS: \n\nPyCon Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permissions to republish this video."
