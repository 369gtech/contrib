description: 'Regular expressions are powerful beasts, but with that power comes a reputation for being hard-to-read. Perl 6, with its long pedigree in REs, bucks that trend. We’ll start by demonstrating some easy examples of regular expressions in Perl 6, and by the end of the talk build up easy-to-read examples that other modern regular expression engines can’t handle, including validating JSON files.'
