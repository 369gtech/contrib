description: "GoWayFest 4.0, Online â€“ July 11-12, 2020\n\nHow to Safely and Efficiently Build your App with Modules, Aaron Schlesinger\n\nGo 1.11 introduced modules as the new dependency management technology for Go, and since then, we've been hit with a lot of new technologies in this space. With version 1.13, we're now using a Google-hosted module proxy and a checksum DB, all by default.\n\nIn order to safely and efficiently build our programs, we need to not only understand these technologies, but to understand how they affect our workflow and the safety of our app.\n\nIn this session, I'll briefly introduce the new features that Go 1.13 turns on by default, the pros and cons of these features, why you might want to opt out of them, and how to do so. Much of this talk will be live demos illustrating why to use the default features and why/how to turn them off. We'll use Athens for the demos of turning the defaults off.\n\nYou'll walk away from this talk with a good understand of what your builds are doing under the hood, under what circumstances you should use them or turn them off, and how to do just that.\n\nThis talk is for everyone who writes Go code, and no prior knowledge of modules is necessary. You'll be introduced to the pieces of dependency management that you'll need for this talk.\n\nSlides - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UP_3MMm87uNQIylTww5SbYoOvWr3QOC8/view?usp=sharing"
