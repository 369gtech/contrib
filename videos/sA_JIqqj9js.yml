description: "Video sponsor: United States Digital Service (https://usds.gov)\n\nThe quest for the perfect cross-platform solution has been like the quest for the Holy Grail. It’s been going on a long time, there are a myriad of perceived benefits, and every time someone claims to have found it, it’s never the right one. Many people ask, “Should I go with a cross-platform solution, or a native solution?” but the reality is the quest is bringing us closer to a solution where there isn’t a meaningful difference.\n\nReact Native wasn’t the first to show a solution could be both cross-platform and native, but it has certainly convinced a lot of people. As many of those early converts are discovering the limitations, they are beginning to fall back into either-or thinking. Maybe they just have the wrong assumptions.\n\nKotlin Multiplatform makes some new assumptions and, although it wasn’t the first to do so, is gaining in popularity very quickly. Is Kotlin Multiplatform the holy grail of cross-platform? Probably not. But it does bring cross-platform and native closer than ever before.\n\nThis talk will map out the quest for the perfect cross-platform solution, why we embarked, the twists and turns we’ve had along the way, and why the future of cross-platform is native.\n\nAbout Justin Mancinelli\nJustin has been at Touchlab for 3 years helping dev and product teams internally and externally navigate the waters of mobile app development and integrating them into larger technical, customer, and business ecosystems. He started programming BASIC and Assembly on a TI-86 calculator in middle school and eventually explored the world, becoming a senior developer and agile team lead along the way. Most of his commuting time is spent reading blogs and sharing choice quotes on Twitter. Most of his personal time is spent with his wife and toddler exploring Queens."
