recordingDate: 1506326683
description: "In object-oriented development, we are all familiar with design patterns such as the Strategy pattern and Decorator pattern, and design principles such as SOLID.\n\nThe functional programming community has design patterns and principles as well. This talk provides an overview of some common FP patterns, from the basics of partial application and currying all the way to monads and monoids."
