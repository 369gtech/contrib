description: "Docker images are great. But as an application developer, Dockerfile may not be the best mechanism to create them with.\n\nThere will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this talk--you'll learn about a few source-centric tools you can use to build and deploy Docker images.\n\nAttendees will learn how to take advantage of everything containers have to offer, without becoming an expert in the underlying technologies. Anyone who wants to deploy to a container platform or is using containers locally can benefit from this talk. You don't need previous experience with Docker"
