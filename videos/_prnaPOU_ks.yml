description: "So, you now scorn AsyncTasks...Or maybe you've got battle tested patterns for using them. Maybe you have\ndiscovered RxAndroid and will just never need to worry about concurrency again. That's great! Do you actually know the details, though? Can you actually distinguish between snake oil and solution? Don't take somebody else's word for it! Take a deep dive into the internals of Android's concurrency constructs, look at the code, and understand them for yourself! In this session, Blake Meike focuses on:\n  * AsyncTasks without the mythology\n  * Looper/Handler: the core of Android Concurrency\n  * IntentServices: palliative, not panacea\n  * Services: Binder, processes and lifecycles\n\nwww.istanbultechtalks.com"
