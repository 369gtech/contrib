description: "Prabakar Paulsami\nDirector, Applications Development\nOracle\n\nFarooq A.k\nPrincipal Quality Assurance Engineer\nOracle\n\nIn the world of continuous integrations and continuous delivery, regression issues and performance degradations are not acceptable by anyone. We will share our processes & tools which are being followed to solve above problems. Our hosted microservice, called Scrum Assistant Microservice(SAM),is built using JET. SAM uses terraform, docker and selenium grid technologies; it is completely configurable, scalable and 100% available. Devs & QA continue to work on their code from their machines; give their working code to SAM to validate UI tests, code audits, coverage, performance tests etc. SAM never utilizes developer resources there by giving maximum resources and time to them. All execution results are sent via emails once completed."
