This presentation looks at information from a fundamental perspective to gain insight into what it is. This fundamental perspective defines Information “... as a difference that makes a difference...” Looking at the Universe from this perspective allows us to assess its dynamic as a continuous generation of differences and therefore information, leading us to posit that information is inherent to the Universe. The greater this dynamism, the greater the disorder, the greater the differences, the greater the possibilities for information. Where there is no motion, e.g., at zero degrees Kelvin, there are no differences and therefore no information. Where there is random motion, e.g., when white noise or white light is present, there are no differences and therefore no information. But, how does this concept of information relate to us as living beings? Indeed, how do living beings, as cognitive beings, perceive the information in the Universe and make sense of it? This self-referential exercise is really at the heart of this talk.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nDr. Jaime F. Cárdenas Garcia. Obtained his BSME, MS and PhD degrees from the University of Maryland in 1971, 1975 and 1983, respectively. Dr. Cárdenas Garcia has held academic positions in mechanical engineering at the universities of Colorado State, Texas Tech, Maryland (College Park) and Texas (Brownsville). He was also a patent examiner at the United States Office of Patents and Trademarks. His research interests are in macro to micro applications using optical techniques as well as Atomic Force Microscopic based full-field measurements, respectively; in the development of solutions of inverse problems using experimental/analytical/numerical methods; and lately he is pursuing his interest in Biosemiotics that studies and explains the phenomenon of life. He has over 150 publications in scientific journals and international conferences."
