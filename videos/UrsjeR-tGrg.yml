With this talk you'll learn how those vulnerabilities are indexed (NVD, CVE) and how their severity is scored (CVSS).\n\nYou'll see how to create your first Continuous Security pipeline using Jenkins and OWASP DependencyCheck which detects vulnerabilities and track them using OWASP DependencyTrack (open-source softwares)\n\nDo you first step in the DevSecOps philosophy !!!\n\n*https://www.veracode.com/products/software-composition-analysis\n\nJulien Topçu \nFrom Société Générale & OWASP fundation member\nSenior Lead Developer for Société Générale, I'm an active evangelist on \"value creation\" focused methodologies, such as DDD/Hexagonal Architecture, l'XP and Kanban #NoEstimates.\n\nAs an OWASP fundation member, I strive to convey the DevSecOps mindset to the community. I set up several Continuous Security pipelines at companies scale."
