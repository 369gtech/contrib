At the same time we need to provide an always-on service to our customers. This means that we need to create resilient APIs and in addition we need to discover and connect to them in a secure way which exceeds standard service discovery. In addition we offer our internal developers the same promises as our 3rd party developers in terms of accessibility and backwards compatibility. Moreover, the platform needs to scale to support over 27 countries and thousands of engineers creating hundreds of services.\n\nThis talk takes us on a journey on how we manage, register, discover, expose and consume our APIs at ING in a secure and resilient manner.\n\nAlessandro Vermeulen \nFrom ING\nAlessandro has been a committed Functional Programmer for 10 years, originally in Haskell and now in Scala. He is a Functional Programming evangelist at ING Bank where he maintains the core libraries and frameworks for the API Platform and trains colleagues in functional and reactive programming with Scala and Akka, and gets excited by opportunities to remove redundant code through abstraction."
