description: "Psychological safety is a key requirement for high-performing teams. Teams that are afraid to fail or make mistakes are teams that are afraid to take risks. It might be counterintuitive, but teams that are afraid to fail will be too afraid to build secure products.\n\nUnhealthy teams with pressure to deliver won't stop to ask, \"Is this feature secure enough to ship? Is it making my customer safer?\" As a leader, how do you cultivate healthy development cultures that encourage every member of a team to hit \"the red button\" for security?\n\nAttendees will learn techniques for leaders to foster healthy security cultures in their organizations, how we've done this at Pivotal over the last three years, and what the future will look like for organizations that prioritize security and their customers.\n\nLearn more: https://pv.tl/2JeC75d\n\nSpeakers: Molly Crowther, Staff Technical Program Manager, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019\nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/the-red-button-adventures-in-security-leadership"
