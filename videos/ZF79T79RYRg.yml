title: 'How Amazon EventBridge transforms serverless development - James Beswick - ServerlessDays Stockholm'
recordingDate: 1576580120
description: "Event-driven architecture can help decouple services and simplify dependencies as your application grows. Amazon EventBridge provides new options for developers looking to gain the benefits of this approach.\nIn this session, I’ll explore the typical problems in synchronous architectures and how events provide a new way to communicate between microservices. You’ll see how this allows service teams to become more independent and how it helps developers get their features to users more quickly.\n\nThis sessions shows the difference between existing AWS messaging services, how Software-as-a-Service applications can now emit events, and why this is better than polling or web-hook mechanisms. Finally, I will use live coding examples you can immediately use in your serverless applications.\n\n\nVideo by https://www.flowpix.se/"
