description: "\"JavaScript Combinators\"\n\nJavaScript's first-class functions are the basis for nearly everything in the language, including methods and constructors. In this talk, we'll explore functions that consume and return functions, and see how they can be used to build expressive programs that hew closely to JavaScript's natural style, while taking advantage of ES6/ECMAScript 2015â€™s new features."
