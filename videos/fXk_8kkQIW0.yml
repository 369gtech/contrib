description: "Designers are Leaders, and Leaders are Designers \nby Lily Dart\n@lily_dart\n\nThe users experience of the services and products we build is harder to quantify than it once was. Just a few years ago, the best we could expect was some printed marketing materials and a desktop-focused website. \n\nNow that experience is made up of a collaboration of responsive websites, apps, emails, push messaging, and interactive experiences across a multitude of interfaces and devices.  \nDesign is no longer just the remit of designers. \n\nEverything from server infrastructure to the colours in the branding can effect the user experience. So what does this new world look like for those of us who make design decisions every day? How can we ensure that dedication to a quality experience is shared by our coworkers, our organisations, and our clients?\n\n\nLily will be talking about the qualities that a designer (or anyone else making design decisions) needs to be successful, and what can happen when we struggle to motivate the people we work with to buy-in to the same approach. \n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/syncnorwich/events/220976141/?comment_table_id=234422086&comment_table_name=reply"
