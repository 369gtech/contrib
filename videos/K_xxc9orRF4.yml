description: "Speaker: Giulio Manzoni\n\nJoin us for an exciting tech talk with Dr Giulio Manzoni, founder of Microspace Rapid Pte Ltd, the first and only Singapore small medium enterprise to concieve and develop nanosatellites. Dr Giulio will share with us about the POPSAT-HIP1, the first made-in-Singapore nanosatellite that was launched into space on June 2014, and the ATHENOXAT-1, an experimental nanosatellite for nocturnal observation which was launched into space on 16th December 2015.\n\nMicrospace vision is to excel at the front line of nanosatellites R&D, developing full satellites, innovative propulsion systems and optical payloads to enable the reduction of size and increased efficiency of spacecrafts for a more sustainable use of our Space.\n\nPresent in Singapore since 2007, Microspace Rapid early projects includes micropumps, electronic controls and pressurized gas containers to complete the system producing fully controllable thrust in the range of 100 microN to 10mN which enables fine attitude control and formation flight of nanosatellites of 1kg to microsatellites of 100kg mass.\n\nEvent Page: https://www.facebook.com/events/1776845012343350/\n\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/L3du/"
