description: "SRE by Influence, Not Authority: How the New York Times Prepares for Large-Scale Events\n\nVinessa Wan and Brett Haranin, The New York Times\n\nHow do you SRE in a large decentralized organization where development teams manage their own deployments and infrastructure? In this session, weâ€™ll cover how we formed our team at The New York Times and our rationale behind it, talk through our challenges, and how we leveraged an incident to kick off Elections readiness, our largest SRE effort to date.\n\nAttendees will understand how we organized this effort and integrated our team to partner with application teams. We will detail how we increased reliability through a combination of architecture reviews, monitoring improvements, and stress testing.\n\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
