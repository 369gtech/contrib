description: "Small memories flooding our consciousness like a river of delightful experiences, carrying us through our lives, tugging at our heart, pointing us towards endless appreciation of what many fall prey to forgetting: our love of solving puzzles and our joy of transforming reality and life itself.\n\nThis is the joy in what we do."
