description: "This video was recorded at Scala Days Chicago 2017\nFollow us on Twitter @ScalaDays or visit our website for more information http://scaladays.org \n\nAbstract: \nFinancial Exchanges are all about enabling near real-time market transactions with minimal latency and maximal predictability. In an environment where performance is king, and \"zero garbage\" and \"lock-free\" algorithms are the norm, come hear how one team decided to take a different approach using Scala.\n\nThis talk is part technical case study, part project postmortem, and part reflections on building a Scala team from the ground up. We'll talk about how Scala can succeed in a highly regulated, generally risk-averse environment, and why it can be worth that risk and lead to a happier, healthier team.\n\nStill not sure if this talk will be worth your time? You might enjoy this talk if you believe in Life Beyond Java, but the rest of your team thinks that Java 8 Lambdas killed Scala and you are looking for moral support."
