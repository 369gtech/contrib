description: "It's not what you know, it's who you know. Ever heard that? Well, whether that is fully true or not, it definitely doesn't hurt to become known in the community you want to work in. In this video, I am going to show you a really easy way to help the community out in a way that will also gain you a bit of reputation.

And trust me, it is very easy to do.\n\nFull courses: https://www.iamtimcorey.com/\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/IAmTimCorey\nNewsletter signup:  https://signup.iamtimcorey.com/ \nContribution Guidelines: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\nThe Article I Updated: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-absolute-beginners\nMicrosoft Documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/\n\nSponsors:\nTuhafeni Angula (Patreon Subscriber)"
