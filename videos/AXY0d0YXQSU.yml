description: "The final step in any successful release of Erlang (or Elixir) software is getting the release artifact(s) onto production machines. There are currently many ways this can be accomplished. This talk investigates some of the current approaches I've encountered, addresses some of the ways I've gone about this over the last 10 years, and introduces the different tools used. The primary focus will be on creating system packages (e.g. deb or rpm packages), but will touch on other packaging techniques.\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/anthony-molinaro/"
