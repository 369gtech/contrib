title: 'Initiation to Containers for Database Pros'
language: English
recordingDate: 1592579381
description: "Containers have been embraced by the developer community, but acceptance and adoption by DBAs is more… tepid. That’s understandable–why would anyone want a database that’s stateless and immutable?! Speaker, Sean Scott, started using Docker under duress and had no idea what he was doing! Since then, he's learned that Docker elegantly addresses many situations faced by DBAs, including:\n\n• Rapidly provisioning test and development environments\n• Interacting with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure databases (including ATP & ADW)\n• Preparing environments for performance testing\n• Building Gold images\n• Exploring new technologies and features\n• Discovering and confirming bugs\n• Preparing for certification exams\n\nThis session is a crash course in Docker covering the terminology, concepts, skills, and practical examples needed to begin using containers to support databases.\n\nSean Scott\nPrincipal Consultant and Oracle ACE Associate\nViscosity"
