description: "Domain-Driven Design Europe 2016 - Brussels, January 27-29 2016\nhttp://dddeurope.com - https://twitter.com/ddd_eu\nThere's been much talk of DDD, its tactical and strategic approaches to design, its abstract notions. Yet some perceive it as empty words or gold plating, and are at a loss when it comes to its value proposition. This talk brings a unique and practical perspective on what it is like, this experience of building up models, fleshing out designs and growing a common understanding of the various problem domains at play, guided by language, expertise and boundaries."
