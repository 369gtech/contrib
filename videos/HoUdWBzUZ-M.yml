title: 'App Engine: Easier auth with OAuth2Decorator'
language: English
recordingDate: 1355938732
description: "Here on the App Engine team, we're always trying to make it easier to call Google APIs from within your application. Using the library google-api-python-client, API calls can be a breeze, but performing authentication and authorization can sometimes (often?) take 50% of development time! We'll show how to get up and running with OAuth2Decorator to make auth as easy as the rest of the library.\n\nFor more information, check out the documentation:\nhttps://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/platforms/google_app_engine?hl=en#Decorators"
