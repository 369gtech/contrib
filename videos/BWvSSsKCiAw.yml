description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nOver the past few years, the C++ Standard committee has discussed what types of things user code can do with the standard library that are guaranteed to be supported between language versions, and what usages are out of bounds. Starting with proposals in Toronto in 2017 (http://wg21.link/p0684r0) and continuing in 2018 (http://wg21.link/p0921), the committee has been moving toward producing a user-facing Standing Document (SD) describing roughly what is and is not supported. These are the rights that the committee reserves in order to make changes to the standard library in the future. \n\nThis talk will discuss the details of those proposals and that SD, and what it means for you. What uses of the standard library are guaranteed? What uses are sketchy, but you'll maybe get away with? What uses will make it difficult or impossible for you to upgrade to future language versions?\n— \nTitus Winters, Google\nC++ Codebase Cultivator\n\nTitus Winters has spent the past 6 years working on Google's core C++ libraries. He's particularly interested in issues of large scale software engineer and codebase maintenance: how do we keep a codebase of over 100M lines of code consistent and flexible for the next decade? Along the way he has helped Google teams pioneer techniques to perform automated code transformations on a massive scale, and helps maintain the Google C++ Style Guide.\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
