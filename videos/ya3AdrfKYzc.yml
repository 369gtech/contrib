description: "You can engineer a novel drug on your laptop today using Machine Learning thanks to an open-source contribution by a company called Insilico Medicine based in Hong Kong. I spent some time reading their paper, playing with their model, and learning about the history of drug discovery. I can very confidently say that we are about to enter into a new era of personalized, low-cost medicine. And this new era will not just be about treating diseases, it'll be about finding actual cures using primarily cell and gene therapies. I am actively working on figuring out how i can best contribute here, I want to join in on the fun :) In this episode i'm going to explain everything i've learned about this field and by the end I want you to start generating molecules on your machine.
