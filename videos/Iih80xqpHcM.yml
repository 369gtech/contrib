description: "Front-end Application Deployment Patterns - Ross Kukulinski, Heptio \n\nKubernetes is a powerful deployment platform that allows complex workflows like rolling, blue-green, and canary deployments of software. Safely managing these complex deployment patterns for frontend browser applications where HTML references multiple CSS, JavaScript, or image assets is fraught with challenges. Doing this poorly results in broken page loads or inconsistent UI behavior. In this session, Ross Kukulinski, will cover: - Common deployment patterns for applications on Kubernetes - How web-applications make these patterns more complex - Solutions and associated live-demos showing how to resolve these problems Attendees will leave this presentation with a variety of strategies to manage blue-green, canary, and A/B deployments of front-end applications using of Kubernetes. \n\nTo Learn More: https://sched.co/GrR3"
