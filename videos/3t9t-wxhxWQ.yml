description: "Developers are taught to write code but what about deploying code ? Using a serverless architecture, testing, building, deploying and monitoring are activities that happens in a cloud native environment. Coding is still done locally. What can we do to enable developers in the cloud? If one needs to run a DB cluster locally, it doesnâ€™t make sense to have a local development environment anymore. Serverless enables to use services rather than running them ourselves or even building them. Writing code is actually a small part of the work, deploying and maintaining is often unknown.\n\nAbout:\n\nJulien Bisconti, Site Reliability Engineer, Independent\n\nJulien has been working as a software engineer for more than a decade with a liking for DevOps and site reliability engineering.
