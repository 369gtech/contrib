description: 'Regular expressions may seem like a topic that has been studied through and through. But in reality, much can still be improved in terms of performance and composability. Part of our work at Grammarly involves defining complex rules that are based on regular expressions, pushing the limits of what Javaâ€™s standard regexps can do. In this talk, I will describe an approach to implementing a custom regular expression engine by creating a specialized virtual machine.'
