description: "This is the wheel you’ve been reinventing everything you start a project (especially when working on distributed systems). you’ve likely found yourself spending less time on business logic and more time on the necessary infrastructure to make everything play together. You don’t need to. I’m going to show you how things, like maintaining state, handling events, orchestration and more, can simply be executed. I’ll do this through examples and live coding with BPMN and Camunda.\n\n# Niall Deehan\nI specialize in the implementation of executable BPMN models within the English-speaking world. My career has involved long stints as both a Java Developer and a Technical Analyst so I see BPMN (and especially Camunda BPM) as a linguistic bridge between those two disciplines. I dream of the day where all communication can be made through BPMN so that spelling would become obsolete."
