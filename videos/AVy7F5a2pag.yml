description: "JavaFX is included with JDK 1.8, supports CSS 3 skinning and data binding, and comes with a WYSIWYG editor: the Scene Builder. In this session, a Model-View-Presenter/Model-View-ViewModel architecture heavily influenced by convention over configuration, inversion of control (Scene Builder), CSS, and data binding are presented in a working code example with a focus on productivity and maintainability. The presentation also discusses integration with REST services, WebSocket, Java EE 7, and combination with Java 8 features such as lambdas and Nashorn.\n\n\nAuthor:\nAdam Bien\nConsultant and author Adam Bien is an Expert Group member for the Java EE 6 and 7, EJB 3.X, JAX-RS, and JPA 2.X JSRs.
