description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nFlux Deep Dive: A GitOps Approach to Progressive Delivery - Stefan Prodan & Hidde Beydals, Weaveworks \n\n“Progressive Delivery” refers to a set of techniques for reducing deployment risk by decoupling the deployment from the release process. In this session, Stefan and Hidde will talk about implementing these techniques on Kubernetes. We will discuss in depth how canary releases can be orchestrated through Git operations, declaratively, using Kubernetes custom resources and Flux git-to-cluster synchronization. We will demo a GitOps pipeline that automates the release process of a web application. The demo will feature: - Flux for cluster state management - Flux Helm Operator for app deployments - Flagger for app testing and incremental rollout\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zev2"
