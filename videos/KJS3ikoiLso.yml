description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017\n—\nMutexes have frequently been observed to outperform reader-writer locks in domains where, logically, reader-writer locks should dominate. I was recently given an opportunity to address this inconsistency and, to demonstrate my certainty of success, accepted a bet regarding outperforming a mutex for a high read, low write work task with short — but not extremely short — lock hold times. \n\nI lost the bet. \n\nI resolved to understand how I lost this bet and, in my mind at least, convert this \"loss\" to a \"win\". The bet focused on a Linux platform (the evaluations presented are multi-platform). This presentation will discuss design criteria for a reader-writer lock, the \"losing\" implementation, the performance results for the \"losing\" implementation, a possible explanation for the loss, the novel \"winning\" implementation, and the results supporting the value of the \"winning\" implementation. \n\nA basic understanding of mutexes, reader-writer locks, and atomic operations is recommended for attendees. \n— \nJeffrey Mendelsohn: Bloomberg LP\n—\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com"
