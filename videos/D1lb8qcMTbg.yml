title: '#FOSSBack: Thomas Fricke - Digital Sovereignty Driving Open Source in Germany and Europe'
recordingDate: 1614087902
description: "Since mid 2019 Digital Sovereignty has been promoted by the Government in Germany, for the most of us unexpectedly. \n\nBehind the scenes economical motivations are driving the initiatives. Several new governmental agencies have been created, projects have been started on scale driving the administration to go digital, finally deliver a promise broken for at least twenty years.\n\nThe fear of loosing the industrial technology base to the US and Chinese cloud hyperscalers, conflicts with the US administration on political questions have created lots of activities.\n\nGaia-X and the Corona app are only the most prominent initiatives started directly by the German government. \n\nThe talk tries to give an overview what is going on, tries to give an estimation what will come next, how sustainable the initiatives are, where it makes sense to demand further steps.\n\n###########\n\nFollow us on Social Media and join the Community!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fossbckstg\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8653059/​\n\nFOSS Backstage is an event by Plain Schwarz – https://plainschwarz.com"
