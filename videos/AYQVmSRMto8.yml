Why and how to integrate your strategies for better business efficiency\"\n\nThere are a few types of business growth strategies. Plain inbound, plain outbound and a mix. The challenge is that there is no \"Perfect\" setup of these, and almost never you should work only with one. \nThe main idea of setting up your growth strategy is to not only balance the activities between those channels / actions but also link them accordingly not to have fights, misunderstandings and to bring in transparency and control over the full client communication.\n\nThe main thought will be - why marketing and sales team don't get along , how and when transfer the lead between those departments, how to war up leads in marketing, and how to close marketing qualified leads properly without wasting resources and time. \n\nThe speech took place on 9th May 2019 on Marketing Stage during Infoshare 2019."
