title: '"Marketing: Not such a dirty word after all" - Ben Long (LCA 2020)'

description: "Ben Long\n\nhttps://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/173/\n\nAs technical communicators we have responsibilities - to our engineers, our audience, and to ourselves. \r\n\r\nWe owe it to our engineers to be precise - to represent their ingenuity and hard work in the most accurate way. We owe it to our audience to be accessible - to be easily understood by anyone who wants to learn from us.\r\n\r\nI also believe we owe it to ourselves to be far-reaching. We have limited time in each day, and we put a lot of it into researching and writing great content. So we want to make sure it’s getting in front of as many people as possible who need it (and sometimes those who don’t know they need it until they see it).\r\n\r\nWe don’t want to waste our time. We do want to make it count.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll talk about precision, accessibility, and reach - why we should think about them, how we can sharpen them, and tips we can apply from content marketing strategies to strengthen them.\r\n\r\nWho knows, you may even find yourself landing in a marketing team as I have. Scary? Only at first. (I can tell you a little bit about that too.)\n\nlinux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
