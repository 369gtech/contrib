title: 'Event Driven Architectures with Apache Geode and Spring Integration'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538670880
description: "Built into Apache Geode is a powerful event driven architecture. This architecture allows the developer to react to changes in the data in many different ways. In this session I will cover the various plugin points and how we can take advantage of that to build streaming architectures. In this session I will deploy Spring Integration pipelines to act on the data where the data lives - reacting to the data in context. This gives us a streaming solution with in-memory speeds.\n\nSpeaker:\nCharlie Black\nPrincipal Data Engineer, Pivotal\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2018"
