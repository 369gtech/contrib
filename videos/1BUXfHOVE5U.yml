Learn more about Code & Supply at https://www.codeandsupply.co.\n\n------\n\nIt's 2020. We know that burnout is real, self-care is important, and “rockstar” techies are at least cryptids, if not outright myths. Right?\n\nI'm a recovering rockstar. It wasn't enough for me to make a career change and transition into tech, I had to /win/ at it. On top of my full-time job, I taught, spoke, networked, organized, tweeted, blogged, appeared on TV... “no” wasn't in my vocabulary.\n\nTurns out there's only so long I can keep up that sort of behavior without developing problematic mental health issues and wrecking my relationships (oops!). In this session, I'll talk through learning how to accept my limitations, to recognize burnout and be kind to myself, and to responsibly re-engage after taking a self-care break. I've made the mistakes so you don't have to!"
