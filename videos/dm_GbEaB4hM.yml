description: 'As security researchers, we are always looking for the next device that will make our jobs easier and our research more effective. In many cases, physical gear can be expensive and limited in capability which can be prohibitive, especially in engagements where dead drops are required. However, with the skyrocketing popularity of microcontrollers and single board computers, that barrier has been reduced significantly and has created a host of new possibilities for everything from dead drops to wired and wireless network intrusion and analysis. gh057 will introduce some of the more popular options in this genre and some live demonstrations of their more fun uses. gh057 will demonstrate three devices he built to solve specific problems and that are based on these platforms: ATtiny85, ESP8266 / ES32, Raspberry Pi Finally, and as a bonus, gh057 will demonstrate a simple technique that uses Applescript and Bash that can be used to create a simple USB trojan and can be useful for end-user training.'
