title: 'Josh Goldberg - TypeScript for APIs - JSworld 2021'
language: English
recordingDate: 1626092586
description: "Developers love APIs that make usage easy. Whether we're installing packages on npm, passing data within a project, or integrating with an external service, we don't want confusion or uncertainty around whether our code will work. TypeScript provides a great standard for describing the shapes of all those things and more. Formalizing our APIs with it provides a plethora of benefits for JavaScript and TypeScript projects alike.\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore how to use TypeScript to set up a \"pit of success\" for bringing in external code to a project. We'll start off by exploring how npm packages are described by TypeScript \"definition files\" -- even when the package author and/or consumer aren't themselves using TypeScript. Next, we'll expand these definitions using auto-generation tools such as OpenAPI (\"Swagger\") that keep shared definitions for known API entities updated across projects. Swagger segues well into GraphQL, which provides a host of options for generating full type definitions and clients from schemas in your code.\n________\nRewatch more recordings from our past conferences at our video portal ➡️ https://frontenddeveloperlove.com/video \n________\nOur upcoming conferences:\n➡️ https://vuejs.amsterdam/\n➡️ https://reactlive.nl/\n________\nPowered by https://passionatepeople.io\n\n#unittests #webaudio #unittesting #hiphop #frontendlove or #vuejsamsterdam #javascript #reactacademy #react #microinteractions #designsystems #javascript #artificialintelligence #amsterdam #speaker #conference #frontendlove #frontenddeveloperlove #javascriptconference #frontendconference #vue #angular #react #cfp #theateramsterdam #meetup #conferences #events"
