title: 'KotlinConf 2018 - Sealed Classes Opened My Mind: How We Use Kotlin to Tame State at Etsy by Patrick'
language: English
recordingDate: 1539593559
description: "Recording brought to you by American Express https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs\nThe talk explores using sealed classes to represent state via an event stream and how we can take filtered views of it while still maintaining the exhaustiveness of when. The talk would follow the concepts outlined in my post here: https://codeascraft.com/2018/04/12/sealed-classes-opened-my-mind/\n\nAdditionally it would explore how to use RxJava to emit these events and how to use when and filterIsInstance to react to them.\n\nThere is a section on how Java's instanceof was often considered a poor practice and the (sometimes painful) indirection of polymorphic solutions like the visitor pattern. And finally how Kotlin makes all that pain go away.\n\nAbout Patrick Cousins:\nBeen programming for nearly 20 years and I still love rediscovering that passion for new patterns and languages. Fan of corny jokes and seal puns."
