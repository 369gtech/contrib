description: "Jumping all in on Microservices is very appealing for us developers. We dream of the day when all of our systems will be nicely decoupled and independent. When riding the hype we often choose not to talk about the trade-offs, but neglecting to do so can have great consequences, and one day we wake up to reality. Still, there are good reasons why to pursue a Microservice architecture, and at Queue-it that is what we have done.\n\nThis talk is based on the path towards a Microservice architecture at Queue-it, and will explore the pros and cons of Microservices. We will discuss when to apply the architecture and what alternatives there might be."
