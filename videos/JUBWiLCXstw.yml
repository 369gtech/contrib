description: "Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/Pivotal/scaling-your-product-team-while-staying-agile\n\nSoftware companies large and small need to move fast, and that typically requires growing your product teams beyond the proverbial “two pizza” rule. \n\nFinding and keeping great people is tougher than ever these days, but there is much more to scaling a product organization than just hiring! In this talk, Dan will walk through the challenges and opportunities encountered as product organizations grow from beyond the single agile team, based on real world experiences of Pivotal Tracker, a popular agile project management tool that’s been around for 10 years, as well as other fast growing product teams at Pivotal. \n\nTopics discussed will include the importance of a strong culture, pair programming as a growth strategy, vertical vs horizontal team organization, the product manager role, how design fits into a product team at scale, and much more.\n\nSpringOne Platform 2016 \nSpeaker: Dan Podsedly; VP & GM, Pivotal Tracker."
