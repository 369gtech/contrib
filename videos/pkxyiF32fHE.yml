description: "By now, you should have heard of these buzzwords - AI, Machine Learning, and more recently, Deep Learning. But what exactly is Deep Learning, how it works, and more importantly, how do you actually get started with it?\n\nIn this session, Wei-Meng will explain Deep Learning so that it is easy to understand. You will learn what it means by back-propagation, gradient descent, loss functions, optimizers, and more. You will walk away from this session with a practical example on how to train a deep learning model to recognize objects. If you want to join in the AI bandwagon, this is a session not to miss!\n\nDon't miss our next conference!\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndccopenhagen.com/"
