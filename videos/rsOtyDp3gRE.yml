description: "Let's Talk Everything IAM! - Sree Tummidi, Pivotal\n\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) is a key pillar of security. Its impossible for any customer, big or small, to think about rolling out Cloud Foundry without putting controls in place to allow authenticated and authorized access at all layers of the platform. Projects like UAA and more recently PERM enable these patterns for both the platform and the apps running on it in a standards based manner.\n\nThe roadmap for UAA and PERM is going to be governed by an important development in the foundation with the introduction of CF Container Runtime for kubernetes. Kubernetes comes with its own IAM model for the platform and the Istio (https://istio.io/) service mesh provides security for applications running in Kubernetes. Achieving inter-op between these platforms (CF CR and CF AR) is a big goal keeping operator and developer productivity in mind.\n\nIn this talk we will take a closer look the role UAA and PERM will play in this new world when it comes to enabling IAM.\n\nhttps://cfseu18.sched.com/event/FRyR/lets-talk-everything-iam-sree-tummidi-pivotal"
