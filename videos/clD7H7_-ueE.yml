description: "While Docker has enabled an unprecedented velocity of software production, it is all too easy to spin out of control. A promotion-based model is required to control and track the flow of Docker images as much as it is required for a traditional software development lifecycle. New tools often introduce new paradigms. We will examine the patterns and the anti-patterns for Docker image management, and what impact the new tools have on the battle-proven paradigms of the software development lifecycle.\n\nJonathan Roquelaure (@roquelaurej) is Solution Engineer at JFrog, the creator of Artifactory Binary Repository, the home of Bintray the software distribution platform, whiches are are used by millions of developers around the world. Based in France, multi-skilled developer, agilist and specialized in continuous integration and delivery. He's focused on making developers life easier through processes fluidisation and automation\n\n[UBJ-1333]"
