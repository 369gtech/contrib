title: 'Tobias Goeschel - Choking the Monolith - The Strangler (Fig) Pattern Applied'
language: English
recordingDate: 1620033943
description: "\"The so-called \"Strangler Fig\" (aka \"Strangler\") pattern is a much-cited strategy for replacing legacy systems with new, often microservice-based architectures. However, it's not actually a microservice pattern, and there are several - quite different - ways to implement it. \n\nAre you confused yet?\n\nFear not: We will have a look at the theory, and then explore together, how Strangler Fig could be used to improve and replace a project worthy being called \"The Most Horrible Piece Of Code in the World\".\""
