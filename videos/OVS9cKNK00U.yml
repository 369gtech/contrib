title: 'State of the Art Web User Interfaces with State Machines - David Khourshid'
language: English
recordingDate: 1538644041
description: 'This talk is intended for all developers, beginner to advanced, and provides gentle explanations to two otherwise confusing (but essential) computer science topics: finite state machines and statecharts. It will focus on using FSMs within any framework (or no framework at all), with an emphasis on statecharts - an extension of FSMs that simplifies even the most complex user interfaces, and is used to this day from traffic lights to avionics systems and NASA shuttle missions.'
