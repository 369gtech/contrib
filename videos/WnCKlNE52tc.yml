title: 'Protecting users on a thriving web (Chrome Dev Summit 2019)'
recordingDate: 1573516099
description: "From spoofy phishing sites to cross-site tracking, it can be hard to know where you are and what's being observed about you on the web. Chrome’s goal is to help people make safe decisions amidst this complexity. To help people figure out where they are on the web, Chrome has a new warning for deceptive lookalike domains and a new tool to allow power users to use their expertise to protect the masses. Chrome is also designing new capabilities that let third-party web developers do their jobs while collecting much less data about the people visiting websites. Spam and fraud prevention, web-wide measurement, and even ad personalization are all important to a flourishing web — and with cutting-edge cryptographic and ML techniques, we can support those while protecting user privacy and fighting fingerprinting.\n\nPresented by: Emily Stark, Michael Kleber\n\nView the schedule → https://goo.gle/2nON8mp\n\n#ChromeDevSummit All Sessions → https://goo.gle/CDS19\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nEvent photos → \_https://goo.gle/CDS19Photos"
