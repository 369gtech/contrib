title: '#HITBLockdown D1 - Exploiting Directory Permissions On Macos - Csaba Fitzl'
language: English
recordingDate: 1590639740
description: "In this talk I will talk about how can we exploit applications on macOS (including macOS itself), where some of the directory / file permissions are incorrectly set. The incorrectness of these settings it’s not trivial at first sight because understanding these permissions are not intuitive. We will see bugs from simple arbitrary overwrites, to file disclosures and privilege escalation. The concepts applicable to *nix based system as well, however this talk focuses on macOS bugs only. We will also cover different techniques about how to  control contents of files, to what we don’t have direct write access.\n\n=== \n\nCsaba graduated in 2006 as a computer engineer. He worked for 6 years as a network engineer, troubleshooting and designing big networks. After that he started to work as a blue teamer, focusing on network forensics, malware analysis and kernel exploitation. Currently he works in a red team, where he spends most of his time simulating adversary techniques and doing pentents. He gave talks / workshops on various international IT security conferences, including Hacktivity, hack.lu, Troopers, SecurityFest, DEFCON and Objective By The Sea. He is the author of the ‘kex’ kernel exploitation Python toolkit. Csaba spends his free time with his family, practices ashtanga yoga before sunrise or simply hikes in the mountains."
