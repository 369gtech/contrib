description: "An open source project is more than just a code repository. If you want to be more than a single-developer project in an obscure corner of the world, you need to build community around the code. But building communities of users, adopters, and developers requires planning and work. In this session, we’ll talk about the sorts of things that you need to think about: license selection, finding and connecting with your community, courting contributors and contributions, trademarks, intellectual property management, contributor agreements, whether or not you should consider moving the project to a foundation, and more.\n\nWayne Beaton \nWayne is the Director of Open Source Projects at the Eclipse Foundation. He started writing software in 1983 on an Apple ][+, learned object-oriented programming and Smalltalk in 1987, and was an early adopter of Java. Wayne is a content review committee member for Devoxx and JavaOne, is a long time contributor to Eclipse open source projects, and regular presenter at JavaOne, JavaPolis/Devoxx, JAX, and EclipseCon. In 1982, he received the prestigious Chief Scouts Award from then-Governor General Edward Schreyer. In 1984 his team was selected to represent beautiful British Columbia in the Kinsmen Voyageur Relay. In his spare time, he writes down meaningless accomplishments from his youth in a lame attempt to impress the reader.\n\nGunnar Wagenknecht \nGunnar currently works in the Platform Services group at Salesforce. Prior to Salesforce he was responsible for Tasktop’s Open Source Program and Engineering Effectiveness. Before Tasktop he lead the development and operation of a multi-tenant, worldwide e-commerce platform serving millions of transactions each day. He also is a prolific contributor with many years of experience in the Eclipse Open Source Community where he has been awarded with the Lifetime Contribution Award. Apart from software and computers he loves chatting about fishing, diving and other things that matters over a good beer or a glass of wine."
