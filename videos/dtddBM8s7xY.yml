description: "CSS can be a source of deep frustration for developers, especially those more familiar with the imperative nature of JavaScript. Over time, this has resulted in a portion of the web community with a fundamental misunderstanding of CSS, not only of how to write it, but of what CSS is in the first place: a declarative, domain-specific programming language.\n\nHow can those of us who know and love CSS convince this group to include CSS in their definition of programming language, and why is it so important? This talk will provide your talking points for that conversation.\n\nSlides: https://www.slideshare.net/laras126/algorithms-in-css-v310-css-day-2019\nAbout Lara: https://notlaura.com\nFollow Lara: https://twitter.com/laras126\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe"
