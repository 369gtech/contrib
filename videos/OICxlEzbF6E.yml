Spreadsheet applications can be a nightmare. In this updated talk, you'll see how OpenPyXL let's you work with those files in a way that's better than using the app OR a .csv. I'll also discuss common problems in working with spreadsheets via code.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU, australia, programming, sydney\n\nThis video is licensed under CC BY 3.0 AU ‹https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/›.\r\n\r\nPyCon Australia (“PyCon AU”) is the national conference for the Python Programming Community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers with a love for developing with Python.\n\nPyCon AU, the national Python Language conference, is on again this August in Sydney, at the International Convention Centre, Sydney, August 24 - 28 2018.\n\nPython, PyCon, PyConAU"
