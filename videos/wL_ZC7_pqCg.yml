description: "Akshai Parthasarathy\nOracle\n\nHiginio Maycotte\nCEO\nPilosa\n\nIn this presentation, you can learn more about Oracle Cloud Native Services: Container Engine for Kubernetes, Cloud Infrastructure Registry, Functions, Resource Manager, Streaming, and others. H.O. from Molecula will talk about how they are using these services, and their advice on getting started. Container orchestration, serverless, infrastructure as code, and streaming platforms can be difficult to deploy and manage. Yet, they are essential to get reusable code deployed faster and more often. We need managed services that are built on reliable infrastructure, and provide options for hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios."
