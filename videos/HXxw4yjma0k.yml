description: "Google Tech Talks\r\nAugust 20, 2008\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis presentation is drawn from Hunter's recent lead chapter in the U.S. Presidential Climate Action Project's report to the President-elect. It describes the business case for moving aggressively to solve such challenges as global warming, peak oil, the vulnerability of our energy infrastructure and others. Hunter discusses how climate protection, energy efficiency, renewable energy and other sustainable approaches will give us a stronger economy, and a higher quality of life. Hunter discusses how to unleash the new energy economy as the antidote to life in a carbon constrained world. The global climate crisis threatens many aspects of life on earth, including access to water. Energy is a relatively easy challenge to solve. But providing access to water, both at home and in water-short regions around the globe will not be trivial. Fortunately, in water, as in energy, there are solutions that cost less, work better and can deliver a higher quality of life. Hunter will describe how communities and companies are implementing these and many other strategies to cut their costs and drive their innovation.\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Hunter Lovins\r\nL.
