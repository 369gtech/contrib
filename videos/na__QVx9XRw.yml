description: "Speaker: Eduards Sizovs\nTalk: How We Built Dev.Tube\nAbstract:\nBuilt by 2 developers in only 2 months, dev.tube is gradually becoming the primary hub of tech videos. In this entertaining and practical session, Eduards – the founder and core developer, will tell what went wrong, what went well and what can we learn from dev.tube's launch. We’ll cover:\n\n* how we attracted 1 million monthly visitors\n* how we maintain infrastructure (and how much does it cost $$$)\n* why experienced java developers ended up writing javascript\n* why sometimes we do not write unit tests\n* how to make OSS contributors happy (or angry)\n* how SaaS vendors helped us survive the load (and why)\n* …and much more!"
