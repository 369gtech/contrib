description: "Speaker: Shane Woo, Quantitative Analyst and former Associate Cybersecurity Specialist, GovTech\n\nShane graduated from the NUS Business School in 2018 with a degree in Business Administration. Despite this non-technical background, he realised he wasn’t that interested in a traditional ‘business’ career, and wanted to pursue tech. Fortunately, by picking up skills through self-study, he was able to make the leap to join the GovTech TAP programme.\n\nThere, he spent the first two years as a Cybersecurity Specialist doing Threat Hunting under the Government IT Security and Incident Response Team (GITSIR), and has recently joined the Data Science and AI Division as a Quantitative Analyst. This cross-domain exposure has given Shane valuable experience and a unique perspective of how tech can be integrated.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developers-Singapore/events/274030422/ \r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\r\nRecorded by: Michael Cheng"
