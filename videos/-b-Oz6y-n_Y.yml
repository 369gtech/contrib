description: "A Google TechTalk, July 23, 2016, presented by Alexander Thiemann\nABSTRACT:  This talk will give an insight on web development using the Haskell web framework «Spock» ( https://www.spock.li ). It will give a short overview of the possibilities like type-safe routing, hyperlinks, sessions, database queries, templates and JSON parsing/generation and then we will also look at a technique to build a full stack application with Spock and GHCJS as used in production in TramCloud.\n\nhttps://wiki.haskell.org/ZuriHac2016"
