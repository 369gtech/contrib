You will learn about the underlying working of Boosting, Bagging, and Voting algorithms.  The video will make you learn how to create a model using Ensemble Learning validate it using cross-validation.\n\nThese are the following topics that are covered in this Ensemble Learning Tutorial video:-\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:00:47 What is Ensemble learning?\n00:01:49 Need For Ensemble Learning\n00:02:31 Bias - Variance Tradeoff\n00:04:03 Ensemble Learning Techniques\n00:09:00 Ensemble Learning In Action\n\nðŸ”¹Checkout Edureka's Machine Learning Python Tutorial playlist: https://bit.ly/3szLTCO\nðŸ”¹Checkout Edureka's Machine Learning R Tutorial Playlist: https://bit.ly/3duYGlF                 \nðŸ”¹Checkout Edureka's Machine Learning Tutorial Blog Series: https://bit.ly/2PX5lIp\n\nðŸ”´Please do subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future: https://goo.gl/6ohpTV\n\n--------Edureka Online Training and Certification-----------\n\nðŸ”µ DevOps Online Training: https://bit.ly/2BPwXf0\nðŸŸ£ Python Online Training: https://bit.ly/2CQYGN7\nðŸ”µ AWS Online Training: https://bit.ly/2ZnbW3s\nðŸŸ£ RPA Online Training: https://bit.ly/2Zd0ac0\nðŸ”µ Data Science Online Training: https://bit.ly/2NCT239\nðŸŸ£ Big Data Online Training: https://bit.ly/3g8zksu\nðŸ”µ Java Online Training: https://bit.ly/31rxJcY\nðŸŸ£ Selenium Online Training: https://bit.ly/3dIrh43\nðŸ”µ PMP Online Training: https://bit.ly/3dJxMTW\nðŸŸ£ Tableau Online Training: https://bit.ly/3g784KJ\n\n--------------Edureka Masters Programs----------------\n\nðŸ”µMachine Learning Engineer Masters Program: https://bit.ly/388NXJi\nðŸŸ£Cloud Architect Masters Program:  https://bit.ly/3i9z0eJ\nðŸ”µData Scientist Masters Program:  https://bit.ly/2YHaolS\nðŸŸ£Big Data Architect Masters Program:  https://bit.ly/31qrOVv\nðŸ”µDevOps Engineer Masters Program: https://bit.ly/2B9tZCp\nðŸŸ£Business Intelligence Masters Program: https://bit.ly/2BPLtn2\nðŸ”µPython Developer Masters Program: https://bit.ly/2Vn7tgb\nðŸŸ£RPA Developer Masters Program: https://bit.ly/3eHwPNf\n\n-----------------Edureka PGP Courses---------------\n\nðŸ”µArtificial and Machine Learning PGP: https://bit.ly/2Ziy7b1\nðŸŸ£CyberSecurity PGP: https://bit.ly/3eHvI0h\nðŸ”µDigital Marketing PGP: https://bit.ly/38cqdnz\nðŸŸ£Big Data Engineering PGP: https://bit.ly/3eTSyBC\nðŸ”µData Science PGP: https://bit.ly/3dIeYV9\nðŸŸ£Cloud Computing PGP: https://bit.ly/2B9tHLP\n\n--------------------\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/edurekain\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/edureka\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/edureka_learning/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/edurekaIN/   \nSlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/EdurekaIN   \nCastbox: https://castbox.fm/networks/505?country=in\nMeetup:  https://www.meetup.com/edureka/\n\n#Edureka #EnsembleLearning #EnsembleLearningInMachineLearning #WhatIsEnsembleLearning #MachineLearningTraining #Python\n\nHow it Works?\n1. This is a 5 Week Instructor led Online Course,40 hours of assignment and 20 hours of project work\n2. We have a 24x7 One-on-One LIVE Technical Support to help you with any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require during the course.\n3. At the end of the training you will be working on a real time project for which we will provide you a Grade and a Verifiable Certificate\n\nAbout the Course :\nEdurekaâ€™s Machine Learning Course using Python is designed to make you grab the concepts of Machine Learning. The Machine Learning training will provide deep understanding of Machine Learning and its mechanism. As a Data Scientist, you will be learning the importance of Machine Learning and its implementation in python programming language.\n\nWhy Learn Machine Learning with Python?\n\nData Science is a set of techniques that enables the computers to learn the desired behavior from data without explicitly being programmed. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science. This course exposes you to different classes of machine learning algorithms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms. This course imparts you the necessary skills like data pre-processing, dimensional reduction, model evaluation and also exposes you to different machine learning algorithms like regression, clustering, decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes and Q-Learning.\n\nGot a question on the topic?
