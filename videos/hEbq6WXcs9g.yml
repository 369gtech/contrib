description: 'Graham is the VP of Applied Sciences and Research at Wave, where he’s responsible for the integration of new technologies and research areas into the company, primarily Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Over the years, Graham has built, led and managed teams from 5 to 100 as a founder, manager, executive and board member. He has a passion for solving complex problems by creating fun, inclusive, high performing teams. In previous lives, he’s built multi-petabyte systems, found homes for lost cats and puppies, done stand up comedy at weddings and night clubs (including an unfortunately momentous poetry jam) and taken himself far too seriously.'
