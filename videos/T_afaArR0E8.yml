title: 'How to Deploy a Tensorflow Model to Production'
language: English
recordingDate: 1496250002
description: "Once we've trained a model, we need a way of deploying it to a server so we can use it as a web or mobile app! We're going to use the Tensorflow Serving library to help us run a model on a server that we can then make HTTP requests to for data. We'll have the user upload an image and it will return a classification for that image. \n\nCode for this video:\nhttps://github.com/llSourcell/How-to-Deploy-a-Tensorflow-Model-in-Production\n\nPlease subscribe!
