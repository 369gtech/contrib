description: "Learning a new programming language can be intimidating and it doesn’t take too long before impostor syndrome can kick in. Things can even get more challenging if you’re learning includes being exposed to a new programming paradigm. \n\nThis talk discusses about ways through which the journey of learning Elixir can be made more fulfilling and worthwhile through collaboration. We will explore how the better usage of mediums like Exercism, Slack etc., not only help us identify different ways of getting unstuck as we work towards getting a clearer understanding of the functional concepts in Elixir but also how they empower us to be better programmers in general through thoughtful conversations about code. \n\nWe will also see how this journey of learning Elixir gives us opportunities through which we can contribute back to the language and community.\n\nSlides can be viewed here: https://speakerdeck.com/boddhisattva/learning-elixir-better-through-collaboration-and-giving-back-2\n\nMore details here: https://codesync.global/speaker/mohnish-jadwani/"
