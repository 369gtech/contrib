recordingDate: 1428404755
description: "What is Docker and why should you care? A Docker container is like a lightweight Virtual Machine. It gives you the benefits of a virtual machine, isolation of your application, without the drawbacks, having to ship an entire operating system with your application, slow startup time, and difficult interaction with the host.\nIn this presentation you will learn why Docker and containerization is the future of DevOps and how to use it efficiently. You will learn how to build, run, and link containers, and what volumes are and what they are used for.\n\nYou will also learn about some of the many orchestration solutions that exists for managing a cluster of containers, both locally and in the cloud.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
