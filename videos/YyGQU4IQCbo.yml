title: 'Choosing the right Deep Learning Framework: A Deep Learning Approach'
language: English
recordingDate: 1568552980
description: "Nick Acosta\n\nThis talk will demonstrate how deep learning can be used to identify a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch that would best help a developer build out deep neural networks based on how they write and the problems they solve.\n\nDeep Learning Frameworks allow for the easy construction of neural networks and have made Python the go-to language for Artificial Intelligence development. However, the most popular one, TensorFlow, is still in the midst of putting out just its 2nd major release, and many others are equally as new. Because of the intense pace of innovation in the field deep learning, these frameworks are changing as rapidly as networks they are helping to build. If a developer chooses to use a deep learning framework because of a particular feature that it has, it could quickly change drastically or become unavailable all-together. This session will cover the data collected and methods used to align developers with a deep learning framework that is most suitable to their code and allow audience members to receive recommendations via samples of their own Jupyter Notebooks."
