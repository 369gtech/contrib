description: 'Java 8 makes it relatively easy to program with parallel streams and to implement asynchronous tasks using CompletableFuture. When someone says it’s easy, cautious programmers ask “What’s the catch?” Well, of course, that’s one of the major topic we’ll address in this deep dive session. We will start with a fast introduction to parallel and asynchronous programming with Java 8 and quickly delve into the gotchas, when to use these facilities, when to avoid them, and how and where to put them to good use.'
