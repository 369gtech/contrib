In traditional synchronous programming patterns, users are asked to monitor the spinning wheel as the application moves from one task to the next until a response can be returned. However, developers can reclaim these precious milliseconds by learning to think asynchronously.\nAsynchronous patterns challenge developers to evaluate what tasks require the client to wait versus what can be done after the fact. When developing serverless applications on AWS this process is made easier by the asynchronous and polling patterns that are native to AWS Lambda.\nIn this session I will demonstrate taking an existing translation application that is synchronous and modifying it to use asynchronous patterns. This will be accomplished using Amazon DynamoDB Streams [...]\r\n\r\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\r\nhttps://goto-oslo.com/2020/sessions/1297/thinking-asynchronously-virtual\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcph\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\r\n#Serverless #DynamoDBStreams #EventBridge #AWS #Programming\r\n\r\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\r\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!
