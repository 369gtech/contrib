description: 'Changes, even those that represent improvement, are always accompanied by obstacles and discomforts. Kubernetes can become very complex with all the objects that need to be handled in addition to releases that you operate with. The goal of this session: address complexity with development passion. In this session I will explain and demonstrate (in code) how you can simplify Kubernetes complexity with Helm: templates, values, requirements and pod specifications made easier and reusable.'
