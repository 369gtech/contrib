description: "Donâ€™t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nManaging Applications in Production: Helm vs. ytt and kapp - Dmitriy Kalinin & Shatarupa Nandi, Pivotal \n\nHave you ever got a stuck Helm upgrade? Did you struggle counting number of spaces to use for indenting a template chunk? Have you switched away from generic deployment tools to writing your own operators? Do you dream about extracting common app configuration into a library for use by all your applications?  This talk will dissect challenges you and I have faced while working with production Kubernetes environments, managing non-trivial application configuration, and deployment mechanics. It will dig deep into Helm v2, Helm v3, ytt, kbld, kapp, to understand design choices that ultimately result in great successes and failures in your production environments. Attendees will come away with a deeper knowledge of the inner workings of these tools and appreciation for the complexity hidden away in these tools.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zetv"
