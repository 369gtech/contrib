description: "OWASP AppSec EU 2018 Keynote - Day 2, Afternoon\n\nIn this talk, Allison Miller will discuss how todayâ€™s defenders are adapting to the new normal of our ever evolving ecosystem -- expanding exposure surfaces, complexity in every corner, continuous change, not to mention bigger big data and badder bad actors -- by focusing on designing and architecting more defensible systems. The modern defender can no longer depend on simple \"castle and moat\" style tactics, but must craft protections for platforms, applications, and services that operate in real-time at internet scale -- while at the same time protecting millions of customers, transactions, endpoints, and actions on any given day. We'll talk about the models and design approaches that we can add into our arsenals, and the technologies we'll need to launch the practice of defense beyond the perimeter.\n\nManaged by the official OWASP Media Project https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project"
