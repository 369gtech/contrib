title: 'The Quantum Computers Are Coming'
language: English
recordingDate: 1525041001
description: "Many people may not know it, but we live in a time where the first quantum computers have been created – and they’re *pretty damn cool*. Why? Because while regular bits are limited to only two boring values, QBITs can take near infinite values and operate singularly or in harmony with each other. This outstanding property gives rise to a new kind of algorithms (and a lot of fun!). Follow me on a journey from Zuses Z3 computer and Schrödingers cat to supercooled quantum processors and parallel universes – no PhD in physics required.\n\nEVENT:\n\nDevoxx Bucharest 2018\n\nSPEAKER:\n\nAlasdair Collinson\n\nPERMISSIONS:\n\nDevoxx Bucharest Organizer provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish this video.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nDevoxx Bucharest: https://www.voxxed.com/event/voxxed-days-bucharest/"
