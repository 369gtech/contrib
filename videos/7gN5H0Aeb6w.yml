description: "Speaker: Edson Yanaga, Burr Sutter\r\n\r\n == 1st talk: Guillaume Laforge on Apache GroovyGuillaume Laforge will be in Singapore for Voxxed Days Singapore. He is Developer Advocate at Google for the Google Cloud Platform.Since 2003, Guillaume has been involved in the Groovy programming language project, leading the project since 2004.He initiated the creation of the Grails web application framework, and founded the Gaelyk project, a lightweight toolkit for developing applications in Groovy for Google App Engine. Apache Groovy keeps on rocking the JVM. In this presentation, Guillaume will show some of the enhancements and new features coming in the upcoming 2.5 / 2.6 / 3.0 releases. Among other things: the refinements of existing code transformations, some additions to the GDK (Groovy Development Kit), the new Macro system, and of course, the full Java 8 support. \r\n\r\n\r\n== 2nd talk: Edson Yanaga and Burr Sutter from Redhat -\_Reactive Microservices with Vert.x Burr and Edson are both Java Champions and Developer Advocates at Redhat. Burr has founded Devnexus (second largest Java conference in the U.S.)Edson has just published a book on Migrating to Microservice Databases.Edson and Burr are still working on their talk. We will publish their abstract in a few days. Everybody is talking about microservices and reactive programming these days. And there’s a reason for that: the high-demand and high-scale distributed world that we have today, reacting to events in an asynchronous and non-blocking fashion seems the right approach to deal with scalability. And to achieve microservices you need a lightweight, fast, modular, high-performance and un-opinionated environment. Meet Vert.x: a toolkit for building reactive applications on the JVM. Come to this session to see how you can use Vert.x to create reactive code using Java, Groovy, JavaScript or other JVM languages. \_If you are keen to register for Voxxed Days Singapore, you can use the promo code VOXXED-DAYS-LOVES-JAVA and enjoy a 10% discount.\r\n\r\nEvent Page: https://www.meetup.com/singajug/events/240026369/\r\n\r\nProduced by Engineers.SG\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/7Z45/"
