description: "Paul Anderson\nPresident\nAnderson Software Group, Inc.\n\nGail Anderson\nResearch Director\nAnderson Software Group, Inc.\n\nMobile applications are becoming increasingly important for businesses. In this session we describe how you can leverage your Java and JavaFX skills to create mobile applications and deploy them on both iOS and Android platforms. With a plug-in from Gluon and your favorite IDE, you have a framework that gives you Write Once, Run Anywhere technology and a way to communicate with cloud data securely. We also show you how to decouple client-side code from the back-end implementation (e.g., Oracle Cloud) and why this is advantageous."
