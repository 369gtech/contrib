description: "Edward and I spent this summer teaching a full time Ruby on Rails and JavaScript course to a group of 30 students, many of whom had never programmed before. We'll talk about growing pains in the curriculum, parts of JavaScript that are easy and hard to learn (and why!), why we decided to teach this glass, what we got out of it, and what the students got out of it. More importantly, we'll talk about not just how we taught JavaScript, but how we used meta-JavaScript and JavaScript tools to facilitate the learning and the logistics of the course. What I mean to say is, how we used JavaScript in order to teach JavaScript.\n\nSource: http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/nick-small-and-edward-ocampogooding-what-we-learned-by-teachingjs.html\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
