description: "Join us for Kubernetes Forums Seoul, Sydney, Bengaluru and Delhi - learn more at kubecon.io \n\nDon't miss KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2020 events in Amsterdam March 30 - April 2, Shanghai July 28-30 and Boston November 17-20! Learn more at kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects \n\nIntroduction to CRI-O - Mrunal Patel, Red Hat, Inc. & Peter Hunt, Red Hat, Inc. \n\nYou have a lot of complicated things to think about as a developer and Kubernetes admin. Your container runtime shouldn't be one of them. CRI-O is there to be your \"no-worry\" CRI option. Running distributed applications, even with kubernetes, is a challenging task, and ultimately a developerâ€™s focus should be on providing value to their end-users. CRI-O is a container runtime designed to be secure and reliable and is developed exclusively for Kubernetes so that you can focus on what matters more. Join Mrunal Patel and Peter Hunt as they walk through the architecture and design of CRI-O and show you how to deploy and run with kubernetes, so you can choose it as your runtime, and promptly forget about it. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uai5"
