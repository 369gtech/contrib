description: "My Life as a Solo SRE\n\nBrian Murphy\n\n2015 was the worst year of my professional career. Between botched fail forward releases, major customer impacting incidents and weakly supported features, I was being worn down. And then in 2016, I helped introduce the organisation to SRE culture. I became the first SRE and helped change the engineering organisation. Over the next few months and years, I championed SLIs, drove down MTTA/MTTR and improved release cadence. In this talk, you will hear my tails of woe, but I will leave you with advice and tips on how to make your life and your organisation better.\n\nView the full SREcon19 Europe/Middle East/Africa Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19emea/program \n\nSign up to find out more about SREcon at https://srecon.usenix.org"
