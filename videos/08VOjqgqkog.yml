title: 'Hannes Lowette - Drinking a river of IoT data with Akka.NET'

description: 'You can''t develop a device any more without it connecting to something. These "smart" devices all have one thing in common: they generate a never-ending stream of data. If you want to process all that data for 100, 1000 or 10000 devices, you can probably get by with a very simple web stack. But as soon as you want to scale to 1000000 or more devices, you''re going to need a better strategy. Scaling software is always tricky. We all have been through this. You load balance your web farm only to find out that your database is a bottleneck. Or to find out you need to synchronize caches across your farm, etc. Akka.NET and its implementation of the actor model make scaling a bit easier. Developing stateful code becomes a breeze, as well as scaling it and making it resilient. But there are pitfalls as well. No prior Akka.NET knowledge is required for this talk.'
