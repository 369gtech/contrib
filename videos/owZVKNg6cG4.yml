title: 'Angular Applied by Yakov Fain'
language: English
recordingDate: 1510225553
description: "In this session, I'll introduce you to developing Web apps with Angular and TypeScript while working on a sample app. We'll start with generating a new app using Angular CLI. Then we'll add components and injectable services to this app, will set up the navigation using the router, and use other constructs of the Angular framework. A special attention will be paid to creating loosely-coupled components. Finally, we'll create a script to optimize and deploy this app in a Spring Boot app. I'll spend about 30% of the time going over slides to explain things, and 70% is live coding. I'll use the latest version of Angular available at the time of this session.\n\nYakov Fain works as a Solutions Architect at the IT consultancy Farata Systems. A Java Champion, he has taught multiple classes and workshops on the web and Java-related technologies, presented at international conferences, and published more than a thousand blog posts. Yakov is is a co-author of the Amazon Bestseller \"Angular 2 Development with TypeScript\" as well as a number of other books on programming. Yakov lives in New York City."
