description: "The talk from QA Fest conference in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nPresentation: https://bit.ly/2zsoBGE\nFb: https://www.facebook.com/QAFest/\nWebsite: http://qafest.com/\n\nHow good is your testing? Do you know? And if you do, can you explain why?\nOne way to measure the success of your testing is to compare the information you now have about your product, to the information you intended to gather when you started testing. That intention is what your test strategy should capture and communicate. That last word is important: communicate. Even the best testing in the world isn't worth anything if you can't communicate what you're going to do, what you've done, and why.\nIn this presentation I will show how I think about, model and visualize a strategy that is useful and that lets me later assess how well testing is fulfilling its mission, whether it's for hands-on testing that I'm doing to do on that particular day, or if I'm managing a multi-site project with cross-functional agile teams and need to construct a high-level starting point for test planning for the coming 6 months.\nFurthermore, I will discuss how to divide the strategy work between different project members and how to make sure that the quality assessments and reporting can be made valuable and, above all else, actionable by the project manager and product owners.\nThis talk is directed at all types of project members, managers and other stakeholders who works with product quality."
