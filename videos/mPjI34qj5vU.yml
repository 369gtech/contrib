description: "Digital Transformation of Vision Banco Paraguay with Serverless \nFunctions - Alex Ellis, VMware & Patricio Diaz, Vision Banco SAECA \n\nThis talk explores how a bank in Paraguay struggled with fire-fighting issues with their monolithic enterprise service bus code and embarked on a journey of digital transformation with serverless functions and Cloud Native technology. For Vision Banco SAECA Serverless with OpenFaaS gave an easy on-ramp to start making use of technology like Docker, Kubernetes and Prometheus within days through user-friendly abstractions and workflows. Patricio Diaz who leads the effort at the bank is now running two key parts of the home banking service (HomeServe) with OpenFaaS functions.    Due to the sensitive nature of the workloads - monitoring dashboards are important for the team and these were set up with the existing Prometheus data and Grafana. Given the initial success Patricio is working on moving more of the existing system functionality over to functions. \n\nTo learn more:  https://sched.co/GraO"
