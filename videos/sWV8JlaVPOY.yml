Learn more at https://kubecon.io The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.\n\nSponsored Session: VMware - Automatically Turn Your Source Code into Scalable Microservices on Kubernetes\n\nSpeakers: Boskey Savla\n\nDeploying and managing microservices on Kubernetes isn’t easy. You have to build the right dockerfile and container image and create various Kubernetes objects, like deployments, services, replicas, and horizontal pod autoscalers. And this is an iterative process with several testing and validation checkpoints along the way. Sound complex? It sure is.\n\nIn this demo, you’ll learn how to simplify and automate this with Cloud Native Buildpacks and Knative. Cloud Native Buildpacks figure out the language your code is written in, determine the best way to package the code, and build an OCI-compliant container image. And Knative takes that image and automatically generates the required configuration to create deployments, services, and automated pod scalers."
