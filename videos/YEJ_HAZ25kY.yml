description: "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Aarhus 2014\nhttp://gotocon.com\n\nDavid Evans - Agile Consultant, Specification by Example\n\nABSTRACT\nTo get the most out of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), Specification by Example (SBE) or Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD), you need much more than a tool. You need high value specifications. How do we get the most out of our specification and test writing effort? How do we write testable scenarios that business people will actually care about? These and other questions will be addressed in this talk in which we take a practical approach using real-world examples.\n\nIf you work with Cucumber, SpecFlow, Fitnesse or similar tools to support BDD and ATDD, you will learn how to avoid common mistakes that teams make when writing test scenarios. You will also learn to recognise the characteristics that take good scenario descriptions beyond the role of acceptance tests and into living documentation for long-term value.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com"
