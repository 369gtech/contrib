title: 'Java EE Microservices Platforms – what’s in it for me? (Mike Croft, UK)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1468314921
description: "In my experience as a middleware consultant I’ve often heard a question “which is best?”, asked about all kinds of tools and technologies. The answer is always an unhelpful “it depends…” because there is never an objective answer. Really, a better question is “which is most appropriate?”.\n\nFirst off, we’ll start with explaining Micro Service Architecture and microservices principles, busting some popular myths about using microservices with Java EE.\n\nThen we’ll investigate 3 ways of creating microservices and compare and contrast the ways they work and the features they provide. During the presentation I will analyse Spring Boot, WildFly Swarm and Payara Micro. I will also go through the available options and demo the features / shortcomings of each."
