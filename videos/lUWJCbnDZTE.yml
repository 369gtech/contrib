description: "Agile and Open Source – The perfect marriage?\r\n\nAgile and Open Source might be at first glance very different things, however they share many principles and certainly what they value the most is working software. Is it possible to be agile in an open source environment, where you basically have volunteers dedicating their time to work on something they love. Is it possible to make them work in projets having an Agile mindset?\r\n\nIn this talk I want to share the differences and similarities between Agile and Open Source and how Red Hat is engaged to work with the Open Source community and show that what is important is the Agile mindset. I will show examples how a team working with Fedora Modularity tracks and delivers incremental changes to the project using Open Source tools and how they are engaging with the community with the purpose of getting people outside of Red Hat to work with them."
