description: "Making the Most of Your SRE Toolbox: Bootstrapping Your SRE Team through Reuse\n\nMark Duquette, IBM DevOps Services SRE, and Tom Schmidt, IBM\n\nYou've spent the last year building tools and infrastructure to enable Continuous Delivery practices. Your next challenge; apply what youâ€™ve learned building out a Common Infrastructure environment to jumpstart your new SRE organization.\n\nSome of the same concepts that went into developing a comprehensive delivery pipeline can be used for SRE activities. \n\nIn this session, we will discuss how to re-purpose existing tools, dashboards and frameworks so that they can be used to enable \nSRE tasks. \n\nWe will explore these topics using real-world experiences as we worked to build out an effective SRE organization.\n\nView the full SREcon17 Americas Program at https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17americas/program"
