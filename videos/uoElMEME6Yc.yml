recordingDate: 1599161530
description: "Kubernetes has quickly become the de facto standard for container orchestration. However, there is no standard way to develop and operate an application running on Kubernetes. The Open Application Model (OMA) defines a standard way to build and run cloud-native applications. In this webinar, we will highlight the latest development in the OAM realm with live demos.\n\nPresenter:\nDr. Ryan Zhang, Staff Software Engineer @Alibaba Cloud"
