He show how it works in Google Earth and Google Maps, and talks about server-side coding techniques for generating the KML. And geo developer Brian Hamlin demonstrates a specific application of Dynamic KML, using PostGIS with Google Earth.\r\n\r\nThis talk is very useful for developers who want to use servers to store data, and show subsets to their users based on what is displayed in their viewport or browser."
