description: "Deep Dive: DotNet and CF Pipeline - Larry Smithmier & Nathan Allen-Wagner, Magenic\n\nFor organizations transitioning from traditional DotNet to CloudFoundry, the process can seem daunting. This session will walk through a narrow happy path for training and setting up a team for success, from a backlog and a blank screen to your first production deployment. Topics that will be discussed include kanban -vs- sprints, appropriate decomposition and user story sizing, scaffolding, source control and branching, build tooling, testing and gated builds, and deployments. Some common pitfalls will be examined and tricks to avoid grafting current bad practices to a new development platform will be covered as well.\n\nAbout Nathan Allen-Wagner\nNathan has been with Magenic for 5 years and has 20 years of experience designing, implementing, and supporting various types of systems from occasionally connected desktop apps to multi-user distributed systems, message oriented backend processes, and micro-services. He has worn many hats, including network admin, lead developer, project manager, product manager, dba, and solution architect. Nathan is passionate about well-crafted software, but also values simplicity, clarity, and actually shipping functionality. He has experience with numerous flavors of agile and SAFe, on teams both small and large. Nathan is a fan of .NET, especially .NET Core, and has spent time with every version of the frameworks since .NET first appeared on the scene.\n\nAbout Larry Smithmier\nLarry Smithmier has worked for Magenic for more than 6 years and has over 20+ years’ experience as a systems analyst & software engineer.
