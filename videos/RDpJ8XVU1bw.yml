SIG PM, originally established as a Product Management Group, today covers multiple aspects of Product, Program and Project Management of Kubernetes. In this session, the SIG PM co-chairs will provide a brief overview of SIG PM history and basic principles, the areas of interaction with the Kubernetes community, together with the information on how to start contributing to Kubernetes as a PM. \n\nhttps://sched.co/Uahh"
