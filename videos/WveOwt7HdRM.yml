title: 'YOW! Data 2021 - Zhamak Dehghani - Data Mesh; A principled introduction'

recordingDate: 1628827888
description: "For over half a century organizations have assumed that data is an asset to collect more of, and data must be centralized to be useful. These assumptions have led to centralized and monolithic architectures, such as data warehousing and data lake, that limit organization to innovate with data at scale.\n \nData Mesh as an alternative architecture and organizational structure for managing analytical data.\nIts objective is enabling access to high quality data for analytical and machine learning use cases - at scale.\n \nIt's an approach that shifts the data culture, technology and architecture\n- from centralized collection and ownership of data to domain-oriented connection and ownership of data\n- from data as an asset to data as a product\n- from proprietary big platforms to an ecosystem of self-serve data infrastructure with open protocols\n- from top-down manual data governance to a federated computational one.\n \nIn this talk, Zhamak will introduce the principles underpinning Data Mesh and architecture.\n\nZhamak Dehghani works with ThoughtWorks as the director of emerging technologies in North America, with a focus on distributed systems and data architecture, and a deep passion for decentralized technology solutions.\nShe founded the concept of Data Mesh in 2018, a shift in analytical data management toward data decentralization, and since has been implementing the concept and evangelizing it in the wider industry.\nZhamak serves on multiple tech advisory boards including ThoughtWorks and contributes to the creation of ThoughtWorks Technology Radar. Zhamak has worked as a technologist for over 20 years and has contributed to multiple patents, distributed computing communications, and embedded device technologies.\n\nFor more information on YOW!
