title: 'Vincent Pradeilles Property Wrappers at Mobile Era'
recordingDate: 1574413422
description: "Swift 5.1 brought a new construct to the language: Property Wrappers. SwiftUI, for instance, relies heavily on it to provide its system of data-binding through annotations like @State, @EnvironmentObjects, etc. Unlike other language improvements, Codable for instance, Apple hasn’t restricted the use of this new feature to its own frameworks: any codebase is free to leverage it to implement custom property attributes that will suit its own specific needs. While this is a great opportunity to factorise common behaviours throughout a project, one can still wonder: won’t it hurt code readability and predictability on the long run? Keeping code short is good, but if it’s achieved through a collection of arcane annotations, it might end up defying the original intent.\n\nAbout the speaker\nVincent started working on iOS apps back in 2011. For the last years, he’s been working at Worldline, where he contributes to building great apps for major French banks. He loves Swift and enjoys sharing about it on the Internet. Most notably, he built the framework KeyPathKit that implements a SQL-like syntax for data manipulation. He is also the person behind the Twitter account @ios_memes.\n\nAbout Mobile Era\nMobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo. We're passionate about developing mobile apps and want to see a kick-ass event in Oslo for people like ourselves. The organizing committee consists of developers who are also active in organizing open events, conferences and meetups in the Oslo developer community.\n\nOur topics: iOS / Android, Mobile web / PWA, Cross-platform / JS-to-Native, IoT / Hardware, Mobile UX / Accessibility\n\nFollow us on:\n\nWebsite: mobileera.rocks\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mobileeraconf\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mobileeraconf/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/mobileeraconf"
