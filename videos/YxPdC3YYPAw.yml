description: "Intro: Azure SIG - Stephen Augustus, VMware & Craig Peters, Microsoft \n\nIn the SIG Azure Intro, we’re going to tell you all about why SIG Azure exists and the team behind managing it. From there, we’ll talk about what’s happened over the last few releases, Kubernetes 1.14 and Kubernetes 1.15, as well as some of what’s planned for Kubernetes 1.16. Additionally, we’ll cover some user stories of implementing Kubernetes on Azure. Finally, and most importantly, we’ll talk all about some of the best ways to get involved with SIG Azure and all of the forums that we’re communicating on! \n\nhttps://sched.co/MPh9"
