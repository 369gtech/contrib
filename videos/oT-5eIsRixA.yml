description: 'Agile has become a very popular word, but in spite of that popularity, the software industry has not witnessed the transformation that we had hoped for in the early 2000s. Even though some of the practices have become widely accepted and successfully applied, I still see most organisations adopting agile ideas superficially and with at best temporary, local improvement. Although much larger forces drive this phenomenon, I have learned by trying how to describe agile ideas in ways that compel even my more skeptical clients and colleagues to give the practices a try. In this talk, I will share with you the most effective ways I''ve found so far to introduce agile concepts to my clients and colleagues.'
