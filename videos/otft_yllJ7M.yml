description: 'Some say they can read people and tell by their expressions or body language what kind of personality they have. But what if it is possible to read people from the code they write? It would perhaps be possible to tell who to avoid because they are a little bit aggressive and who to approach because they like to help out other people. In this talk we will explore what research is conducted on the relation between personality traits and programming semantics.'
