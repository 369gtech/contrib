language: English
recordingDate: 1639542663
description: "tanzu.tv/tt/77  \n\nThis summer the TAP team made a choice to build the Tanzu Application Platform’s GUI on top of the OSS project Backstage. We’ll discuss the reasons that led to that choice, the lessons learned along the way, as well as where we want to take OSS Backstage, TAP GUI, and the TAP GUI plugins moving forward.  \n\n* * *\n\nKris Applegate recently joined VMware from the other side of Dell Technologies. After spending 17.5 years at Dell EMC in various roles, he decided it was time to explore his passion for Kubernetes and Cloud-native workloads. He’s the Technical Lead for the Tanzu Activation Program, which includes Tanzu Application Platform GUI, Tanzu Learning Center, Tanzu Community Edition for Developers, and the TAP Unboxing experience."
