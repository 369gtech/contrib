His latest book, The Practice of Network Security Monitoring, contains Richard's latest thinking on the subject, as well as an introduction to the premier open source NSM distribution, Security Onion.\n\nRichard will show how NSM can help you implement a security strategy that wins against a variety of intruders, based on fast, comprehensive, and accurate incident detection, response, and containment.\n\nAbout Richard Bejtlich\n\nRichard Bejtlich is Chief Security Officer at MANDIANT.
