description: "Rod began writing Spring in 2001. Eighteen years later, it's stronger than ever, thanks to the work of waves of exceptional committers. \n\nIn this talk, Rod will examine why Spring has had such longevity. What architectural principles and decisions helped? What mistakes needed to be fixed? How was it possible for such an amazing team and community to grow? How did it navigate the changing problems and possibilities of the JVM ecosystem? \n\nRod will discuss some of the key things that make successful frameworks, including: \n\nthe Open/Closed principle\nthe role of Design Patterns\nclear layering\nconsistent coding conventions\nabstraction from the underlying environment\npractical application of academic research\n\nWhat lessons can you apply to designing your own framework? Rod will use the open-source project he’s currently working on——the Atomist Software Delivery Machine project——as an example of the decision process.\n\nSpeaker: Rod Johnson, CEO, Atomist\nSlideshare: https://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/eighteen-years-of-spring\nFilmed at SpringOne Platform 2019"
