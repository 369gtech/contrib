description: "Scaling your application servers is easy with microservices, but the actual scaling and operation challenge is the data. Your database is your bottleneck and the biggest scaling and availability concern. Working with a large scale distributed system entails many challenges in data processing.\n\nHow do you handle distributed transactions?\n\nHow to scale your data beyond a single data center and how to handle the eventual consistency state that you may cause by doing that?\n\nHow do you migrate data and database schemas without downtime?\n\nAnd many more issues when the world of microservices and large scale meets databases.\n\nIn this talk we’ll try to answer this kind of questions, by exploring some patterns used by Wix.com, which operates hundreds of microservices and petabytes of data across multiple datacenters, as well as multiple clouds on a large scale. Hopefully you can adapt some of these patterns to better handle your data."
