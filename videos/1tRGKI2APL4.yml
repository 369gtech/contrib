description: "Java agents are pluggable self-contained components that run embedded in a JVM and intercept the class-loading process. Java agents can be loaded statically at startup or dynamically at runtime to attach to a running process in a fail-safe fashion. This session covers different aspects of Java agents’ functionality and implementation details by discussing usage examples and real-world experiences. It also covers several commercial tools that leverage the agents’ functionality. You will learn how to implement an agent and apply the Java instrumentation API in combination with bytecode manipulation libraries to carry out interesting tasks. The session also presents the case for native agent implementation.\n\n\nAuthors:\nAnton Arhipov\nJRebel (@jrebel) product junkie @ ZeroTurnaround, vim fan and IntelliJ addict http://linkd.in/aarhipov\nView more trainings by Anton Arhipov at https://www.parleys.com/author/anton-arhipov\n\nNikita Salnikov-Tarnovski\nMore than 10 years in Enterprise Java development for the largest custom software development company in the Baltics.
