description: "Originally recorded January 30, 2014. In the world of ever growing data volumes, how do you extract insight, trends and meaning from all that data in Hadoop? Do you need help transforming your big data into big knowledge?\n\nOrganizations know that the key to competitive advantage is in using advanced analytics to discover trends and use them to your advantage faster than the competition. Getting relevant information from big data requires a different approach. Churning out a couple of analytical models a week isn't going to cut it. If you're using big data to identify trends, spot weaknesses and predict outcomes, you need proven analytical software that's a lot faster, more efficient, accurate, and easy to use.\n\nLearn more about how to reveal insights in your Big data and redefine how your organization solves complex problems.\n\nYou will learn how to:\n\nUse sophisticated analytics in both a visual interface and a coding interface.\nPrepare, explore and model multiple scenarios using data volumes never before possible to generate accurate and rapid insights. Interact with the data to add or drop variables into the model and instantly see how their influence provides increased predictive power.\nEasily perform modeling tasks interactively and on-the-fly\nQuickly understand your model fit with model diagnostics - interactively and in real time (typically in seconds instead of hours or days).\nAsk what-if questions on all the data.\nUse a scalable recommendation system to help improve customer experience through profiling users and items and finding how to relate them\n\nAbout Wayne Thompson\n\nWayne Thompson is the Manager of SAS Predictive Analytics Product Management at SAS.Over the course of his 20-year tenure at SAS he has been credited with bringing to market landmark SAS analytics technologies (SAS Text Miner, SAS Credit Scoring for Enterprise Miner, SAS Model Manager, SAS Rapid Predictive Modeler, SAS Scoring Accelerator for Teradata, and SAS Analytics Accelerator for Teradata).
