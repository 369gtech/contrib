description: "Serverless is the latest phase in the evolution of cloud development. Its building blocks are functions, a bunch of stateless “nano-services”, that can scale automatically and charged only when used. In this talk I'll cover the Serverless Architectures practices, use cases and tooling.\n\nThis spring over 9400 IT specialists took part in Code Europe, the largest programming conference in Poland! Follow our website for more details: https://www.codeeurope.pl/en The next edition of Code Europe is coming in December!"
