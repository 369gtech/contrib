description: "J. Paul Reed, Director of Site Reliability Services/Principal Consultant, Salesforce\n\nKevina Finn-Braun, Director of Site Reliability Services, Salesforce\n\nAs organizations experiment with greater concurrency and integration between their departments and move toward a continuous delivery of customer-value, failure is assured. Asking “how can failure be avoided?” isn’t as useful or relevant as focusing on\n\n– “How does our organization react when failure occurs?” and\n– “How do we create a sustainable, actionable process for describing, exploring, and remedying failure?”\n\nThis is the question that presented itself to Salesforce’s Service Reliability Engineering team. Their SREs had received training in incident response and management, but were still struggling with how to incorporate that feedback into the organization at large, to improve outcomes. Feedback loops weren’t always closed, leaving many opportunities for improvement lost.\n\nThis is the story of my months-long journey with Kevina and her team to identify the specifics of what made reliability retrospectives difficult to have, why actionable takeaways were often lacking, and how the feedback loops within the company’s operations organization weren’t serving Salesforce’s needs.\n\nWe then ran a series of experiments together, putting the SRE team on a road to improving their ability to respond, react, remediate, and reincorporate learnings from failure into the organization."
