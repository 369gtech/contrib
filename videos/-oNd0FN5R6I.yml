description: "Henri Tremblay, Senior Software Engineer, Terracotta, a Software AG company\nAnthony Dahanne, Software Developer, Software AG\n\nIs caching data in your application still relevant today, with all those HTTP caches, very fast key value stores, and microservices? During this presentation, you will learn the basics of caching (TTL, TTI, invalidation, tiering, and so on), key figures in the caching world, how the Java community came up with a specification (JSR 107), and how you can leverage it in your application with the implementation of your choice (EhCache 3). During the multiple demos, you’ll even see how you can sync up your (clustered) caches when you start scaling your application."
