description: "In this talk I'll presente an overview of deepfakes - how depfakes are being misused in the society to propagate propaganda, how they undermine trust, and how you can generate deepfakes. Finally I'll delve into how you can spot deepfakes and how you can detect deepfakes using AI.\n\nNiladri Shekhar Dutt is a data scientist at Sentinel (https://thesentinel.ai/) where he works with governments and security agencies to defend against deepfakes and information warfare.\n\n\n\nwww.pydata.org\r\n\r\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other.
