recordingDate: 1216950532
description: 'Alex Martelli, a well-published Python developer and Google''s Über Tech Lead, has some fairly strong convictions about code reviewing, and he''s not afraid to share them.  Alex believes that there''s no enough code reviewing being done in the open source community, and enumerated several of them for O''Reilly News at OSCON 2008.  He also addresses the increasing availability of tools for organizing code reviews, and some lessons that even the largest companies can take to heart.'
