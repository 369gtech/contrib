title: 'OSCON 2016 - Getting started contributing to Apache Spark by Holden Karau (IBM)'
recordingDate: 1479842271
description: 'Apache Spark is one of the most popular tools for big data and with 400+ open pull requests as of this writing, very active in terms of development as well. With such a large volume of contributions, it can be hard to know how to begin contributing yourself. Holden Karau offers a developer-focused head start, walking you through how to find good issues, formatting code, finding reviewers, and what to expect in the code review process. Holden also explores alternatives to contributing to Apache Spark directly (such as creating packages).'
