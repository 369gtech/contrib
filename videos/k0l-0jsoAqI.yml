description: "Facebook moves fast on mobile, shipping the mobile application at least twice a month to hundreds of millions of diverse devices. We also want to make sure the application is fast, as this is a primary ingredient in a delightful user experience. This talk walks through how Facebook thinks about performance as a feature, how it measures success, and deep dives in to the tools we’ve built to improve performance, prevent regressions and enable an amazing experience for everyone.\n\nMike Magruder is a software engineer at Facebook focused on Mobile Performance and Tools. Mike joined Facebook in 2013 where he worked on the HHVM runtime before moving to mobile. Previously he was an architect on the Microsoft Common Language Runtime (CLR) and Bing’s internal application platform.\n\nFor more on YOW! Conference, visit http://www.yowconference.com.au"
