Despite the impacts of COVID-19 descimating industries and livelihoods, open source professionals have been a rare bright spot. The Linux Foundation partnered with edX, the non-profit learning platform developed by Harvard and MIT, to produce the 2020 Open Source Jobs Report, which surveyed hiring managers and open source pros to gain insight into trends in hiring and retention across the industry.   In this session, Linux Foundation SVP & GM, Training & Certification Clyde Seepersad digs into the findings in the new report, including how COVID has impacted careers, but also which technologies and roles are growing in importance. Clyde discusses growing demand for technologies like cloud and containers, the need for more pros with skills like DevOps, incentives used by employers to retain top talent, and what open source pros say motivates them. \n\nhttps://sched.co/ff0N"
