title: '#8 e-Meetup | Susanne Kaiser - Designing a Serverless Application with Domain Driven Design'
language: English

description: "With Serverless/FaaS the unit of work is a fine-grained, ephemeral function triggered by a variety of events. One approach could be by introducing DDD - itâ€™s a methodology to capture a business domain as closely as possible into software coming with strategic and tactical design patterns. \n\nIn this talk, I highlighted how Domain Driven Design and Serverless/FaaS can go together by splitting a system into Bounded Contexts and how these Bounded Contexts can be implemented by using Serverless technologies."
