description: "As the British capitalâ€™s boroughs and public sector bodies seek to meet spiraling demand in the face of reduced budgets, the London Office of Data Analytics, a collaboration between the Greater London Authority, Nesta, and ASI Data Science, is exploring the potential of applying data analytics to reform public services. Eddie Copeland shares lessons learned from piloting the London Office of Data Analytics.\n\nThe pilot program focused on using data to predict the location of properties rented out to multiple tenants where the landlord has failed to obtain the correct license. There are estimated to be tens of thousands of these unlicensed houses of multiple occupancy (HMOs) across London, but only a small minority are correctly licensed, representing a loss of revenue for local authorities and often presenting dangerous living conditions for vulnerable tenants. Eddie explores how the team at the London Office of Data Analytics overcame the barriers to joining up, analyzing, and acting upon public sector data at city scale to address this important challenge.\n\nSubscribe to O'Reilly on YouTube: http://goo.gl/n3QSYi\n\nFollow O'Reilly on \nTwitter: http://twitter.com/oreillymedia\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/OReilly\nGoogle: http://plus.google.com/+oreillymedia"
