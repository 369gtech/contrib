description: "Journey on Embedding SRE in Data Platforms: Insights & Lessons\n\nKarthikeyan Selvaraj and Rajesh Ramachandran, PayPal\n\nDevOps philosophies today are mostly associated with service and web-based applications. With the invention of ML and AI, data is now capable of driving innovation, thereby creating new markets and revenues where the typical DevOps for building/optimizing code builds and delivery is only one piece of the bigger puzzle in the data analytics space.\n\nIt becomes significantly more important to include SRE processes such as instrumentation, metrics, and monitoring with proper change management controls as part of Data DevOps. In this talk, we share our journey on building the Governed Data DevOps Platform with abstracted technology management and embedded SRE workflows for thousands of its Data Engineers and Scientists. It covers how we were able to successfully run a reliable data platform with zero disruptions.\n\nThe talk covers in detail how to:\n\n- Successfully run a reliable data platform with zero disruptions\n- Embed SRE processes within the Data Development/Analytics process\n- Provide monitoring frameworks to efficiently run Data Platforms\n- Overcome the challenges that were faced in this journey\n\nKarthikeyan Selvaraj has more than 14 years of experience in software product development, worked as a consultant for companies such as Google, Linkedin, and Apple, and is currently leading Data DevOps Platform within PayPal.
