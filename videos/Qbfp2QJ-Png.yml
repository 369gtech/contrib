language: English
recordingDate: 1574400516
description: "Speakers: Jing Xu, Manu Batra\nGetting started in containers and Kubernetes can be daunting, especially when coming from the Virtual Machines world. The differences in storage models adds to the confusion. This session will explain the storage and data management differences between Virtual Machines and Containers. Specifically we will focus on:\n\n- Translating the VM terminology and challenges to the Kubernetes container world.\n- Drawing architectural parallels between the two approaches including storage operations and communication fundamentals.\n- Discouraging the impulse to tackle storage problems the same way on Kubernetes as was done in the VM world.\n\nYou will leave this talk with an understanding of how storage works in Kubernetes ecosystem, with parallels to VM/hosts storage terminology, architecture, and operations."
