description: "Pub is the package manager for Dart. With pub, you can manage libraries and dependencies for your Dart apps. This video shows you an early preview of pub and gives a demo of a Dart app with 3rd party libraries installed by the pub command line.\n\nDart is a new structured web programming language, libraries, and virtual machine. Dart works across the modern web, thanks to its Dart to JavaScript compiler. You can try Dart, and pub, today at http://www.dartlang.org"
