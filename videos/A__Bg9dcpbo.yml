language: English
recordingDate: 1510448401
description: "Implementing IoT projects doesn't have to be difficult, time consuming and expensive.\n\nMicroPython brings Python 3 to embedded platforms, and since Python is one of the easiest languages to learn, and there are WiFi SoCs available around $5, this is a great way to get started in IoT! We'll look at:\n\n    1. What is a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) with some specific examples based on the ESP8266 and ESP32 WiFi SoCs\n    2. Why Python? A quick look at C and IoT vulnerabilities\n    3. How to install MicroPython and communicate with the ESP SoC to write programs\n   4.  What it is capable of and what things are being developed for it\n   5. How to contribute to the MicroPython project\n\nNick is a enthusastic about the Internet, passionate about open source and downright zealous about Python.\n\nHe has worked in systems administration, programming, research, standardization, teaching and systems integration in companies from startups to multinational giants. He has previously presented at IETF, OSDC, PyConAU, LinuxConfAU and BuzzConf as well as many user groups.\n\nFor more information on YOW! Conference, visit, http://connected.yowconference.com.au"
