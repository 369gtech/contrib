description: "Portability is one of the main benefits of TensorFlow -- you can easily move a neural network model to Android and run predictions on mobile phones, for all kinds of AI tricks from image recognition to motion recognition. But models are often large (tens of megabytes) and prediction can consume lots of CPU power. In this session, we'll share tips and tricks on overcoming these challenges so you can bring the latest AI technologies to your Android app.\n\nSee all the talks from Google I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/D0D4VE\nWatch more Android talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/c0LWYl\nWatch more Chrome talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/Q1bFGY\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O '17 here: https://goo.gl/pmO4Dr\n\nSubscribe to the Google Developers channel: http://goo.gl/mQyv5L\n\n#io17 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2017"
