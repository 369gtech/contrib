recordingDate: 1401178743
description: 'AngularJS lets you use today the features of next-generation web standards, making front-end development more productive and fun. What''s better, it provides its "magic" tools such as databinding, dependency injection, modularity, composable and event-driven architecture to both web AND mobile apps. This "code-based" interactive talk will share some lessons learned in the development of mobile sites and apps with Angular, from how to structure applications, tune bandwidth and performance, interact with mobile-specific elements such as touch, sensors, and native-looking UX with Ionic Framework.'
