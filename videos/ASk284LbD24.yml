description: "My grandfather served in the US Navy during World War II. His ship was sunk by the Japanese. He then spent 3.5 years as a Prisoner of War on the Burma-Thai Death Railway (\"The Bridge on The River Kwai\").\n\nIf all goes well, this summer I'll be scuba diving the wreck / grave site.\n\nI can also talk about our Indiegogo crowd-funding efforts."
