description: "Running a Publicly Available Developer Sandbox - Andrew Gracey, SUSE\n\nSo, you've built your platform, what next? How do you get users onboarded? How do you make sure everything works externally? How do you stop problems before they occur? In running the SUSE Developer Sandbox, we've learned a lot about the rough edges of Cloud Foundry and have found some nice ways to smooth them out. Join me for a talk about the lessons we've learned in the last 6 months and 500 users!"
