description: "Video recording of a presentation given at JDK IO conference in Copenhagen in June 2018 at the IT-University organized by the Danish Java User Group - Javagruppen.\n\nhttps://jdk.io/jdk-io-2018/speakers/216-nicolas-frankel\n\nSpring Boot and Kotlin, a match made in Heaven\n\nSpeaker: Nicolas Frankel\n\nDespite being quite recent, Spring Boot has seen a spectacular start as an amazing kickstarter for Spring-based application. You can now start your project in a matter of minutes, not days!\n\nOn the other hand, you're still using Java, with all its ceremony regarding code... Wouldn't it be great if we could pair Spring Boot with a powerful yet simple language?\n\nIn this talk, I'll live code a Spring Boot application using Kotlin, the friendly language provided by JetBrains. Come discover how you can now cut through all the red tape and finally focus only the important stuff."
