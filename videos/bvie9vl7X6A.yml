description: "Video from Devoxx Poland 2019.\n\nSoftware architecture should enable business agility, but often it does not happen because the mismatch between product design and software architecture. In this talk Sandro will describe how a software design approach, focused on behaviour and also driven from the external interactions and business flows, can enable a better collaboration between business and technology. This talk shows techniques (used in real projects) to bring product and software design together, at the same time, produce an Agile architecture that is more resilient, focused and fully aligned to business goals."
