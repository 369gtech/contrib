description: "The book industry is undergoing rapid changes, and the fallout is just beginning. Seismic industry changes always bring success and opportunity to some, transformation and consolidation to others, and failure to those who get left behind. At no time has publishing been in a similar crossroads, where both content format and the delivery methods are changing at the same time. To survive and thrive in publishing today, content must be enabled for flexibility and portability. Publishers are looking to control costs and gain efficiencies in warehousing, print, and physical and digital distribution. Consumers are demanding to read what, how, when, and where they choose. As the pressure to invest in the future of content becomes increasingly important, critical operating and capital investment decisions need to be made quickly to survive. The opportunities are not only there, but growing, and who gets a share, how much and when, is still wide open. Prichard is known for financial turnarounds while executing strategic business shifts. During this keynote Skip will share insights he has learned during his career with early digital pioneers like LexisNexis, ProQuest, a deep-content publisher of academic and scholarly content, and Ingram Content Group, now a global powerhouse at the intersection of publishing and retailing.\n\nDavid \"Skip\" Prichard\n\nIngram Content Group Inc.\n\nSkip Prichard is President & Chief Executive Officer of Ingram Content Group Inc.
