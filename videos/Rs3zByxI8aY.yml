description: "Harbor is an open source cloud native registry that securely stores container images, signs them as trusted, and scans them for vulnerabilities.\n\nHarbor solves common challenges by delivering trust, compliance, performance, and interoperability. It fills a gap for organizations and applications that cannot use a public or cloud-based registry, or want a consistent experience across clouds.\n\nDuring this webinar, project lead James Zabala will demonstrate how Harbor can be used to provide a consistent cross-cloud registry experience. We’ll also discuss Harbor’s architecture, deployment options, and the project’s roadmap."
