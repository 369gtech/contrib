description: "http://CppCon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2018\n—\nGit and CMake are already established standards in our community. However, it is uncommon to see them being used in an efficient way. As a result, many C++ projects have big problems with either importing other dependencies or making themselves easy to import by others. It gets even worse when we need to build many different configurations of our package on one machine. \n\nThat presentation lists and addresses the problems of build system and packaging that we have with large, multi-platform, C++ projects that often have many external and internal dependencies. The talk will present how proper use of CMake and Conan package manager can address those use cases. It will also describe current issues with the cooperation of those tools.\n\nIf you've attended or seen my talk at C++Now 2018, that time you can expect much more information on Conan and package creation using that tool. I will also describe how the integration of CMake and Conan changed over the last few months.\n— \nMateusz Pusz, Epam Systems\nChief Software Engineer\n\nSoftware architect, chief developer, and security champion with more than 14 years of experience in designing, writing and maintaining C++ code for fun and living.
