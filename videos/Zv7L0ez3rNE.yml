title: 'DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Life on the Edge: CDN and HTTPS Delivery in 2017'
recordingDate: 1506597377
description: "It's been possible for a while to deploy HTTPS with fast negotiation. Yet, many sites\_pay a heavy tax on performance by only deploying HTTPS from\_their origin (LAMP-style) infrastructure. In this presentation, we'll look at deployment strategies for HTTPS and CDNs --\_as well as\_their impacts. We'll also consider how well Drupal 8 integrates with each of these models and rigorous ways to measure results.\n\nWe'll look at these deployment models:\n\nJust a reverse proxy cache (like Varnish)\nTraditional, asset-push CDNs\nHTTPS just at the origin\nHybrid HTTPS from the origin for pages with CDN HTTPS for other assets\nHTTPS deployed via CDN\nAnd we'll consider their impacts on:\n\nSecurity\nCost\nDevice compatibility\nOngoing maintenance requirements\nSite visitor experience\nSearch-engine rankings\nTo bring everything fully into 2017, we'll also look at:\n\nIPv6 and the surprising impacts on mobile performance\nThe promise (and limits) of HTTP/2\nHow all of these technologies and services\_work (or don't work)\_with BigPipe"
