description: 'You’re at DockerCon and have spent the last two days deep in sessions, the Hallway Track, and networking. You’ve heard the stories, learnings and benefits from large and small organizations that are on their devops and app modernization journey with Docker. You may have even begun to identify multiple use cases for Docker at your work and how it could benefit your business and other teams. In this session, Jim Armstrong of Docker will share how other Docker users have built their cases for broader use of Docker in their organizations. He will share real experiences of developers convincing their ops teams, ops teams introducing Docker to their developers, and passionate Docker users convincing IT executives to adopt Docker.'
