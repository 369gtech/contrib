description: "Julian Fischer, CEO of anynines guides through the journey of building a highly available, self-provisioning PostgreSQL Cloud Foundry service. The talk is meant to share experience collected in the anynines team from years of building production grade backing services. PostgreSQL in particular is a good example as it has never been built to be fully automated. Challenges such as setting up a proper replication, detect failure scenarios and perform automatic failovers are interesting challenges with many pitfalls for beginners. Learn about production requirements, technical challenges and have a look at an exemplary architecture to learn about building failure resilient Cloud Foundry data services. \n\nJulian Fischer\nanynines\nCEO\nJulian Fischer is CEO of anynines. As an expert for digital transformation he has been attending hundreds of IT conferences and speaking at dozens including several Cloud Foundry events. His passion for Cloud Foundry was the motivation to found anynines, a startup entirely focused on cloud-native software development and operations. anynines has been the first Cloud Foundry based public PaaS and is entirely operated under German jurisdiction. With more than three years of Cloud Foundry operation experience anynines has established in CF related enterprise operations and consulting for central europe.
