recordingDate: 1552546818
description: "Presented by Brian M. Carlson, Git Ecosystem Engineer, GitHub\n\n\"Git has long used SHA-1 to identify objects in its datastore, but recent cryptanalytic advances have rendered SHA-1 weak. There's ongoing work to transition to SHA-256, which is more secure. We'll cover the transition plan, where we are with it, what's involved in the transition work, and how we're going to provide interoperability between versions of Git using different hash algorithms.\"\n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels. Git Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and to showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from contributors, maintainers and community managers around the world.
