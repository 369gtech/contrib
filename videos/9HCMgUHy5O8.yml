title: 'Bryn Llewellyn - Ten Rules for Doing a PL/SQL Performance Experiment'
language: English
recordingDate: 1533210572
description: 'I’m often asked to comment on a speed difference between two PL/SQL tests. Usually, the tests are presented as SQL*Plus spool files, whose differs in just a couple of tiny details. The times are measured, for just a single test run, using SET TIMING ON and are shown like “Elapsed: 00:00:02.36”, with indefensible precision. Sometimes the times are shorter. This is no way to conduct a performance experiment! This session tells you how to do your experiment properly with reference to a real, and interesting, case study. Though the title says “PL/SQL” the method described applies to any single-user test that runs entirely inside Oracle Database. I said “ten rules” to get your attention. Of course, there are actually rather more rules.'
