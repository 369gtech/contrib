description: "Spring I/O 2018 - Barcelona, 24-25 May\n\nCoroutines is a new feature in Kotlin 1.1. It allows for writing an asynchronous code almost like it was regular/synchronous. If you combine it with Spring you'll get a powerful tool for creating fast, scalable, non-blocking applications.\n\nIn this session, I'll show how coroutines can be used in Spring-based applications, what sort of problems can be encountered and how to solve them. I'll also present a glimpse of the spring-kotlin-coroutine library, which is a one-stop solution for Spring/coroutines interoperability."
