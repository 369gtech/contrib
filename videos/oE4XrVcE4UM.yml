title: 'How Modern SQL Databases Come up with Algorithms that You Would Have Never Dreamed Of (vJUG)'
language: English
recordingDate: 1495023453
description: "SQL is the only ever successful, mainstream, and general-purpose 4GL (Fourth Generation Programming Language) and it is awesome!\n\nWith modern cost based optimisation, relational databases like Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL finally keep up to the promise of a powerful declarative programming model by adapting to ever changing productive data without performance penalties. Thousand-line-long, complex SQL statements can be run in far below a millisecond against billion-row strong tables if database developers know their ways around the SQL language - and the best news is: It's not that hard!\n\nIn this talk, I'll show how the SQL database will constantly outperform any hand written data retrieval algorithm - or in other words - how SQL, being a logic language, is the best language for business logic.\n\nSimon Maple\nSimon is a Developer Advocate at ZeroTurnaround, and is all about community discussion and interaction. His passion around technical communities led him to become the founder and organiser of the vJUG (virtualJUG), as well as continuing to be an active leader of the London Java Community (LJC). Simon’s energy in building and driving the Java community forward culminated in him becoming a Java Champion in 2014. Previously, Simon worked for IBM for almost 12 years, testing, developing and evangelising WebSphere Application Server. He is an experienced speaker, having presented at JavaOne, DevoxxUK, DevoxxFR, IBM Impact, JDC, JMaghreb and many more (including the vJUG :) ), and is a keen technical writer for RebelLabs.\n\nLukas Eder\nI am the founder and CEO of Data Geekery GmbH, located in Zurich, Switzerland. With my company I have been selling database products and services around Java and SQL since 2013. Ever since my Master’s studies at EPFL in 2006, I have been fascinated by the interaction of Java and SQL. Most of this experience I have obtained in the Swiss E-Banking field through various variants (JDBC, Hibernate, mostly with Oracle). I am happy to share this knowledge at various conferences, JUGs, in-house presentations and on my blog. Here’s my conference and JUG talk schedule for the most recent time: http://www.jooq.org/news."
