The Network Service Mesh (or NSM) Project attempts to simplify how multi-cluster networking is consumed in Kubernetes by extending the core concepts that are already familiar to the K8s community. This talk will demonstrate how easy it is becoming for developers to consume networking via NSM, when we change our 35-year old view of IP networking. \n\nhttps://sched.co/UdLh"
