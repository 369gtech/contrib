title: 'Elisa Coluccia: Information Overload - How to Survive in the Era of Push Notifications at Stretch'
recordingDate: 1582182001
description: "If you are struggling between slack notifications, emails, that piece of report you’re trying to finish, and the 13th meeting of the day, well, this talk is for you. Would you like to know what are the superpowers to effectively managing distractions and important information? \n\nAs the Nobel prize Herbert Simon wrote, “a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention”. We are every day exposed to a massive amount of information that, especially now, reach us out in an increasing “pushy” way. Whether we are at work or in our home after dinner, we are constantly bombarded by notifications, emails, slack messages. To translate it in numbers, our mind can consume a maximum of 120 bit/sec and we are exposed to over 34 gigabytes of contents every day. With this presentation, we will talk about the importance of allocating our attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that takes it away. We will discuss strategies to recover the focus and taking control over the huge amount of information that we are exposed to. We will learn some techniques on how to leverage the overload of content for improving our ability of decision making.\n\nStretch is a non-profit leadership and management conference that brings 500 attendees and 16 speakers from all around the world who want to build effective organizations since 2013.
