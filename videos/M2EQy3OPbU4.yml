description: "Google Tech Talks\nJune 27, 2007\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe address the problem of sketching the hamming distance of data streams. We develop Fixable Sketches which compare data streams or files and restore the differences between them. Our contribution: For two streams with Humming distance bounded by k we show a sketch of size O(klogn) with O(logn) processing time per new element in the stream and how to restore all locations where the two streams differ in time linear in the sketch size. Probability of error is less then 1/n.\n\nSpeaker: Ely Porat\nAt age 16 Ely Porat multithreaded being a junior in high school, a freshman in the computer science department of Bar Ilan university and hacking computers...."
