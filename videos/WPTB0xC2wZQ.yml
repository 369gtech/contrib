Are you looking for techniques to increase your team’s creativity? How about more positive-attitude team meetings? How about saying “Yes and” instead of “Yes but”? Have you heard about the importance of plussing, a term introduced by Walt Disney?\n\nJoin me to this interactive session. There will be plenty of interaction, games, fun and brainstorming. Duration is ~45 mins. Want to read more before the talk? I totally recommend Creativity, Inc, from Ed Catmull, president of Pixar and Disney animations.\n\nOnly \"yes and\" answers accepted!\n\nAlexandros Zotos \nFrom Amazon\nBeing agile, creative, positive, team player, with vision and common sense are my basic principles, not only in work but also in life.\nArchitecting and building distributed, reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems is my passion.\nDid you say Operational Excellence and Best Practices? You had my curiosity but now you have my attention\nAble to bring value on project startups, project integration/maintenance/scaling/robustness and legacy systems.\nAble to provide research, since during my academic career I have produced a number of articles which have been published in international journals/conferences\nGive talks/trainings for Scrum, Chaos Engineering, NoSQL, ThreadConcurrency and lately for Improv at work and life!"
