recordingDate: 1485324869
description: "The Swift programming language is now in its third year of life, and a number of patterns and common practices are arising. This talks is not about them. We’ll explore some less conventional, yet very effective and elegant ways to write Swift code, inspired by the functional programming world.\n\nWe won’t be talking hipster-monadic-burritos, but real actionable tools and technique that you can bring back to work tomorrow and easily introduce to your team-mates. In fact these concepts will all be introduced together with their real world usages.\n\nCome and see how thinking outside of the box and writing code in a bit less conventional way can make you a lot more productive.\n\nGio is developer with a passion for testing and infrastructure, focused on iOS development, and blogs about these and other topic on http://mokacoding.com\n\nHe loves learning new things and has recently picked up Haskell, and speed-cubing. In his spare time he likes to swim and read about cosmology.\n\nIf you talk with him, it won’t be long before he’ll mention his love for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nFor more on YOW!
