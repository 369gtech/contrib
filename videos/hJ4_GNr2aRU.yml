title: 'Bring your PHP website to the world - Jonas Birgander & Adam Heurlin'
recordingDate: 1443105623
description: "Imagine a website that started in a basement and now wants to conquer the world. What does that involve? Can a market entry plan include rewriting the database structure? Prisjakt is on that journey and has learned some lessons to share. Of course there is a lot of content and marketing to the site, but we will focus on code and infrastructure.\n\nYou will hear about databases designed under the assumption that there would be only one language and that all servers would be in the same datacenter. (The first country we expanded to was on the other side of the globe.) You will learn a way to have different feature sets for different regions. There will also be talk about converting both the site and the database from Latin-1 to UTF-8. (Quite an adventure for a PHP based site, which ended well.) And then we have translations…\n\nGeekiness is in the Prisjakt DNA, so features in the code are explored as rigorously as the features of the products you can find on the site. PHP is not only a quick language to get started with, correctly\nused it can power really big and globally used applications. We will share with you what we learned so far.\n\nFoo Café is an independent and physical meeting place for people of all backgrounds and expertise within the IT-industry in the Malmö/Lund region. Foo Café is aimed at those interested in sharing, learning and creating. \nJoin the fun at foocafe.org"
