recordingDate: 1534161101
description: "Anita Singh, Senior Android Engineer Beginner APIs, Winnie\n\nFONTS, EMOJI AND TEXT USING SUPPORT LIBRARIES\nBeginner / APIs / Talk\n\nAndroid Oreo introduced exciting text changes that make it easier to use custom fonts, communicate with emojis, reduce APK size, and expand or contract textviews dynamically. Luckily, the Support Libraries from v26 onwards allow us to implement these features with backwards compatibility.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how to implement these text changes with the help of the Support Libraries, and their limitations. You will also learn about how they are natively implemented by the framework versus the Support Libraries.\n\nAt the end of this session, you will have an increased understanding of the inner workings of Fonts in XML, Downloadable Fonts, EmojiCompat and autosizing of TextViews, as well as be ready to update your apps with them without the fear of the unknown!"
