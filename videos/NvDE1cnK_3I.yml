title: 'Webinar: Observability of multi-party computation with OpenTelemetry'
language: English
recordingDate: 1595533553
description: "You have seen the impact of observability in enhancing the understanding and pace of development of complex systems. With the latest innovation in managing logs through the OpenTelemetry project, we can now combine together multiple blockchain systems to report fine-grained information into a comprehensive consortium view.\n\nIn this talk, we will show you a reference architecture to integrate best of breed technologies: Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry Collector and Hyperledger Fabric.\n\nWe will show how information such as traces, metrics and logs is captured and aggregated at the level of each member of the consortium. We will then show how this information can be shared to form a consortium view between multiple industry participants.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresenters:\n\nAntoine Toulme, Engineering Manager @Splunk\nDave McAllister Sr, Technical Evangelist @Splunk"
