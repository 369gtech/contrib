description: "Vladimir Dejanovic, Founder, AmsterdamJUG\n\nYou’ve heard of a “new thing” called gRPC and the promises that it will solve all issues for you, so now you’re not sure if you should use it for breaking up your monolith to microservices. If it is good for Google, it should be good for you too, right? gRPC might sound like SOAP or Cobra, but is that true or not? Attend this session for a deep dive into gRPC and what it is, what it isn’t, how you can use it to solve some complex problems, when to use it, and when not to use it. Also find out how it differs from the REST API you know and maybe love."
