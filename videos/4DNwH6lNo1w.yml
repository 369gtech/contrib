title: 'YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 - Brian McKenna - Teaching functional programming at Atlassian'
language: English
recordingDate: 1532912400
description: "My team works on Atlassian Marketplace, a project which started 10 years ago and uses Scala, Haskell and Nix. The Marketplace code uses concepts such as applicative functors, monad transformers and lenses. People joining the team mostly learned concepts as they needed to, through experimentation and asking questions.\n\nLast year we started hosting functional programming classes for more fundamental and broad understanding. We've been using the Data61 (formerly NICTA) Functional Programming Course with a lot of success. This talk will describe how we teach FP, what we've learned about teaching FP and the challenges we face.\n\nBrian's specialties: Functional programming, Haskell, PureScript, Idris, Agda, Scala, JavaScript, Emacs, Git\n\nFor more on YOW!
