description: "Hey, yep, Hi — it’s me again! Your friendly neighbourhood accessibility advocate.\n\nIn this talk, I’m gonna take a break from aria-labels, alt-tags, and screen-reader demos.\n\nDon't get me wrong, that stuff is still important and needs to be shared as widely as possible, but, you see, I seem to have uncovered bigger problems. One of them is that basic human rights is hard to assign story points to, and we all know what happens to un-estimated stories during Sprint Planning!\n\nThere seems to be a bit of a misconception that the responsibility of accessibility falls on the shoulders of the front-end engineer or UX designer. In reality, true accessibility, and inclusivity, goes much deeper than text size and colour contrast.\nThere seems to be a bit of a misconception that the responsibility of accessibility falls on the shoulders of the front-end engineer or UX designer.

Nope, we’re not going to launch a new cryptocurrency, but you are leaving money on the table by locking potential customers out of your product.\n\nI am going to talk numbers - how measurable and tangible returns can be made from an investment in accessibility and inclusion. Plus how to think about accessibility at every layer of your stack and how to build it into your workplace culture.\n\n\nCheck out more of our talks, courses, and conferences in the following links:\nhttps://ndcsydney.com/\nhttps://ndcconferences.com"
