description: "Dirk Ginader, Senior UX Prototyper at Yahoo! really likes SASS & Compass. He  like them so much that he wants to tell you all about them: their nestable properties, their mixins, their awesome rules (like @import). \n\nIn this talk from HTML5 Dev Conf, you'll learn about the best of what these CSS preprocessors have to offer, and how they can make your code cleaner and faster. If you like what you learn, you may want to check out another talk from the conference, from the creator of Sass: Hampton's 6 rules of mobile design.\n\n** More videos on open source development at http://marakana.com/s/"
