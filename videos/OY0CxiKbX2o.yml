description: "Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming events: EnvoyCon Virtual on October 15 and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2020 Virtual from November 17-20. Learn more at\_https://kubecon.io. The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  \n\nMigrating Transactions Worth Billions of $ to Service Mesh With No Downtime - Mahendra Kariya & Shishir Joshi, Gojek \n\nThe word “Fintech” is generally associated with legacy systems and technologies. But that’s not the case at Gopay, one of the biggest payments companies in South East Asia. Gopay processes transactions worth billions of dollars, with peak scale of more than 15000 financial transactions per minute. Gopay has heavily adopted Kubernetes to run its few hundred microservices and has very recently migrated to a service mesh based architecture.  This talk is a case study of why Gopay chose to move to service mesh, and how it was accomplished with zero downtime. Mahendra will cover some of the critical decisions made by the team, the overall approach for migration, along with a few interesting war stories. He will also discuss the criticality of monitoring the health of service mesh and how the team is doing it using Prometheus and Cortex.\n\nhttps://sched.co/Zeqp"
