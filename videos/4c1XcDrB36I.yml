description: "Classes, and the CSS methodologies based on them, have begot a component based approach to styling web pages. This results in a form of presentational markup that, despite breaking with the \"separation of concerns\" principle, has proven to be a popular approach to collaborating on style schemas. However, methodologies and standards are not equivalent and inviting the explicit prescription of CSS into the editorial process will quickly alienate non-developers charged with simply writing content. This session will explore ways to help content editors elicit stylistic nuances without having to think about design or CSS at all.\n\nSlides: http://slides.com/heydon/effortless-style/\nAbout Heydon: http://www.heydonworks.com\n\nMore about CSS Day: http://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: http://cssday.nl/subscribe"
