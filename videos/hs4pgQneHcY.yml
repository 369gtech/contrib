description: "Being successful as a company probably means that you are doing the right thing, but it does not necessarily mean that you are doing things right.  From a technical point of view, you are sitting with a growing technical debt that will slow you down in the long despite adding more developers.  This can be turned around, by focusing on long term quality (by knowing what you are actually testing) and productivity, raising awareness of technical debt by measurements and visualisation and providing tools for the above. \n\nTalk objectives: Technical debt needs to be managed and payed off. Focusing on the long term quality and productivity can actually benefit the short term. Measure problems, use tools and visualisation for guiding development in the right direction. Test relentlessly to know your quality.\n\nTarget audience: Developers and managers.\n"
